From market giants to early-stage breakouts, these five cryptos are poised to define the next big rally. One stands out above the rest: MAGACOINFINANCE , the rising contender that’s capturing early investor attention. 1. MAGACOINFINANCE (MAGA) MAGACOINFINANCE has become the most popular presale of the year. Its presale has raised over $8 million and it is aiming for a $0.007 listing. MAGACOINFINANCE is still trading for below $0.001, but offers massive upside potential. In fact analysts think early-stage investors can see returns of between 25x and 36x. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Presently in Stage 7, the project awards a MAGA50X bonus. This conveys the message that everyone still has the chance to participate. MAGACOINFINANCE is not like the other meme tokens, thanks to its structured tokenomics and viral growth which are highly scarce. The message is very clear for all those who want to get ahead of the game. This is not the end but just the beginning. 2. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is back in the spotlight, trading just below its all-time high of $109,000. Institutional inflows, ETF momentum, and positive macro signals suggest BTC could soon enter a new price discovery phase, with targets of $110K–$120K in the near term. 3. Solana (SOL) Solana has recovered impressively, hovering between $140–$150 after bouncing from $95 lows. Bulls are eyeing a push past $160, which could pave the way toward $200–$220, or even all-time highs near $300–$350. Solana’s high-speed ecosystem and scalability continue to attract both developers and institutional players. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB) The Shiba Inu coin is slowly making a comeback. Currently, SHIB is a little above $0.00001325. The community backing is strong, and the Shibarium upgrades continue. Analysts believe that price could rise to $0.0000286 by the end of the month and $0.0000326 long-term. 5. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi and NFTs, trading at $3,762.59 and up nearly 30% in the past week. With forecasts projecting year-end prices near $2,751–$2,900, ETH continues to be a cornerstone asset for institutional and retail portfolios alike. Conclusion: Why MAGACOINFINANCE Leads This List CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT While Bitcoin, Solana, SHIB, and Ethereum offer strong long-term narratives, MAGACOINFINANCE’s early-stage position, rapid growth, and record-breaking presale make it the standout play for asymmetric upside. With Stages 7, 8, and 9 still open, investors have a rare window to position before listings — and before the wider market catches on.

Following the development, Lido DAO announced that it will initiate an emergency voting process to replace the relevant oracle node. The protocol’s official statement stated that despite the security threat, Lido’s operation continued uninterrupted and user funds were safe. Lido’s oracle system has a multisig structure that requires signatures from 5 out of 9 participants. No security breaches were detected in the eight oracle nodes other than Chorus One. The DAO's statement included the following statements: “Emergency Lido DAO vote announcement: Due to the compromise of the oracle private key belonging to Chorus One, the Lido oracle node in question will be rotated.” Related News: Watch Out: We Are Entering a Critical Week, Even Trump Has Warned - Numerous Economic Developments and Altcoin Activity Expected - Here Is the Hour-by-Hour Schedule Authorities stated that the leaked key did not directly control funds and that there were no flaws in the oracle software. The oracle system in question is responsible for transferring data from Ethereum’s consensus layer to smart contracts. This information includes validators’ earnings and possible penalties. According to the evaluation, it was stated that even if the entire oracle system was compromised, there would be no significant damage other than a limited deviation in the stETH value, thanks to the security limits of the system. It was stated that in this incident, the attacker only stole a transaction fee of 1.4 ETH, and that this amount was not directly related to the protocol. *This is not investment advice.

Crypto Veterans Think it has the Potential to Skyrocket and Grow by 20,000% Thanks to AI Innovation",https://timestabloid.com/could-ruvi-ai-ruvi-be-the-next-avalanche-avax-crypto-veterans/,"Avalanche (AVAX) , with its current price of $24.77 and a market cap of $10.35 billion , remains a cornerstone in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Known for its three-blockchain architecture that ensures scalability without compromising efficiency, Avalanche has set the bar high for blockchain innovation. Yet, a new contender, Ruvi , is making waves with its cutting-edge focus on AI-powered blockchain utility . Could Ruvi capture the same meteoric rise Avalanche enjoyed by addressing entirely new blockchain frontiers? Avalanche’s Legacy vs. Ruvi’s Potential Avalanche’s unique architecture divides its network into three blockchains — the X-Chain for asset creation and transfer, the C-Chain for smart contracts, and the P-Chain for managing validators and subnets. This modular design is optimized for high transaction speeds and scalability, allowing Avalanche to handle up to 6,500 transactions per second. This performance has made it a favorite for DeFi applications, gaming platforms, and custom blockchain deployments. Meanwhile, Ruvi is carving its niche by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into blockchain technology. Ruvi’s platform enables users to create content (like text, video, and images) while earning $RUVI tokens for their contributions. Where Avalanche emphasizes DeFi and custom ecosystems, Ruvi’s ecosystem extends its impact to creators, marketers, and educators, marrying blockchain with real-world practicality . Investment Opportunities with Ruvi Ruvi is currently in its presale phase , offering tokens for $0.01 , along with hefty bonuses for early buyers. Here’s a breakdown of potential earnings across investment tiers, assuming Ruvi’s token price climbs to $1, $2, or $3 over time. Entry-Level Investment ($800) Tokens purchased at presale price: 80,000 Ruvi . 40% bonus adds an extra 32,000 tokens , giving you 112,000 tokens . At $1 per token, your investment grows to $112,000 . At $3, it could reach a staggering $336,000 . Mid-Level Investment ($1,500) Tokens purchased at presale price: 150,000 Ruvi . 60% bonus grants 90,000 additional tokens , totaling 240,000 tokens . If the price rises to $2, your investment is worth $480,000 . At $3, it becomes an impressive $720,000 . High-Level Investment ($7,000) Tokens purchased at presale price: 700,000 Ruvi . 100% bonus doubles your holdings to 1.4 million tokens . If Ruvi’s price hits $3, this investment could generate a jaw-dropping $4.2 million . Investing during the presale phase allows you to secure tokens at a fraction of their potential future value, making Ruvi an enticing prospect for both cautious newcomers and seasoned crypto veterans. Why Ruvi Stands Out Avalanche’s success stems from solving the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. Ruvi addresses a different challenge by democratizing content creation and introducing blockchain to industries like education, entertainment, and marketing. Its capped supply of 5 billion tokens ensures long-term scarcity and value retention. What sets Ruvi apart is its broader appeal. While Avalanche primarily serves developers, institutions, and DeFi enthusiasts, Ruvi’s AI-linked tools are designed for everyday users . This accessibility gives it a high potential for mass adoption, even among non-crypto natives. Don’t Miss Out on Ruvi’s Presale Few opportunities rival the early-stage gains seen in projects like Avalanche. Ruvi’s presale is shaping up to offer the same life-changing potential for those who get in early. The combination of blockchain innovation and AI-powered tools makes it one of the most exciting projects today. The presale won’t last forever , and as more investors snap up tokens, availability will only diminish. Don’t look back and wish you had joined earlier. Secure your $RUVI tokens today and position yourself at the cutting edge of blockchain’s next evolution.

This is why the next crypto to explode includes not just the usual market leaders, but also newer platforms that bring real people into the spotlight. BlockDAG is proving this model with a bold move: combining developer transparency and consistent public engagement through a dedicated podcast. In doing so, it’s rewriting what it means to build trust in the open. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Where the Dev Team Speaks Directly to the Community Among the strongest contenders for the next crypto to explode is BlockDAG, which is turning developer engagement into its competitive edge. Unlike many projects that operate behind closed doors, BlockDAG is taking a vocal approach through its ongoing podcast series. In these sessions, core developers not only explain technical progress but also share project goals and respond to questions from their user base. These regular podcasts have quickly become central to BlockDAG’s strategy, helping to anchor its growing community. And the results are hard to ignore. The project has already raised $235 million in presale, with Batch 28 currently underway. Until May 13, BDAG is priced at $0.0019, offering a substantial opportunity for those joining now. Early backers from Batch 1 have already seen a return of 2,520%, and over 20 billion BDAG coins have been distributed so far. These milestones reflect strong interest built not just on buzz, but on visibility, connection, and clear communication. BlockDAG’s choice to connect directly with the community isn’t a passing trend. It’s a strategy that makes its infrastructure feel more human and trustworthy. In a market still dominated by anonymous teams and stale whitepapers, BDAG is showing that authenticity can drive real traction. If ROI, connection, and active engagement matter, BlockDAG is clearly a leading choice for the next crypto to explode. 2. Binance Coin (BNB): Real Utility That Keeps Expanding Binance Coin remains a steady force in the market, and its continued relevance comes from practical, real-world use. Whether it’s trading discounts, project launches, or seamless cross-chain activity, BNB consistently supports the vast Binance ecosystem. Binance has continued to grow across multiple jurisdictions, adapting to new regulatory conditions while keeping liquidity high. BNB’s value also benefits from quarterly token burns and expanding use cases across both centralized and decentralized applications. New features such as Web3 identity services and tools with integrated AI are also being introduced regularly, helping BNB maintain attention without relying on cheap tactics. For anyone evaluating the next crypto to explode, BNB stands out for its reliability and evolving ecosystem. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE): Humor, Community, and Unexpected Strength Dogecoin refuses to fade. While many wrote it off early as a passing meme, it has outlasted hundreds of technically superior coins. Its staying power comes from its vibrant community, easy-to-understand branding, and sheer visibility. Dogecoin is still being discussed as a serious contender in conversations about the next crypto to explode. The coin continues to receive support from a wide base of smallholders as well as influencers like Elon Musk. There’s also growing speculation about DOGE being integrated into micro-payment systems, particularly on X (formerly Twitter). Behind the scenes, development is still ongoing. New upgrades are making the project more usable over time, even if slowly. For those who believe social energy can push a project forward, Dogecoin remains a wild card worth watching. 4. Avalanche (AVAX): Speed and Scale with Real-World Impact Avalanche has moved beyond marketing claims by delivering real scalability. With its fast finality and subnet system, AVAX appeals to companies, game developers, and institutions looking for high-speed and flexible blockchain solutions. Its growth in real-world asset tokenization is especially promising. Through partnerships with financial firms and gaming enterprises, Avalanche is gaining serious ground. The ability to spin up custom blockchains within its network gives developers tools that Ethereum still struggles to provide. With regular funding rounds for ecosystem projects and steady technical improvements, Avalanche is a strong pick for those tracking utility-focused contenders in the race for the next crypto to explode. Connection Is the Real Catalyst for the Next Crypto to Explode Looking ahead to 2025, the strongest digital assets will succeed by offering more than just code. They’ll need to deliver transparency, real usability, and lasting trust. BlockDAG is demonstrating exactly that, using podcasts and open conversations to show that people, not just protocols, can drive confidence. With $235 million raised and a clear vision ahead, the window to get in at $0.0019 before May 13 is quickly closing. BNB, DOGE, and AVAX each bring their own strengths to the table. But in a time when users crave clarity and connection, BlockDAG is creating the kind of transparency that sets new standards. In the end, the next crypto to explode will be the one that people believe in, and BlockDAG is working hard to earn that belief every day. The post The Next Crypto to Explode?

Analyst Believes This Cycle Is Unique,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/new-xrp-rally-incoming-analyst-believes-this-cycle-is-unique/,"XRP investors are keeping an eye on a crucial price level this week. Bitcoin has managed to reclaim above $100,000 and Ethereum is over $2,300. XRP has recorded a modest increase as well but still hovers at the lower part of the $2 price range. From a chart of a market observer who goes by the name of “Guy on the Earth,” XRP has held above a persistent horizontal trendline at $2. Historical Price Rollercoaster Back in March 2017, XRP burst in price, rising from $0.0055 to a high of $3.80. After peaking at that all-time high in January 2018, it fell hard. XRP initially broke through $2 on December 30, 2017. By January 13, 2018—two weeks later—it dipped below again. That initial test revealed the $2 level was more resistance than support for new buyers. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Failed Breaks After Rally XRP attempted to break past that level once more in April 2021. It peaked at $1.96 but could not make further progress. From January 2018 all the way up to December 2024, the $2 line acted as a ceiling. Traders watched it cap price action for almost seven years. Every time XRP hit against that wall, it fell back into the $1 zone. $XRP Thats about as clean as it gets. This time it is different. This time it’s XRP. pic.twitter.com/9mK8QVuQVX — Guy on the Earth (@guyontheearth) May 9, 2025 Recent Break Above Two Based on reports, XRP finally cleared the $2 trendline in December 2024, when broader markets jumped on a bullish wave. Since then, the coin has stayed above this line for almost five months. That’s a first in XRP’s history. While its bounce hasn’t been as fast as Bitcoin’s or Ethereum’s, holding this level longer than ever feels different. Analyst Predictions And Warnings As per “Guy on the Earth,” remaining above $2 would pave the way for greater prices. He previously predicted an increase to $3.30, which already occurred. His next goal rests at $5.30, where he advises traders to take profit. He said “this time is different” for the altcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Wider Risks And Outlook This trend in prices is just half the story. Ripple’s legal battle against the SEC and regulatory updates for crypto would do the trick. On-chain metrics such as active accounts or large transfers would put some perspective behind that $2 hold. Traders should pay attention to sudden spikes in daily volume around this line. If XRP drops below $1.80 on a daily chart, some analysts will declare the setup invalid. For the moment, however, many view this extension above $2 as a signal that XRP’s next act could be better than its previous one.

44492719,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=724862,1746997825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44492719.jpeg,Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says he plans to make it the top financial service app in the world,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-says-he-plans-to-make-it-the-top-financial-service-app-in-the-world/,"Brian Armstrong said this week that Coinbase is building to dominate the entire finance industry, not just crypto. During the company’s earnings call on Thursday, the CEO told analysts that within five to ten years, he wants Coinbase to be the number one financial services app on the planet. Brian wants to take on retail, businesses, institutional clients, and developers. His bet? That everything people do with money will eventually happen on crypto rails. Brian said he’s not looking at what traditional finance has been. “We want to look forwards and skate to where this opportunity is going,” he said. He made it clear that Coinbase is still mainly focused on trading and payments, but that’s just the start. “Crypto is eating financial services,” he said . Brian believes asset classes like money market funds, securities, real estate, and debt are all moving on-chain. And he sees Coinbase as the platform that will power that change. Coinbase eyes banks as future clients, not enemies Right now, Coinbase serves both regular people and big players. On top of its core exchange, it has rolled out services like stablecoin payments, staking, and institutional custody. Brian said more than 200 major institutions use these features, including BlackRock, Stripe, and PayPal. The timing is no accident. Over the past two months, US regulators have started to ease up on crypto. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency just gave the green light for banks it oversees to offer crypto services. That decision comes right after the Federal Reserve and the FDIC made similar moves, reversing warnings they gave out last year. With President Donald Trump back in the White House and regulatory pressure easing, Brian said old institutions are now racing to figure out how to plug into the space. Congress is also getting ready to pass legislation focused on stablecoins, which would clear the path for banks to offer more crypto-related products. In February, Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, said the bank could issue a stablecoin if regulation allows it. Brian said it’s only a matter of time. “We think that every major bank is going to be integrating crypto at some point,” he said. He explained that Coinbase can be the engine behind that. “For some of them, it’s a custodial solution. Others are interested in having a stablecoin solution.” He also said some banks want to make their own stablecoins, but he thinks that’s a bad idea. “Our view is that that’s not necessarily the best path because stablecoins have network effects,” Brian said. He added that for a stablecoin to really work, it needs to be usable across multiple institutions. That’s not possible if every bank tries to create its own version. Stablecoins are now Coinbase’s second biggest source of income after trading. In the first quarter of this year, stablecoin-related revenue went up 50% compared to the same time last year. From the last quarter alone, it increased by 32%. The growth came mainly from USDC, which Coinbase helped create. The company has a 50% revenue-sharing deal with Circle, the stablecoin’s issuer, and takes all the interest from USDC products on its platform. Brian said his “stretch goal” is for USDC to become the top stablecoin globally. Right now, Tether’s USDT holds that title. “If you can get shared economics, I don’t see why we wouldn’t see more of these banks partnering with USDC,” Brian said. He said even if banks don’t want to fully commit to USDC, they can still use Coinbase to support their back-end infrastructure. “Regardless, we at Coinbase can help power infrastructure for all these folks that are coming into the industry,” Brian said.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tells the media that the US-China trade walks were productive. Source: Fox News ""We will be giving details tomorrow, but I can tell you that the talks were productive,"" Bessent continued, without mentioning the word ""deal"" once in his statement.

Related: Bitcoin nears $100K as Trump set to reveal trade deal with UK Trump's tariffs cause chaos in markets and draw widespread criticism Although traditional financial and digital asset markets have recovered and retraced some of the value lost following the initial price shock brought on by US President Donald Trump's sweeping trade tariffs , investor uncertainty still looms over asset markets. The Trump administration has flip-flopped on its tariff policies, reversing course on trade proposals or softening its rhetoric several times, leaving investors on edge and uncertain about investing in riskier assets like tech stocks and crypto. In April 2024, the US Customs and Border Protection, at the behest of the Trump administration, announced that select tech products would be exempt from tariffs including, smartphones, processing chips, computers, and other electronics. However, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick walked back the electronic tariff exemptions one day following the announcement. Lutnick said that the tariff exemptions would only be temporary until administration officials decided on a comprehensive tariff regime that featured different tariff rates for economic sectors. The lack of a comprehensive, decisive trade policy has called the Trump administration's plans into question , with many observers saying that the trade tariffs will only create more discord in financial markets and the broader economy.

Instead, the spotlight is on MAGACOINFINANCE , an early-stage contender that’s quietly turning into one of the most talked-about opportunities in the market. What’s Next for MAGACOINFINANCE With over $8 million raised , MAGACOINFINANCE has already surpassed presale expectations. But the real story isn’t just how much capital it has secured — it’s what’s coming next . Currently in Stage 7 of its presale, the project still offers investors an exceptional opportunity to enter before the masses. The $0.007 listing target is now in clear sight, and the project is still priced under $0.001 , setting the stage for a 25x–36x base ROI . On top of that, early buyers can activate the MAGA50X promo code to secure a 50% bonus on token allocations — a rare advantage at this stage of a presale. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! What the Future Holds Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, MAGACOINFINANCE has built a strategic framework designed for sustained growth. It’s running a scarcity-driven model, reinforced by timed unlocks, referral-based expansion, and the absence of centralized exchange exposure — all of which preserve early-stage pricing dynamics. Analysts point out that projects launched under similar models have historically achieved gains of 18,500% or more , making MAGACOINFINANCE’s roadmap even more compelling. With Stages 8 and 9 still ahead, the potential catalysts include exchange listings, media exposure, and viral community growth — all set to unlock during the next growth phase. Why It’s Still Worth Joining Now LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X The key message for investors? You’re still early. While the headlines around MAGACOINFINANCE’s $8 million milestone are impressive, the project is just getting started. Stage 7, 8, and 9 represent some of the last windows for strategic entry before major price discovery begins. It’s not about chasing what’s already happened — it’s about positioning for what’s about to unfold. Analysts agree: this isn’t the end — it’s just the beginning. For those seeking a high-conviction, early-stage crypto play in Q2, MAGACOINFINANCE is fast emerging as the smartest bet on the table.

44494164,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66948,1747000714,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Predicts How Much $1000 In XRP Could Be Worth This Year,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-how-much-1000-in-xrp-could-be-worth-this-year/,"Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, recently shared his optimistic outlook on XRP’s price trajectory, suggesting that holding just 1,000 XRP tokens could be a financially significant decision by the end of 2025. In a recent video, Farina presented a detailed case for why XRP may outperform expectations in the coming market cycle. XRP’s Unusual Market Performance This Cycle Farina emphasized that the current crypto market cycle is not following typical patterns. Traditionally, XRP tends to experience price surges later in the cycle, often after Bitcoin and other major altcoins have rallied. However, in this cycle, XRP has already shown substantial growth early on. He pointed to XRP’s sharp increase in late 2024, when the token surged from under $0.60 to over $3.30 in weeks. This was its highest price since 2018 and occurred while Bitcoin’s dominance in the market remained relatively high. Farina interprets this as a sign that XRP may be moving independently of broader market trends, a shift he believes signals greater strength and potential for sustained growth. Legal Clarity and Institutional Access A key factor supporting Farina’s bullish view is the resolution of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) legal case against Ripple. With XRP now classified as a non-security, Ripple can freely partner with financial institutions, a development that removes a major barrier to adoption. In addition, Farina highlighted the growing interest in XRP from institutional investors. The approval and launch of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is viewed as a major step toward broader market participation. According to him, the intersection of legal certainty and increasing institutional access creates favourable conditions for XRP’s value to rise. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s broader business strategy may also contribute to XRP’s upward trajectory. Farina mentioned the company’s recent acquisitions, including that of Hidden Road , and suggested that a potential acquisition of Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, could significantly increase Ripple’s influence in the financial sector. Farina projects that XRP reaching $10 by the end of 2025 is within reach, based on ongoing shifts in market dynamics, such as a potential decline in Bitcoin dominance and growing demand for crypto investment products like ETFs. He further proposed a scenario in which XRP could hit $100 , though he acknowledged that such an outcome would depend on widespread adoption and using XRP in tokenizing real-world assets. Under that scenario, a holding of 1,000 XRP tokens would be valued at $100,000. Farina notes that while this might not be transformative for everyone, it could represent meaningful financial progress for many investors. While the video highlights the potential of owning just 1,000 tokens, Farina recommends that investors consider accumulating 10,000 XRP if they have the means. At current prices, approximately $2.42 per coin, this would require an investment of around $24,000. In his view, holding this amount allows greater flexibility in profit-taking and positions investors for long-term wealth generation should XRP reach the $100 mark, which would equate to $1 million in value. At present, 1,000 XRP tokens can be acquired for roughly $2,400. Farina concludes that whether one holds a small or large amount, the coming years could be key for XRP investors.

Experts Are Convinced",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-mutuum-finance-mutm-50x-when-bitcoin-btc-reaches-170000-and-ethereum-eth-hits-7650-experts-are-convinced/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) eyes a potential $170,000 target and Ethereum (ETH) aims for $7,650 in the next bull cycle, analysts are also turning their attention to high-upside altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently trading at just $0.025, a 50x rally would place MUTM at $1.25, a realistic leap considering the historic performance of small-cap tokens during major market surges. Currently in Phase 4 in presale, Mutuum Finance has already pulled in over $7.9 million from more than 9,700 investors. The token is currently priced at $0.025, but that’s set to increase by 20% to $0.03 once Phase 5 begins. With over 65% of Phase 4 already sold out, this is the ideal moment for investors to get in before prices climb. Experts argue that if BTC and ETH reach their projected highs, it could trigger a liquidity wave into emerging projects, with MUTM poised to benefit from its DeFi use case and growing community. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the headlines, Mutuum Finance could quietly deliver life-changing returns for early investors. Mutuum Finance: The Next Big Thing in DeFi Mutuum Finance presents itself as an outstanding innovator in decentralized finance through its dual-lending model that has impressed the entire crypto community. The project stands out for its combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models through its new uniquely connected system. The project has gained substantial investor trust as it already surpasses 9,700 investors together with its $7.9 million presale total. Despite the $0.025 token price in Phase 4 it is expected to rise to $0.03 in the upcoming phase as demand intensifies before the supply dwindles. Mutuum Finance has introduced a dynamic dashboard featuring real-time leaderboards of the 50 highest token holders and provides additional MUTM tokens for leaders. The additional MUTM token rewards for board leaders create friendly competition which motivates investors to spend more time in the platform. This gamified aspect contributes to the development of an extremely interactive environment. How Mutuum Finance’s Dual Lending System Works At the heart of Mutuum Finance’s appeal is its hybrid lending system. Through the P2C model, users can earn passive income by lending USDT to smart-contract-powered liquidity pools that handle everything automatically. On the other hand, the P2P model eliminates third-party interference entirely giving users the freedom to borrow or lend directly ensuring more privacy, flexibility, and control. This blend of two systems strikes a strong balance between decentralization and efficiency, offering something that appeals to both cautious and adventurous DeFi users alike. The $100,000 Giveaway and Growing Community Mutuum Finance isn’t stopping at just building tech, it’s also building a thriving user base. To that end, the team has launched a $100,000 token giveaway, in which ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. There’s also a referral program designed to reward users for bringing others into the ecosystem, with incentives for individuals and organizations alike. Holders of MUTM tokens gain access to exclusive updates and features, helping them stay closely connected to the platform’s progress and direction. Bitcoin heading to $170K and Ethereum aiming for $7,650 in 2025 could ignite a major altcoin rally, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is perfectly positioned. With over $7.9M raised and 65% of Phase 4 sold out at $0.025, a 50x move to $1.25 is firmly on the table. Phase 4 buyers lock in 140% gains before listing. Momentum is building fast, act now or miss out on DeFi’s next breakout.

TRUMP appears ready for a breakout, with potential to hit $13.70 if upward momentum holds. Meanwhile, Ethereum is focused on improving scalability and decentralization, aiming to climb to $2,200. Yet, for those evaluating long-term opportunities in crypto, Unstaked is drawing significant interest. Unstaked brings something different to the table. Instead of market-driven hype, it presents a real growth path from its stage 8 presale price of $0.00799 to an expected launch price of $0.1819, offering a 2700% ROI. What truly separates it is the way its governance works. It gives every $UNSD holder a say, avoiding centralized decisions or insider control, making it a platform that shares direction with its users. TRUMP Forecast: Will It Break Past $13.70? TRUMP is gaining traction as it tries to exit its downward pattern. With a 3.5% uptick, its price action is being closely watched. Analysts point to resistance at $12.15, with a breakout potentially pushing it toward $13.70 if bullish sentiment persists. Technical signals present mixed results. The MACD histogram shows a decline in bearish momentum, suggesting a possible bullish shift. But the 50-day and 200-day EMAs remain significant resistance zones. TRUMP’s future trajectory depends on overcoming these levels and regaining momentum. While Trumo coin can deliver strong short-term moves, its long-term reliability remains uncertain. High volatility may lead to big wins or steep losses. This has led some to explore more predictable growth paths. Ethereum Targets $2,200: Will it Reach? ETH remains a key player in the altcoin space, though not without hurdles. Following a consolidation phase, Ethereum’s development plans are getting noticed. The team is working to boost scalability using advanced rollups. Vitalik Buterin has underlined the role of reliable proof systems to secure the network under growing demand. In terms of price, Ethereum is targeting a potential rise to $2,200. Analysts from Amberdata have noted a rise in demand for call options at this level, along with a possible ETH/BTC rebound, which may give Ethereum added strength against Bitcoin. However, progress in Ethereum’s roadmap may take time, and market conditions will influence its trajectory. This has prompted some to consider alternative projects with clearer paths to user-led growth. Unstaked: Transparent Governance and Equal Access TRUMP may face volatility, and ETH continues working on technical advancements, but Unstaked brings a straightforward approach focused on transparency. It’s structured so that each $UNSD holder plays a role in the platform’s direction, without a central authority. Its governance is fully open, enabling users to suggest ideas, vote on developments, and decide key platform actions. There’s no preferential access, no hidden allocations, and no dominant whales steering the course. This setup means that active participants genuinely shape what Unstaked becomes. Alongside that, Unstaked’s AI-based platform is still in development and will become active after the presale concludes. The crypto presale has already raised over $4.1 million, including $1 million in just 24 hours. With a stage 8 price of $0.00799 and a launch price of $0.1819, it presents a clear 2700% ROI. Fair pricing for all participants ensures equal entry, avoiding early adopter advantages often seen elsewhere. In a space where fairness is rare, Unstaked prioritizes shared governance and open access, making every user part of the platform’s progress. Summing Up! TRUMP could surge if it breaks resistance levels, and Ethereum stays strong with continuous upgrades. But Unstaked presents a clearer case for those focused on the long run. With its 2700% ROI potential and a governance system designed to give every participant a say, Unstaked stands out. It’s not driven by hype or insider agendas. Instead, it gives people a chance to directly shape their future. As the crypto industry grows, choosing projects that emphasize fairness and real involvement, like Unstaked, could offer lasting benefits.

Chainlink is now focused on long-term user support with its new structured reward plan for stakers. Meanwhile, Hedera is seeing a huge jump in stablecoin use, pushed forward by tools meant for safe and regulated usage. Both are solid steps that push real use of blockchain. But Web3 ai has taken another path by using deep-learning AI models to make accurate crypto price forecasts. Unlike changes that follow user actions or staking, this tool reads current market data in real time. This makes Web3 ai stand out by giving users a clear edge in choosing the right time to act. That’s the main reason why it’s gaining attention in the latest Web3 ai update. Web3 ai’s Price Prediction Shows Rally to $1 Guesswork based on social media trends or gut instinct often leads to losses. That’s where Web3 ai is proving its strength. Its Price Prediction Tool is built with LSTM and GRU neural networks that go beyond guesswork, offering data-backed insights. Rather than promoting speculation, it gives calculated signals for upcoming short- and mid-term price changes. This tool offers real-time analysis of technical patterns, key data points, on-chain trends, and market mood. This lets users avoid poor entry points, plan better exits, and ride price swings before they become obvious to the crowd. Because of this reliability, Web3 ai pulled in $500K in just one night. Early users also jumped into the presale, now topping $2.5 million in only a few days. Priced currently at $0.00033 in stage 3, with a future listing price of $0.005242, the possible return sits at a massive 1747%. As word spreads about a $1 price goal, more people are calling $WAI the best crypto to buy now . The market is clearly moving from hype-based actions to smart tools. Relying only on feelings might leave many behind. Web3 ai is about smart decisions, not random guesses. Hedera (HBAR) Update: Stablecoin Growth Hits New Highs Hedera (HBAR) is gaining attention with its rising stablecoin activity, showing it’s being used more in the real world. Just in 2024, stablecoin transfers on Hedera crossed $15.6 trillion, proving the network can handle heavy workloads with ease and low costs. Hedera is quickly becoming a top pick for developers and financial services aiming to grow stablecoin systems. A big reason for this growth is the launch of Stablecoin Studio. It helps businesses build and manage stablecoins while staying within legal rules. For example, banks in the Philippines are using Hedera to issue PHPX, a peso-backed stablecoin that makes sending and receiving money faster and cheaper. Also, Hedera’s stablecoin market cap jumped from $81 million to $130 million in just two weeks, a 980% rise over the last year. This sharp growth is attracting more eyes to Hedera (HBAR) news across finance and tech sectors. Chainlink Update: New Rewards Drive Long-Term Participation The latest Chainlink (LINK) update brings a rewards program that aims to build trust among those who stake. It’s made to boost active validator roles and add strength to the network. In this setup, LINK holders earn rewards for helping to keep data feeds secure and active. This method also gets users to hold onto their LINK, which could shrink the supply and possibly push prices higher. Chainlink is now leaning into long-term support, and this payout model adds another reason to stay involved. Overall, it signals a smarter approach to building deeper community ties, especially with those aiming for steady returns. With fixed rules for who can join and clear reward steps, this Chainlink (LINK) update brings new focus to staking and shows its value for consistent earners. Final Verdict! While Chainlink grows through better staking and Hedera expands through stablecoin use, both are reacting to existing demand. Web3 ai, on the other hand, is focused on reading signals before they trend. By using LSTM and GRU neural networks, Web3 ai shifts the model from reacting after the fact to preparing in advance. This gives users an upper hand and removes the stress of emotional calls. Web3 ai is not just another crypto project, it shows that many are now looking for smart tools that are based on real analysis. As crypto grows up, smart data tools are becoming a must-have.

But while the majors hold their ground, two rising stars — NEAR Protocol (NEAR) and MAGACOINFINANCE (MAGA) — are rapidly gaining attention, offering fresh opportunities for investors seeking the next big play. Cardano (ADA): Stable but Testing Resistance Currently, Cardano is practicing around the psychological level of $0.68, which is above the support of $0.66-$0.63. Even so, this is occurring despite mixed technical indicators. ADA is up 44% year over year but faces a critical area of resistance at $0.70-$0.74. Investors are keeping a watchful eye as the platform progresses with scaling upgrades and governance improvements. Ethereum (ETH): Momentum Holds Strong Ethereum is still the backbone of DeFi and Web3 and is presently trading at $3,762.59 (almost 30% in a week). May price is forecasted to average $1,665, long run forecasts pegging it at $2,900 by the end of the year. Ethereum’s ongoing strength at these levels is maintained by institutional flows and growing layer-2 solutions. XRP: Building Toward a Summer Breakout XRP holds firm between $1.77–$1.90 , trading around $2.08–$2.10 after a mild pullback. Analysts remain bullish, with some projecting a $7–$10 range for the summer, citing strong institutional interest and upcoming ecosystem milestones. XRP’s stability at support makes it one of the top assets to watch. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Quietly Gaining Ground NEAR has been quietly rising under the radar. Known for its scalable sharding technology and developer-friendly tools, NEAR is increasingly finding traction in DeFi and gaming. As adoption grows, analysts believe NEAR could become one of 2025’s surprise leaders — offering compelling upside for early movers. MAGACOINFINANCE: Rapid Growth Grabs the Spotlight MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW While NEAR climbs quietly, MAGACOINFINANCE is making noise. With over $8 million raised , the project is in Stage 7 of its presale, offering a $0.007 listing target and a 25x–36x ROI potential from its current price under $0.001 . The MAGA50X bonus code offers an additional 50% token bonus , further amplifying investor excitement. What’s even more remarkable is that MAGACOINFINANCE has built a loyal community that continues to grow by the day, fueling viral momentum across crypto spaces. This is not the end, it is the beginning most importantly. The investment opportunity with MAGACOINFINANCE now is quite attractive as Stages 7, 8 and 9 are still open. Soon the coin will be listed and it will attract attention from more users.

Ripple’s rise comes after the SEC settlement which brought much needed clarity and boosted investor confidence and institutional interest. Ripple’s comeback shows the potential in the crypto space especially for new tokens that are about to grow exponentially. Enter Ruvi , a new cryptocurrency project that’s expected to capture the next wave of innovation and investment. Combining blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI), Ruvi has a unique value proposition for forward thinking investors. Just like Ripple’s trailblazing work in cross border transactions, Ruvi is targeting real world problems with real solutions. Here’s why Ruvi might be the next big thing. Ripple’s Lessons for Early Investors Ripple has revolutionized global payments by providing faster, cheaper and more efficient cross border transactions. With 3-5 second transaction times and costs of just $0.0002 per transaction , XRP has carved out a space in sectors that were once dominated by traditional financial systems. But the real lesson investors can learn from Ripple is the power of early adoption. Those who saw XRP’s potential years ago turned small investments into life changing returns during its price rise. With its current comeback, Ripple shows how innovation that meets market demand creates value for both enterprises and investors. Ruvi offers the same opportunity for those who are ready to identify the next growth story at its earliest stage. Why Ruvi Stands Out While Ripple is focusing on streamlining global payments, Ruvi is redefining innovation by marrying blockchain with AI to solve complex problems in industries like healthcare, resource management and logistics. Here’s how Ruvi is uniquely positioned for success: AI Integration : Ruvi uses predictive analytics to provide real time insights and actionable solutions that businesses can rely on. Scarcity by Design : Ruvi’s token supply is capped at 5 billion so scarcity is controlled and demand will increase over time. Presale Bonuses : Early investors can get up to 100% presale bonuses making this the best time to get in on the project.Just like Ripple, Ruvi’s focus on utility means it’s more than just a speculative asset. It’s a tool for real world applications and long term growth. Timing Is Everything Ruvi is in presale now and tokens are available at $0.01 each. This early entry point comes with huge growth potential especially with presale bonuses. Act now and you could be the difference between small returns and big profits. Ruvi Returns To see Ruvi’s potential, check out these investment examples: Entry-Level Investor ($500) Tokens Bought: 50,000 Bonus Tokens (40%): 20,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 70,000 Projected Value (at $2 per token): $140,000 Mid-Tier Investor ($3,000) Tokens Bought: 300,000 Bonus Tokens (80%): 240,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 540,000 Projected Value (at $2.50 per token): $1.35 million High-End Investor ($10,000) Tokens Bought: 1,000,000 Bonus Tokens (100%): 1,000,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 2,000,000 Projected Value (at $3 per token): $6 million These examples show Ruvi’s potential to deliver big returns just like Ripple’s early investors. Ruvi vs Ripple Ripple’s appeal is in its utility as a bridge currency for global transactions and partnerships with enterprises across borders. Ruvi follows the same utility philosophy but broadens its scope. By solving problems in industries beyond payments, Ruvi’s use cases have wide applications and long term relevance. Ripple focuses on financial systems, Ruvi’s AI driven approach pushes the boundaries of what blockchain can do and positions it as a game changer in multiple sectors. Should You Get Ruvi Now? Ruvi is a once in a lifetime chance to get in on the ground floor of a high potential cryptocurrency. Just like Ripple made way for blockchain based global payments, Ruvi is changing industries with AI. With its $0.01 presale price and bonuses, there’s no better time to get in on Ruvi. Conclusion Ripple’s success and ongoing growth shows how innovation and timing can create huge opportunities for investors. Ruvi with its AI backed solutions and capped token supply brings a new dimension to the crypto space. Don’t miss the chance to be an early backer of what could be the next big name in blockchain. Join Ruvi now and be part of the future of cryptocurrency innovation. Get your tokens, act now and watch your investment grow with this project.

From market giants to early-stage breakouts, these five cryptos are poised to define the next big rally. One stands out above the rest: MAGACOINFINANCE , the rising contender that’s capturing early investor attention. 1. MAGACOINFINANCE — Political Meme Power with 35x Potential MAGACOINFINANCE is more than a meme — it’s a movement. With over 50,000 holders , nonstop presale momentum, and a sharp political theme that resonates with U.S. retail investors, it’s become the fastest-growing presale of 2025 . This early Ethereum investor cited several reasons for making MAGACOINFINANCE his #1 altcoin for this cycle: $132,000+ on-chain whale buy (largest of any presale so far) Listing price target of $0.007 — Stage 7 still under $0.0003 35x ROI forecast based on presale metrics and media growth Coverage across major crypto sites and political finance spaces Community growth fueling FOMO ahead of listings If meme coins like DOGE and SHIB were driven by culture, MAGACOINFINANCE is powered by ideology, identity, and timing . 2. Ripple (XRP) — ETF Narrative and Global Expansion Ripple is back in the headlines as ETF rumors, expanding global adoption, and strong legal positioning make XRP one of the few legacy coins with major institutional upside. Key support: $2.08 Breakout targets: $2.46 to $5.00 Catalysts: ETF speculation, central bank integrations 3. SHIBA INU (SHIB) — Burn Rates and Shibarium Adoption SHIB’s growth story continues thanks to deflationary pressure via token burns, renewed Shibarium usage, and a loyal community. The Ethereum whale sees $0.00008 as a reachable target if momentum holds. 4. Cardano (ADA) — Technical Strength and Network Growth With ADA regaining support at $0.80 and heading toward $1.10, the investor noted its staking growth and dApp development as key signs of a 2025 resurgence. 5. Arbitrum (ARB) — Rebound Play for Layer 2 Value At $0.28, ARB is undervalued. As Ethereum’s Layer 1 continues to deal with congestion, Layer 2 projects like Arbitrum stand to benefit. He sees a mid-cycle breakout coming once gas savings and migration hit critical mass. 6. Chainlink (LINK) — Data Backbone of DeFi and RWA With its integration across AI, RWA, and traditional financial infrastructure, LINK is being called the “invisible engine” behind Web3. Price targets: $19.50 to $22 once $16.80 is reclaimed. Final Takeaway This isn’t your average meme coin list. From institutional-grade assets like XRP and LINK to the explosive presale energy of MAGACOINFINANCE , this Ethereum millionaire is positioning his portfolio for maximum asymmetric upside in 2025. If you’re watching for the next big mover, MAGACOINFINANCE might be it —with 35x gains projected and the political narrative heating up.

Known for community driven growth and astronomical returns Shiba Inu went from an internet joke to a serious player in the crypto space with a market cap of over $9.44 billion . While SHIB’s recent run shows the power of digital assets, a new crypto project called Ruvi is making waves as it gets ready to deliver similar life changing returns. By combining blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI) Ruvi is going to solve real world problems across industries like healthcare, logistics and data analytics. With its presale Ruvi is an opportunity you can’t ignore. Could it be the next SHIB? Here’s everything you need to know. Shiba Inu’s Rise to Fame Shiba Inu’s story is legendary. Launched by the pseudonym “Ryoshi” in 2020 this Ethereum based token turned a joke into a global movement. Fueled by community passion and endorsements from the likes of Elon Musk, SHIB shattered expectations and turned early adopters into overnight millionaires. One of the key factors behind SHIB’s success was its accessibility. The token was affordable and had a massive circulating supply so even small investors could hold millions of SHIB. Paired with ecosystem developments like ShibaSwap and a growing use case in the metaverse Shiba Inu has evolved into more than just a meme coin. But if you missed the SHIB train, Ruvi might be your chance to catch the next one. Why Ruvi Deserves Your Attention Ruvi isn’t just jumping into the crypto scene with hype, it’s backed by innovation and utility. Here’s what sets Ruvi apart: AI Integration Ruvi combines blockchain with advanced artificial intelligence to provide predictive insights and decision making tools to solve complex problems in industries like logistics, resource management and healthcare. Limited Supply With a token supply capped at 5 billion Ruvi ensures scarcity which could drive long term value as demand increases. Compare this to SHIB’s 589.55 trillion supply and you can see the value retention with Ruvi.* Presale Bonuses Early adopters can get up to 100% presale bonuses effectively doubling their investment before the token launches. Ruvi’s presale is just $0.01, a great entry point with huge upside. The SHIB phenomenon showed us that early participation in projects can lead to big fortunes and Ruvi could be the next one. Big Returns, Structured Approach By investing in Ruvi now you can be an early participant in a potentially revolutionary crypto project. Here’s a look at the potential returns: Entry-Level Investment ($500) Tokens Acquired: 50,000 Presale Bonus (40%): 20,000 Total Tokens: 70,000 Potential Future Value (at $1.50 per token): $105,000 Mid-Tier Investment ($3,000) Tokens Acquired: 300,000 Presale Bonus (80%): 240,000 Total Tokens: 540,000 Potential Future Value (at $2 per token): $1.08 million High-End Investment ($10,000) Tokens Acquired: 1,000,000 Presale Bonus (100%): 1,000,000 Total Tokens: 2,000,000 Potential Future Value (at $3 per token): $6 million Imagine multiplying your investment as Ruvi grows and gets adopted across industries. Ruvi vs Shiba Inu While Shiba Inu is about entertainment and community, Ruvi is about a next level utility model that solves real world problems. Both offer big returns for early adopters but Ruvi’s AI backed solutions and capped supply makes it a strong alternative for investors looking for value beyond speculation. Don’t Miss Out With crypto thriving on innovation and timing Ruvi is an opportunity you can’t miss to invest in a high potential project at ground level. The lessons from Shiba Inu showed us how early stage investments can deliver exponential returns. Ruvi with its game changing technology and presale bonuses could very well be the success story of tomorrow. Conclusion Shiba Inu made millions for early adopters. Ruvi will change the game for blockchain and AI. Get in Ruvi today and grow with the crypto market. The future is for the early birds.

With a market cap of $29.15 billion this proof-of-stake blockchain is showing why it’s considered a leader in decentralization and innovation. But as good as Cardano has been, there’s a new contender catching the attention of blockchain enthusiasts and investors. Enter Ruvi , a cryptocurrency project that’s going to redefine blockchain by adding artificial intelligence (AI) to its core. Ruvi isn’t just another token. By combining AI with the blockchain’s transparency and security it’s going to solve problems across industries like supply chain, healthcare and resource allocation. If you were impressed by Cardano’s growth, Ruvi might just be the project to watch for the next wave of exponential returns. Lessons from Cardano’s Success Cardano has carved its name not just as a technological powerhouse but also as a model for sustainable growth. Its focus on peer-reviewed research and academic rigor sets it apart and builds trust among stakeholders. Initiatives like smart contract support via the Alonzo upgrade and its recent moves to optimize scalability with mechanisms like Ouroboros have been key to its growth. For investors who saw ADA’s potential in 2017 when it was priced at $0.0024 today’s prices are a 345x return . That’s the power of spotting a good project early. This is where Ruvi comes in, offering a ground floor opportunity for those looking for the next exponential growth story. Why Ruvi Stands Out Ruvi isn’t competing with the blockchain giants; it’s carving its own path by using blockchain and AI to solve real world problems. Here’s why Ruvi has all the hallmarks of a breakout: AI-Blockchain Fusion Ruvi is unique with its focus on AI, data driven solutions for logistics and healthcare. Its predictive capabilities will enhance decision making in real time.* Scarcity and Value Creation With a capped supply of only 5 billion tokens Ruvi ensures scarcity, as adoption grows long term value. Compare that to Cardano’s larger circulating supply and Ruvi’s strategy looks even better. Generous Early Incentives With bonuses up to 100% Ruvi’s presale is the best chance to max out your holdings before the project launches. Available now for just $0.01 per token Ruvi’s presale is like getting in on Cardano’s early days. Strategic Investment Opportunities Ruvi isn’t just technology; it’s an investment with massive upside. Consider these scenarios: Entry-Level Investor ($500) Tokens Bought: 50,000 Presale Bonus (40%): 20,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 70,000 Projected Value (at $1.50 per token): $105,000 Mid-Tier Investor ($3,000) Tokens Bought: 300,000 Presale Bonus (80%): 240,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 540,000 Projected Value (at $2 per token): $1.08 million High-End Investor ($10,000) Tokens Bought: 1,000,000 Presale Bonus (100%): 1,000,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 2,000,000 Projected Value (at $3 per token): $6 million These aren’t just hypotheticals but show the real possibilities of Ruvi’s growth. Ruvi and Cardano: Comparisons and Contrasts Both Cardano and Ruvi are about innovation and industry impact but their approaches are very different. Cardano is an academic and research led blockchain framework to support dApp development, Ruvi is solving real world problems with AI backed blockchain tools. Together they show the versatility and utility of cryptocurrency. Conclusion Cardano showed us early adopters get the biggest returns. With blockchain and AI, capped supply and presale bonuses Ruvi is more than just another crypto project. It’s a movement. Get in now and be part of the next big project of the year.

Analysts Suggest it Will Reach $2.00 and Deliver 20,000% Profits to Early Investors",https://timestabloid.com/can-ruvi-ai-ruvi-follow-trons-trx-legacy-analysts-suggest/,"Tron (TRX) has mastered its role as a blockchain ecosystem focused on decentralized content sharing and applications (dApps), with a current price of $0.2625 and a market cap of $24.91 billion . Tron’s decentralized approach has enabled millions of transactions and positioned it as one of the leaders in the crypto space. Yet, while Tron continues to flourish, a newcomer named Ruvi is stepping into the spotlight, offering a compelling mix of AI-driven blockchain solutions that could redefine the way we use cryptocurrency. Could Ruvi claim a spot alongside giants like Tron? Tron’s Achievements vs. Ruvi’s Vision Tron’s decentralized ecosystem has disrupted the content industry by allowing creators to share directly with their audiences, eliminating intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. This transparency has helped creators retain more earnings while offering consumers lower costs. Tron’s ecosystem also supports decentralized games , fast transactions, and dApps, boasting throughput that outpaces many competitors. Enter Ruvi , a game-changer blending blockchain with AI-driven content creation tools . Unlike Tron’s broader focus on dApps and decentralized web services, Ruvi hones in on empowering users to create valuable digital content such as text, video, and images while earning $RUVI tokens . This focus positions Ruvi to appeal not only to blockchain enthusiasts but also to educators, marketers, and content creators seeking more practical, everyday utility. Why Ruvi’s Presale Is Generating Buzz Ruvi is making waves in its token presale stage , offering buyers the chance to secure $RUVI tokens at just $0.01 each. Better yet, early investors receive significant bonuses , ensuring more value for their initial contributions. Here’s how the potential for returns stacks up across investment levels. Entry-Level Investment ($800) Tokens bought at presale price: 80,000 Ruvi 40% bonus adds 32,000 tokens for a total of 112,000 Ruvi If Ruvi’s price rises to $1, the investment’s value soars to $112,000 . At $3, this could hit a staggering $336,000 . Mid-Level Investment ($1,500) Tokens purchased at presale price: 150,000 Ruvi A 60% bonus adds 90,000 additional tokens , totaling 240,000 Ruvi At $2 per token, the investment grows to $480,000 , or $720,000 at $3. High-Level Investment ($7,000) Tokens acquired at the presale rate: 700,000 Ruvi With a 100% bonus , holdings double to 1.4 million Ruvi If Ruvi’s price hits $3, this could result in a massive $4.2 million return. These enticing early-stage potential gains make Ruvi a standout opportunity for investors seeking the next big thing in crypto. Ruvi’s Focus on AI vs. Tron’s Decentralization Tron disrupted the content world by decentralizing how creators share and monetize their work, supported by a rich dApp ecosystem and scalable transaction speeds. It excelled in areas like decentralized gaming and stablecoin activity while maintaining nearly 10 billion active accounts globally. Ruvi, however, brings a novel twist with its AI-infused platform , offering content creators the tools to directly generate and monetize their original work. Think of Ruvi as a blockchain-based assistant for creators, enabling them to effortlessly produce and share high-quality materials while being rewarded in crypto. When paired with its limited 5 billion token supply , Ruvi’s economic model ensures strong potential for token valuation as demand scales. The Time to Act is Now If you regretted missing Tron’s early days, or the chance to capitalize on its disruptive growth, now is the perfect time to consider Ruvi. Just as Tron revolutionized content sharing, Ruvi is expected to lead the next evolution by making blockchain accessible to creatives and everyday users alike. The presale won’t last forever , and opportunities like these pass quickly. Secure your $RUVI tokens today and position yourself at the forefront of this innovative AI-powered blockchain solution.

The hype isn’t just about the latest meme or fleeting trend anymore. Now, it’s about substance, real utility, and early access to tech that people actually want to use. And with presale stages moving quickly, the window to get in on these emerging opportunities is narrowing by the day. Right now, three crypto ICOs are making waves for all the right reasons: BlockDAG, Cold Wallet, and Dragoin. They’re offering more than buzzwords. We’re talking about mobile-based mining, true privacy layers, and gamified ecosystems that turn participation into profit. If you’re watching the early-stage crypto scene, here are the names you need to know. 1. BlockDAG ($BDAG): Mobile Mining, Real Momentum, and a $235M ICO Milestone BlockDAG has become a headline act in the world of crypto ICOs, and for good reason. With over 1 million users already engaging through its X1 mobile mining app, it’s making it possible for anyone with a smartphone to join the mining revolution. No complicated rigs. No gatekeeping. Just open access to earning, and it’s working. The numbers speak for themselves. The project has now raised over $235 million, with more than 20 billion coins sold so far. Currently in Batch 28, BlockDAG is offering a limited presale price of $0.0019 until May 13, while the batch pricing has already climbed to $0.0262. Early participants from Batch 1 have already seen a staggering 2,520% ROI. What’s fueling this momentum is not just utility but the project’s clear lead in usability. As exchange listings near and the mobile app continues to attract new users daily, BlockDAG is setting a new standard in how crypto ICOs scale, and it’s doing it visibly, transparently, and fast. 2. Cold Wallet ($CWT): Privacy-Powered Tools for the DeFi Generation Cold Wallet is stepping into the crypto ICO scene with a bold mission: to make privacy non-negotiable. Forget overshared data and invasive trackers. Cold Wallet puts users in control by offering zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology baked into a hot wallet that thinks like a cold one. That means no IP tracking, no balance visibility, and no unnecessary data leaks. But it doesn’t stop at safety. $CWT serves as the project’s utility core, unlocking staking rewards, governance options, and exclusive app features. Now in Stage 4 of its presale, Cold Wallet is priced at $0.00743, and early backers are looking at an impressive projected ROI of 4,900%. In a market where privacy often takes a backseat to marketing gimmicks, Cold Wallet is taking the opposite approach, by putting technology and user trust first. If you’re exploring crypto ICOs with serious upside and longevity, this one offers both. 3. Dragoin ($DDGN): Fantasy Battles Meet Play-to-Earn Profitability Dragoin isn’t your typical meme coin wrapped in a Game of Thrones theme. It’s a fully interactive gaming experience that lives on the Ethereum blockchain and operates through a play-to-earn format. Users participate in dragon battles directly in Telegram, earning $DDGN in the process. Dragoin’s presale is currently in Stage 4, with the coin priced at $0.0000444. Based on current projections, early participants could see an ROI of up to 6,700%. What’s more, the project includes a deflationary burn mechanic, unsold tokens will be permanently destroyed at launch, tightening supply and adding urgency for those still on the fence. With a renounced contract, transparent tokenomics, and a focus on community-led fun, Dragoin is creating more than a meme moment. It’s building a decentralized, gamified world that rewards users both emotionally and financially. For those looking at crypto ICOs with a creative edge and strong fundamentals, Dragoin is one to watch closely. Final Word: These Crypto ICOs Offer More Than Hype There’s no shortage of early-stage coins launching in 2025. But very few are bringing both traction and tangible use cases to the table. BlockDAG has already shown it can move massive numbers with a mobile-first strategy. Cold Wallet is filling a critical gap in user privacy with real cryptographic infrastructure. And Dragoin is turning community engagement into entertainment and earnings through its battle-ready game economy. Whether you’re exploring crypto ICOs for utility, narrative, or long-term value, these three projects check all the boxes. But remember, the best entries come early. Once listings begin and prices shift, today’s opportunity becomes tomorrow’s missed chance. Want in early? Now’s the time to take a serious look.

Ronnie Atkinson of Macon, Georgia, who owns his own logging company, is accused of conspiring with a high-ranking executive at a community bank through “materially false and fraudulently pretenses, representations, and promises,” local CBS-affiliate 13WMAZ reports . Prosecutors say Atkinson had friends and relatives act “straw borrowers,” or people with good credit history who apply for loans in order to transfer funds to those who don’t. Those applications were meant to benefit Atkinson, and the high-ranking bank employee was well aware of the scheme but approved the loans anyway, according to the charges. Atkinson is also accused of giving the bank fake bills for logging equipment he supposedly needed loans for. Some bills were real but with inflated prices, and others were completely fabricated for things that were never even purchased. One of the documents provided was a real bill for $56,000, but Atkinson managed to get a loan of $149,500 for it, prosecutors allege. Says court documents, “(The market president) thus let Atkinson exceed his $500,000 lending limit without the proper approvals by making it appear these loans belonged to a different (person)… (The market president) also did not seek the required approval for (Atkinson’s) loans that were graded substandard.” A grand jury determined there is enough evidence to charge Atkinson with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and identity theft. He is facing up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. The government is also looking to seize any of his assets that were the result of the fraud.

On May 8, frontrunner Lee Jae-myung, of the Democratic Party, said that South Korea “needs to create a won-based stablecoin market.” Lee Jae-myung insisted that Seoul should “enter the stablecoin market quickly” or risk an “outflow of national wealth.” Korea's major conservative party went through one of the most tumultuous weekends in its history after the party tried to overthrow its own presidential candidate and failed — all within 24 hours. https://t.co/05W70jtJKm — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) May 11, 2025 However, his remarks drew criticism from Lee Jun-seok, the candidate for the Reform Party. South Korea’s Digital Daily quoted Lee Jun-seok as saying: “Lee Jae-myung’s take on economics is always dangerous and experimental. He is irresponsibly throwing unverified ideas around. And he repeats plausible-sounding words without understanding anything about the market.” South Korean Presidential Candidates: Stablecoin War-of-Words Lee Jun-seok added that South Korean investors have already had their fingers burned with Terra’s KRW-pegged KST stablecoin. On his social media pages, the candidate wrote: “South Korea already has experience with a won-pegged stablecoin called KRT. That same coin was at the core of the Terra-Luna incident.” Lee Jun-seok, the candidate for the South Korean Reform Party. (Source: @junseoktube/YouTube/Screenshot) The Terra ecosystem collapse of May 2022 saw the firm’s stablecoins lose their pegs. The crash wiped millions of dollars from global crypto markets. Thousands of South Koreans were affected. Lee Jun-seok continued: “Terra’s KRT started out as a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Korean Won. But it had no real assets to back it up. Instead, operators tried to maintain its price by utilizing the highly volatile sister coin, LUNA (now LUNC). But the results were disastrous.” The Reform Party candidate explained that when market confidence collapsed, LUNC’s value plummeted. He said: “All of Terra’s coins, including KRT, collapsed. That rendered the ‘stable’ in stablecoin meaningless.” PPP loses public trust after failed gambit to replace presidential candidate https://t.co/Ms0GOwKHeC — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 11, 2025 Collateral Question Lee Jun-seok hit out at Lee Jae-myung, saying that the latter was calling for the creation of a KRW stablecoin “without explaining what asset collateral will be included in.” He said that the Democratic Party candidate has not spoken about how this coin would manage market risks to overcome the “causes of past failures.” Lee Jun-seok, a former leader of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), founded the Reform Party in January 2024 following his split from the party. He has resisted calls from the PPP leadership, who last month asked him to rejoin the party as they head into next month’s election. But Lee Jae-myung’s defenders took to social media to rebut the Reform Party candidate’s claims. The former Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Byeong-wook claimed that Lee Jun-seok’s comments were “out of touch” with international regulatory trends. Ex-Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Byeong-wook (left) with presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung in 2016. (Source: @777byung1/X) Kim noted that “almost every international regulator” has already ruled that “algorithm-based tokens are too volatile to even be classified as stablecoins.” South Korean polls favor the opposition, and Lee Jae-myung won an overwhelming primary victory in late April. However, he faces several legal charges that could preclude his candidacy, @Doug_Bandow writes. https://t.co/UnyFZQ8ALP — Foreign Policy (@ForeignPolicy) May 6, 2025 He claimed that regulators everywhere from Washington to Brussels and Tokyo shared this view. Kim added: “Structures like those used by Terra are out of the question. The focus of policy discussions is now on collateralized stablecoins backed 1:1 with cash and government bond deposits. These coins would have real-time reserve disclosure protocols and immediate redemption obligations.” A War of Words Kim accused Lee Jun-seok of “lumping” algorithm-based and collateralized stablecoins together. The ex-DP MP said that Lee Jun-seok’s logic was that “Terra failed, so stablecoins are dangerous,” adding: “If he had only familiarized himself with the basic concepts of global financial regulation, Lee Jun-seok would have avoided making such a radical generalization.” Kim argued that won-pegged tokens could help cut overseas remittance fees and revitalize the domestic digital economy. The media outlet quoted an unnamed official from a domestic crypto exchange as welcoming public discourse on stablecoins and other crypto-related matters. The official said: “We are seeing politicians engage in a range of technical debates regarding virtual assets. These have not been made public until now. We are positive about seeing an institutional reorganization in the crypto sector after the election.” South Korea goes to the polls on June 3. The PPP’s candidate, Kim Moon-soo, earlier this month pledged to allow the national pension and soverign wealth funds to buy tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) .

Co-op Food, one of the largest grocery chains in the UK employing approximately 70,000 people, disclosed last month that it had suffered a cyber-attack from “highly sophisticated” criminals. Co-op CEO Shirine Khoury-Haq said that “the cyber criminals were able to access a limited amount of member data.” However, the hackers have since reached out to the BBC and reportedly gave proof that they had breached the company’s IT networks and “stolen huge amounts of customer and employee data.” Anonymous hackers operating under the name “DragonForce” reportedly showed BBC screenshots from a Microsoft Teams chat where the group told Co-op’s head of cyber security that the company was being extorted. The screenshots reportedly show the hackers saying, “Hello, we exfiltrated the data from your company…We have customer database, and Co-op member card data.” The hack has forced Co-op to begin limiting grocery deliveries to only “essential items” after its electronic data interchange (EDI) system was damaged by the exploit. In a government press release , Pat McFadden, the UK’s Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said that that “companies must treat cyber security as an absolute priority.” “These attacks need to be a wake-up call for every business in the UK. In a world where the cybercriminals targeting us are relentless in their pursuit of profit – with attempts being made every hour of every day – companies must treat cyber security as an absolute priority. “We’ve watched in real-time the disruption these attacks have caused – including to working families going about their everyday lives. It serves as a powerful reminder that just as you would never leave your car or your house unlocked on your way to work.

The breach triggered alarm among community members, raising fears over the safety of their crypto assets . Ledger team member Quintin Boatwright said that one of their contracted moderators had their account compromised, which allowed a malicious bot to post scam links in one of the channels. The hacker then prompted users to a secondary website and type in their recovery phrase, a private code that gives users complete access to their crypto wallets. Individuals who attempted to caution others in the chat were either muted or banned. The attacker employed computer bots to overwhelm these users and prevent them from speaking out against the scam enough to prevent its rapid spread. The Ledger team moved fast. They uninstalled the bot, deactivated the account, flagged the reported scam website, and audited all permissions. This helped cut the losses before the fallout could spread. Ledger responds swiftly to security breach After the server was regained, the Ledger was set to work on increasing security. Boatwright said that additional safeguards had been put in place to ensure that that couldn’t happen again. He also called attention to a fundamental rule for the community: never enter a recovery phrase or connect a wallet through any links shared on Discord. The phony website had already been removed by Sunday morning. But the harm could not be entirely assessed immediately. This is not the first time scammers have attempted to deceive Ledger users. Some Ledger customers were recently targeted in a separate scam, receiving physical letters that directed them to a site where they could “verify” their device by entering their seed phrase. The letters bore Ledger’s official logo, and the information may have been gleaned from a prior hack of Ledger’s database in 2020. Industry leaders tighten crypto security in response to threats The Ledger Discord hack is the latest escalation in phishing attacks against the crypto industry. In 2024 , phishing scams caused more than $1 billion in losses across nearly 300 events, making it the most expensive attack vector in the industry. One of the deadliest thefts in 2025, cryptocurrency firm Bybit said hackers stole $1.5bn (£1.1bn) worth of digital currency in what could be the biggest crypto theft in history. In January 2025, over 9,200 individuals were defrauded of $10.25 million in an elaborate phishing campaign against Ethereum users. To counter these threats, the crypto industry is upping its security game. Platforms are deploying multi-factor authentication, making user education on cybersecurity risks and best practices part of their priority to limit phishing attempts. Security allies and white-hat hacker collectives have also organized to pool information and collaborate on responding to new threats. Nationally and internationally, worries about politically motivated cyberattacks have mounted. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has been connected to several high-profile crypto thefts, such as July 2024’s $234.9 million hack of India exchange WazirX. According to people familiar with the plans, G7 leaders may discuss North Korea’s malicious cyber activities and crypto hacks at a summit in Canada next month, reflecting mounting global concerns over Pyongyang’s growing online thefts.

In a new interview on the Milk Road YouTube channel, Tapiero says that monetary policies need to align before digital assets can truly take off. Tapiero says Fed Chair Jerome Powell is currently “holding back” on policy shifts – but once he acts, the macro investor believes Bitcoin and the broader crypto market will soar. “[Fiscal tightening] needs to be offset by some sort of monetary offset to keep things in balance [so] the economy doesn’t have too aggressive [of] a pullback in liquidity [and] in demand side drivers. Fiscal policy has been contributing to demand, and now it’s not, and I think monetary policy needs to offset that and the dollar is already sensing that and that’s why it’s weakened… Ideally, in a perfect world, [Treasury Secretary] Bessent and Trump or whoever should have gone down to Jay Powell and said, ‘Hey guys, we’re going to be undertaking the greatest fiscal tightening of the last 50 years, give us some slack on the monetary side, let’s work together on this…’ But Powell for whatever reason is really holding back here, and I think the next few months the data will confirm that he needs to move and that’ll help Bitcoin and the whole digital asset ecosystem – Ethereum, Solana, the whole world sort of take off again because there is a part of our world that is driven by this liquidity from the old world.” According to Tapiero, relying on liquidity from traditional finance will be necessary no matter how strong Bitcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) present themselves and if his conditions are met, BTC could rally close to $200,000. “Regardless of the good fundamentals that are relating to Bitcoin, regardless of the good fundamentals relating to some of the other projects and the activity in the space, the growth of DeFi, stablecoins, even non-fungible tokens (NFTs) might be coming back a little bit, so I think you just have a little bit of liquidity from the old world come in [and] you have Bitcoin head up to my target, [which] has been $180,000 for a long time.” BTC is trading for $103,159 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

While Binance coin (BNB) shows signs of a technical push following AI integration and Shiba Inu (SHIBA) draws interest as Shibarium’s network activity picks up, both moves rely heavily on internal ecosystems to sustain traction. BlockDAG, by contrast, is capturing attention through external alignment. Its collaboration with Inter Milan ahead of the Champions League final isn’t just publicity, it’s a calculated play for trust. In a climate where visibility is easy to buy but credibility is earned, BlockDAG ’s approach stands apart, reinforcing investor confidence during a critical phase of its breakout crypto presale. BlockDAG Taps Into Inter Milan’s Spotlight to Boost Credibility In a space where trust is often elusive, partnerships can speak louder than whitepapers. In this context, BlockDAG’s recent appearance alongside Inter Milan as the club prepares for the Champions League final is more than a branding play; it’s a strategic alignment. For example, for a project deep into a $600 million presale push, visibility matters, but credibility matters more. By doing so, associating with a globally respected football club helps position BlockDAG not as just another breakout crypto but as one willing to put its name beside institutions known for discipline and excellence. Moreover, this collaboration comes at a time when investor skepticism is high, and presale participants seek tangible signals of legitimacy. With $235 million raised, over 19.7 billion coins sold, and a return of 2,520% since its first batch, BlockDAG’s presale success is already turning heads. Nevertheless, the limited-time offer of $0.0019 per coin, marked down from the current batch 28 price of $0.0262, adds urgency for newcomers who want in before the May 13 deadline. Consequently, in a market crowded with promises, BlockDAG’s alignment with Inter Milan places it in front of millions at a moment of peak attention. It’s a calculated move to reinforce long-term vision with short-term proof. For that reason, for those watching from the sidelines, this might be the signal that turns interest into action. Binance Coin Price Movement Hints at Breakout Binance coin (BNB) price movement is showing signs of renewed momentum following the announcement of AI integration through the BNB Chain’s plug-and-play module. Specifically, the integration offers developers easier access to AI-powered applications, boosting utility and user engagement across the ecosystem. As a result, this shift has added fresh energy to BNB’s technical outlook, which recently flipped a key resistance level into support. At the same time, market participants are now watching closely as BNB eyes the $635 mark, with indicators supporting a potential upward continuation. With this in mind, with AI adoption expanding and on-chain fundamentals aligning, Binance Coin is positioning itself for a possible breakout phase. Shiba Inu (SHIBA) Price Outlook Strengthens Shiba Inu (SHIBA) price outlook is gaining traction as the Shibarium network’s total value locked (TVL) nears the $3 million mark. This development indicates a surge in TVL that reflects growing confidence in the network’s capabilities. Furthermore, SHIBA’s transaction volumes have spiked by nearly 300% within 24 hours, reaching 6.93 trillion tokens. From a technical standpoint, technical analysis reveals a double-bottom pattern on SHIBA’s weekly chart, often indicative of a potential trend reversal. If this occurs, if SHIBA can surpass the neckline resistance at $0.000033, it may target a price of $0.000045, suggesting a possible 4x rally from current levels. Additionally, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) histogram bars have turned green, signaling waning bearish momentum. However, confirmation of a strong uptrend would require the AO to move into positive territory. Trust, Timing, and Traction Shiba Inu may ride the momentum of its network growth, and Binance Coin continues to evolve through technical enhancements, but both rely on internal catalysts to justify price speculation. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is building trust by associating with institutions already recognized for excellence. Its alignment with Inter Milan offers something less common in presales, public validation. As the project surpasses $235 million raised with a presale ROI of 2,520%, its strategy reflects not just timing, but intent. For those weighing which project carries the weight of credibility, BlockDAG puts a clear signal on the scoreboard.

The investors are continuing to assert that Binance’s decision to remove Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) from its platform caused substantial market damage to the cryptocurrency. Legal representatives for the BSV holder coalition have filed to challenge the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal’s July 2024 dismissal. According to recent court documents, they argued that the court failed to properly consider the full economic impact of the delisting action.

Market analysts note that the renewed legal action coincided with a temporary price spike for Bitcoin SV. The coin saw a 15% gain before settling at the $42 range at press time. Despite this momentary rally, the cryptocurrency trades below its all-time highs. The controversy arose from Binance’s decision to delist BSV in April 2019, during a contentious industry discussion about the coin’s founder and his dubious claims about the beginnings of Bitcoin. Several other major exchanges followed with similar delisting actions shortly thereafter. Industry observers suggest this case could establish important precedents regarding the authority exchanges have in determining which cryptocurrencies remain accessible to traders, and whether delisting decisions can be considered anti-competitive practices under existing regulatory frameworks. BSV, which emerged following a contentious hard fork, has faced several technical and security challenges in recent years. Critics say its network vulnerabilities are justification for the original delisting decisions. The exchange has previously maintained that its listing policies are applied consistently based on technical merit and community standards rather than targeted action against specific projects.

Boatwright said the security breach was an isolated incident and that Ledger has taken additional measures to strengthen its security on Discord, a chat platform many crypto projects use to share protocol developments and engage with their community. Using the compromised Ledger community manager account, the hacker told Ledger Discord members that there was a recently discovered vulnerability in the firm’s security systems and strongly urged all users to verify their recovery phrases with a scam link, according to several screenshots shared on X. Ledger users were asked to connect their wallets and follow on-screen instructions. Source: ecurrencyholder It isn’t clear whether anyone was affected by the security breach. Cointelegraph has reached out to Ledger for comment. Ledger scammers were sending physical letters last month In April, scammers were mailing physical letters to owners of Ledger hardware wallets, asking them to validate their private seed phrases in a bid to access and empty the wallets. The letter used Ledger’s logo, business address and a reference number to feign legitimacy and asked users to scan a QR code and enter the wallet’s recovery phrase. One Ledger user who received the letter speculated whether scammers were sending letters to Ledger customers whose data was leaked in July 2020. Related: Jameson Lopp: Most don’t realize how easy self-custody has become That incident saw a hacker breach Ledger’s database and dump the personal information of over 270,000 of its customers online, which included names, phone numbers and home addresses.

One veteran trader recently revealed he’s steering clear of SOL in 2025, citing concerns over centralization risks and recurring network outages that could hinder long-term growth. Instead, his focus has shifted to an emerging altcoin trading under $0.05, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance tokens are available at $0.025 in phase 4 backed by innovative approach to decentralized finance. The project has raised over $7.9 million and attracted over 9700 investors. Over 65% of the phase 4 has been sold out meaning inventors have less time before the phase concludes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Low-Price Giant Waiting in the Wings Mutuum Finance is selling for $0.025 in Phase 4 of its presale and already making waves with its fast pace. Over $7.9 million has been raised from more than 9,700 investors. With a Phase 5 price increase to $0.03 and a projected public listing price of $0.06, Phase 4 investors are looking at a 140% return by the time the token lists on exchanges. That kind of upfront potential is catching serious attention, not just from retail investors, but also from Ethereum whales quietly buying up behind the scenes. Mutuum Finance is taking a bold step in the DeFi market with a hybrid lending framework that incorporates the best features of Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer functionality. The architecture allows for passive returns by way of smart contract-managed pools as well as peer-to-peer lending between users for increased discretion and control. It’s an adaptive, dual-lane approach to borrowing and lending that’s not typical of decentralized finance. Gamified Engagement and Smart Tokenomics To make it more attractive, Mutuum Finance has recently introduced a leaderboard gamified in the form of a top 50 token holders leaderboard. Such users are eligible for additional rewards, thereby creating a competitive atmosphere that encourages long-term holding as well as community engagement. The platform has also partnered with CertiK on a full smart contract audit, increasing investor confidence and transparency. mtTokens and Yield Without Lockups One of Mutuum Finance’s key features is its mtToken program, which allows users to earn yield on tokenized assets like ETH and DAI without necessarily locking them up. This stands in stark contrast to typical staking protocols in which liquidity gets sacrificed for the sake of passive returns. Complementing this is a sensible loan-to-value framework, such as $5,000 lent against $7,000 value of ETH, for a safe-borrowing environment. As top traders move away from Solana over centralization and outage concerns, attention is shifting fast to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a low-price DeFi gem still under $0.05. Now in Phase 4 at $0.025 with 65% sold out and over $7.9M raised, investors are racing to secure 140% gains before the Phase 5 price jump. With smart tokenomics, audited contracts, yield without lockups, and a gamified ecosystem, MUTM isn’t just another altcoin, it’s the one elite insiders are quietly stacking. Time is running out, get in before the rest of the market wakes up. Mutuum Finance is offering something truly innovative with its dual-lending system, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality, making it a standout in the DeFi market. This is your chance to get in on the ground floor, before everyone else catches on. Don’t miss out on what could be the next big DeFi breakthrough.

Contracts tied to the S&P 500 climbed about 1.3 percent as of 6:20 p.m. in New York, while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.5 percent. The gains followed a weekend meeting in Switzerland, the first face-to-face encounter since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, who headed his delegation, called the session “an important first step” toward settling differences. No new policies were unveiled, yet he said the two sides agreed to open a permanent channel led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and himself. Bessent told reporters that Washington will release more details on Monday, and He said a joint statement is in the works. The stakes are high for American businesses that sell into China or rely on Chinese demand. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence , Gillian Wolff and Gina Martin Adams, estimate that the average S&P 500 company booked 6.1 percent of its 2024 revenue in the Chinese market. Exposure is much larger for some well-known names: Apple Inc. drew 17 percent of its sales from China in the three months ended in March, and Tesla Inc. generated 22 percent of its revenue there, according to the firms’ latest earnings reports. Successive rounds of retaliation have pushed US tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent, while Beijing’s levy on American goods stands at 125 percent. Before the weekend talks, Trump floated cutting the headline US tariff to 80 percent, down from the existing 145 percent, if progress could be achieved. The S&P 500 slipped 0.5 percent last week, giving back part of a rebound that began after Trump’s April 2 call for “reciprocal tariffs” knocked the index to the edge of a bear market. Even with the modest weekly drop, milder rhetoric helped Wall Street regain ground. Outside the stock market, many large companies say shifting trade rules are starting to squeeze their plans. United Parcel Service Inc., Ford Motor Co. and toy maker Mattel Inc. have all withdrawn earnings guidance in recent weeks, saying supply snags and unpredictable tariffs make forecasting too risky. Optimism also lifted sentiment around Asian stocks Japan’s Nikkei 225 futures were quoted at 37,830 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, compared with Friday’s cash close of 37,503.33. A weaker yen added to the upbeat mood for exporters as both the Japanese currency and the euro opened lower against the dollar after the Swiss meeting. Washington and Beijing each spoke of “substantial progress,” yet investors still seek concrete steps. “It’s not yet clear what exactly is involved, so we’ll have to wait and see what comes out going forward,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management. “The yen is weakening, and at the very least, there doesn’t seem to be a negative market reaction. As we wait for specific announcements, the general trend of recovery is likely to continue.” The Nikkei 225 has gained about 5 percent since April 2, one of the best gains among major stock benchmarks. Japan was among the first nations to enter formal trade talks with Washington after the tariff shake-up, though a final deal has yet to be struck. Meanwhile, earnings season offers another test for Tokyo investors. Heavyweights on the calendar this week include SoftBank Group Corp., Nissan Motor Co. and Sony Group Corp., and traders will analyze their comments for any shift in outlook linked to the global trade story. Investors will also look to Monday, when Bessent is expected to spell out the US position and He has pledged to publish a joint statement—an early sign of whether the weekend goodwill can evolve into lasting action.

The comment came just as Washington was also claiming headway in a separate negotiation with Beijing. Peter Hoekstra, who became U.S. envoy to Canada last month, told Global TV’s “The West Block” that President Donald Trump’s 25 percent duty placed on most Canadian goods in March may not disappear soon. “I’m not sure they’ll be totally removed,” Hoekstra said when asked about the levy, which the White House has justified by linking fentanyl trafficking to Canadian supply chains. Customs data indicate that less than 1 percent of the fentanyl seized at U.S. borders arrives from Canada, though officials say some production does take place north of the border. Hoekstra’s remarks followed a fresh trade pact between Washington and London that offered the United Kingdom only limited relief on car, steel, and aluminum duties while keeping a 10 percent base tariff on British imports. The ambassador stressed that Canada and the United States can move past months of tension during which Trump urged Canada to become the “51st state” and mocked then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as “Governor Trudeau.” The president struck a more cordial tone last week when newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney visited the White House. “I think the president wants a very positive relationship,” Hoekstra said. “We have moved beyond the 51st state, at least as far as I’m concerned.” Substantial progress has been made in US-China tariff deal While the North American discussion played out, senior U.S. and Chinese officials were working behind closed doors in Switzerland on the deepest trade rift of all. After two days of meetings in Geneva, both sides said on Sunday that they had made real progress. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the sessions “productive and constructive.” China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng used the words “in-depth” and “candid” to describe the talks, the first face-to-face encounter since Mr. Trump hit Chinese goods with a 145 percent tariff in January. Beijing had replied with its own 125 percent charge on certain American products, jolting financial markets and raising fears of a global downturn. Full details of the Geneva discussion are to be released jointly on Monday. Still, the tone from negotiators was upbeat. U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer said “the deal we struck with our Chinese partners” would help narrow America’s 1.2 trillion-dollar trade deficit. Bessent reported “substantial progress” on lowering the temperature of the dispute, while He Lifeng told reporters that the outcome was “of great significance to the two countries but also has an important impact on the stability and development of the global economy.” Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, inspector general of the World Trade Organization, welcomed the breakthrough. “I urge both nations to build on this momentum by continuing to develop practical solutions that mitigate tensions, restore predictability, and strengthen confidence in the multilateral trading system,” she said in a written statement. Trump, commenting after the first day of the meetings, praised what he called a “total reset” in relations. In a social-media post on Saturday, he said the talks were “very good” and that change had been “negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The attack resulted in the theft of nearly 1.5 ETH, prompting an emergency DAO vote to rotate the oracle’s address. According to Chorus One, the operator of the oracle, the incident appears to be an “isolated event” with no further threats to the protocol. The operator continued to say that they have thoroughly audited their entire infrastructure and found no evidence of broader compromise. Blockchain data shows that the attacker drained 1.46 ETH worth about $3,800 from the compromised address. Chorus One says the investigation is ongoing, and a full postmortem will be shared once it is concluded. The exploiter’s activity suggests using an automated system rather than a targeted attack. Lido breach sparks renewed focus on oracle security and DeFi resilience While the breach led to the drain of the oracle address’s ETH balance (which was purposely held at a low level, Chorus One said), the attack did not affect Lido’s operations, as its protocol reporting oracles needs a 5-of-9 consensus. Lido’s head of validators, Izzy, commented that in the worst-case scenario, compromised oracles could cause delays in stETH rebases, whether positive or negative. This would primarily affect stETH holders, but the impact would be negligible, except for those using stETH in leveraged DeFi strategies. The Lido DAO vote to rotate the compromised address currently has unanimous support, though it has not yet reached a quorum. Izzy continued to say that oracles are complex and have different usages across DeFi. He noted that in Lido, they’re an integral part of the protocol, and possible negative impact is meaningfully mitigated through effective decentralization, segregation of duties, and multiple layers of checks. The breach underscores the urgent need for strong cybersecurity protocols in decentralized finance as global monetary, trade, and business systems increasingly transition onchain into complex digital infrastructures with expansive attack surfaces. Crypto industry urged to act as hacks soar to $2B in Q1 losses The crypto industry has suffered a series of thefts, prompting questions about the security of customer funds, with hacking hauls totaling more than $2 billion in 2024 – the fourth straight year where proceeds have topped more than $1 billion. Earlier this year, the crypto exchange Bybit suffered the industry’s largest hack at $1.4 billion, with North Korea’s Lazarus Group pegged as the culprit by cybersecurity firms, which was later confirmed by federal authorities. Hacken also reported that crypto hacks were responsible for $357 million in losses in April 2025, a significant increase from losses incurred in March. Speaking at Token2049, Hacken CEO Dyma Budorin noted that the crypto industry needs to adopt more robust cybersecurity and code auditing measures to stem the tide of hacks and exploits plaguing the asset sector. Cybersecurity threats in crypto have become so pronounced, particularly from hacking groups associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea (DPRK). Leaders from the Group of Seven countries are reportedly looking to discuss how the numerous crypto hacks and malicious cyber activities that North Korea has engaged in for years could be addressed and mitigated.

As per Ju, it has served as a safe haven for various groups including Chinese miners. “Governments, except when tackling money laundering, haven’t really interfered with stablecoins,” noted Ju. Ju predicts that government-issued stablecoins will soon face regulations similar to traditional banking. This could potentially need automatic tax collection through smart contracts and implementing wallet freezes based on government mandates. These changes could drive users who rely on stablecoins for large international transfers to look for alternatives that resist censorship. How? Ju presents two ways: 1. Algorithmic stablecoins that aren’t controlled by governments. 2. Stablecoins issued by countries that don’t censor financial transactions. One technical approach could include decentralized stablecoins that track regulated coins like USD Coin using oracle networks such as Chainlink ( LINK ). However, Ju stated that he hasn’t yet identified projects that have successfully implemented this model. Interestingly, Ju suggested that USDT could turn into a dark stablecoin if the company opts not to comply with U.S. regulations under future administrations.

According to analysts, XRP is showing early signs of a bullish turnaround and it has also broken above a previous high in Relative Strength Index (RSI). This, according to analyst Josh of Crypto World, could mean the end of the bearish trend. Additionally, if Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins also continue to rise, XRP could make a bigger move. XRP Important Price Targets: XRP is facing resistance around $2.45 to $2.46, an important level within a downward-trending price channel. While there was an attempt to break through this resistance, a confirmed breakout hasn’t happened yet. Until that happens, short-term resistance is expected to hold. On the support side, XRP could find short-term buying interest around $2.31 to $2.33. Below that, additional support lies near $2.17, and even stronger support is expected between $2.05 and $2.10 if prices fall further. XRP Elliott Wave Analysis A key pattern visible on the chart is a triangle that formed after the 2017-2018 peak. This triangle likely ended with a breakout to the upside, starting a fifth wave that has pushed XRP much higher—an aggressive move that aligns with how these patterns typically behave. XRP has formed what looks like a five-wave rally from its April 7 low, potentially completing the first wave of a new uptrend. The price recently hit around $2.46, which matches projections. While a further push toward $2.56 or even $2.68 is possible, there’s no confirmation yet that the wave has topped. If the price falls below $2.26, it could signal the start of a corrective wave (wave 2).",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-12 01:35:47

Posting on Truth Social , the president vowed that the order, due at 9 a.m. in Washington on May 13, would slash prices “almost immediately by 30 per cent to 80 per cent.” He said the policy would create a “most favoured nation” rule so America never pays more than whichever country gets the lowest price for the same medicine. A similar idea stalled during Trump’s first term after fierce pushback from drug makers. This time he said that he is ready to confront them. “Campaign contributions can do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party,” he wrote. “We are going to do the right thing, something that the Democrats have fought for many years.” Industry lobby group PhRMA, which led the earlier resistance, did not respond to comment requests by The Financial Times. The group has long argued that price caps would drain money from research. Trump addressed the claim directly, writing that companies “would say, for years, that it was research and development costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the ‘suckers’ of America, ALONE.” He said the new order means the country will “finally be treated fairly.” Republican leaders who favor a lighter regulatory approach have not yet responded publicly, but several senior lawmakers opposed the earlier proposal when it surfaced in 2020. Shock waves spread through Asian pharma markets Shares in Japanese drugmaker Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. fell as much as 7.2% in early trading on Monday, their steepest slide in a month. Daiichi Sankyo Co. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. each lost about 5%. In South Korea, SK Biopharmaceuticals Co., Celltrion Inc. and Samsung Biologics Co. all dropped more than 3%. Analyst Hidemaru Yamaguchi at Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc. said in a note that, although the legal path is “questionable,” the announcement is negative for the whole sector. Firms that depend on the United States for a big share of revenue—such as Takeda, Astellas Pharma Inc. and Otsuka Holdings Co.—are especially exposed, he added. Shares of Astellas and Otsuka also traded lower. Investors worry that any American move to squeeze prices could prompt tougher talks in other countries and shrink profit margins. The concern surfaces as many drug makers rely on U.S. sales to fund high-cost trials for cancer and next-generation therapies. The White House has not released the full text of the order. Executives and lobbyists are expected to study the language once it is published to see whether it can be challenged in court. For now, both Wall Street and health-care watchers are waiting to see if Monday’s signing sets off a long legal fight—or a quick gain for shoppers at the pharmacy counter, for everyday American families.

XRP Rises & DOGE Aims High,https://thecoinrise.com/unstaked-pulls-in-1m-within-24-hours-xrp-rises-doge-aims-high/,"What’s linking XRP and Dogecoin this month isn’t just price action; it’s renewed energy from headlines and speculation. XRP is building momentum as institutional demand rises, especially after ETF green lights and Ripple’s massive $1.25B purchase. Dogecoin (DOGE) is also drawing attention, with charts signaling a possible move toward $0.18, driven by ETF rumors and political memes. Yet, while these well-known names make noise, a lesser-known contender is starting to build traction under the radar. Unstaked’s $UNSD is currently in presale for $0.00799, and experts are projecting long-term targets above $4, equating to a 27x gain. With over $1 million coming in within just 24 hours, it’s clear that major buyers are paying attention. The AI agents are still in progress and will become active once the presale ends and the project launches. Utility and demand are expected to rise sharply after that, positioning Unstaked as a strong layer 1 crypto to watch. Unstaked: AI-Driven Presale Gem Set to Reach $4 Unstaked has entered stage 8 of its presale, pricing $UNSD at $0.00799. It’s capturing attention across the space, as predictions above $4 put the potential return at 27x. What’s more telling is the speed at which interest is building; more than $1 million was raised in a single day, pushing total crypto presale funding over $3.9 million. This isn’t just another early-stage project, it’s attracting large-scale participation. A standout feature of Unstaked is that there are no private allocations involved. This means that general participants don’t have to worry about insider dumps at listing, giving them a clear advantage. The presale has allocated 60% of the supply, with prices rising stage by stage. The launch price is set at $0.1819, already offering a nearly 28x increase from the current presale rate. The AI agents, still under development, are set to operate on platforms like Telegram and X around the clock. These tools will need $UNSD for activation, upgrades, and management. Once they go live following the token listing, demand is expected to rise rapidly. With supply being limited, a crunch could follow, benefiting early supporters the most. For those seeking a standout layer 1 crypto before it gets listed, Unstaked stands out as a top option. It’s being viewed as one of the strongest upcoming projects in its category, an opportunity to catch early before the broader market reacts. XRP Market Analysis: Price Action and Institutional Growth XRP’s current outlook presents a mix of progress and caution. It’s trading at around $2.20, slightly off April’s high of $2.34, with bearish patterns like a descending triangle forming. Still, major developments are keeping long-term interest alive. Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road suggests a bigger move into institutional territory. The SEC also approved ProShares’ XRP futures ETFs, helping XRP push past $2.16 when the news broke. What lies ahead? CME is preparing to roll out XRP futures later this month, indicating a growing appetite from institutions. Ripple’s executives have ruled out any IPO plans for now, highlighting strong internal finances. From a technical viewpoint, targets range from $2.40 to even $10, depending on support levels and momentum. The base is there for future growth if XRP can hold its current ground. DOGE Price Outlook: ETF Buzz and Chart Movement Dogecoin (DOGE) is gaining strength as it trades near $0.182 and breaks above key barriers. Hype around a possible ETF has reignited interest, with more volume and bullish movement showing up on charts. There’s also renewed chatter about political memes, which often help drive DOGE spikes. Elon Musk has reportedly stepped back from DOGE-related efforts to focus more on Tesla, though attention around the coin hasn’t faded. Projections are currently varied. CoinCodex suggests a possible dip to $0.135, while Benzinga forecasts highs up to $0.731, a potential 326% jump. The overall trend is showing strong support levels, meaning DOGE could see a sharp rise if interest holds. With prices still under $0.20 and the ETF story unfolding, any breakout could surprise latecomers. Final Say! Between XRP’s major acquisition, fresh ETF approvals, and upcoming futures listings, the XRP market analysis remains focused on institutional momentum. At the same time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is back on watch with bullish charts, ETF discussions, and targets as high as $0.73. However, if large returns are what you’re chasing, Unstaked is showing the most promise. At $0.00799 in stage 8 of presale, $UNSD has already attracted more than $1 million in a single day. Analysts are predicting prices above $4, and with tools launching after the listing and utility tied directly to the coin, demand could explode. No private allocations give general buyers a fair advantage. If you missed early entries like MATIC at $0.01, this might be one to watch. It’s rare to find a layer 1 crypto project this early with such potential.

Ethereum (ETH) volume has surged to $14 billion for the first time in over a year, a clear sign that large players could be preparing for significant moves. Meanwhile, Binance Coin price is steadily testing $600, with a decisive break above $625 needed to unlock the next leg higher. Despite these encouraging signs, seasoned traders know that top returns often do not come from coins already in motion. Instead, major profits tend to emerge from early-stage projects, especially presales. That is exactly where Web3 ai ($WAI) stands apart. This platform combines 12 AI-powered tools to scan and analyze market signals before they become obvious. Priced at just $0.000331 in Stage 3 of its presale and targeting a launch price of $0.005242, Web3 ai offers a clear path to a projected 1,584% ROI, reinforcing its position as the best crypto presale to watch in 2025. Ethereum Volume Surge Signals Whale Accumulation Ethereum (ETH) volume has witnessed a remarkable increase, reaching its highest point in more than twelve months. Data reveals that trading volume has now crossed $14 billion, largely driven by heightened market activity and substantial transactions. Experts believe this volume spike may reflect growing interest from major players who are preparing for possible price moves. The rebound in Ethereum (ETH) volume is notable, especially after a long period of flat trading earlier this year. Although ETH prices have yet to surge, this volume growth suggests momentum could be building quietly. If the current trend holds, Ethereum’s position in the crypto spotlight may soon become even more prominent. Binance Coin Price Struggles to Clear $625 Resistance Binance Coin (BNB) has started to show signs of recovery following its recent dip. The current Binance Coin price hovers around $598.90, fluctuating between key support at $570 and resistance at $625. This range remains vital for short-term price action. Analysts indicate that if Binance Coin holds above $570, it could target resistance levels near $615 and eventually $630. However, a decisive breakout above $625 is needed to confirm a bullish trend. Over the last 24 hours, Binance Coin price has remained steady, gaining about 1.65% in the past week. While the outlook is cautiously optimistic, traders are closely monitoring whether BNB can push through the upper levels and sustain upward momentum. Web3 ai: The Smart Solution to Finding Best Crypto Presale Opportunities While Ethereum and Binance Coin are catching attention, real opportunities often come from presales. These early-stage projects offer far higher upside potential but are also difficult to evaluate due to market noise and frequent overhype. Web3 ai addresses this challenge with precision. By using 12 AI-driven tools, Web3 ai simplifies the process of identifying quality presales. It assesses tokenomics, on-chain data, team backgrounds, smart contract security, and overall market sentiment. Machine learning and natural language processing enhance its ability to spot risks and opportunities early, ensuring users are ahead of major trends. Additionally, Web3 ai’s Scam Detector and Risk Manager strengthen its appeal, alerting users to potentially dangerous projects before trouble arises. The platform’s seamless access across mobile, browser, and desktop makes it even easier for users to manage crypto activity without switching between multiple apps. While Web3 ai was designed to analyze other presales, its own presale has captured the spotlight. The $WAI token is currently available at $0.000331, with a launch target of $0.005242. This implies a remarkable 1,584% ROI for early participants, positioning Web3 ai as the best crypto presale to enter in 2025. Final Observations Ethereum (ETH) volume reaching $14 billion suggests major market players are preparing for future moves, while Binance Coin price eyes a breakout beyond $625. Both assets reflect growing optimism but may offer limited upside compared to presale opportunities. That is why Web3 ai stands out right now. Its AI-powered platform delivers deep insights that help users capture potential gains before markets react. With its presale live and offering a calculated 1,584% ROI, Web3 ai provides more than just information. It offers a clear path toward smart, early participation in the next wave of crypto growth.

While most of the top cryptocurrencies stayed quiet or posted decent gains of around 2-3% over the weekend, Pi Coin defied the trend and made an impressive move up to the 16th spot on the crypto rankings. This sudden jump comes just a little over a month after Pi Coin hit an all-time low of $0.40, weighed down by market uncertainty and token unlock events. Since then, the coin has bounced back strongly. What’s Next For Pi Coin Price? Looking at the monthly chart, the price has recovered well from its previous dip around $0.40, which was the lowest point since its earlier all-time high above $3. The formation of a bullish hammer candlestick pattern on the chart now hints that the long-running downtrend might be coming to an end. With Pi’s price returning to its monthly trading range, analysts are setting their sights on higher targets. The next possible price levels being discussed are around $2.30, $2.40, and potentially even $3, depending on how much momentum the market can build in the coming weeks. In the short-term, Pi Coin is trying to break above the $1.50 level. Big Announcement on May 14? Adding to the excitement is the upcoming Consensus Summit, set to begin on May 14. The Pi Network community is eagerly waiting for some major updates, especially with Pi Network co-founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis scheduled to speak at the event. Rumors are swirling about announcements, including the launch of new decentralized apps (DApps), the long-awaited listing of Pi on major crypto exchanges like BitMart, HTX, or maybe even Binance, and a full roadmap for the official launch of Pi’s mainnet.

Stablecoins have been used for various groups to store assets due to a lack of government interference; however, with regulations pending, that could soon change, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, said in a May 11 X post. “Soon, any stablecoin issued by a country could face strict govt regulation, similar to traditional banks. Transfers might automatically trigger tax collection through smart contracts, and wallets could be frozen or require paperwork based on government rules,” he said. “People who used stablecoins for big international transfers might start looking for censorship-resistant dark stablecoins instead.” On the heels of US President Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration assuming power earlier this year, lawmakers are weighing stablecoin legislation, which seeks to regulate US stablecoins, ensuring their legal use for payments. The European Union has already brought in its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which, among other measures, mandates that stablecoins be regulated and transparent. Source: Ki Young Ju Ju speculates that a dark or private stablecoin could be created as an algorithmic stablecoin , with the value maintained through algorithmic mechanisms rather than being pegged to an external asset like gold, which makes it susceptible to interference from authorities. “One possible example could be a decentralized stablecoin that follows the price of regulated coins like USDC using data oracles like Chainlink,” he said. Another way would be stablecoins issued by countries that don’t censor financial transactions, or, for example, if Tether chooses not to comply with US government regulations in the future. “USDT itself used to be considered a censorship-resistant stablecoin. If Tether chooses not to comply with US government regulations under a future Trump administration, it could become a dark stablecoin in an increasingly censored internet economy,” Ju said. Privacy technology in crypto is already being used Zcash ( ZEC ) and Monero ( XMR ) — while they aren’t stablecoins —already shield transactions and allow users to send and receive funds without revealing their transaction data on the blockchain. Related: Russia finance ministry official floats country making own stablecoins: Report Several projects are also working on using similar technology for stablecoins, such as Zephyr Protocol, a Monero fork that hides transactions from being revealed on the blockchain. PARScoin also hides user identities, transaction values, and links to past transactions. The market cap of US dollar-denominated stablecoins has continued to grow, crossing $230 billion in April, a report from investment banking giant Citigroup found.

While insiders at Ripple had hinted weeks ago that a deal was done, many in the crypto community were waiting for written confirmation from the SEC itself. That confirmation has now arrived. The SEC has publicly announced that it has reached a settlement agreement with Ripple to resolve its civil enforcement action. The agreement also covers Ripple’s executives, though that part had already been settled earlier. What matters most to XRP holders is the deal involving Ripple and its XRP token. According to the settlement terms, Ripple will pay $50 million out of the original $125 million penalty. The remaining amount will be returned to Ripple. Both sides have also agreed to drop their appeals — but only if the court agrees to lift the injunction that has been placed on Ripple for months. Attorney John Deaton, who has closely followed the case, weighed in on the news. He said that it would be “absolutely shocking” if Judge Analisa Torres didn’t agree to lift the injunction, given the circumstances. Legal Experts Issue Clarification Soon after the settlement details surfaced, rumors started spreading online that Ripple would be paying the $50 million fine using XRP, and that the U.S. government planned to hold XRP as part of a strategic reserve. However, former SEC lawyer Marc Fage l quickly dismissed those claims. He clarified that the money is already in Ripple’s counsel’s custody in cash form, and once the court approves the deal, it will be paid to the SEC — not in XRP. Nonsense, the initial fine the court ordered of $125,000 has already been set aside in an account in USD earning interest, and the parties have agreed in the settlement agreement how it will be distributed. https://t.co/Dq706YV6mp — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 10, 2025 Attorney Bill Morgan also stepped in to address the false reports. He explained that the original fine amount was already placed in a USD account earning interest, and both parties have agreed on how it will be distributed according to the settlement terms.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-12 03:10:43

On May 9, the Northern Mariana Islands Senate voted 7-1 to override Governor Arnold Palacios' April 11 veto of the bill , which would allow the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” The bill will now head to the 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House, which will need a two-thirds majority vote to override the veto and pass the bill into law. If the House is quick to pass the bill, the Tinian government could be in the lead for the first US public entity to issue a stablecoin. It’s in a race against the state of Wyoming, which is aiming to issue a stablecoin by July . Tinian is governed by the local government, the Municipality of Tinian and Aguiguan, and is one of four municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a small US territory in the Pacific north of Guam. Tinian has just over 2,000 residents, and its economy heavily relies on tourism. Senators push “much-needed” bill despite “deep concerns” Governor Palacios said in his letter last month that he vetoed the bill as it “presents several legal issues and may be unconstitutional” and would regulate an activity that could not “be clearly restricted” to Tinian. Democrat Senator Celina Babauta, the only one to vote against overriding the veto, said before the vote that she had “deep concerns with respect to the lack of resources, the lack of manpower” to enforce the gambling law and police use of the stablecoin. “We are restricted by federal statutes and must comply with that,” she added. Senator Celina Babauta (right) delivers remarks at a Senate hearing alongside Senator Karl King-Nabors (middle). Source: YouTube “We struggle with trying to find creative and innovative ways to diversify our economy and our industries,” Babauta said. “I don't believe that gambling is the only thing that we can be looking forward to every single time there's an investor that comes in.” However, Republican Senator Karl King-Nabors, who represents Tinian and co-authored the bill, said it was “a far more stringent and efficient way to oversee the online gaming aspect.” “This stablecoin is tracked through software, and if anything, it allows for more transparency when it comes to the Tinian Casino Gaming Control Commission,” he added. King-Nabors said the bill aligned with “much-needed” economic diversification measures, as the local economy was yet to bounce back from a COVID-19 pandemic-induced slump. “This legislation stands at a time where we're going through so much economic hardships,” King-Nabors added. “I find it difficult that we're constantly having to step over obstacles when we're trying to incentivize and look for ways to bring in revenue that don't affect our environment, that don't require a brick and mortar, that don't impact our land.” Tinian bids for fully-backed stablecoin Republican Senator for Tinian, Jude Hofschneider, led the introduction of the bill in February, which aims to amend a local Tinian law to allow internet-only casino licenses, along with allowing the island to launch a fully backed US dollar-pegged stablecoin. A four-member Tinian delegation to the Marianas legislature, which includes Hofschneider and King-Nabors, had passed the bill to Governor Palacios in a unanimous vote on March 12. Statements shared with Cointelegraph in March said the stablecoin is called the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD) and will be backed by cash and US Treasury bills held in reserve by the Tinian Municipal Treasury. The Tinian government chose tech services firm Marianas Rai Corporation, based in the Northern Mariana Islands’ capital of Saipan, as the exclusive infrastructure provider to issue and redeem MUSD. MUSD is built on the eCash blockchain, a network that rebranded from Bitcoin Cash ABC in 2021 and is a fork of Bitcoin Cash, a blockchain that split off from Bitcoin in 2017. Related: Senator Tim Scott slams partisan politics for failed stablecoin bill Marianas Rai Corp. co-founder and technology chief Vin Armani told Cointelegraph in April that it was “in active discussions with potential partners” about launching the token after Governor Palacios’ veto and was “poised to act quickly” as US Congress is looking to pass stablecoin laws. In the US, one stablecoin bill, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins ( GENIUS ) Act, has since stalled in Congress after Senate Democrats pulled support for the bill due to concerns about President Donald Trump’s sprawling crypto ventures. Another stablecoin-regulating bill in the House, the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, has also lost Democrat support due to Trump’s crypto tie-ups.

Since then, they’ve been falling in price, correcting over five months until this Thursday. For most of that time, UNI was moving in line with its currency peers by market cap. The center of gravity for everything fell in February and March, stocks included, as markets shuddered from the Trump shock, took profits on a large swath of unrealized gains, and sent their taxes to the federal government. Uniswap Tokens Lap Bitcoin in 48 Hours So, there wasn’t anything necessarily wrong with Uniswap or UNI; it was just that the market had overbought and then corrected. This happens frequently in crypto markets, which move very fast compared to the NYSE and Nasdaq. Over the past 30 days, Uniswap and Bitcoin both posted a 33% green candle, but only because UNI flew up the chart starting on Wednesday, from $4.80 to $6.30 in under 48 hours. If UNI had remained trading sideways at the previous level before the massive 31% green day, it would have almost ended the month at a loss. Certainly, by opportunity cost, a Bitcoin maxi might say it was something like shorting BTC for that 33% ride up and getting squeezed out. Did The UNI Delegate Beef Stir The Markets? But, the Ethereum DEX (decentralized exchange) token pulled out a win for Friday’s 30D price chart, staying on parity with Bitcoin. That’s despite the crypto news FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) over some supposed drama at the Uniswap Foundation. A veteran DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) delegate, who goes by the screen name Pepo, quit the UNI DAO on May 5 and published a short manifesto, vague-posting their discontents with the Uniswap Foundation. Did altcoin traders following sources familiar with the DAO beef just reward UNI for sticking in Pepo’s craw this week? https://t.co/tfeJYc4lVT — PEPO (@0xPEPO) May 5, 2025 “There are people in this governance who continue to act with clarity, integrity, and grit,” Pepo wrote, “not because it’s rewarded, but because it’s right [ … ] I saw you. I respect you. And I thank you.” Uniswap Foundation said a day later, “[Uniswap is] the only major Protocol Foundation that is funded through the express approval of delegates.” The post Uniswap News FUD an Opportunity to Buy an Altcoin at Value? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|UNIBTC|UNIUSD|UNIUSDT|Uniswap,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-12 03:27:45

In 2024, we began reconnecting with our heritage — not just geographically, but in terms of responsibility,” Ben said. “This year marks our return in full strength. We are dedicating resources and realigning strategies to serve Mandarin-speaking users.” Ben announced a suite of Mandarin-focused business optimizations at Bybit – including accelerated trading channels, dedicated domains and nodes, and a full-stack upgrade to Chinese-language customer service — faster, more professional, and more responsive than ever before. From cryptocurrency trading – spot, futures and options – to Gold & FX, BybitCard, BybitPay, and structured wealth management products, Ben emphasized that “every product is now being built to suit the needs and expectations of our Mandarin-speaking community.” Building Crypto Ark, Bit by Bit CCCC Bali emerged not only as a platform for education and experimentation, but also as a proof-of-concept for what a decentralized creator economy can achieve.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) outperformed stocks and held up “incredibly strong” during a sharp sell-off on stock markets in April, following Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on “Liberation Day,” observed crypto trader “Daan Crypto” on May 11. Following its plunge to $75,000 on April 7, Bitcoin recovered strongly to trade 27% higher at around $95,000 by the end of the month. Meanwhile, indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined in April. At the time, people wondered if Bitcoin’s relative strength came from the narrative that countries were using Bitcoin to bypass tariffs. The analyst said the opposite should theoretically occur if the trade deal is confirmed. “Theoretically speaking, if the trade uncertainty was what was making BTC outperform, it should stop outperforming after we hit the most important deal, which includes China.” Bitcoin performance since Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement. Source: Daan Crypto On May 11, the White House announced that talks between the US and China regarding a trade deal have made “substantial progress.” However, no official agreement had been announced. Related: Bitcoin must close the week above this level to start 'price discovery 2' “We will be giving details tomorrow, but I can tell you that the talks were productive,” said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. However, if Bitcoin keeps doing its thing and outperforming, “it’s safe to assume that tariffs likely have little direct impact on how BTC is treated or used,” Daan concluded. Markets await trade deal announcement Some analysts, however, believe that Bitcoin will likely jump if a trade deal comes through, along with potential rate cuts. “We believe that institutional investors are less apprehensive about investing in Bitcoin and crypto as US-China trade talks come to a conclusion and the likelihood of rate cuts increases,” Jeff Mei, chief operations officer at BTSE, told Cointelegraph. Meanwhile, Jupiter Zheng, researcher at HashKey Capital, said, “A US-China trade deal could signal stability in global markets, potentially driving investors to seek growth opportunities and send capital into alternative assets.” “Bitcoin could also see new highs as a result, particularly if the deal weakens the dollar or leads to renewed liquidity flows into emerging markets.” Analyst Will Clemente said on X that only a solid announcement of a trade deal is likely to keep momentum rolling. “Feels like you’re gonna need a real, tangible announcement on the China front to keep things moving here locally, momentum starting to stall out on BTC for the first time in a bit,” he said.

44506654,https://thecoinrise.com/top-altcoins-to-buy-now-blockdag-tron-aptos-cosmos/,1747022424,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/44506654.jpeg,"Top Altcoins to Buy Now: BlockDAG, Tron, Aptos, Cosmos",https://thecoinrise.com/top-altcoins-to-buy-now-blockdag-tron-aptos-cosmos/,"Some of the biggest moves in crypto lately aren’t coming from Bitcoin alone but from altcoins building strong ecosystems or pulling in serious trading activity. These networks are showing up in whale wallets, stacking presale capital, or signing new deals with Web2 giants. If you’re looking for the top altcoins to buy now, the four listed below are getting real attention, not because of hype, but because of growth, speed, and usage. The recent rally in on-chain activity, presale momentum, and protocol upgrades across these altcoins makes them hard to ignore. BlockDAG’s presale is approaching a cut-off. Tron is still dominating stablecoin transfers. Aptos just signed deals with both Google Cloud and Franklin Templeton. And while Cosmos hasn’t made big headlines this month, its steady price climb is keeping it on radars. These are the top altcoins to buy now if you’re watching near-term moves with long-term potential. 1. BlockDAG – $235M Raised and Presale Ends May 13 BlockDAG is in its final presale stretch with over $235 million raised and 19.9 billion BDAG coins sold. The current price of $0.0019 is only available until May 13, after which it’s expected to rise. With a projected listing price of $0.05, the potential ROI sits around 2,520%. That upside is backed by major infrastructure already in place. Over 1 million users are active on the X1 mobile miner app, and 17,000 ASIC miners have already been shipped. A live beta testnet is also running, supporting 800 transactions per second. The network blends DAG architecture with Proof-of-Work to reach speeds up to 15,000 TPS while staying secure and efficient. It’s fully EVM-compatible and audited by CertiK and Halborn. A major referral campaign called Buyer Battles is distributing 100 million BDAG, with referrers earning a 25% bonus and referees getting 5%. More than $1.2 million in BDAG has been rewarded this week alone. BlockDAG has also secured a partnership with Inter Milan and is planning 10+ CEX listings. With real products, growing adoption, and short-term token availability ending soon, it’s not just another presale, it’s one of the top altcoins to buy now before the price moves up and supply tightens. 2. Tron – $19B Daily in Stablecoin Transfers Tron is holding strong at $0.2626 with steady volume support, having recently reached $0.2592 after some whale movement in late April. Its real strength, however, is in usage, especially for stablecoins. Tron moves $19 billion in USDT every day, making it the top chain for stablecoin transactions. Tether minted another $1 billion USDT on Tron recently, which further cements its role as a liquidity hub for exchanges and DeFi platforms. With over 303 million user accounts and 10 billion+ transactions, Tron’s usage stats are among the highest in crypto. Tron DAO is also making moves to expand TRX access across the U.S. through a new partnership with MoonPay, allowing users to buy TRX directly. That adds ease of access at a time when most retail users are looking for fast onboarding. While it may not be making loud headlines, Tron’s quiet consistency in high-volume use cases keeps it on every serious watchlist of top altcoins to buy now. 3. Aptos – Token Unlock Ahead, But Trading Volume Spikes Aptos is back in the spotlight with a price of $6.01 and a 5.81% gain over the past 24 hours. On May 12, the network will unlock 11.31 million APT tokens, roughly $65 million worth, yet the sentiment around this unlock is different. There’s a sharp rise in buying activity on Binance, where APT’s order book is showing 60% more buys than sells. Daily active addresses have jumped 25% to hit 120,000, showing increasing user traction ahead of the unlock event. Analysts are watching how the market responds, but on-chain data shows growing interest. Backing the optimism is a wave of new partnerships. Google Cloud is working with Aptos on blockchain-based AI integration, while Franklin Templeton plans to launch a tokenized fund using Aptos infrastructure. The network itself has improved block speeds by 40% in just 2.5 months, dropping from 220ms to 130ms. Aptos also has a strong technical setup with its RSI still under 60 and a bullish MACD crossover in play. These shifts support why it’s one of the top altcoins to buy now, especially ahead of more network expansion. 4. Cosmos – Stable Climb Despite a Quiet Month Cosmos (ATOM) has seen a quiet but consistent performance this month, trading at $5.28 with a 5.18% 24-hour gain. While there have been no major headlines or upgrades since April 25, its price range and resilience are keeping it in play. The recent highs and lows of $5.40 and $5.00 show that ATOM is bouncing within a strong support zone. Traders are watching for breakouts, but the base is solid and daily sentiment remains bullish without any aggressive sell pressure. Even without big announcements, Cosmos still holds relevance because of its core interoperability mission. It powers multiple zones and remains foundational to networks using IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication). Many developers continue to build on Cosmos SDK, which gives it long-term value even during short quiet periods. While it’s not surging in headlines right now, its steady price action and deep utility layer are good enough reasons to count it among the top altcoins to buy now, especially for those eyeing undervalued infrastructure tokens. Key Insights When looking at the top altcoins to buy now, what really matters is whether they’re active, on-chain, in the news, or inside user wallets. BlockDAG has momentum from every angle: presale funds, tech milestones, mining hardware, and user participation. Tron continues leading stablecoin flows with strong partnerships and network stats. Aptos is speeding up and bringing in big names from TradFi and Web2. Cosmos is holding its ground and staying relevant as a cross-chain backbone. Each of these networks brings a different type of value, BlockDAG is about early-stage access with upside, Tron is about scale and liquidity, Aptos is about speed and innovation, and Cosmos is about steady infrastructure. If you’re tracking where attention, users, and development are going, these four rank among the strongest top altcoins to buy now heading into the second half of 2025.

The price is now gaining pace and might clear the $2.40 resistance zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.250 zone. The price is now trading above $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $2.3650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if there is a close above the $2.420 resistance. XRP Price Eyes More Gains XRP price remained supported above the $2.220 level and started a fresh upward wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to surpass the $2.250 and $2.320 levels. The bulls pushed the price above the $2.350 resistance zone to set the pace for more gains. Finally, it tested the $2.475 zone. A high was formed at $2.4752 before there was a pullback.

The first major resistance is near the $2.420 level. The next resistance is $2.480. A clear move above the $2.450 resistance might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.550 resistance or even $2.6350 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.750. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.420 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.3650 level. The next major support is near the $2.320 level.

Although 1.46 ETH ($3,675) was drained from a hot wallet used for oracle voting, Lido confirmed that the protocol remains secure and fully operational . The breach came to light on May 10 when a contributor noticed a low balance alert on the affected wallet. Further checks revealed the key had been accessed by an unauthorized party, prompting immediate coordination between Lido contributors and Chorus One to contain the situation. The compromised wallet, created in 2021, was used to sign oracle reports but was not protected under the same strict standards as other infrastructure, Chorus One later clarified . On May 10, a hot wallet managed by Chorus One that was used to vote in the Lido Oracle was accessed by an unauthorized entity, leading to the transfer of 1.46 ETH. Our team has been working tirelessly, in collaboration with @LidoFinance , to investigate the incident. As a result,… https://t.co/IIAGdBe1pQ pic.twitter.com/ZWpSFJ43VX — Chorus One (@ChorusOne) May 11, 2025 Lido’s Quorum Model Limits Impact of Oracle Key Breach Although the incident affected one of nine oracle participants, Lido’s oracle system is designed with resilience in mind. Its 5-of-9 quorum mechanism ensures no single operator can jeopardize the integrity of the oracle network. All remaining oracle addresses and the software infrastructure passed integrity checks with no signs of further compromise. In response, Lido initiated an emergency DAO vote to rotate the affected oracle key across three contracts: the Accounting Oracle, Validators Exit Bus Oracle, and CS Fee Oracle. The vote, launched immediately after the breach was confirmed, will run for 72 hours with a subsequent 48-hour objection window. The replacement key has already been generated and securely stored using updated security protocols. Minor Node Issues Briefly Disrupted Oracle Reports, Now Resolved Lido’s infrastructure faced additional oracle reporting delays on May 10. These delays were caused by unrelated technical issues affecting four other oracle operators. Specifically, the problems stemmed from node-level bugs. However, they were resolved quickly and had no impact on user funds or staking operations. Meanwhile, Chorus One, which runs validator services across multiple networks, addressed concerns about the compromised wallet. The company explained that the wallet had always held low balances and was never used to store client assets. Therefore, no customer funds were at risk. Chorus One added that the incident does not reflect its current security standards. Today, the firm secures oracle keys using HashiCorp Vault and enforces strict role-based access controls. Lido has promised a full post-mortem once its ongoing investigation concludes. In the meantime, a review of oracle infrastructure and security practices is underway to prevent recurrence.

Bitcoin attempted to climb above the $105,000 levels, but it failed and is now trading slightly above the $104,000 mark. As altcoins try to outperform Bitcoin, XRP is busy making headlines in Asia. According to reports, XRP emerged as a top performer on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit. XRP Tops Upbit Outpacing BTC, ETH XRP became the top-most traded crypto on Upbit, as it pulled in a massive 11.3% share of the $3.59 billion in the last 24 hours. Interestingly, this is more than Bitcoin and Ethereum’s share combined. Analysts believe this could be the start of an XRP liquidity takeover. Additionally, on Sunday, a whale bought 11 million XRP from Upbit . This has left the community wondering if a major price surge is next or if big news could be coming soon. Also, there has been increased activity related to XRP in recent months on Upbit. Some believe that the whale could be expecting a bullish trend for XRP over its legal victories or growing adoption. 880 Million Tokens Accumulated In Past Month Data from Santiment reveals that whales have accumulated over 880 million tokens in the past month, which shows growing confidence in XRP’s growth. XRP hit a seven-week high of $2.4712, fueled by rumors that BlackRock could be filing for an XRP ETF soon. However, BlackRock has remained silent on whether XRP was discussed in its recent meeting with the SEC. XRP is currently trading at $2.39, up 10% in the past week. Analyst Ali Martinez believes that if XRP follows a symmetrical triangle pattern, it could shoot up to $15. This pattern shows that XRP is currently consolidating, and if it breaks out, the price could rise. Analyst Dark Defender believes that XRP is in Wave 5, which is the final, big push of this cycle and could take it to $5.85 to $6.39 with some ups and downs in the way. He notes that the weekly RSI is also turning bullish, adding more support to this outlook.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-12 04:24:35

These files reveal what’s been going on behind closed doors. From private emails to internal memos, this isn’t just paperwork—it’s a rare peek into how the SEC, FDIC, and other agencies have been dealing with crypto, often without telling the public. And now, the crypto world will see what’s inside these files? Why were they hidden? So, let’s find out in detail What the Documents Reveal? Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, shared that the documents were gathered through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests made to key regulators like the SEC and FDIC. Today @coinbase is launching sharing all the docs we've received in our ongoing FOIA campaigns with various government regulators – including 10,000+ pages of previously unpublished docs. Government transparency shouldn’t be a privilege. Among the early finds are: 1/3 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) May 7, 2025 Grewal also pointed out that the documents include internal emails and legal memos, many of which had never been made public before. Meanwhile, one 2019 email from the SEC even admits to a “regulatory gap” around crypto, something the agency has often denied in public. Another 2023 message shows that the New York Attorney General asked the SEC to call Ethereum a security in a case against KuCoin, but the SEC didn’t follow through. Another email even shows how SEC staff couldn’t open a video file submitted by Coinbase due to IT issues, hinting at deeper flaws in how crypto issues are even processed internally. From Pushback to Lawsuits Coinbase didn’t receive all this information easily. According to the company, many FOIA requests were met with delays, denials, and heavy redactions. That’s when Coinbase brought in a third-party FOIA expert, History Associates Inc., and even took legal action to force compliance. Paul Grewal noted that this effort isn’t just about one company or crypto investors; it’s about the right of every American to know what the government is doing.

The United States has reached a trade agreement with China after two days of high-level negotiations in Geneva, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer announced on Sunday. Both countries are set to issue a joint statement on the Geneva trade talks later Monday. The trade deal comes after weeks of a tit-for-tat trade war that saw both countries raise import tariffs above 100%, threatening to inject inflation into the global economy. As such, the positive March U.S. consumer price inflation data released last month was largely dismissed by investors and analysts as a lagging metric that didn’t accurately reflect the escalating trade tensions. The bears, however, cannot make that argument anymore, thanks to the trade deal. So, a continued softening of CPI could raise Fed rate cut bets, providing a bullish catalyst for a BTC rally to record highs above $110,000. On the other hand, a hotter-than-expected CPI could be dismissed as backwards-looking, reflecting the April tariffs and not accounting for the de-escalation in trade tensions. The CPI due Tuesday is expected to show the cost of living eased to 2.3% year-on-year in April from March's 2.4%, according to RBC. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is expected to have stayed at 2.8% year-over-year in April, with continued moderation in rent inflation. According to 10x Research, consensus is that the headline CPI likely held unchanged at 2.4% in April. ""If this expectation holds, the market may view the inflation report as positive. Barring any negative tariffs headline, this week's week's inflation data could provide a bullish catalyst,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research , told CoinDesk. ""CPI could be bullish, and may bring new all-time highs,"" Thielen added. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, changed hands at around $104,000, just 5.1% short of hitting new highs above $109,350, CoinDesk data show. BTC has had a near V-shaped recovery from $75,000 since early April, with prices surging 10% last week due to continued inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has registered net inflows for 20 straight trading days, amassing over $5 billion in investor money, according to SoSoValue data. Last week, the Federal Reserve kept the benchmark borrowing cost unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, while reiterating the data-dependent stance on potential rate cuts. Chairman Jerome Powell, however, offered dovish hints, saying ""the underlying inflation picture is good,"" while calling the inflationary impact of tariffs short-lived. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose 39% to $2,500 last week, the best performance since December 2020, according to TradingView. Other major altcoins such as XRP, DOGE, ADA and SOL surged 9.7%, 56%, 19% and 20%, respectively. According to HTX Research, there are no signs of speculative frenzy yet, meaning the rally could continue. ""Implied volatility (IV) in bitcoin options remains stable in the 50%–55% range, far below the extreme levels of 80%+ typically seen at the peak of past bull markets. CME Bitcoin futures open interest currently stands at $14.8 billion, well below the $20 billion peak observed during the 2020 Trump election period, indicating that leverage is still manageable,"" HTX Research said. ""As long as yields do not climb back above 4.8% and ETF inflows remain steady, Bitcoin is likely to consolidate in the $105,000–$115,000 range while awaiting the next breakout trigger,"" HTX added.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Ether|Markets|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-12 04:29:15

Coinbase, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, revealed it has repeatedly chosen not to follow MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-maximalist approach, citing risks to its financial health and core business. Meanwhile, Irish presidential hopeful and former UFC champion Conor McGregor has called for the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve in Ireland, promoting it as a way to return financial power to the people. Coinbase Rejected Bitcoin Maximalist Strategy Over Fears It Would Undermine Core Exchange Business In an interview with Bloomberg on May 9, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong admitted that the crypto exchange giant seriously debated adopting a Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy similar to that of MicroStrategy — which famously converted a significant portion of its corporate reserves into BTC. However, each time the idea was floated internally, it was ultimately scrapped due to concerns about the potential consequences. “There were definitely moments over the last 12 years where we thought, man, should we put 80% of our balance sheet into crypto — into Bitcoin specifically,” Armstrong said. “But we made a conscious choice about risk. It could have killed the exchange.” The comment sheds light on a key divergence in philosophy between Coinbase and Bitcoin evangelists like MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, who has turned his software company into a de facto Bitcoin holding vehicle, attracting both massive attention and significant investor returns. In contrast, Coinbase chose a more balanced and cautious path, focused on long-term viability and customer trust. Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas expanded on this conservative approach during the same call, pointing out that Coinbase didn’t want to appear to be betting against its own users by favoring one asset over another. Instead of taking an all-in approach on Bitcoin, Coinbase has pursued a diversified crypto allocation strategy. According to its Q1 2025 earnings report, released on May 8, the firm purchased an additional $153 million worth of crypto assets, with a focus on Bitcoin. This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 9,480 BTC, worth approximately $988 million at current market prices — accounting for the majority of its $1.3 billion in crypto assets. That makes Coinbase the ninth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net, behind institutional juggernauts like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Marathon Digital Holdings. Largest corporate BTC holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries ) The Rise of the Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Model MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused treasury model has spurred dozens of imitators. More than 100 publicly listed companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, while 40 ETF issuers, 26 private firms, and at least 12 nation-states also count BTC as part of their official reserves. Some companies have gone as far as issuing debt or equity specifically to purchase Bitcoin, banking on the asset’s long-term appreciation to enhance shareholder value. While this high-risk strategy has paid off for early movers like Saylor, Coinbase’s leadership appears more committed to long-term operational resilience and regulatory compliance than short-term speculative gains. Even as it opts out of Bitcoin maximalism, Coinbase is aggressively expanding its footprint in other areas of the crypto market. On the same day it reported its Q1 earnings, Coinbase announced the $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, the leading crypto derivatives exchange. This marks the largest corporate acquisition in the crypto industry to date and signals Coinbase’s ambitions to become a global leader in crypto derivatives. Deribit processed more than $1 trillion in trading volume in 2024 and holds roughly $30 billion in open interest across its options and futures products — primarily focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Previously, Coinbase’s derivatives operations had been largely limited to its Bermuda-based platform. The Deribit acquisition dramatically expands its capabilities and market share in this lucrative sector. Balancing Risk, Growth, and Credibility Coinbase’s strategy appears to be a calculated effort to navigate an evolving crypto landscape where volatility, regulation, and institutional adoption intersect. While many investors applaud Saylor’s aggressive conviction in Bitcoin, Armstrong and Haas have opted for an approach that prioritizes operational flexibility, reputational neutrality, and long-term customer alignment. That doesn’t mean Coinbase is backing away from Bitcoin. The company’s growing BTC reserves and expanding derivatives infrastructure suggest it still views the asset as a critical pillar of its strategy — just not one to bet the entire house on. As Coinbase continues to diversify and scale its operations globally, the firm’s leadership remains cautious but optimistic. By avoiding the extremes of crypto maximalism while still embracing the core technologies of blockchain finance, Coinbase is crafting a uniquely strategic path forward. Whether this approach outperforms the high-risk, high-reward playbook of firms like MicroStrategy remains to be seen. But one thing is clear — Coinbase is betting on being a long-term infrastructure provider, not just a speculative vehicle riding Bitcoin’s next bull run. Conor McGregor Backs Irish Bitcoin Reserve in Unconventional Political Push In other Bitcoin news, on May 9, former UFC champion turned political candidate Conor McGregor called for the establishment of a “strategic Bitcoin reserve” in Ireland, positioning it as a tool to return financial sovereignty to the people. “Crypto in its origin was founded to give power back to the people,” McGregor posted on X. “An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people’s money.” The unexpected announcement sparked immediate interest from several high-profile figures in the cryptocurrency space, igniting a broader discussion around national Bitcoin adoption and financial independence — particularly in a European context, where most countries remain firmly within the bounds of the traditional financial system. In response to McGregor’s call for collaboration, Bitcoin advocate and host of The Pomp Podcast, Anthony Pompliano, joined the conversation. McGregor responded enthusiastically: “We need the greatest minds for this BTC Reserve. Message me and let’s chat on my space.” Even US President Donald Trump’s crypto advisor David Bailey chimed in — and was promptly invited to speak with McGregor directly: “David message me, let’s discuss your ideas!” McGregor has promised to reveal more details during an upcoming X Spaces discussion, which is expected to attract a global audience of Bitcoiners and political commentators alike. McGregor announced his independent candidacy for the Irish presidency in late March 2025, with a platform focused primarily on anti-immigration measures and tough-on-crime policies. While these stances have drawn both support and criticism, his latest foray into Bitcoin marks a significant pivot — and one that aligns him with a growing global movement of politicians exploring or adopting national cryptocurrency reserves. The idea of building a national Bitcoin reserve remains rare and controversial. So far, only a handful of countries — including El Salvador, Bhutan, and potentially the US through state and federal interest — have made serious attempts to acquire and manage a Bitcoin treasury. Ireland, as a member of the eurozone and governed by European Central Bank policies, would face considerable legal and economic obstacles in adopting such a strategy. Nevertheless, McGregor’s proposal may strike a chord with younger, tech-savvy voters disillusioned with traditional finance. A Polarizing Candidate in a Crowded Race Ireland's next presidential election must take place by Nov. 11, 2025, with President Michael D. Higgins constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. McGregor’s candidacy, while currently outside the mainstream political machinery, has been bolstered by high-profile media attention and a recent visit to the White House, where he met with Donald Trump and received the former president’s endorsement. However, the former MMA star is also facing mounting legal and reputational challenges. He is currently appealing a civil conviction for sexual assault in Ireland, and has been previously investigated for hate speech — controversies that may severely hinder his electability despite his celebrity status and campaign charisma. McGregor’s support for a Bitcoin reserve comes just weeks after the failure of his first major foray into the crypto world. Backed by his image and influence, the “REAL” project — launched by Real World Gaming — aimed to merge gaming and blockchain through tokenization. But the project fell far short of its $1 million pre-sale target , raising just $392,315 over a 28-hour period in early April. Investors were refunded in full. The flop raised questions about McGregor’s business judgment in the crypto space. Still, the Irish fighter’s pivot toward national policy and Bitcoin strategy seems intended to separate personal ventures from public initiatives. The Bigger Picture: Bitcoin in Government Strategy McGregor’s endorsement of a national Bitcoin reserve aligns with a broader geopolitical narrative. From El Salvador’s full-throated embrace under President Nayib Bukele to rising interest in Bitcoin accumulation among US state lawmakers and global hedge funds, the idea of decentralized digital currency as a sovereign asset is gaining traction — albeit slowly and unevenly. In the US, former North Carolina Congressman Bo Hines recently said the country has “countless” ways to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve, citing national energy surplus and fiscal strength. McGregor appears to be tapping into a similar narrative — that Bitcoin can be leveraged as a sovereign tool in uncertain economic times. Whether Ireland, under a potential McGregor presidency, could realistically adopt such a policy is doubtful. Still, by introducing the topic into national discourse, McGregor may force the Irish establishment to at least consider the implications of crypto adoption at a sovereign level. With Ireland’s presidential election less than six months away, McGregor is racing against the political clock to gain traction. His upcoming X Spaces is likely to reveal more concrete policy proposals, and could either solidify his role as a crypto-savvy disruptor or expose further gaps in his understanding of national economic strategy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-12 05:00:00

The breach occurred after an attacker gained access to the account of a contracted community moderator. Using that access, the attacker deployed a bot that posted scam links designed to trick users into revealing their 24-word recovery phrases. The fraudulent message claimed a vulnerability had exposed sensitive user data including shipping details and transaction histories linked to recovery phrases. It urged users to verify their seed phrases by visiting a fake website, falsely described as an official Ledger page. An attacker hacked into the account of a community administrator of the hardware wallet company Ledger, impersonated the official to issue a false security vulnerability warning, and induced users to click on phishing links to submit their seed phrases, thereby stealing assets.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 12, 2025 Mod Account Removed, Bot Deleted as Ledger Responds to Discord Attack According to Ledger team member Quintin Boatwright, the breach was quickly contained. Specifically, the compromised moderator account was removed, the malicious bot was deleted, the phishing website was reported and internal permissions were reviewed and secured. As Boatwright explained, the issue was resolved promptly and appeared to be an isolated incident. However, some community members raised concerns about how the attack was handled. They alleged that the attacker used moderator privileges to ban or mute users who attempted to report the scam. As a result, Ledger’s response may have been delayed. Nevertheless, no confirmed user losses have been reported so far. Fake Letters and Malware Devices Show Persistent Threats to Ledger Users The incident is part of a broader pattern of scams targeting Ledger’s user base. In April, scammers sent fake physical letters to hardware wallet owners. These letters asked users to scan QR codes and enter their recovery phrases on spoofed websites. The messages used Ledger’s branding and referenced customer data leaked in a 2020 breach. That breach exposed names, phone numbers and addresses of over 270,000 users. Previously, the company also dealt with cases where users received tampered Ledger devices. These devices were modified to install malware when used. In response, Ledger has strengthened access controls on its Discord server. It has also reminded users that they will never be asked to share their recovery phrases. The company continues to monitor for suspicious activity and encourages users to report any unusual behavior through official support channels.

Ethereum's latest Pectra upgrade also introduced a dangerous vulnerability via EIP-7702, enabling off-chain signatures that could allow hackers to take control of wallets without user confirmation. This raised some major concerns among security researchers who even called the threat critical. On the BNB Chain, Mobius Token (MBU) suffered a $2.15 million exploit when a malicious smart contract drained millions of tokens and converted them into stablecoins. Ledger Users Targeted Again Hardware wallet provider Ledger confirmed that its Discord server has been secured after an attacker compromised a moderator’s account on May 11. The attacker used it to post malicious links that were aimed at tricking users into revealing their wallet seed phrases. According to Ledger team member Quintin Boatwright , the breach was quickly contained. The compromised moderator account was removed, the malicious bot deleted, the scam website reported, and all permissions were reviewed and locked down to prevent further abuse. However, some community members alleged that the attacker misused moderator privileges to ban and mute users who were trying to report the breach, which may have delayed Ledger’s initial response. The scam involved a message claiming a newly discovered vulnerability in Ledger’s systems and urged users to verify their seed phrases through a fraudulent link. Users were then prompted to connect their wallets and follow fake on-screen instructions, which posed a serious risk of fund loss. While it is still unclear if any users fell victim to the scam, screenshots of the deceptive messages were widely circulated on X . This latest phishing attempt follows a troubling trend. In April, scammers sent physical letters to Ledger hardware wallet owners, urging them to enter their recovery phrases via QR codes under the guise of a security check. These letters had official branding and references to make them appear legitimate. Some recipients speculated that the mailings were linked to a July 2020 data breach, where the personal information of more than 270,000 Ledger customers—including names, phone numbers, and addresses—was leaked online. The year after the breach, several users reported receiving fake Ledger devices rigged with malware. Overall, it seems like Ledger customers are being specifically targeted by sophisticated scammers. Pectra Update Introduces Dangerous Flaw It’s not only Ledger users who should be cautious. Ethereum’s recent Pectra network upgrade, which went live on May 7, introduced powerful new features intended to boost scalability and enhance smart account functionality. However, it also exposed a serious new attack vector that could allow hackers to drain user wallets using nothing more than an off-chain signature. At the heart of the issue is EIP-7702, which is a key part of the upgrade that enables users to delegate control of their externally owned accounts (EOAs) to a smart contract by signing a message — without needing to submit an on-chain transaction. This change allows attackers to exploit unsuspecting users through phishing attempts or fake apps. If a malicious actor obtains a valid signature, they can use the SetCode transaction (type 0x04) to install code in the victim’s wallet that redirects calls to a contract under the attacker’s control. From there, they can transfer ETH or tokens out of the wallet without the user ever authorizing a typical transaction. Security researchers like Arda Usman and Yehor Rudytsia confirmed that this risk is immediate and critical. Smart contracts that depend on legacy assumptions, like tx.origin checks, are now vulnerable. What makes this attack particularly dangerous is how easily it can be deployed through ordinary off-chain interactions — Discord messages, phishing websites, or fake DApps. Wallet interfaces that do not properly display or interpret the new transaction type are especially at risk, and signatures can even be reused on any Ethereum-compatible chain due to the potential for chain_id = 0 signatures. Rudytsia explained that from now on, even hardware wallets are vulnerable to signing malicious delegation messages. Users are urged not to sign messages they don’t understand, especially those involving account nonces or unrecognized formats. Wallet developers must adapt quickly by integrating signature parsing and clear warnings for delegation attempts, as the messages enabled by EIP-7702 often bypass existing standards like EIP-191 and EIP-712. While multisig wallets offer more protection due to the need for multiple approvals, single-key wallets still have to evolve to detect these new threats. Alongside EIP-7702, the Pectra upgrade also included EIP-7251, increasing the validator staking cap to 2,048 ETH, and EIP-7691, which improves layer-2 scalability by increasing the number of data blobs per block. Unfortunately, the unintended consequences of the delegation mechanism are already proving to be a top security concern. Mobius Token Hit by Exploit Meanwhile, more than $2.15 million in digital assets was stolen from the Mobius Token (MBU) smart contracts on the BNB Chain after a targeted exploit on May 11, according to blockchain security firm Cyvers Alerts . The attack was executed with precision, beginning just minutes after the deployment of a malicious smart contract. Cyvers flagged this as suspicious before the exploit took place. The attacker initiated the exploit using wallet address 0xb32a53… at approximately 07:33 UTC, just two minutes after deploying the malicious contract. The exploit targeted a victim wallet identified as 0xb5252f… and successfully drained 28.5 million MBU tokens. The stolen tokens were then quickly converted into USDT stablecoins, which resulted in a total loss of $2,152,219.99. Cyvers confirmed that the attacker used the contract address 0x631adf… to carry out a series of malicious transactions. The security firm labeled the exploit as “critical,” due to the suspicious contract logic and abnormal transaction behavior that was used by the hacker. For now, the attacker’s wallet remains active, and the stolen funds have been deposited to Tornado Cash . This exploit is part of a broader trend of escalating crypto thefts in 2025. According to a report from blockchain security firm PeckShield, April alone saw close to $360 million in crypto assets stolen across 18 major hacking incidents. This was a staggering 990% increase in losses compared to March, when just $33 million was lost to hacks. One of the most serious events that contributed to April's total was an unauthorized transfer of $330 million in Bitcoin, later confirmed to be the result of a social engineering attack targeting an elderly US resident. Overall, the Mobius Token exploit serves as another stark reminder of the urgent need for improved contract auditing and real-time threat detection systems across DeFi platforms.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|WALLET|ZRX|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-12 05:21:45

In his post, JD emphasized the importance of taking calculated profits, suggesting that 95% of market participants will lose money for not following his advice. My Top target for #XRP are in the 2-digits… Between $10 – $99 Make sure to take calculated profits as the 95% will lose in the end! We need majority to lose big for us 5% to win big ! Lets geeet it! #XRPArmy #XRPCommunity — JD (@jaydee_757) May 9, 2025 JD has called these investors “ dumb money investors ” for years. He is convinced that only 5% of investors will act right and earn massive profits from XRP’s surge. XRP is currently trading at $2.41, and JD’s targets suggest a surge ranging from 314.8% to 4,007.9%. JD’s viewpoint reflects a sentiment common among seasoned traders who believe successful investing hinges on disciplined exits rather than idealistic holding. Another expert shared his belief that many investors will sell their tokens when XRP hits $10, losing out on massive gains. He also believes that 95% of the market will miss the true bull run because they sold too early. Community Divides Over Profit Strategy and Long-Term Vision The post received varied responses from members of the XRP community, revealing a split between traders aiming for high exits based on long-term utility and those favoring short- to mid-term gains. One user dismissed those with modest expectations, saying they can cash out between $3.5 and $5. He has higher expectations for the asset and added that strong investors don’t need those looking for quick and small gains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another commenter countered the profit-taking approach, “You only lose if you sell.” This kind of thinking highlights the belief among some investors that XRP’s price will be driven predominantly by its eventual use case, particularly in financial settlements, and not by speculative cycles. Proponents like Edoardo Farina have likened selling XRP at current levels to giving it away for free to massive institutions and constantly advocate for long-term holding. JD responded to this argument by clarifying that his strategy involves securing profits once XRP’s utility is fully implemented. His approach indicates confidence in the asset’s long-term potential but is tempered with a realistic stance on market behavior. In reply to one particularly bullish commenter claiming XRP would reach four-digit prices, JD suggested that the commenter would lose money, as holding too long with unrealistic bullish expectations could result in missed opportunities.

Reports also emerged about Donald Trump’s list of around 20 countries prioritized for early trade negotiations, including key partners like Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. In a widely anticipated move , the Federal Reserve held rates steady last week, citing increased macroeconomic uncertainty tied to tariffs, signaling a continued “wait and see” approach. This week will see key inflation and consumer confidence reports, which could rattle markets if they come in worse than expected. Economic Events May 12 to 16 April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) excluding food and energy is due Tuesday. The CPI report is one of the two key measures of inflation, along with the Personal Consumption Expenditures index. The CPI report reflects price trends across the economy and shapes consumer spending and business sentiment. However, figures are usually much lower than reality in terms of price increases for consumers. April’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report is due Thursday, reflecting input costs for producers and manufacturers and measuring the cost of producing consumer goods. This leading inflation data also shapes policymakers’ decisions. April’s Retail Sales report is also due Thursday. This data indicates how much consumers are spending on durable and non-durable goods and is a leading indicator of economic health. Key Events This Week: 1. April CPI Inflation data – Tuesday 2.

The White House said that talks between the US and China regarding a trade deal have made “substantial progress,” on Sunday. “We will be giving details tomorrow, but I can tell you that the talks were productive,” said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto market capitalization had dipped slightly to $3.45 trillion during the Monday morning Asian trading session. However, it was still hovering around multi-month highs. Bitcoin prices came just shy of $105,000 on Sunday and were holding around the $104,000 level on Monday morning, just 4.4% away from the all-time high. The asset has gained 11% over the past week, though analysts expect some consolidation at these levels. Ethereum has been on fire for the past week, surging more than 40% over the past seven days. ETH came close to $2,600 on May 11 before retreating slightly to trade at $2,525 at the time of writing. Altcoins also performed well over the weekend, but momentum has slowed as we enter a new week.

The currency climbed after the U.S.-China trade talks over the weekend eased concerns of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. New Zealand’s kiwi dollar fell to around $0.588 on Friday but bounced back on Monday by 0.3% to $0.5924. The Australian dollar was up 0.2% to $0.6425, while the euro stood at $1.1224, down 0.2%. The Sterling plummeted by 0.3% to $1.3277. U.S. Treasuries and equities slumped after Trump’s sweeping tariffs announcement last month, which shook confidence in American assets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Sunday after talks in Geneva that a deal had been reached with China to cut the U.S. trade deficit. “I suspect that talk of the demise of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency is premature and that we’ll see a more normal trading pattern resume once we have some clarity around global trade.” -Michael McCarthy, Chief Executive Officer of Moomoo Australia. More talks between the two nations are also expected on Monday. U.S. earnings and data this week, including consumer price index (CPI) figures on Tuesday, are expected to indicate how the trade war has impacted the economy and expectations for rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve. McCarthy also argued that U.S. inflation data will be the most important for the U.S. this week, while Australian unemployment data will be the most important for Australia. He believes that trade talks will likely dominate market action this week. The CEO of the Australia-based online trading platform said the upcoming U.S. CPI data for last month will give a fresh read of the impact of import levies on inflation. He added that April retail sales on Thursday will offer the latest window into consumer spending, as jobs data is also expected on Thursday for the U.S. and Australia . McCarthy sees retail sales flatlining in April after a pre-tariff surge the month before. Trump’s heightened levies have put the dollar under pressure in recent weeks, though it gained some support last week after the Fed signaled it was in no rush to cut interest rates again. The chance of a rate cut in June is 17%, down from more than 60% a month ago, while a July move is seen as a 59% chance. The increase in risk appetite has also affected gold, which has been on a tear in recent weeks as investors sought the safety of the physical metal. Gold was down 1.7% at $3,268 an ounce, short of the April all-time high of $3,500.

Micheal Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone, argued that there was evidently a broad framework under which the two nations could conduct further talks to reach a broader trade agreement. Investors are hoping that Trump’s administration will soon scale back the 145% tariff on Chinese goods, even if only to the 60% first flagged by the White House.

Although the initial statements from both countries are positive in terms of reaching a mutual understanding, the crypto market has reacted with a minor retracement, while Santiment warned investors to exercise caution for now. The US-China Deal The official statement from the White House contained quotes from two major US representatives, including Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. “I’m happy to report that we made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks We will be giving details tomorrow, but I can tell you that the talks were very productive […] And I spoke to President Trump, as did Ambassador Jamieson, last night, and he is fully informed of what is going on. So, there will be a complete briefing tomorrow morning.” US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer also spoke on the matter, and his words were similarly vague, with little to no details. Greer reminded that this whole situation stemmed from President Trump’s national emergency declaration, as the administration found a “massive $1.2 trillion trade deficit.” However, the delegation is “confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to work toward resolving that national emergency.” Proceed With Caution Santiment revealed that stock markets (Asian and futures in the States) reacted positively after the statements from Beijing and Washington went out, as traders anticipate that “tariffs will no longer be an anchor holding back their investments.” The analytics platform added that the tariff discussion rates have gone through the roof for the first time since the crypto market’s bottom just over a month ago. BTC’s price first jumped to $105,000 but lost some steam and now trades at a grand lower. Most larger-cap alts are also slightly in the red on a daily scale. Consequently, Santiment urged investors to be wary of further upcoming volatility and to wait for the actual details of the deal. “If this deal indeed does immediately reduce the impacts on exporters & importers for both countries, we should see an instant bullish impact on all markets. Just avoid overextending until confirmations are made to avoid getting trapped into any “buy the rumor, sell the news” scenarios.” The post New US-China Trade Agreement: Implications for Crypto Investors (Details) appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|China|United States,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-12 05:48:29

Expert States the Shocking Truth,https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-price-really-driven-by-the-market-expert-states-the-shocking-truth/,"Concerns are emerging within the XRP community regarding the authenticity of its recent market behavior. All Things XRP (@XRP_investing), a well-known figure in the community, recently shared a thread on X, revealing how much XRP price action is influenced more by automated systems than by genuine human trading activity. IS XRP'S PRICE REALLY DRIVEN BY THE MARKET? Or are trading bots quietly pulling the strings? The truth will shake your confidence in “organic” crypto markets. Let’s reveal the truth. pic.twitter.com/TRSrnXQuOo — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 9, 2025 Automated Trading May Dominate Crypto Markets According to All Things XRP, up to 75% of all trades on cryptocurrency exchanges are conducted by automated systems rather than individual investors. On some smaller and less trustworthy platforms, he suggests that the volume of bot trades reaches as high as 95%. This level of automation raises significant doubts about the reliability of chart patterns and technical indicators, which traders often depend on for decision-making. If these patterns are not from organic trades, predicting investor behavior becomes increasingly difficult. XRP’s Liquidity Makes It a Target All Things XRP highlighted the digital asset’s unique market conditions, which he claims make it particularly appealing to algorithmic traders. Its combination of high liquidity and consistent volatility provides fertile ground for automated strategies such as arbitrage and high-frequency trading. Tactics, including spoofing, where fake orders are placed to mislead traders, and wash trading, where the same entity buys and sells simultaneously to create artificial activity, may distort short-term price signals. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Some of this bot activity has previously been attributed to Ripple , and All Things XRP suggested that under these conditions, individual retail traders may find themselves at a disadvantage. Concerns Over Market Manipulation Fears of market manipulation persist. He drew attention to the Operation Token Mirrors investigation in 2024 that exposed bot activity on NexFundAI, which inflated trading volumes and caused investor losses. This incident has raised alarms about similar practices affecting XRP, especially as regulators like the SEC and FBI struggle to keep up with the decentralized nature of crypto exchanges. He also warned that technical analysis may be unreliable in XRP markets dominated by bots. He suggested price movements may not reflect real investor sentiment, urging greater focus on fundamental developments and evolving regulations. Decentralized Platforms Offer Hope Software developer Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) echoed these concerns, claiming bots have compromised centralized exchanges. He highlighted the XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange ( XRPL DEX ) as a more transparent alternative. Its on-chain data, slower speeds, and adaptive fees help reduce the impact of high-frequency trading bots. Van Code stressed that for XRPL DEX to become a viable alternative, key upgrades are needed, such as fiat on-ramps for RLUSD, credible wrapped asset issuers, better trading interfaces, and broader user participation. He remains optimistic that a shift toward user-controlled, transparent trading is possible. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to police, the incident occurred last November. The victim had finished hosting a crypto-related event in downtown Las Vegas, and when he returned home, the suspects forced him into a vehicle and drove him to a remote desert area an hour away from the city. There, they forced him to hand over passwords to his accounts, according to a May 10 report from Las Vegas local news outlet 8 News Now. The man was allegedly told to comply with the teens’ demands if he wanted to “live to see another day,” and because they also “had his dad and would kill him,” according to the report. It’s also alleged that a fourth person may have been communicating with the three young men through a phone call during the incident, which the victim could hear through a speakerphone. After having his accounts drained of $4 million in crypto and NFTs , the victim reportedly walked five miles back through the desert to reach a gas station where he could call a friend for help. Two 16-year-olds from Florida are facing charges including robbery, kidnapping, and extortion in connection with the incident. A third teen allegedly involved in the plot has left the country, prosecutors say. One of the young men is behind bars with bail set at $4 million, while the other has been released under house arrest with electronic monitoring. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for June, with both teens set to be tried as adults. Digital asset lawyer Sasha Hodder said in a May 10 X post that this case illustrates how “Crypto theft is evolving. It’s not just social engineering or SIM swaps anymore.” Source: Sasha Hodder Uptick in thieves targeting crypto industry offline Crypto industry participants are increasingly becoming targets for kidnappings and extortion. In a recent May 3 case, the father of a crypto entrepreneur was freed by police in Paris, France, after being held for several days in connection with a 7 million euro ($7.8 million) kidnapping plot. In February, a UK crypto broker reportedly jumped 30 feet from a balcony to escape kidnappers who were threatening to torture and kill him if he didn’t hand over 30,000 euros ($30,917) of crypto.

The first dates back to 2014, when someone allegedly tried to extort computer scientist and cryptographer Hal Finney of 1,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth $400,000 at the time. There have been 21 incidents of in-person crypto-related robbery so far this year, according to Lopp’s list. In 2024, there were 28 incidents, while there were 17 in 2023 and 32 in 2021.

The board added that illegal mining has increased due to the global crypto transactions, local media reported . TNB derived the statistics through a joint operation involving the Energy Commission, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, police and local councils. According to the electricity board data, there were 610 detected cases of power theft in 2018, linked to illegal mining. The numbers have shot up to 2,397 in 2024, it added. “Joint operations and nationwide raids have successfully shut down illegal mining setups,” TNB said in a statement. “These enforcement actions have safeguarded the stability of the power grid.” The stats revealed that the average number of crypto-related electricity thefts stood at 2,303 per year from 2020 to 2024. TNB Deploys ‘Smart Meter’ to Detect Power Thefts The board received around 1,699 crypto-related complaints between January 2020 and December 2024, with an average of 340 per month. “The number of complaints reflects increasing public awareness of reporting on illicit crypto mining activities,” TNB said. Further, the electricity provider has deployed ‘smart meters,’ which could improve detection of electricity theft and enable efficient monitoring. The strategy came after the board conducted a continuous consumption patterns analysis to spot suspicious energy usage. “We work closely with the relevant authorities and stakeholders to uphold fair and sustainable electricity usage, therefore ensuring reliability for all customers.” The smart meter device records the daily electricity usage and communicates the numbers to the TNB through radio-­frequency waves. Additionally, the board has proposed employing AI and predictive analytics to further improve the process, the report read. When it comes to legal enforcement, the TNB has proposed stricter actions under the Electricity Supply Act. Anyone who tampers with or alters any electricity installation is liable to a fine of up to 1 million Ringgit ($232K), imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both. Over Half a Billion Ringgit Lost to Energy Thefts: CID Director Datuk Seri Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain, director of Bukit Aman Criminal Investi­gation Department (CID), noted that TNB lost about 520 million Ringgit ($121 million) to electricity thefts. “Most of the cases involved illegal crypto mining operations,” he told The Star. Besides, he noted that crypto mining syndicates often operate from rented shops, warehouses or residential homes with low foot traffic. “Many syndicates would then install heavy-duty ventilation ­systems, air conditioners and soundproofing materials to avoid drawing attention from the neighbours or enforcement authorities.” Further, these criminals illegally bypass the electricity meter by tapping directly into the main power grid for surplus electricity consumption. “This allows them to consume massive amounts of electricity – often equivalent to what an entire residential block would use,” the officer said, adding that these syndicates don’t stick to a single place to avoid attention. “They would shift their operations every few months to new premises,” he noted. In February, Malaysian police uncovered an illegal Bitcoin mining setup , following an explosion at the house that hosted the operation. The investigations found that the electricity had been connected illegally for bitcoin mining, causing a short circuit.

Traders awaited further details from the negotiations, which were expected to be announced on Monday. Still, the upside was tempered by weak April CPI/PPI data from China, where consumer prices fell for the third month and producer prices posted their steepest drop in six months. Easing geopolitical tensions also lifted sentiment, with a fragile ceasefire holding between India and Pakistan, and Ukrainian President Zelenskiy showing willingness to meet Russia’s Putin in Turkey this week. Gold slipped over 1% to around $3,260 on Monday, hitting a one-week low, as optimism over US-China trade talks dampened demand for safe-haven assets. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.39% toward 37,600 while the broader Topix index gained 0.4% to 2,744 on Monday, with Japanese shares scaling six-week highs. The Japanese yen weakened past 146 per dollar on Monday, marking a fresh one-month low as optimism over US-China trade negotiations. Investors also kept a close eye on ongoing trade talks between the US and Japan, with Tokyo aiming to secure a deal by June. On the domestic front, Japan recorded a current account surplus of JPY 3.45 trillion in March, following a record JPY 4.06 trillion surplus in February. The gauge for Japan’s service sector fell to 42.6 in April 2025 from 45.1 in the previous month, marking its lowest level since February 2022 and the fourth consecutive month of decline. The value of loans in Japan increased 2.4% year-on-year in April 2025, slowing for the second straight month and missing market expectations for a 2.8% gain. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.51% to around 3,350, while the Shenzhen Component surged 1.2% to 10,250 on Monday, extending last week’s gains as optimism over progress in US-China trade talks outweighed mounting deflationary pressures at home, the offshore yuan strengthened around 7.23 per dollar on Monday, after Friday’s muted session. Meanwhile, April’s inflation data underscored persistent economic weakness, with consumer prices down 0.1% year-on-year for the third month and producer prices falling 2.7%, the fastest drop in six months. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 1.11% to 23,188 in early Monday trade, marking the eighth straight session of gains and notching their highest level in 1-1/2 months. India ( SENSEX ) rose 2.71% surged 1,922 points, or 2.4%, to 81,377 in early trading on Monday, halting losses from the previous two sessions and hitting the highest level in nearly five months, as India and Pakistan reached a truce over the weekend following four days of cross-border firing. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.09% to 8,276 in Monday morning trade, gaining for the fourth session. The Australian dollar rose above $0.642 on Monday, rising for the second straight session. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended near the flatline on Friday as investors looked ahead to high-stakes trade negotiations between the US and China in Geneva this weekend. U.S. stock futures jumped on Monday after the Trump administration announced a breakthrough trade agreement with China, following weekend negotiations in Switzerland: Dow +1.07% ; S&P 500 +1.44% ; Nasdaq +1.95% .

New, disruptive coins are rising and could reshape the market’s landscape. With the current crypto bull cycle underway, the spotlight is on a few key players gaining traction. Solana, XRP, and Cardano are making strides to capture attention. Meanwhile, an exciting newcomer, Codename: Pepe crypto, aims to leverage artificial intelligence for massive profits. This fresh approach challenges the status quo and urges investors to take notice before the landscape shifts. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins , two of the most prominent trends today . Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use “AI” as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Codename:Pepe Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Codename:Pepe aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility , while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Codename:Pepe stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Codename:Pepe is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform . According to its developers, the project’s AI framework will be able to: Identify Emerging Meme Coins: By constantly monitoring social media and on-chain activity, Codename:Pepe spots early trends and high-potential tokens before they gain mainstream attention. Analyze Market Sentiment: AI-driven algorithms evaluate discussions, hype levels, and whale movements to determine which coins have the most momentum. Provide Actionable Trading Insights: Generates AI-backed forecasts, risk assessments, and early buy/sell signals to maximize trading efficiency. Optimize Auto-Trading Strategies: Uses real-time data to adjust automated trading strategies, ensuring adaptability in fast-moving market conditions. The development team behind Codename:Pepe is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Codename:Pepe has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices . The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token was offered at $0.003333333. It goes through 28 stages, and its price increases incrementally. Those who buy $AGNT earlier get a bigger discount. Secure Your Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Token Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Codename:Pepe combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market : AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Solana’s Rapid Rise: A 2025 Overview of the ‘Ethereum Killer’ Solana, launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko, has become one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains. It uses a unique system called proof-of-history, allowing it to handle over 50,000 transactions per second with low fees. This speed has drawn in many developers and investors. Since mid-2021, Solana’s native token, SOL, has seen a remarkable increase. Its price surged by more than 600%, hitting an all-time high of $263.83 in November 2024. This impressive growth shows Solana’s appeal to those seeking significant returns in the crypto market. Experts believe Solana will continue to grow due to its fast technology and increasing adoption. Some analysts predict that SOL’s price could exceed its previous highs. For example, DigitalCoinPrice forecasts SOL reaching a high of $531.91 by the end of 2025. However, Solana faces challenges like network outages and tough competition from other blockchains such as Ethereum and Cardano. Despite these hurdles, many remain optimistic, citing Solana’s innovative features and expanding ecosystem. Looking ahead, long-term predictions vary. Some suggest SOL could reach over $1,000 by 2030, while others are more cautious. As of 2025, Solana continues to make its mark in the blockchain world with its speed and scalability, making it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Ripple’s Resurgence: Is XRP Set to Soar in the Crypto World? Ripple, known by its digital currency XRP, is shaking up the world of money transfers. Designed for speed and affordability, it allows quick transactions with both traditional currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Ripple’s unique technology can handle up to 1,500 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest networks around. The real strength of XRP lies in its potential to revolutionize global payments. By partnering with banks and financial institutions, Ripple aims to integrate XRP into mainstream finance. This could transform how money moves across borders, making transactions faster and cheaper for everyone. Looking back, XRP has had its ups and downs. From being worth less than a cent in 2013, it soared to an all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. Despite facing challenges, including legal battles, XRP has shown resilience. Its ability to bounce back highlights its strong foundation and potential for growth. In 2025, many see XRP as an attractive option in the crypto market. Its ongoing partnerships and technological advancements position it well for future success. With improvements in speed and security, XRP stands out among its competitors. Experts are optimistic about where XRP could go next. Some predict that by 2030, it might reach prices between $5 and $15 or even higher. These forecasts are based on expected growth, wider adoption, and new partnerships. While no one can predict the future with certainty, XRP’s potential makes it a cryptocurrency to watch. Cardano (ADA): The Sustainable Future of Blockchain Technology Cardano, introduced in 2017, is a decentralized blockchain platform that prioritizes sustainability and efficiency. Unlike energy-intensive networks like Bitcoin that use proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanisms, Cardano employs a proof-of-stake (PoS) system called Ouroboros. This innovative approach significantly reduces energy consumption, making Cardano an environmentally friendly alternative in the blockchain world. ADA is the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano ecosystem. It functions as a store of value and facilitates peer-to-peer transactions. Users can stake ADA to participate in network validation, contributing to security and earning rewards in the process. Cardano’s vision is to become a scalable and secure platform for decentralized applications (dApps), positioning itself as a strong contender alongside platforms like Ethereum. Historically, ADA experienced notable price movements. In September 2021, it reached an all-time high of $3.10 during a vibrant crypto market phase. Market fluctuations are common in the cryptocurrency space, and ADA has seen both surges and corrections. Analysts often speculate that events like Bitcoin halvings could spark bull markets, potentially influencing the value of altcoins like ADA. Cardano’s continuous development, grounded in peer-reviewed research, enhances its appeal to developers and investors. Its commitment to improving scalability and security could increase its adoption and utility in the blockchain sector. While future price movements are uncertain, Cardano’s strong fundamentals suggest potential for growth. In the current market cycle, Cardano’s sustainable approach and technological advancements make it a noteworthy project in the crypto landscape. Its focus on environmental responsibility and scalability addresses some of the critical challenges facing blockchain technology today. As always, individuals interested in ADA should stay informed and consider the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion While Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) are positioning themselves for the next crypto cycle, their short-term potential appears limited. Traditional altcoins may not offer immediate gains as the market dynamics shift rapidly.

DeFi lending protocols are currently the leading DeFi vertical in TVL at $53.6 billion, representing 43% of the $124.6 billion locked across all DeFi protocols. The figure also surpasses liquid staking. Multichain lending protocol Aave currently holds $25 billion of locked value, accounting for nearly half of the DeFi lending market. Change in crypto lending protocol TVL since 2019. Source: DeFiLlama In stark contrast, DEXs, which once held nearly double the TVL of their closest competitor , have dropped from $85.3 billion in November 2021 to $21.5 billion today. Explaining the rise in DeFi lending and fall in DEX TVL, the founder of crypto fund Apollo Capital, Henrik Andersson, told Cointelegraph that lending is arguably the “only sustainable way to produce yield” in DeFi, as DEX liquidity pooling has largely become unprofitable due to impermanent loss. He also argued that the industry-leading DEX Uniswap v3’s more “capital efficient” design, relative to Uniswap v2, may have contributed to the DEX TVL fall, as liquidity providers can now earn more rewards with less upfront capital. Andersson also pointed out that the rise of intent-based swaps — a relatively new crosschain trading mechanism — may have further reduced the DEX TVL, as market makers typically source liquidity from centralized exchanges to facilitate these swaps. DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Compound Finance enable crypto users to lend assets to earn interest or borrow against collateral. Smart contracts manage deposits, loans and interest rates to ensure trustless transactions. DeFi users who supply Ether ( ETH ) and Tether ( USDT ) on Aave, for example, currently earn an annual percentage yield of 1.86% and 3.17%, respectively. Providing stablecoins and Ether to DEX pools such as Uniswap’s can offer higher rewards; however, as Andersson pointed out, they’re far less sustainable, fluctuating by the day. DeFi now dominates CeFi in crypto lending market DeFi-based crypto lending accounted for around 65% of the total market by the end of 2024 and has increased or maintained its market share against centralized lenders every quarter since Q4 2022, an April report from crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital showed. The fall started occurring around the time several centralized crypto lenders such as Genesis, Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager fell bankrupt, causing TVL to fall massively.

Change in market share between centralized and decentralized crypto lending protocols between Q3 2018 and Q4 2024. Source: Galaxy Digital However, it was DeFi lending protocols that led the resurgence in crypto lending activity, Galaxy noted, pointing to a near 960% increase in DeFi open borrows between Q4 2022 and Q4 2024. Galaxy said the strong recovery of the DeFi lending market is a testament to the design and risk management practices adopted by DeFi lending protocols while showcasing the benefits of algorithmic, overcollateralized and supply-and-demand-driven borrowing models. Galaxy expects increased institutional participation and clearer regulations to drive the next wave of crypto lending adoption.

This mindblowing rally of over 100% in the past several days transpired after a hype announcement from the Pi Core Team, which many anticipate to be a listing on the world’s largest exchange. PI Coming on Binance? It was less than a week ago – on May 8, to be precise – when the PI Core Team (the official X channel of Pi Network with over 4.3 million followers) said an ecosystem announcement would be made on May 14. At the time, the project’s native token traded at around $0.6 after a prolonged downtrend and subsequent consolidation around that level. PI’s loud community quickly picked up the statement, with multiple speculations about its meaning. While some related it to the upcoming appearance of Pi Network’s Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis at the 2025 Consensus conference, others thought it could be a listing on Binance. The crypto exchange giant held a community vote in February to determine whether its user base wants to see PI on its platform. Although the ‘ yes ‘ answers dominated heavily, there has been no official confirmation or communication on the matter since. However, some X users noted that the exchange has experimented with certain PI deposits and withdrawals, which was a clear sign to them that a listing is inevitable. A popular Pi Network-dedicated channel said they are “93% sure that Binance is now in the process of listing PI,” as the exchange “smells profit from 3 thousand kilometers away.” PI’s Rocket Moves PI’s price went on a massive roll after that announcement. It surged to $1 yesterday and, after a brief hesitation, flew past that level decisively and continued its ascent to a multi-week peak of over $1.3 earlier today. On a daily scale, PI has soared by over 30%, while its gains since the hype statement are at almost 110%. Pi Network’s token is the best performer on a weekly scale, which has made it the 19th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The spot volumes are on the rise as well, while Crypto TA King outlined the next resistance levels at $1.39, $1.69, and $2. However, the popular channel with over 330,000 followers warned that this price rally could be a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” event. PI has definitely fallen victim to such developments in the past.

Uniswap founder Hayden Adams noted the achievement in an X post on May 12, which included a screenshot of a Dune Analytics dashboard counting down to the milestone. Uniswap also has a current daily volume of $3.3 billion, according to Dune. DeFillama meanwhile shows Uniswap is the leading DEX with a 23% market share in daily volumes, which it reports as slightly lower at $3 billion over the past 24 hours. The second-largest DEX in volume is PancakeSwap, with $2.7 billion and a 21% DEX market share. Uniswap has a current total value locked of just under $5 billion. However, this figure is around half of its 2021 all-time high, as overall DeFi total value locked (TVL ) is about half of what it was in late 2021. DeFillama reports a DeFi TVL of $124 billion, while DappRadar reports $132 billion, with more than half of this total on Ethereum. Uniswap reaches total trade volume milestone. Source: Hayden Adams Related: Decentralized exchanges gain ground despite $6M Hyperliquid exploit The DEX’s native token, Uniswap ( UNI ), has not mirrored the platform’s performance and remains down more than 84% from its peak price of $45 four years ago in May 2021. UNI had lost 3.4% on the day and was trading at just over $7 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko. Uniswap smart wallet coming Adams also announced on May 12 that Uniswap was “rolling out our own 7702 wallet and supporting other 7702 wallets … with the goal being one-click swapping for all users.” EIP-7702 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal led by Vitalik Buterin that went live with the Pectra upgrade on May 7. It enhances Ethereum accounts to withstand potential threats from quantum computing and allows externally owned accounts to temporarily function as smart contracts during transactions.

Referencing Coinbase’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Brett pointed out that the exchange earned more transaction revenue from XRP than from Ethereum or Solana. XRP held on Coinbase experienced a 458% surge in value over the past year, leading many to reconsider the token’s standing among leading cryptocurrencies. Coinbase earned more in transaction revenue from $XRP than from Ethereum or Solana. Data from its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows a 458% surge in the value of XRP held on Coinbase in the last year. pic.twitter.com/AQMyp1vXt0 — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) May 10, 2025 Community Sentiment and XRP’s Performance The post prompted several users to weigh in on XRP’s current trajectory. One user remarked , “XRP catching up in silence?” while another claimed that “XRP is the replacement for ETH and SOL.” These reactions reflect a broader sentiment that XRP is gaining strength while maintaining a relatively low profile. XRP has now outperformed Ethereum for more than five consecutive months. In addition to this consistent trend, it has also surpassed Ethereum’s Fully Diluted Value (FDV). The next target is to beat Ethereum for the second position in the market ranking. While the asset may be building slowly, experts have previously shown that it tends to move fast and aggressively , and it may begin a historic run out of nowhere and shock the market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Market Dominance Coinbase’s data offers more than a surface-level insight into transaction revenue. The fact that XRP generated more revenue than Ethereum or Solana suggests increased trading activity and growing user engagement with the asset. It also points to a significant shift in investor interest, especially considering that Ethereum and Solana have traditionally dominated discussions about utility, scalability, and the developer ecosystem. The 458% increase in XRP holdings on Coinbase over the past year shows a sharp rise in accumulation and confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. Such a rise is unlikely to be coincidental, particularly when viewed alongside its outperformance of the top assets. XRP is also outpacing Bitcoin in certain areas . A recent analysis showed that active XRP addresses surged by 490% while Bitcoin only experienced a 10% growth. Some experts have maintained for years that XRP could eventually surpass Bitcoin in market influence and utility. Although such predictions have often been met with skepticism, current trends appear to support the idea that XRP is closing the gap.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Wood says Bitcoin has “miles to go” before it peaks due to a combination of dwindling supply and rising interest from institutions. According to Wood, her base-case price target of the flagship digital asset in 2030 is between $700,000 and $750,000, while her bull case target is around $1.5 million. A rise to Wood’s base-case price would represent about a 573% increase from current levels. “Our analyst and our on-chain analyst put [out a] piece recently, and you can see the building blocks, how much share we expect Bitcoin to either take from gold or grow that store-of-value market, institutions moving in – and they’ve barely moved in, we have a million more coins, roughly, to be minted ever, and institutions are just testing the waters right now – and then there’s the emerging market use cases as well. So we think we have miles to go.” Last January, ARK Invest launched its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), a BTC-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that ARK currently holds 48,363 Bitcoin worth about $5 billion. Bitcoin is trading for $103,970 at time of writing, up 9.9% in the last seven days.

According to an announcement on the official Discord server, the breach occurred on May 11 after an attacker took over a contracted moderator’s account. Using the elevated privileges, the attacker deployed a bot to post scam links in one of the channels, directing users to a malicious website that mimicked a Ledger verification page. “The issue was quickly contained: the compromised account was removed, the bot was deleted, the website was reported, and all relevant permissions were reviewed and secured,” said Ledger staff member Quintin Boatwright in the May 11 Discord post. To target users, the attacker issued a fake security warning that claimed a vulnerability had been discovered in Ledger’s systems. Users were urged to “verify” their recovery phrases via a provided link, which led to a fraudulent third-party website. You might also like: Exclusive: Ledger taps Transak to power secure crypto-to-fiat withdrawals The phishing site mimicked an official Ledger interface and instructed users to connect their wallets and enter their 24-word seed phrases under the guise of a critical update. The setup was designed to harvest sensitive credentials and gain full access to a victim’s crypto assets. Screenshots of the scam post quickly circulated on X, prompting warnings from security analysts and further scrutiny of Ledger’s community management protocols. See below. Hey @Ledger a community mod's account has been compromised and is currently social engineering an attack on your discord channel. pic.twitter.com/nsFdYZ8izD — ecurrencyhodler (@ecurrencyhodler) May 11, 2025 According to some community members, the attacker used moderator rights to mute and ban users who attempted to warn others about the scam, possibly delaying Ledger’s initial response. While it remains unclear whether any users fell victim to the phishing attempt, the incident follows a string of similar scams targeting hardware wallet customers. As previously rep orted by crypto.news, Ledger customers were recently targeted in a phishing campaign involving fake letters sent by mail bearing Ledger’s branding, a return address, and a fabricated reference number. It urged recipients to scan a malicious QR code and enter their 24-word recovery phrase, under the false pretext of a required security update. Ledger is not the only wallet provider that has dealt with security threats. In March, Ledger’s security research team, Donjon, disclosed a vulnerability in rival manufacturer Trezor’s Safe hardware wallets, warning that the devices could still be physically hacked due to a vulnerability in the microcontroller used to perform critical cryptographic operations. Notably, the chip is vulnerable to voltage glitching attacks, which can allow an attacker to extract or manipulate data stored in the device by briefly altering power input during operations.

Beat Holdings, a Tokyo-listed company, just bumped up its Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto ETF investment cap from ¥1 billion to a whopping ¥5 billion, saying in a press release that the board gave the green light to “enable the Group to continuously invest in cryptocurrencies and/or its ETF,” a fivefold jump from the initial plan revealed back in February. Beat Holdings said that so far, it has purchased approximately ¥1 billion (around $6.8 million) worth of the iShares Bitcoin Trust shares. Now, the Tokyo-listed company says macroeconomic trends and growing institutional interest in Bitcoin favor increasing investment cap. “This extra liquidity can spill over into global financial markets, supporting risk assets, including Bitcoin, especially since Bitcoin and related ETF has increasingly become a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.” Beat Holdings To support the expanded investments, Beat has drawn $2.8 million (¥400 million) from its revolving credit facility.

Despite its broad geographic presence, the firm primarily focuses on delivering financial information and services within the Chinese market. In a January statement outlining its rationale for targeting cryptocurrencies and related ETFs, Beat cited the widespread adoption and long-term growth potential of Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). The firm also noted the 2024 approvals of ETFs for both assets by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a key driver. Beyond direct investment, Beat said it’s also exploring the acquisition of intellectual property linked to blockchain-based digital assets such as non-fungible tokens and altcoins, including rights to manga and anime characters. The company is also weighing the potential to create proprietary tokens and may establish or acquire cryptocurrency exchanges as part of its broader strategy.

Vora stated that leadership would pass to @0x_chill and @pastagotsauce, although neither has disclosed their real identity. Since its launch in 2021, DeGods evolved from a niche experiment into a multimillion-dollar community. Vora announced his departure on Monday via X with a candid message. He reflected on sleepless nights spent building both DeGods and its sister collection y00ts. He thanked the community for friendships made and assured followers that no legal issues were behind his exit. Frank DeGods Insists He Faced No Legal Issues and Isn’t on the Run He admitted that the project’s fixation on his “frank degods” persona may have become a roadblock. He noted at times “the hate was overdone” but understood its appeal as click-driven criticism. He further clarified that he committed no unlawful acts and affirmed that he is not evading any investigations. today is my last day as ceo of degods. my chapter is closing, but the story isn't over. @0x_chill & @pastagotsauce will be taking over. — Frank (@frankdegods) May 12, 2025 Although Vora offered no formal explanation for stepping down, his comments suggest a mix of personal reflection and community pressures. He expressed pride in the work achieved and optimism that a fresh perspective could drive DeGods forward without the distractions surrounding his own reputation. Series of Technical and Artistic Stumbles Precede CEO Exit The move follows a series of high-profile setbacks. In 2023 Vora oversaw the ill-fated migration of DeGods from Solana to Ethereum after Solana’s downturn post-FTX collapse . Moreover an overhyped Season 3 release later that year disappointed collectors with lackluster artwork and triggered a sharp drop in the project’s floor price. Meanwhile DeLabs, the studio behind DeGods, merged with Dust Labs in Feb. 2024 and saw co-founder Kevin Henrikson, also known as Kevin DeGods, depart around the same time. Observers interpreted those changes as a bid to streamline operations and redefine the roadmap after the project’s rocky transition. Subsequently, the launch of the DEGOD token in Sept. 2024 aimed to simplify the ecosystem but met mixed reactions from holders. Community debate over governance and tokenomics continued to swirl into early 2025, adding to the challenges faced by the founding team. Vora hinted at new ventures beyond the NFT space, possibly in artificial intelligence, and welcomed the opportunity to pursue fresh interests. His departure ushers in a new chapter for DeGods under undisclosed leadership.

The rally is picking up pace with better US-China trade talks, steady ETF inflows, and hopes of lower inflation lifting market sentiment. After falling to $75000 in April, Bitcoin has bounced back strongly, gaining nearly 10% in just a week.

A joint statement is expected soon. The deal follows months of tariff hikes, which had raised inflation concerns. Now, with tensions easing, investors are optimistic that April’s CPI data won’t reignite inflation fears . CPI Could Fuel Further Gains This upcoming Tuesday is CPI day again, and it will be very important to watch.

Core CPI is expected to hold steady at 2.8%. Markus Thielen from 10x Research said if the numbers come in as expected, the market could interpret the report as bullish, possibly pushing Bitcoin beyond its previous high. Even a slightly hotter CPI might not hurt sentiment, as it would be seen as outdated, reflecting the impact of now-defused tariffs. Continuous ETF Inflows BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has seen 20 straight days of inflows , attracting over $5 billion. This, combined with the Fed’s decision to hold interest rates steady, has kept investor sentiment high. Chairman Powell even noted that the tariff’s impact on inflation is likely short-lived. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 10 May, 2025 , Altcoins Join the Rally Ethereum posted its best weekly gain since 2020 , jumping 39% to $2,500.

Although the top cryptos were unable to demonstrate huge moves, they managed to hold around the gains, above the pivotal support, which suggests the growing dominance of the bulls. The market capitalization just faced a small pullback from $3.34 trillion, while the volume dropped by over 12%, which suggests the markets could remain still throughout the trading day. Bitcoin, Ethereum & the Top 10 Cryptos Bitcoin price remained elevated throughout the weekend and marked the local highs above $105,000 after holding above $102,500 support levels. Besides, the Ethereum price surged above $2500, while the XRP price faced a pullback from $2.84 to $2.4. Meanwhile, Cardano prices hold above $0.8, Solana plunged slightly after marking the highs above $180, and Litecoin reclaimed the three-digit figure. BinanceCoin price reached above $657, and Tron price trades above $0.26. Top Gainers for the Day With the crypto markets closing the weekly trade on a bullish note, the start was somewhat bullish, as bears tried to initiate a correction phase. Despite this, the biggest gainers included Pi with over a 47% jump, followed by dogwifhat with a 30% rise, Kaspa with 18.5%, and Four with over 14%. Meanwhile, the memecoins like FLOKI, Pepe, Fartcoin and SPX6900 also experienced a decent rise. Top Losers for the Day In the past 24 hours, the loss margin is much lower than the gains, as the altcoins attracted minimal bearish action. Among them are the tokens such as Arbitrum and Flare, which attracted a more than 3% jump. The altcoins like Theta Network, Lido DAO, Optimism, POL, Near Protocol, Helium and a few other tokens face marginal losses below 3%. However, these losses are expected to recover in the next few hours, which could push the markets back under bullish influence. The crypto market sentiments have turned bullish, with the indicator rising to 73, suggesting the retail investors have turned greedy. Moreover, the bullish sentiments on PI and Kaspa have risen over 90%, followed by Filecoin, Cardano and Ethereum.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-12 07:21:18

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs brought in $921 million over the past week, dated from May 5-9. Notably, these investment products have been on a strong inflow run for three straight weeks, bringing nearly $5.8 billion. BlackRock’s IBIT led the pack again, bringing in over $1 billion last week alone, according to Farside data . It’s now riding a 19-day inflow streak that’s added over $5 billion to its assets, making it the longest-running streak for any spot Bitcoin ETF this year. Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB also chipped in with smaller gains, adding $62.4 million and $45.6 million, respectively. However, three of the funds, namely, Grayscale’s GBTC, Bitwise’s BITB, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, and VanEck’s HODL, recorded a combined outflow of $217.4 million, which partially offset the week’s overall gains. The remaining BTC ETFs saw zero flows over the period. You might also like: Bitcoin eyes new all-time high amid “substantial progress” in U.S.-China trade talks Following Friday’s inflows, total net inflows into these investment vehicles since launch day stood at $41.16 billion, a new all-time high for cumulative flows. A lot of this fresh momentum is being linked to macro developments. U.S. President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement with the U.K., pledging to roll back tariffs on British cars, aluminum, and steel. In return, the U.K. will open up its market to more American exports like beef, ethanol, and soft drinks. Talks with China are also back on the table, and that’s been a major relief for global investors. With geopolitical stress easing, Bitcoin ( BTC ) broke above the $100,000 mark again, climbing to around $104,000 at the time of writing. It’s now just 4.5% off its all-time high from January. Risk-on sentiment returned, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 70, firmly in “greed” territory, up from last week’s neutral readings. Analysts attribute the rally in part to strong capital flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju, Bitcoin’s current rally is being driven by consistent ETF inflows, alongside rising institutional and government participation. Despite the persistently strong demand for BTC ETFs, their Ethereum counterparts had a bearish week, recording three days of outflows versus just one day of inflows. The nine spot Ethereum ETF funds recorded a combined net outflow of $38.15 million over the period.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming the talk in May 2025, after raising $8,000,000 since presale began where 455 million tokens had been sold to 9,700 holders. For this decentralized finance platform currently at 4 in $0.025, up from $0.01 per the first phase, the token is 70% sold out having phase 5 to come with a 20% surge in price to $0.03. Investors are cutting against the clock for a lending model that seems to guarantee stability and passive income. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Lending Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making its name in the crypto market through decentralized lending and borrowing system. Lenders put up assets in liquidity pools and make returns in the form of mtTokens which accrue in value as loans get interest. Meanwhile, borrowers get at the funds by using collateral in the form of posting $7,000 in ETH to access $5,000 USDT loan, ensuring that overcollateralization is making the platform stable. This configuration reduces the risk and secures consistent returns for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) compared to volatile legacy tokens. The team is in the final stages of a smart contract audit with CertiK, with results to be published on social media shortly, and this is providing investor confidence. Security and opportunity are the integral aspects that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) unites making the platform the best option for portfolio diversity. Presale Momentum and ROI Potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 4 is edging toward completion, where 70% of tokens have already been claimed at $0.025.

The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokenomics offer a 140% profit at the $0.06 listing price – a strong lure to early adopters. Post launch, analysts eye a possible ascent to $2.50 by 2025 for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a result of listing on the exchanges and adoption of the platform; representing off-the-charts ROI of 9900% from the current rates. Of late, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) opened a dashboard with the largest 50 holders which will reward their shares of bonus tokens for maintaining their positions, fueling more zeal amongst the investors. Innovative Features Driving Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching a peer-to-peer lending feature with which users can negotiate terms pertaining to niche assets such as meme coins, adding flexibility beyond normal pools. Through its buy and distribute mechanism, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform revenue is redirected to repurchase MUTM tokens, which are distributed to stakers to support buy pressure and halt sell-offs. A $100,000 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) giveaway is active, sharing $10,000 between 10 early investors, an effort to intensify pressure as phase 4 reaches its conclusion. Combined with an upcoming over-collateralized stablecoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well positioned as a forward thinking DeFi player ready for long term growth. Diversification Done Right Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a calculated pivot from legacy tokens with capped upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending model, robust tokenomics, and presale traction make it an attractive option for high-yield opportunities in April 2025. Reduced tokens in Phase 4 indicates tightening time to buy at $0.025.

This is not permanent. This is a tactical pause in a trade war that’s been spiraling since early April, when Trump yanked up import taxes on China and Beijing fired back with its own penalties. This sudden easing comes from a closed-door deal that was hammered out in Geneva, where both governments agreed they couldn’t keep messing up their supply chains without blowing up trade altogether. The decision is designed to stop the economic bleeding, not to fix the damage. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said: “We had very productive talks and I believe that the venue, here in Lake Geneva, added great equanimity to what was a very positive process. We have reached an agreement on a 90-day pause and substantially move down the tariff levels. Both sides on the reciprocal tariffs will move their tariffs down 115%.” Back in April, Trump decided to crank up tariffs on Chinese imports, triggering an immediate response from Beijing. The tariffs set by the US were pushed all the way to 145%, which made it impossible for American companies to buy Chinese-made goods without getting price-gouged. China, in return, spiked their tariffs on American exports to 125%, choking off sales for US farmers and manufacturers. That tit-for-tat turned into an economic cage match. The damage came fast. Trade between both sides tanked. Big businesses started sweating. Executives didn’t see a way forward. Last month, Bessent admitted that the situation was “unsustainable.” That was before they flew out to Geneva to hammer out this short-term fix.

In his recent post, Conor McGregor considered the benefits of cryptocurrency as well as the large potential posed by Bitcoin. “Bitcoin or cryptocurrency? I can see lots of transparent and trustless applications within crypto. And I can see an immutable people’s money with Bitcoin,” said McGregor in his post . Bitcoin or cryptocurrency? I can see lots of transparent and trustless applications within crypto. And I can see an immutable people’s money with Bitcoin. What cryptos can help bring accountability to a government? Why?? — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) May 11, 2025 In the end, the UFC star asked X users which cryptocurrencies they believed could be used to bring government accountability. His question garnered responses from some of the crypto industry’s leading figures, including Cardano ( ADA ) founder Charles Hoskinson and Bitcoin Treasury solution Orqestra co-founder Stephen Cole. “Let’s chat,” said Hoskinson to McGregor in a comment under his Bitcoin post. Meanwhile, Cole alleged that Bitcoin was the best choice among all other kinds of cryptocurrencies. He regarded Bitcoin as “the only one socially decentralized enough to resist pressures,” compared to other tokens in the space. “Cryptocurrencies are much more like companies than commodities. Even if they claim to be “decentralized”, there’s usually a small group of influential people who get rich if you buy in and who can change the rules of the supply if they try hard enough,” said Cole in his comment.

In March 2025, Conor McGregor declared his intention to run for president in the upcoming Irish elections. Ireland’s presidential election is set to take place in November 2025. A figurehead of the far-right movement in Ireland, McGregor’s political leanings seem to be in line with Donald Trump’s . Earlier this year, he had appeared at the White House with President Trump on St. Patrick’s Day, where he became the latest European ally of the U.S. president in promoting anti-immigrant sentiment and policies. Therefore, it is possible that McGregor will also adopt a crypto-friendly approach in his administration if he does get elected president. In fact, similar to Trump, the UFC champ has previously embarked on his own meme coin venture in early April. However, it ended up becoming a flop. On April 7, Conor McGregor launched his official meme coin, REAL, which fell 61% below its $1 million minimum pre-sale bid target. As a result, the project was paused, and all presale bids were refunded. At press time, the website for REAL has declared that it would relaunch the token “soon.” Users can register to be notified by providing their email address and X handle.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency touched an intraday high of $105,706 before settling around $105,461, marking a significant breakout from the recent consolidation range between $103,000 and $105,000. Market sentiment shifted as reports emerged that the U.S. might reduce tariffs on Chinese imports, potentially easing global recession fears. This positive sentiment boosted Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainty, further supported by a stronger risk appetite among investors. The US and China have reached a deal to cut tariffs by 115% for 90 days, indicating a possible easing of trade tensions. This could benefit both economies and improve relations. #TradeDeal BBC News – World — GlanceNow (@SnapGlance) May 12, 2025 Key Market Drivers: U.S.-China trade optimism Strong support at $103,818 (50-day EMA) Bullish technical breakout above $105,000 Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Daily Technical Outlook – May 12, 2025 Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish amid BTC recent breakout above $105,000 signals a potential shift in market momentum. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $103,818 provided strong support during the consolidation phase, reinforcing bullish sentiment as the price held above this critical level. The breakout now sets the stage for a potential rally toward the next major resistance at $106,750, with a further upside target at $107,300, aligning closely with the psychological $107,000 mark. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is also turning bullish, with the histogram expanding and the MACD line crossing above the signal line. This suggests growing buying pressure, reinforcing the breakout. However, traders should watch for a potential pullback if Bitcoin fails to hold above the $105,000 support. Key Price Levels: Immediate Resistance: $106,750 Next Resistance: $107,300 Immediate Support: $105,000 Next Support: $103,818 Lower Support: $103,080 Market Risks and Potential Pullbacks; Bitcoin Gains While the breakout above $105,000 is a positive sign, the market remains vulnerable to downside risks. If Bitcoin fails to sustain this momentum, a pullback toward the immediate support at $103,818 is possible. A breach of this level could expose Bitcoin to a deeper correction toward $103,080, which coincides with a previous support zone and the lower boundary of the recent trading range. Traders should also keep an eye on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is approaching overbought levels, potentially signaling a short-term correction. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5.58M as Flexible 78% Staking Yield Draws Investors BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to gain traction, crossing $5.58 million in funds raised as it nears its $6.27 million presale cap. Priced at $0.002505, the token has positioned itself as more than just a meme coin—offering real utility through flexible, high-yield staking. Utility-Driven Tokenomics Fuel Demand Unlike typical meme tokens, BTCBULL blends crypto culture appeal with tangible staking rewards. Investors can currently earn an estimated 78% APY while keeping their tokens fully liquid—unstaking is allowed at any time without penalties or lockup periods. This model has resonated with investors who seek yield without sacrificing access, especially in a volatile crypto environment. Current Presale Stats: USDT Raised : $5,581,603.93 of $6,272,266 Current Price: $0.002505 per BTCBULL Staking Pool Total: 1,342,549,903 BTCBULL Estimated Yield: 78% annually With less than $690K left before the next milestone, the presale window is narrowing fast.

The three co-founders are the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change , TradeMark Africa , the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation , and the Chartered Institute of Export and International Trade .

It is “doing the opposite of Trump and connecting the world while making trade more efficient,” an email said. Furthermore, there is the issue of the fragmentation and inefficiency plaguing international trade. This is particularly the case for developing markets and small exporters. “Global trade is long overdue for modernization,” the partners argue. Therefore, TWIN aims to provide an open, interoperable, and inclusive foundation for data sharing and collaboration across borders, says the announcement. Additionally, it will offer a framework for innovators to bring novel digital trade services. It will provide governments with “improved visibility and smarter border management,” while the private sector gets new efficiencies and business models.

Moreover, the Foundation will work to develop and implement standards and best practices for distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and related innovations. It will also seek partnerships with like-minded organizations. Finally, it will share knowledge and best practices with ecosystem builders to enhance TWIN management and implementation. Also, the Foundation will raise funds and work to recover costs to ensure the financial sustainability of its operations.

Here’s the Update,https://timestabloid.com/grayscale-spot-xrp-etf-is-coming-heres-the-latest/,"JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie), a well-known crypto commentator on X, has drawn renewed attention to the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which is approaching a critical regulatory deadline. According to a screenshot he shared, the 240-day SEC review period for the fund ends on July 2. JackTheRippler suggests that a potential decision is imminent on whether it can be converted into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Notably, this fund includes XRP among its holdings, adding weight to speculation surrounding a possible spot XRP ETF approval. BREAKING: The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund Index ETF, including #XRP , is scheduled to launch on July 2nd! SPOT XRP ETF INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/HjwHUItAqM — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) May 10, 2025 Overview of the Grayscale Fund The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) is a diversified crypto investment vehicle focused on the top digital assets, excluding stablecoins and meme tokens. It is designed to offer institutional and retail investors exposure to leading crypto assets through a regulated product. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The fund contains Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Avalanche, and Grayscale has applied to convert the fund to an ETF . This conversion would make it one of the first diversified crypto ETFs, and its inclusion of XRP is particularly significant as the community has been anticipating a spot XRP ETF for years. SEC Clock Set to Expire on July 2 The image shared by JackTheRippler emphasized that the product has been reporting to the SEC since 2021 or 2022, and the transition to a listed ETF is a key part of their long-term strategy. In the excerpt shared by JackTheRippler, the speaker confirms that the 240-day clock expires on July 2. The process follows a formal ETF application, after which the SEC has a statutory period of 240 days to approve or deny the request. Multiple crypto ETF applications are pending with the SEC, and industry observers have speculated that once one product receives the green light, others may follow in rapid succession. What’s Next for XRP? Including XRP in the fund has fueled growing interest due to the token’s complex history with the SEC. XRP was the subject of a lawsuit by the agency, but regulatory clarity has improved as the regulator is in settlement proceedings with Ripple. While no decision has been made public, the July 2 deadline offers a clear timeline for the market to watch. Should the GDLC ETF receive approval, with XRP as part of its underlying assets, it would mark a significant shift in how the asset is viewed from a compliance and investment standpoint, further cementing its regulatory clarity.

His upbeat post about a “total reset” with China sparked optimism across markets, boosting investor confidence in BTC . Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s recent V-shaped recovery from $82,000 in late March to over $104,000 today is convincing Crypto analyst PlanB that the bull market is not only intact but gaining steam. Despite some calling it a bear market just weeks ago, the analyst sees Bitcoin’s surge as a continuation of a longer, flatter bull cycle that is just getting started. Bitcoin Bull Run on Cards In his latest video analysis , PlanB refers to his on-chain market cycle model, which showed no signs of a typical end-of-cycle distribution phase back in March. Instead, the data pointed to continued bullish momentum. Drawing from past patterns, he expects Bitcoin to push past its previous all-time high of $110,000 soon, with several new highs likely to follow in succession. Notably, his stock-to-flow (S2F) model predicts that as Bitcoin becomes more scarce, its price rises. Historically, after each halving, a red dot appears on the chart, often signaling the start of a strong bull run. Bitcoin Price Analysis Bitcoin’s RSI is currently at 66, and PlanB predicts it will soar above 80 for several months, a pattern seen in past bull runs. Analyst boldly claims that “we’ll see this happen again, which could drive Bitcoin’s price up to $400,000 in just a few months”. This fits with the stock-to-flow model, which suggests Bitcoin could hit $500,000 per coin by the end of the current halving cycle. The 200-week moving average has risen from $46K to $47K, signaling increased market confidence and possibly the start of the “FOMO phase.” Additionally, realized prices are trending upwards, with short-term realized prices at $92K and the two-year at $77K, indicating most Bitcoin holders are in profit, supporting a strong market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Update Today: 12 May 2025-BTC, ETH, PI & More , BTC Price Forecast Moreover, analysts’ forecast suggests that with just a few high-momentum months, Bitcoin could reach $400K , putting it well within striking distance of the stock-to-flow average. He emphasizes that while models can be wrong, they’re often useful, and all indicators now point toward a potentially historic 2025 for Bitcoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This jump came after news broke about a 90-day truce in the US-China trade war, with both sides agreeing to reduce some tariffs. Traders immediately started buying risk assets. The reaction was fast. Ether moved up by 4% to hit $2,596, and XRP jumped by 3% to trade at $2.44. Solana (SOL) climbed by 3.2% to $179, while BNB moved up more quietly with a 1.1% rise to $665. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s rally was quite short-lived as it had already slipped back slightly to $104,422 at press time. The US dollar spiked while gold and government bonds got dumped. Investors reacted to hopes that the economic damage from the tariff war might ease — at least for now. Yields rose fast. The 10-year US Treasury yield gained six basis points to hit 4.43%, the highest in almost a month. A dollar strength index also rose 0.5%. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen, a traditional safe haven, tanked. Markets move fast as risk appetite returns Over on Wall Street, Dow futures surged 422 points, or about 1%. S&P 500 futures were up 1.38%, and Nasdaq-100 futures rallied 1.94%. The push came after a rough patch. All three major averages had closed lower last week. The Dow Jones slipped 0.2%, the S&P 500 dropped 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3%. That losing streak was broken hard today. Traders are still watching what happens next. The truce on tariffs doesn’t mean the fight is over. But t he sudden decision to step back, even temporarily, gave markets breathing room. The 90-day reduction is short, but enough to stir money into everything from crypto to equities. The Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, spoke on Sunday, saying the US will likely keep the 10% base tariff on imports from other countries. He said this would stay “in place for the foreseeable future,” backing up similar remarks Trump made days earlier. That means while the US might be dialing back on China, the general protectionist stance is not going anywhere. Investors are now looking ahead to more numbers. On Tuesday, the April Consumer Price Index comes out. It will show how much inflation is creeping in. Then on Thursday, the market gets data on retail sales and the Producer Price Index, another key measure of inflation. All these reports will show if rising prices — and global tensions — are starting to hit the economy harder. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Here’s what you need to know,https://cointelegraph.com/news/can-you-stake-bitcoin-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Key takeaways Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks. WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks. Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain. Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos. Unlike proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains like Ethereum or Cardano, Bitcoin relies on proof-of-work (PoW) mining for network security. However, with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and layer-2 innovations , Bitcoin ( BTC ) holders can now generate passive income through various yield-generating methods. These include centralized lending, Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ) on Ethereum , and layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks. This article explores how to earn yield on BTC, the risks involved and the technological advancements enabling these opportunities, all without altering Bitcoin’s core protocol. Staking vs. mining Staking and mining are two distinct consensus mechanisms used to secure blockchain networks and validate transactions. Staking is central to PoS blockchains like Ethereum and Solana . Participants lock up cryptocurrency to become validators, who are randomly selected to create new blocks and confirm transactions, earning rewards. The more coins staked, the higher the chance of selection. Mining, used by PoW blockchains like Bitcoin and Litecoin , involves miners solving complex mathematical puzzles with powerful computers. The first to solve the puzzle adds a new block and receives a reward. Mining demands significant energy and hardware. Bitcoin’s PoW design means it does not support staking. The network relies entirely on miners to ensure decentralization and security. There are no validators or staking rewards in the traditional sense. Yield-generating methods for BTC, such as lending or layer-2 solutions, are not equivalent to PoS staking. Did you know? Some staking platforms offer liquid staking, where you get a token representing your staked asset (like stETH for Ether). This lets you earn staking rewards and still use your capital in DeFi protocols. Ways to earn yield on Bitcoin While you cannot natively stake BTC due to its PoW mechanism, there are alternative methods to help you earn yield on your BTC holdings and make passive income. These methods often involve using third-party platforms or bridging BTC to other blockchains. Centralized lending platforms Centralized lending platforms like Binance Earn, Nexo and Ledn enable you to earn with BTC deposited, which the platform lends to institutional borrowers. In return, you receive interest, which might be paid daily or monthly. But this method involves custodial risk, as users must trust the platform to remain solvent and secure. The collapse of firms like Celsius and BlockFi has highlighted this vulnerability. WBTC on Ethereum WBTC is an ERC-20 token backed 1:1 by BTC, held by a centralized custodian (BitGo). It enables BTC holders to engage in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols, such as lending on Aave, providing liquidity on Curve or yield farming. This unlocks DeFi’s potential but introduces risks from BitGo’s custody, bridge vulnerabilities and smart contract bugs. Bitcoin layer-2 platforms Emerging layer-2 platforms such as Babylon and Stacks also enable you to explore Bitcoin-native yield opportunities. Babylon locks BTC in time-locked scripts to secure its PoS network, while Stacks uses a proof-of-transfer (PoX) model where STX tokenholders lock tokens to earn BTC rewards. These platforms expand Bitcoin’s utility without leaving its ecosystem entirely. Did you know? Ethereum became the largest PoS network in 2022 after “the Merge,” replacing miners with validators. This move reportedly reduced the blockchain’s energy consumption by over 99.95%, making it one of the greenest major crypto networks. How to earn yield with BTC on a centralized lending platform Earning yield on BTC via centralized platforms is straightforward. Choose a reputable platform, create a verified account, deposit BTC, select a flexible or fixed-term lending option, confirm terms, and monitor earnings. Funds can typically be withdrawn after the term. Using Binance Earn as an example, the platform offers multiple yield options: Simple Earn: Beginner-friendly, offering stable yields through flexible or locked savings products. Dual Investment: Higher-risk, with returns based on the settlement price of two assets, exposing users to market volatility. On-chain Yield: Bridges funds to DeFi protocols like Aave, with variable yields managed by Binance. Yields and terms vary by option and market conditions. Simple Earn offers lower, predictable returns with flexible withdrawals, while Dual Investment and On-chain Yield may yield higher but riskier returns with locked terms. Check Binance Earn for current rates. After subscribing: Simple Earn: BTC is locked (fixed term) or withdrawable (flexible term), with interest paid daily or at term’s end. Dual Investment: Funds are committed to a target price and settlement date, with yields paid in the deposited or alternative asset. On-chain Yield: Funds are deployed to DeFi protocols, with Binance handling gas fees and smart contracts. Withdrawals may face delays due to liquidity or network issues. Rewards depend on the platform, BTC amount and program terms. How to earn yield with WBTC on Ethereum WBTC allows BTC holders to earn yield on Ethereum’s DeFi platforms, such as Aave or Curve, by depositing WBTC into liquidity pools and earning interest or fees. Steps to earn yield with WBTC, using Curve as an example: Convert BTC to WBTC: Use a centralized exchange (CEX) (e.g., Binance) or decentralized bridge (e.g., RenBridge) to convert BTC to WBTC, custodied by BitGo. Transfer WBTC to a wallet: Move WBTC to a Web3 wallet like MetaMask and make sure you have enough Ether ( ETH ) for gas fees . Connect to a DeFi protocol: Visit Curve.fi and deposit WBTC into a liquidity pool via the platform’s interface. Earn yield: By providing liquidity, you earn interest or fees based on pool performance. How to earn yield using Bitcoin layer 2s Layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks enable yield generation by leveraging Bitcoin’s security. Babylon, for example, locks BTC as collateral to secure its PoS network, connecting to Cosmos zones (interconnected blockchains). Babylon’s Genesis mainnet launched on April 10, 2025, with over 57,000 BTC staked, valued at approximately $4.6 billion. Steps to earn yield with Babylon: Set up a compatible wallet: Use a wallet like OKX or Phantom, supporting Native SegWit (bc1q) or Taproot (bc1p) addresses. Avoid wallets with Bitcoin Inscriptions (Ordinals) . Access the Babylon stake app: Visit the Babylon Stake app, which is active post-Genesis launch. Connect your wallet: Link your BTC wallet and approve digital signature requests for platform interaction. Choose a finality provider: Select from over 250 finality providers (e.g., Galaxy, Figment) that secure Babylon’s network. Set transaction fees: Choose default or custom fees (higher fees ensure faster confirmation) and enter the BTC amount to lock. Confirm and monitor: Lock BTC via the app and track status in the Babylon Staking Terminal. Rewards include BABY tokens, split 50-50 between BTC and BABY stakers. Did you know? In some countries, crypto yield rewards are taxed as income upon receipt and as capital gains when sold. Tax treatment varies, so consult a professional. Innovative mechanisms in Bitcoin layer-2 protocols Layer-2 protocols enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality. Babylon and Stacks introduce unique mechanisms to generate yield while leveraging Bitcoin’s security. Native time-locked scripts in Babylon Protocol Babylon locks BTC in self-custodial, time-locked scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, using it as collateral to secure its PoS network, launched on April 10, 2025. This non-custodial model supports Cosmos zones without requiring bridges or wrapping. BTC stakers delegate to Finality Providers, earning BABY tokens, while BABY stakers support block production. This trustless system enables delegated voting and restaking across PoS chains. Stacking in the Stacks Protocol Stacking is Stacks’ yield mechanism, using proof-of-transfer (PoX). STX tokenholders lock Stacks ( STX ) for ~2 weeks to support network consensus, earning BTC rewards paid by Stacks miners. This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself. Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) Explained Coinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns for institutional investors outside the US. The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between spot and futures markets , while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling. Targeting annual net returns of 4–8% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin — an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies. Risks involved in earning yield with BTC Generating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s: Custodial risk: Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC’s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns. Smart contract risk: WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits. Liquidity risk: Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts. Network maturity: Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges. Market risk: Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets. Regulatory risk: Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction. How earning yield with BTC may evolve Bitcoin’s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin’s censorship resistance. However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin’s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.

As more people spend time in the metaverse, what you wear online is becoming just as important as real life. Big brands know it, and so do smart crypto teams. Dawgz AI is one of the few meme coins taking this trend seriously, tapping into metaverse growth with actual utility. It’s not just about memes anymore, it’s about being early to where digital identity meets blockchain innovation. Why Digital Wearables Are the Next Big Thing in Crypto Virtual wearables are starting to matter just as much as what people wear in real life. From branded sneakers to full avatar outfits, users are spending real money to upgrade their digital appearance. Why Crypto Is Key to This Shift Blockchain gives digital wearables real value. Instead of being stuck inside one platform or game, these items can be minted as NFTs, traded on open markets, and truly owned by the user. That’s a big deal, it means users can invest in what they wear online, resell it, or even flex limited-edition gear like they would in real life. It also opens the door for new marketplaces and crypto trading activity focused on fashion, collectibles, and more. How the Metaverse Is Changing What We Value Online The more time we spend online, the more important digital identity becomes. People are building entire personalities in virtual spaces, how their avatar looks, what it wears, and the rare items it owns are becoming part of their status and expression. The Rise of Crypto-Powered Economies Inside many metaverse platforms, everything runs on cryptocurrency. From land to wearables, each asset is tied to a token-based system. That’s where new meme coins like Dawgz AI come into play - they’re not just hype, they’re becoming part of a larger virtual economy. With users buying, selling, and trading items like digital clothes or gear, crypto sits at the center of the action. The Best Crypto to Buy Now for Metaverse Utility: Could it be Dawgz AI? As the metaverse grows, not every coin will survive the hype. The real winners will be the ones that offer utility, not just a trend. That’s why investors are starting to look beyond flashy NFT drops or short-term pumps, they’re paying attention to how a cryptocurrency fits into the bigger picture. Dawgz AI is one of the early projects positioning itself right at the intersection of metaverse culture and smart trading. Instead of building another virtual world, it’s helping users navigate and profit from existing ones. With AI tools that simplify trading and track metaverse-related assets, it’s giving everyday users a way to act early and smart, without needing to be full-time analysts. What Sets Dawgz AI Apart from all the Meme Coins Most meme coins blow up fast, then disappear just as quickly. They ride hype for a week, then it's game over. And as the metaverse keeps growing, with digital wearables, NFT gear, and virtual land becoming more valuable, having smart, automated tools might be the edge that matters most. AI Bots That Trade for YouDawgz AI uses Blackbox AI bots, built by ex-Wall Street pros to scan markets and react in real time. These bots can help spot trends early, especially in new spaces like metaverse collectibles and NFT fashion. While others scroll Twitter for tips, Dawgz AI users let the bots do the work. Memes Still MatterThe project doesn’t lose its playful side.

Top Factors to Look For in a Metaverse-Focused Crypto The metaverse is still new and not every crypto project claiming to be in it is worth your time. If you’re trying to figure out which ones will actually last and maybe even grow. Here are a few things to look for: 1. Real Utility, Not Just Buzzwords Does the project do something useful? Whether it’s powering in-game assets, enabling avatar upgrades or helping you trade metaverse tokens better, utility is what separates the serious projects from the short term hype. 2. Strong Community and Culture The metaverse is social by nature. Coins that encourage user engagement, creativity and sharing (like meme contests or community events) tend to stick around longer. 3. Tech That Supports the Trend Projects with tech around automation, AI or data, like Dawgz AI, are better positioned to help users navigate emerging spaces like NFT wearables or digital land markets. Look for tools that help users get in early and smart. 4. Fair Tokenomics and Transparent Plans Is the supply too concentrated? Are there real incentives to hold, stake or participate? A balanced token model with clear use cases is a good sign the project was built with long term thinking. 5. Security and Credibility Audits, clear documentation and known teams reduce risk. In a space that moves fast it’s important to know the foundations are solid. Final Thoughts: The Future Looks Dressed in Digital If the metaverse is where we're heading, then digital wearables, smart trading tools, and virtual assets are going to matter, a lot. The projects that thrive won't just be popular; they'll be useful. That’s why the best crypto to buy now might be one you haven’t fully looked into yet.

With recent progress in trade talks, traders and analysts are watching closely to see how Bitcoin reacts. Is this digital asset becoming more than just a hedge? Or is it stepping into a much bigger role. US-China Seal a Deal — Tariffs Slashed After months of rising tensions, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced on May 11 that the two countries have made “substantial progress” in trade talks. As part of the agreement, U.S. tariffs on most Chinese goods will drop from 145% to 30% for 90 days. In response, China will cut its tariff on American imports from 125% to just 10%. Both sides called it a big step forward after years of back-and-forth conflict. BREAKING: United States cuts tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% for 90 days. China lowers tariffs on US from 125% to 10% for 90 days. pic.twitter.com/FaRJfZA1hu — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) May 12, 2025 Meanwhile, Bessent said the talks were “productive,” while Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng, described it as “an important first step.” But in the middle of all this diplomacy, the crypto world was watching something else, how Bitcoin would respond. Is Bitcoin a Safe Haven? In April, when global markets were shaken by new tariffs, Bitcoin held firm. In fact, it bounced back from $75,000 to nearly $95,000, a 27% rise in less than a month, while major stock indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell. This led many to wonder if Bitcoin is now being treated like digital gold. While, some analysts had suggested that countries might be turning to Bitcoin to dodge tariffs, which could explain its resilience. However, popular crypto trader Daan Crypto believes the real test for Bitcoin starts now. As the trade tension between the U.S. and China has cooled off then something bigger is going on. Institutional Money Continue It’s Inflow Despite all the economic uncertainty and ongoing trade tensions, Bitcoin is showing strong signs of growth. On May 9, it recorded $401.2 million in inflows , while outflows were much lower at $79.8 million. Leading the inflow charge BlackRock led the inflows with $356.2 million, followed by Fidelity with $45 million. In just one week, Bitcoin ETFs saw $1 billion in total inflows, as Bitcoin climbed back to $105,783 , rising 12%.

In a letter filed on May 9 with a Manhattan federal court, the prosecution argued that it had disclosed all “known substantive communications” with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) concerning Samourai Wallet well ahead of trial proceedings. Prosecutors claimed the defense has had the information for months and that “nothing more is warranted,” opposing the defendants’ request for a hearing. Samourai Wallet Case Hinges on 2023 FinCEN Call The dispute centers on a conversation between prosecutors and FinCEN staff that took place in August 2023—six months before charges were filed. According to the defense, FinCEN officials had indicated in that discussion that Samourai likely would not be classified as a Money Services Business (MSB) under current regulations, potentially negating the requirement for a FinCEN license. Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill, who were arrested in April 2024, were charged with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business and money laundering. Both have pleaded not guilty and maintain they operated within legal boundaries. In response, prosecutors stated they acted in good faith by sharing details of the call, which involved FinCEN’s Kevin O’Connor and Lorena Valente. Samourai case update: The government doesn't think the prosecutors' conversations with FinCEN are a big deal. pic.twitter.com/GBsVqSo4Gk — Mallard Beakman ₿ (@Bill_Fowler_) May 9, 2025 They emphasized that the officials’ comments were informal and reflected personal opinions—not definitive regulatory positions. An internal email summarizing the call noted that Samourai Wallet’s lack of custody over user funds “would strongly suggest” it was not operating as an MSB. However, prosecutors highlighted that FinCEN staff “did not have a sense of what FinCEN would decide if this question were presented to their policy committee.” Defense attorneys have used the FinCEN conversation as part of their argument to dismiss the case. They claim it shows Rodriguez and Hill were not legally required to register as money transmitters. They also referenced an April 2024 memo from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, stating that the Justice Department would not prosecute crypto mixers for unintentional regulatory breaches. But prosecutors dismissed the memo’s relevance, writing that it “may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit” and should not influence the court’s decision on the case. Samourai Cofounders Facilitated Over $2B in Illicit Transactions U.S. prosecutors alleged that the duo facilitated over $2 billion in illicit transactions , including $100 million in money-laundering transactions tied to dark web markets. Both Hill and Rodriguez could face up to 25 years behind bars for the crimes, though the DOJ’s recent shift in crypto policy may alter their fate. The legal battle surrounding Samaourai cofounders comes amid an improving regulatory environment in the US. As reported, Paul Atkins has been sworn in as Chairman of the SEC , marking a leadership shift that is being welcomed by the digital asset industry. Under Atkins’ leadership, the SEC has already withdrawn or delayed several prominent cases against crypto firms.

In a post on the social media platform X, Ki Young Ju tells his 422,200 followers that despite Bitcoin’s inflation, Strategy is now gobbling up coins at a quicker rate than what miners can produce. CryptoQuant’s data appears to show that when excluding coins held by MSTR, the supply of BTC has been going down since late last year. “Bitcoin is deflationary. Strategy is buying BTC faster than it’s mined. Their 555,000 BTC is illiquid with no plans to sell. MSTR’s holdings alone mean a -2.23% annual deflation rate – likely higher with other stable institutional holders.” Source: CryptoQuant/X According to BitcoinTreasuries.net , Strategy has 555,450 BTC worth about $58 billion, representing 2.645% of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply. Ju recently backtracked on his previous call that the Bitcoin bull market was over. The CEO said that Bitcoin’s market structure is more complex now, with many different large players, making forecasting harder. According to the CryptoQuant CEO, selling pressure on BTC has eased in the face of “massive inflows” from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “In the past, the Bitcoin market was pretty simple. The main players were old whales, miners, and new retail investors, basically passing the bag to each other. When retail liquidity dried up and old whales started cashing out, it was relatively easy to predict the cycle peak. It was like a game of musical chairs – everyone tried to cash out at once, and those who didn’t ended up stuck with their holdings. But now, the Bitcoin market has become much more diverse. ETFs, MicroStrategy (MSTR), institutional investors, and even government agencies are considering buying and selling Bitcoin. In the past, profit-taking cycles were triggered when whales cashed out at the peak, leading to a chain reaction of sell-offs and a price drop.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $114,112.

ETH was trading at about $2,550 at publication time, with a market cap exceeding $308 billion. By comparison, Coca-Cola stock trades at around $70, giving it a market cap of $303.5 billion. Alibaba stock trades at about $125, with a market capitalization of $303.7 billion. ETH’s recent price action comes on the heels of a network upgrade that improved the storage of layer-2 scaling data, validator user experience and smart account wallet user experience features. Ether surpasses Coca-Cola and Alibaba in market capitalization. Source: 8marketcap Ethereum implements Pectra upgrade on mainnet Originally scheduled for March 2025, Pectra faced delays after technical challenges arose during testing. On Feb. 24, the upgrade was deployed on Ethereum’s Holesky testnet. Following the deployment, the upgrade failed to finalize on the network , leading the developers to investigate and address the issues. On March 5, Pectra was rolled out to the Sepolia testnet, but developers encountered errors made worse by an attacker who caused the mining of empty blocks . To further prepare for the deployment, Ethereum core developers created a new testnet called “Hoodi ” before finally deploying the upgrade to the mainnet on May 7 . With the upgrade, externally owned accounts (EOAs) can act as smart contracts to cover gas fees and payments using tokens that are not ETH. In addition, validator staking limits were increased to 2,048 ETH from 32 ETH, simplifying operations for large stakers. The upgrade also increased the number of data blobs per block, allowing better scalability for layer-2 networks. Since the upgrade, ETH’s price has escalated. On May 7, Ether traded at about $1,786, according to CoinGecko. On May 12, Ether went as high as $2,550, representing a 42% increase in value. Ether’s seven-day price chart.

Post upgrade, cybersecurity experts have warned that attackers could exploit a new transaction type to control EOAs without users signing onchain transactions. Solidity smart contract auditor Arda Usman previously cautioned in comments to Cointelegraph that these vulnerabilities may allow attackers to drain funds through offchain signed messages.

The proposed US crypto legislation for stablecoins would regulate even entities with offshore registrations. Tether, Inc. is registered in the British Virgin Islands, but may go under US jurisdiction. According to a new version of the Genius Stablecoin Act , which is still under review, the place of stablecoin issuance is irrelevant, and all assets will go under a new regime of regulation, coordinated with US financial authorities. Tether will go under US jurisdiction, adding state-specific protections. | Source: US Congress The bill will also offer variations of protection laws depending on the host state where a stablecoin is used. Stablecoin issuers may have different regulatory regimes based on their state of registration, while host states may choose either the general protection regime, or their own set of protections. The new bill differentiates stablecoins from securities and commodities, with plans to treat the assets as a tool for payments. Stablecoin issuers do not currently depend on a jurisdiction to issue the tokens, but use the asset’s origin as a way to circumvent some of the local payment regulations. Currently, stablecoins are gaining more detailed regulation, though for some countries, legacy assets still see no major changes or restrictions. Tether has shown readiness to issue US-compliant stablecoins Tether has already been scrutinized by the New York Attorney General, with a prolonged lawsuit that was settled right before the 2021 bull market. Now, Tether is one of the key players in crypto space, ready to cooperate with regulators. Recently, the token issuer added plans to launch a US-domiciled stablecoin. Additionally, Tether remains one of the large-scale buyers and holders of US debt. Previously, stablecoin issuers were met with local restrictions to issuing and selling assets. In the case of Ethena Labs, the German government banned the issuer from minting tokens through a locally-registered entity. There is no single standard on the jurisdiction of minting tokens and their distribution. However, the new US bill will have stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers, to be enforced in 18 months following the Bill’s launch. The Bill also allows a grace period for establishing stablecoin issuers as Comptroller-regulated entities, opening the door for pure crypto companies to receive banking licenses. Tether has already issued over 151.2B tokens, split mostly between Ethereum and TRON. Those tokens may be treated as legacy by the Genius stablecoin bill. USDT is widely used for centralized trading and by global payment networks. However, US-based listings may be threatened, unless Tether secures licenses based on the new bill’s requirements. In previous years, USDT has faced speculation of being wiped out by regulators. However, the stablecoin proved resilient and remains the key source of liquidity on multiple markets. USDT still trades with over $47B in daily volumes, with additional activity on decentralized markets. USDT added a total of $14B in the year to date, with most minted on the TRON chain. Upcoming regulation does not worry Tether, which also posts quarterly profits based on its bond holdings. Even with the bill enforcement, the company may have a long grace period, while retaining its lively international markets with no restrictions. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The conversation, highlighted by Anders in a post on X, delved into the unique role XRP plays within the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. Schwartz’s insights comprehensively explain why XRP maintains its crucial position in the blockchain space. David Schwartz answering a question about what he believes will drive the value of XRP in the next few years! From Apex 2024! If anyone questions why XRP!? … show them this! XRP has a PRIVILEGED position on XRPL. pic.twitter.com/LA01JihnoV — Anders (@X__Anderson) May 12, 2025 The Privileged Position of XRP on the XRPL According to Schwartz, the primary factor that will sustain XRP’s value in the future is its “privileged place” on the XRP Ledger . He emphasized that XRP’s unique attributes make it irreplaceable within the XRPL ecosystem, primarily due to its liquidity functionality and transactional utility. One of Schwartz’s standout points was that XRP is the only token on the XRPL that can be used to pay transaction fees. This inherent utility ensures that XRP remains central to the ledger’s functioning. One key distinction of XRP is that it can be received by any account on the XRPL, making it unique among tokens. This characteristic alone highlights the foundational role XRP plays in facilitating transactions on the network. Liquidity First: XRP’s Advantage in Cross-Border Payments Schwartz further elaborated on how XRP’s liquidity is prioritized on the ledger. When transactions occur, the payment engine and Pathfinding algorithm are designed to look for XRP liquidity first. This preference means that XRP liquidity is automatically bridged through the order book, giving it an upper hand over other digital assets. This preferential liquidity treatment positions XRP as a vital tool for cross-border payments. Given that liquidity is a significant factor in ensuring fast and cost-effective transactions, XRP’s prioritized role makes it a powerful asset within the financial sector, especially in scenarios requiring cross-border value transfer. XRP’s Role in Financial Institutions and Partnerships Schwartz’s remarks also underline XRP’s appeal to financial institutions. Due to its liquidity efficiency and unique positioning on the XRPL, financial entities looking to optimize cross-border payments find XRP particularly attractive. As Ripple continues to expand its partnerships with banks and payment providers, XRP’s integration into mainstream financial operations appears increasingly likely. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The privileged role that XRP enjoys also means that, regardless of how the digital asset market evolves, XRP will remain integral to the XRPL. This long-term assurance is essential for institutions planning to leverage blockchain technology for cross-border transactions. Why XRP Is Here to Stay As the blockchain space continues to develop, many digital assets will face challenges related to utility and adoption. However, XRP’s unique status on the XRPL sets it apart. XRP’s ongoing role in paying transaction fees and facilitating liquidity on the XRPL ensures its continued importance. David Schwartz’s explanation at Apex 2024 provides a clear vision of why XRP will maintain its essential role in the years to come. As Ripple and the XRP Ledger ecosystem expand, XRP’s strategic benefits will likely cement its position as a leading solution for cross-border payments. The Apex 2024 discussion highlights XRP’s unique advantages within the XRPL, reinforcing its privileged position. With Ripple’s ongoing efforts to forge partnerships and the continuous enhancement of the XRPL, XRP is poised to remain a central figure in blockchain finance.

What Makes Cardano Unique? He started by explaining what makes Cardano stand out, saying that it combines Bitcoin’s secure transaction system with Ethereum’s smart contracts. According to him, it is also flexible and powerful. With features like UTXO for security and Hydra for scalability, Cardano aims to be the go-to platform for Defi on Bitcoin. Amid market volatility caused by macro factors like the US-China tech rivalry and AI disruption, he shared how crypto could be a safe haven in such times. He believes that assets like Cardano, with solid governance and a deflationary model, are becoming more appealing. Can Cardano Make BTC, ETH Better? “I can solve big problems for the Bitcoin and XRP ecosystems and create mutual value. These are win-win relationships. It makes $BTC more valuable, $XRP more valuable, it makes Cardano better, and by extension, Midnight,” he said, as he explained the importance of building win-win relationships. Cardano, Bitcoin, and XRP could all benefit from working together, he said. He criticized Solana for relying on speed and memecoins, and said that Ethereum’s model is flawed, with value moving to faster, cheaper chains. Could Microsoft and Google Disrupt Blockchain? Hoskinson pointed out that if tech giants like Microsoft and Google get involved, they could shake up the blockchain world. He wrapped up by emphasizing how Cardano’s strong foundation, decentralized governance, and long-term vision sets it apart as a unique player in the blockchain space. In a recent X post , he shared how Cardano is shifting from a slow, research-heavy approach to a faster, multi-team model to speed up development. While there are some concerns over recent contact terminations that could cause delays, he is focused on speeding up progress, especially with Leios set for 2026.Cardano is currently trading at $0.8323, up over 5% in the last 24 hours.

This DeFi project’s structured tokenomics and lending model makes it better placed to outshine Ripple (XRP) that rose from $0.50 in May 2024 to $2.16 in May 2025, a 332% gain. At its $0.06 launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) guarantees a 140% return, projected to rise further to $3 in 2025, an 11,900% jump. Phase 4 which has now 70% of its capacity filled verges on the end with a 20% price increase for $0.03 registering in Phase 5. In the hope to book gains, investors are flooding in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Flinches Fever Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is lucratively engaging the crypto market with its fourth presale round currently in progress. Those who buy the tokens at $0.025 are presented with a brief opportunity to jump on them before the price will push to $0.03, a 20% gain. The tokenomics of the project promises a 140% return when listed at $0.06. Analysts further predict a $3 valuation in 2025, which represents an 11,900% ROI for investors entering early. A new dashboard launched recently has the top 50 holders and will reward them with bonus tokens for holding on their positions, which has been the ultimate competition. The team is in the final touches of a Certik audit of its smart contracts which will shortly be published on social media to boost the trust of investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Driven by Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) revolutionizes DeFi by offering a two-fold lending mechanism. Peer-to-Contract pools allow lenders to make dynamic interest, whereas peer-to-peer options would provide direct negotiation of niche assets. Overcollateralized loans provide stability by demanding borrowers to invest more than their loans’ worth. By using a buy-and-distribute mechanism, platform revenue is then used to buy back and distribute the MUTM tokens back to stakers that help create sustained demand. The first three phases sold out quickly while the quick depletion of Phase 4 indicates urgency. While investors view Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a calculated DeFi entry, not dependent on whims of the market, the project stands poised for exponential growth as the adoption numbers grow. Ripple (XRP) Faces Stiffer Competition Ripple (XRP) posted a 332% increase since $0.50 in May 2024 to $2.16 in May 2025 supported by institutional sentiment sizzle and ETF speculation. However, its growth looks pale compared to the project trajectory of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). XRP’s regulatory barriers and banking nature constrain its flexibility and Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s DeFi utility with a structured presale provides gospel to profit making opportunities. By capping potential percentage gains of XRP with a market cap at $125.76 billion, Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) low-cap status and huge 11,900% potential become appealing. Investors in search of outsized returns are shifting gears to MUTM’s presale in pursuit of working with its defined milestones. Outpacing Giants Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at an important point. Its position in Phase 4 entry point $0.025, with 70% already claimed, pushes one to act quickly, before the jump to $0.03 occurs into Phase 5. Dwarfing XRP’s annual 332 % gain, is its 140% on launch return & $3 target in 2025. The lending inventions and tokenomics of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) make a strong argument for investors. Don’t miss the opportunity to join before Phase 4 closes.

The agreement, delivered via a joint statement in Geneva, provides a 90-day window for both countries to negotiate further economic cooperation, according to Bloomberg . According to the deal, the U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on American goods from 125% to 10%. Global Markets, Crypto Surge on News The news sparked immediate reactions across global markets. The Hang Seng Index climbed 2.7%, while the Hang Seng Tech Index jumped 4.5%, reversing losses from the April 2 tariff escalation. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index also rose 0.3% as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro and yen. Bitcoin (BTC) surged to $105,322, gaining 1.62% over the past 24 hours and 11.35% over the past week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Ethereum (ETH) followed suit, rising 3.13% on the day to $2,560, up over 40% in the past seven days. Dogecoin (DOGE) led altcoin gains, climbing 6.29% daily and a staggering 42.5% weekly. The total crypto market capitalization is now $3.38 trillion, up 2% on the day, while market sentiment remains bullish with the Fear & Greed Index showing a score of 73 (Greed). Trending coins like MOODENG and GOAT also recorded gains of over 50% in the past 24 hours, indicating a risk-on environment. While the tariff reductions are temporary, market observers see this as a potential turning point in U.S.-China relations. BREAKING: The US and China have reached a trade agreement on a 90 day pause. The U.S. will cut tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% (from 145%) for 90 days, while China will lower its levies to 10% (from 125%) for 90 days, according to US Treasury Secretary Bessent. pic.twitter.com/5c7frxxNoW — Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) May 12, 2025 Washington and Beijing have been locked in a trade standoff since early April, when former President Donald Trump reinstated steep tariffs. This joint action marks the first significant move toward de-escalation. Despite optimism, Southbound investors were seen taking profits, with nearly HK$13 billion in outflows. Still, crypto traders appear undeterred, with volume across BTC and ETH topping $70 billion combined. If negotiations hold and a longer-term trade agreement follows, analysts expect further upside across both equities and digital assets. Trump Wants China to Stay Out of the Crypto Space Last week, Trump said that he sees crypto as a critical area in maintaining American dominance and preventing China from gaining control . “I’m a big fan of crypto because I want to keep it away from China,” Trump said on Sunday evening, addressing the issue while returning to the White House from Palm Beach, Florida. His comments come amid a rising tide of competition between the US and China, particularly in the fields of artificial intelligence, blockchain and other technological advancements.

Users were told they would be offered compensation if their phrases were found to be compromised. Zhao told his followers: “Never give up your private key recovery phrases no matter who is doing the asking. Social network accounts for a crypto company are often the weakest links.” Ledger has contained the damage As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier today, the hardware wallet provider confirmed that a moderator’s account on its Discord server was compromised but is now back in the firm’s control. The attacker had replicated the style and tone of a legitimate Ledger message, even listing steps to “secure” user wallets. Ledger’s internal team responded by disabling the affected moderator’s account, removing the malicious bot, and conducting a full audit of server permissions. They also flagged the phishing website in question to stop users who were still unaware from accessing it. Back in March, Ledger’s internal security unit, Donjon, revealed a vulnerability in competing wallet provider Trezor’s Safe series. According to Donjon, the issue stems from the microcontroller used in Trezor’s devices, which remains susceptible to physical attacks. State of phishing websites: Punycode attacks On Sunday, a separate incident reported by blockchain security firm SlowMist saw a crypto user lose more than $20,000 due to a phishing scam involving a fake version of the ChangeNOW exchange. The incident occurred while the victim used Google Chrome to access what they believed was the real site. The fake domain employed a tactic known as a Punycode attack, where malicious actors register domains that appear identical to legitimate ones by swapping letters with similar-looking characters from different alphabets. In this case, a Cyrillic ‘е’ replaced a Latin ‘e’, creating a site that was visually indistinguishable from the original ChangeNOW platform. Victims, upon visiting such domains, may be coaxed into entering login credentials, downloading malware, or, in crypto-related scams, providing wallet seed phrases. Once this data is acquired, attackers gain complete control over user funds. In 2017, PayPal users were targeted via a fake Punycode domain that impersonated the official site, stealing user credentials and siphoning funds. The hackers sent several emails to users, with one claiming that Bitcoin had been sent to their accounts from an exchange, as seen in a post on the subreddit r/CryptoCurrency . “This email actually originated from PayPal. It passed through PayPal’s mail transfer agent (MTA) systems and, as such, was allowed in by Google’s MTA systems. Not good,” said the PayPal account holder who discovered the scam. Between 2016 and 2018, Punycode domains were cited in a 25% increase in phishing incidents, according to a cybersecurity study. Most users are unaware of Punycode encoding and cannot easily detect these fake URLs, especially when the rest of the webpage is awfully similar to the official one in design and language.

Pi Network tops the leaderboard of gainers with over 56% gains in the past 24 hours, with a 100% jump in the past couple of days. The price continues to maintain a steep upswing and marks highs above $1.67 in the early trading hours, which suggests a new ATH could be on the horizon. The PI price has been consistently rising after rising from the horizontal consolidation around $0.55, which attracted massive liquidity onto the token. Just before the weekly close, the token initiated a strong upswing, which attracted over 100% gains after surpassing the threshold below $0.8. The current trade setup suggests the PI price is expected to attract more gains, which could push the token up by another 100% in the next few days. But the question arises whether the Pi price can sustain above the gains or face another bearish pullback below $1. The daily chart of Pi price suggests the bulls have broken out and are aiming to reclaim the lost levels above $1.7, which could clear the path towards $2. Meanwhile, the technicians point towards a short-term correction as the RSI has entered the overbought range for the first time since its inception. Moreover, the CMF, which was surging, has displayed a bearish divergence, indicating a halt in the money flow onto the platform. The drop in buying pressure could hinder the progress of the rally, preventing it from surpassing the resistance zone between $1.71 and $1.77, which is the final threshold before the highs. As the RSI has reached 87.83, which indicates a possibility of a pullback after it surges above 90. Therefore, it suggests the Pi price could eventually enter the price range or may even reach $1.8. The token may consolidate for a while around the range and rise above $2. Once the Pi price secures above this range, a new ATH above $3 could follow in the next couple of days. The price may rise to as high as $3.8 and if the bulls hold the Pi Network price rally above the range, the bull run may extend to $5 or even higher.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-12 09:37:16

What’s more, over $900 million in SOL is still locked in staking under the same address. Now, people are wondering, was this simply a routine move, or could it have a bigger impact on Solana’s price? Alameda Research Unstakes $32M in Solana According to Solscan data , Alameda’s staking address, which has been tied to the ongoing FTX bankruptcy process, unstaked 187,600 SOL on May 12 at 01:53 UTC+8. At current market value, this is worth about $32.79 million. So far, there have been no further transfers from the address, and the tokens remain idle. However, given Alameda’s history and its large holdings, market participants are on edge. Despite this unstaking, the same address still holds a massive 5.204 million SOL, worth roughly $910 million, which remains staked. This suggests that while the latest move may seem big, it’s still a small portion of the total holdings. Will this Impact Solana’s Price Whenever a large amount of crypto is unstaked, it opens the door for a potential sell-off, which often leads to short-term price dips. However, it’s important to note that no tokens have been moved or sold yet. If Alameda decides to liquidate part of the unstaked SOL, it could trigger temporary pressure on Solana’s price.

The US has reduced Chinese tariffs to 30%, while China has cut its tariffs on the US to 10%. Bitcoin (BTC) is responding well to the news and is at $104,500 early on Monday. US and China agree a quick-fire initial trade deal Following on from the trade battle in which the US applied 145% tariffs on China, and in which the Chinese government responded by imposing 125% tariffs on the US, the conciliatory language coming out of the two-day US/China trade talks in Geneva was in marked contrast. At the end of the talks on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and US trade representative Jamieson Greer reported “substantial progress” had been made. Bessent said that the talks had been “productive and constructive”, and that he wanted to see fair trade between the two countries. Greer added that an agreement was arrived at very quickly, and that it would help to address the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit. 90-day pause on tariffs More details are already emerging on Monday morning with reports that the tariff cuts will be for a 90-day pause. This comes into effect on 14 May, and a continuation, or lifting, of the pause would presumably only happen if the subsequent trade talks are successful. $BTC briefly hits top of ascending channel Source: TradingView Bitcoin (BTC) has been quite sensitive as more details on the trade agreement are emerging this morning. Initially, $BTC surged upward, hitting $105,700, and looked to all intents and purposes as though it would continue the surge up to the $109,000 all-time high. However, when the 90-day pause news came out, this deflated the price back down to just above $104,000 again. As can be seen in the 4-hour chart above, the current price action is in an ascending channel. The price may eventually be buoyed up if the $104,250 resistance can be flipped into support. That said, not one 4-hour candle body has been able to close above this resistance level so far. The Stochastic RSI on this short-term time frame has the indicators at the bottom. The 8-hour is also working its way down. These could signal upside price momentum when the bulls need it, and this could be when the US stock market opens later today. $BTC closes below last major horizontal resistance Source: TradingView Zooming all the way out into the 2-week time frame, it can be seen that the candle body for the last 2-week period closed slightly under the $104,400 resistance. While this wasn’t a perfect state of affairs for the bulls, as long as the current candle is able to hold above and head higher from here, all should be well. The Stochastic RSI is showing a strong cross-up in the indicators, while the Relative Strength Index at the bottom of the chart is also displaying a cross-up. It will be interesting to see how the traditional market reacts to the US/China trade news, and whether this will spike stocks higher. If so, expect the crypto market to follow suit.

This time, the attackers took over the admin account of Ledger’s official Discord server to spread a dangerous message. According to CZ, the compromised Ledger Discord admin account was used to impersonate official staff. The scammer claimed that a major vulnerability had been discovered in Ledger wallets, putting users’ sensitive information at risk—including their secret recovery phrases. Notably, the victims were directed to a fraudulent website where they were asked to re-enter their recovery phrases to “secure” their wallets. In reality, handing over this phrase gives full control of the wallet to the attacker, putting all funds at immediate risk. How to be Safe? In times of crisis, CZ reminded users of a golden rule in crypto: never share your seed or recovery phrase, no matter who asks or how urgent the message seems. Even if it looks official, it’s likely a scam. He stressed that social media and communication accounts remain the most vulnerable links in security chains, often becoming the easiest entry points for attackers. Ledger’s Response Ledger has responded to CZ’s warning , clarifying that their Discord server itself wasn’t hacked. Instead, a contractor moderator’s account was briefly compromised, allowing a fake message with a scam link to be posted in one channel.

On one hand, you hear predictions of widespread job losses as bots take over everything. On the other, there’s the more optimistic view that technology will eliminate tedious tasks and create entirely new opportunities for humans. For those navigating the fast-paced world of technology and even cryptocurrency, understanding this shift is crucial. The Shifting Landscape of AI and Jobs Historically, technological advancements have often led to job displacement in certain sectors but simultaneously fueled the creation of new roles. The World Economic Forum echoes this, predicting that while millions of roles may be displaced by current trends, even more new jobs could emerge. But what does this mean for individuals, particularly those in roles traditionally considered ‘unskilled,’ like warehouse workers? How do they fit into this evolving picture driven by advanced Robot Automation ? This is where companies like Amazon offer a glimpse. They are at the forefront of integrating automation into their operations, providing real-world examples of this transition. The introduction of sophisticated systems changes the nature of work within their facilities. Amazon Warehouse Robots: More Than Just Lifting Amazon recently provided insights into their progress in integrating robots into their warehouses. A key development is the new Vulcan robot, designed to handle physically demanding tasks. According to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Vulcan is intended to improve safety by taking over ergonomically challenging work, such as reaching high shelves or bending low. This doesn’t mean humans are out of the picture entirely, at least not yet. Amazon describes Vulcan working alongside employees. The robot might retrieve items from the top and bottom shelves, leaving humans to handle items in the middle or those the robot cannot yet manage. This model suggests a collaboration, where robots augment human capabilities rather than completely replacing them. Preparing the Workforce for the Future of Work Beyond the immediate task sharing, Amazon highlights another critical aspect: the creation of new job categories. The company states that robots, which are involved in fulfilling a significant percentage of customer orders, have already led to hundreds of new types of roles. These range from robotic floor monitors to onsite reliability maintenance engineers. This points towards a significant shift in the required skillset for warehouse employees. Recognizing this, Amazon also mentioned its Workforce Retraining program. This initiative aims to equip existing workers with the skills needed to transition into these new technology-focused roles, such as maintaining and operating the robots. This is a crucial component of adapting to increased Robot Automation . While this retraining is a positive step, it’s important to be realistic. Converting the entire workforce to robot technicians isn’t a simple one-to-one replacement. Not everyone will have the interest or aptitude for these technical roles. The scale of human oversight needed for robots is also different from the number of people required for manual tasks. What Does This Mean for Jobs Beyond the Warehouse? Amazon’s approach offers a potential blueprint for how other industries might adapt. Could we see ‘automation monitors’ in retail, overseeing self-checkout systems? Or workers supervising automated cooking systems in fast food? The idea is that running and maintaining automation becomes a fundamental skill, much like using a computer is today, essential for navigating the Future of Work . However, it’s also possible that widespread, full Robot Automation might not materialize as quickly or broadly as some predict. High-level automation might remain concentrated in large corporations or specific industries like automotive manufacturing for years or decades to come. Examples like Amazon’s own ‘Just Walk Out’ technology, which faced challenges and reliance on human oversight, demonstrate that the path to full automation isn’t always straightforward or immediately scalable across all sectors. Conclusion: Navigating the Automated Horizon Amazon’s developments with Amazon Warehouse Robots like Vulcan illustrate a tangible path forward in the age of AI and automation. While some roles may change or diminish, the introduction of sophisticated robots is simultaneously creating demand for new skills and job categories, particularly in maintenance and oversight. The emphasis on Workforce Retraining is a key element in ensuring that the human workforce can adapt to this evolving technological landscape and secure their place in the Future of Work .

What Do Analysts Think? Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-bitcoin-break-all-time-highs-what-do-analysts-think-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin (BTC) extended its rally late Sunday, trading just below $104,000, buoyed by macroeconomic optimism and rising institutional demand. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is currently within striking distance of a new all-time high, with analysts calling a new record high plausible in the short term. Bitcoin traded at $103,926, down a marginal 0.12% over the past 24 hours, after briefly climbing above $105,000 earlier in the day. The cryptocurrency is currently only 4.5% below its previous all-time high of $108,786, reached in January. “Bitcoin is trading near all-time highs, supported by strong technical momentum that has it trading above its 50- and 200-day moving averages,” said Vincent Liu, CIO at Kronos Research. “Rising institutional adoption and a positive 2025 outlook point to a plausible path to another ATH,” he said. Despite the rally, some signs of caution have emerged, with analysts noting that Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered overbought territory, which is often a precursor to price corrections. “This doesn’t necessarily signal a sudden reversal, but it does raise the possibility of a short-term cooling or sideways movement,” said Rachael Lucas, analyst at BTC Markets. “A retest and consolidation above the key psychological level of $100,000 would be a healthy development and could provide a foundation for further upside.” Bitcoin’s ongoing rally in price has been largely attributed to renewed US-China trade optimism. Diplomatic talks in Switzerland on Sunday concluded with both sides claiming to have reached a significant compromise, according to Reuters. Today, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are expected to announce significant progress in negotiations. “The recent rally in the crypto market was driven by renewed optimism regarding the US-China trade talks. As Bitcoin dominance reaches levels last seen before the 2021 bull market, we are seeing a classic rotation as capital starts to flow into altcoins,” said Min Jung, analyst at Presto Research. In addition to macro factors, sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and continued institutional treasury accumulation are helping sustain the upward momentum. “Corporate treasuries like Strategy continue to accumulate BTC, strengthening institutional sentiment,” said Kronos’ Liu. “As macro events like the US CPI release on May 13th approach, investors should remain vigilant, manage risk wisely, and maintain diversified strategies to navigate this high-volatility environment.” With a plethora of tailwinds, from favorable technical indicators to improving geopolitical sentiment, many investors believe that a new all-time high for Bitcoin could soon be on the horizon. However, experts warn that volatility is the only constant in this market. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will Bitcoin Break All-Time Highs? What Do Analysts Think?

Recent reports indicate that the foundational Microsoft OpenAI Partnership could be undergoing significant changes, sparking intense negotiations that may redefine the future of AI development and investment. What’s Driving the AI Partnership Negotiation? According to sources cited by the Financial Times, OpenAI, the artificial intelligence startup that has captivated global attention, is currently engaged in a “tough negotiation” with its primary investor and partner, Microsoft. This comes at a pivotal time as OpenAI is navigating significant internal shifts, specifically concerning its corporate structure. The core of this negotiation appears to be multifaceted, driven by both strategic vision and financial stakes. Microsoft has poured a substantial Microsoft OpenAI Investment , totaling around $13 billion to date. This deep financial commitment grants Microsoft significant influence and a vested interest in OpenAI’s trajectory and profitability. Understanding OpenAI’s Restructuring Plans A key element complicating the current discussions is OpenAI’s recently announced intention to restructure. While the company aims to transform its business operations into a for-profit public benefit corporation, it intends for its nonprofit board to retain ultimate control. This proposed structure is a departure from typical corporate models and requires approval from key stakeholders, including Microsoft, which the FT’s sources describe as a significant holdout in the approval process. Here’s a breakdown of the reported dynamics: Equity Disagreements: A central point of contention is the amount of equity Microsoft will hold in the newly structured for-profit entity. Given Microsoft’s substantial investment, the valuation and distribution of ownership are critical and complex topics. Future Technology Access: Beyond immediate equity, the companies are reportedly renegotiating their broader contractual terms. Microsoft is reportedly offering to potentially reduce its requested OpenAI Equity Stake in exchange for guaranteed access to OpenAI’s groundbreaking technology developed beyond the current 2030 cutoff date specified in their existing agreement. This highlights the long-term strategic value Microsoft places on future AI advancements. Increasing Competition: The relationship, while collaborative, has also become increasingly competitive. As OpenAI’s enterprise solutions gain traction and directly compete in certain markets, and as OpenAI pursues ambitious projects like the ‘Stargate’ infrastructure initiative, the lines between partner and competitor are becoming blurred. This growing rivalry adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing AI Partnership Negotiation . Why Does This Microsoft OpenAI Partnership Negotiation Matter? The outcome of these negotiations has significant implications not just for the two companies involved, but for the broader AI ecosystem and potentially for related tech sectors.

The stock did not move much. Referencing my previous Coinbase coverage, I explain why I expected this miss and how I can see Coinbase achieving much higher than expected EPS later this year. Key drivers are; an ongoing Bitcoin bull market, strong service revenue growth, and a slight re-rating of their valuation. Coinbase is a Buy. Introduction Shares of cryptocurrency trading & service provider Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) dropped by 44% from the beginning of 2025 to their interim low on April 7. Since my first Coinbase coverage on April 10, the stock is up 16%. I am now revisiting COIN because they released their Q1 2025 earnings. The development of some key figures were essential to my previous investment thesis. I recommend reading my first article on Coinbase before this one, to thoroughly understand where I'm coming from. To briefly summarize my points made, though, I outlined that analysts' EPS estimates are going to be way off in 2025. I noted the following: Specifically, I believe Q1 will yield much lower EPS than anticipated due to significant losses in COIN's cryptocurrency holdings and lower transaction volume, both due to a sharp decline in the crypto market. Conversely, EPS will be much higher than anticipated in Q2 and Q4, possibly even in Q3. This leads me to the conclusion that Coinbase was a Strong Buy. The proposed upside potential stems from achieving higher than expected earnings in these two quarters. Additionally, I believe that due to the current recovery in digital asset prices, a rebound of Coinbase is indispensable. Since their IPO in 2021, their performance has been very closely tied to that of Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The gap between the two charts is now larger than ever. I am hereby reiterating my thesis to go long on Coinbase. Data by YCharts Q1 2025 Results As mentioned above, Coinbase reported their Q1 2025 earnings on May 8 by providing investors with a Shareholder Letter . Here's a quick overview of some important developments: Transaction revenue is up 17% YoY, reaching $1.26 billion, and down 19% QoQ, just like the price of Bitcoin. Service revenue reached $2.49 billion TTM (9% QoQ and 37% YoY growth), portraying resilience against Bitcoin corrections. In a $2.9 billion deal ($700 million cash, 11 million COIN shares), Coinbase aims to acquire Sentillia B.V. (Deribit), a leading crypto options exchange with more than $30 billion in open interest and over $1 trillion in trading volume in 2024. Most importantly, however, they did miss EPS estimates of $1.26 and only reported $0.24. This represents a miss of 87%. Revenue fell slightly short of expectations as well, reaching $2.03 billion instead of the anticipated $2.07 billion, which is only a 1.8% miss and less significant. This miss matches perfectly my aforementioned thesis. Despite this prediction, I also thought that Coinbase would drop after missing earnings, but the market seems to have priced this in already since it barely reacted. Q1 '2 5 Shareholder Letter Q1 '2 5 Shareholder Letter I have to mention again how much I love COIN's financial health. Looking at their balance sheet, it becomes clear that they could almost cover ALL liabilities with only their cash and USDC (essentially cash as well) holdings. Cash is going to decrease by $700 million after the planned acquisition of Deribit, but I just believe this goes to show that Coinbase knows when and how to put capital into place to grow their operations. Unlike many other crypto companies, these amounts of cash also make COIN much less likely to dilute shareholders. Q1 '2 5 Shareholder Letter Further Outlook A continued Bitcoin bull market seems inevitable due to the sheer amount of strength we've seen recently. Bitcoin ripped through the resistance at $93.5k and secured it as a new support level. It is now facing a double resistance, at $104.5k and at $106.3k. I believe it is only a matter of time until Bitcoin moves beyond these and reaches new ATHs. In the very near-term, however, we might see a slight correction, due to RSI sitting at 75, which is in the overbought region. TradingView Coinbase will profit greatly from fresh ATHs. First, their digital asset holdings would appreciate to new highs themselves, contributing directly to net income. Second, their transaction volume and thereby revenue grows quickly due to more interest among retail investors. Third, with more euphoria around crypto and Coinbase as a business, investors might bid the stock up higher, making it trade at higher valuations. Valuation From a plain perspective, COIN's P/S ratio seems high, trailing at 7.7X. Keeping in mind that Coinbase are able to achieve net profit margins of up to 40% (last year) and are able to grow revenues quickly in crypto bull markets, it seems less extended. Their P/E currently seems high as well, because of low net income they just reported, which, on a TTM basis, replaced stellar Q1 2024 EPS. Data by YCharts When comparing performance against Robinhood (HOOD), who have become much more engaged in crypto, it is clear that since 2022, both stocks have been closely correlated. Since 2025, Robinhood has decoupled from Coinbase. Data by YCharts This is largely due to the fact that HOOD appreciated in valuation multiples. On a forward EV/EBITDA basis, Coinbase was mostly trading more expensively than Robinhood. This precisely changed at the beginning of 2025, where COIN now trades at a forward EV/EBITDA of 14.4X and HOOD at 25.3X. I'm arguing that both their valuations will eventually draw closer together again, which will help reduce their gap and thus cause appreciation of COIN stock. Data by YCharts Technically, Coinbase is facing a relatively strong resistance - a descending trend line initiated at their 2024 high. They recently got rejected by the set trend line, but a new attempt may be due soon. Their weekly RSI is at 45, which is far from overbought and leaves room for further short-term price increases. Once this resistance is overcome, I can see Coinbase rise well into the $300s. TradingView Risks The main risks I currently see for Coinbase are the following: A market correction: If markets correct further or even a recession takes place, Coinbase would be hit heavily since it depends on market euphoria and speculation in digital assets to drive sales. Their high valuation: They're premium-priced, which leaves them much less room for failure. Growing but not growing quickly enough could be one such issue. In that case, the stock would get re-rated, trading downwards. Conclusion After revisiting Coinbase, I am as convicted of my previous thesis as before. As seen with the Q1 EPS miss, it seems to be working out so far. The much more important part is now the anticipated Q2 and Q4 EPS beats. With crypto prices recovering, I currently don't see any risks towards my thesis other than the ones mentioned. Despite that, I am still downgrading my Coinbase rating from Strong Buy to Buy due to a higher valuation than in my last coverage. I am reiterating my price target of $333.",COIN,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-12 09:51:27

The latest purchase brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 6,796 BTC, currently valued at over $706 million, according to a disclosure filed Monday . The aggressive accumulation puts Metaplanet ahead of El Salvador’s state-owned Bitcoin treasury, which holds 6,174 BTC, according to data from the nation’s Bitcoin Office. Metaplanet Makes Biggest Bitcoin Buy Yet at $102K per BTC The company said the acquisition was made at an average price of $102,119 per BTC, representing its largest single purchase since launching its Bitcoin Treasury Operations in April 2024. Metaplanet uses a proprietary metric known as BTC Yield to evaluate the performance of its Bitcoin strategy in relation to shareholder value. For Q2 2025 to date, the firm reported a BTC Yield of 38%, following 95.6% in Q1 and 309.8% in Q4 2024. The firm aims to grow its holdings to 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, echoing the strategy of Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which currently holds more than 555,000 BTC globally. With this latest purchase, Metaplanet remains the largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder in Asia and ranks 11th worldwide. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,241 $BTC * pic.twitter.com/zrJYzaZJq6 — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) May 12, 2025 Metaplanet’s move comes amid rising institutional interest in digital assets from Japanese firms. Beat Holdings, another Tokyo-listed company, announced last week that it would increase its exposure to Bitcoin-related exchange-traded funds. Beat raised its investment cap from $6.8 million to $34 million and disclosed that it had purchased over 131,000 units of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), yielding an unrealized gain of more than $681,000. To fund its ETF purchases, Beat drew approximately $2.8 million from a revolving credit line, with expected interest charges of $150,000 through the end of the year. Strategy, a major corporate Bitcoin holder in the U.S., also added to its stash last week, purchasing 1,895 BTC worth $180 million. The company now holds over $52 billion in Bitcoin, reinforcing its commitment to using BTC as a treasury reserve asset. Public Companies Show Continued Interest in Bitcoin Just recently, Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, announced it is doubling its capital raising plan to $84 billion in an aggressive push to acquire more Bitcoin. The Virginia-based company announced last week that it has filed to sell an additional $21 billion in common shares after depleting a previous program of the same size authorized in October. It also doubled its debt issuance target from $21 billion to $42 billion, leaving $14.6 billion remaining under its current authorization. In the first quarter of the year, publicly traded companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1%, signaling continued institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency despite market volatility. However, despite public companies’ interest in the leading cryptocurrency, the US government has shown a lack of interest in purchasing Bitcoin. The United States is unlikely to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings , said BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, citing the country’s ballooning national debt and the cultural image tied to Bitcoin investors.

The Ethereum (ETH) price drop has continued below $1,800, while the latest Dogecoin (DOGE) price analysis points to declining interest and a weak market outlook. These legacy coins face challenges. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining traction with strong fundamentals and technical progress. BlockDAG is now backed by two major audits from CertiK and Halborn, has raised $237 million, and sold more than 20.1 billion coins. Its current $0.0019 offer stands far below the paused batch price of $0.0262, making it a limited-time entry before listings go live. With 170,000+ holders and 2,532% ROI opportunity, it stands out among the top crypto coins 2025 . Ethereum (ETH) Price Drop Continues as Momentum Weakens The Ethereum (ETH) price drop has extended further, with ETH unable to maintain levels above $1,850 or $1,820, and now trading below $1,800 and the 100-hour Simple Moving Average. A descending resistance near $1,830 is limiting upward movement. The drop intensified after ETH failed to push past $1,880, with current support at $1,785. A break below this level could trigger further decline toward $1,750 or even $1,685. Upside resistance sits at $1,830, followed by $1,880 and $1,920 if a bounce occurs. However, as long as ETH remains under $1,830, continued pressure is likely. Both bulls and bears are monitoring the $1,785 zone for signs of direction. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Highlights Market Caution Recent Dogecoin (DOGE) price analysis shows the coin losing momentum again in May 2025. DOGE remains far from the $1 target that once defined its hype. Although optimism returned after Donald Trump’s 2024 election win, the coin has since declined by 47.73% year-to-date. This downturn has shaken investor trust. Analysts now point to a funding rate of -0.001%, indicating short bias among traders. This negative funding rate implies sellers are paying to hold short positions, a signal that bearish sentiment dominates. Unless there’s a strong reversal, DOGE may continue to face resistance. Once at the center of crypto’s meme wave, it now stands at a crossroads with no clear rebound in sight. BlockDAG Delivers CertiK & Halborn Audits, High ROI, & Final $0.0019 Entry BlockDAG has completed audits from CertiK and Halborn, two of the most respected blockchain security firms. These reviews go beyond routine checks, confirming the platform is well-built, secure, and optimized for performance. As a result, BlockDAG is moving into the final phase before exchange listings begin. CertiK’s verification confirms the smart contracts are safe and efficient, giving buyers more trust in the project. BlockDAG is positioning itself beyond presale hype, aiming for practical adoption in real use cases. The project has raised $237 million and sold over 20.1 billion BDAG coins. It now has more than 170,000 individual holders and has delivered a 2,520% gain from its starting price of $0.001 to the current paused batch 28 price of $0.0262. Crucially, the $0.0262 rate is paused. For now, until May 13, BlockDAG is available at just $0.0019, offering a 2,532% ROI potential from this price to its confirmed launch target of $0.05. For those evaluating the top crypto coins 2025 , BlockDAG’s audit certifications, user metrics, and discount window suggest a strong opportunity just before listing. Identifying the Top Crypto Coins 2025 The Ethereum (ETH) price drop and Dogecoin (DOGE) price analysis show a slowdown in two well-known tokens. ETH is losing support levels, and DOGE is seeing reduced demand and rising bearish pressure. BlockDAG is heading in a different direction. With full audits from Halborn and CertiK, more than 170,000 unique holders, and a time-sensitive $0.0019 offer still live, it’s separating from the crowd. Add to that a 2,532% ROI from presale price to projected launch price and $237 million already raised, and it’s easy to see why analysts consider BlockDAG among the most promising top crypto coins 2025 .

44518442,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159359,1747044052,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking: Trump Fires Copyright Head Amid AI Training and Elon Musk Controversy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-fires-copyright-head/,"In a move that sent ripples through the tech and legal worlds, former President Donald Trump reportedly fired Shira Perlmutter, the head of the U.S. Copyright Office, along with Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. This unexpected decision comes amidst growing debate surrounding the use of copyrighted material to train Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) models, a topic central to a recent report from the very office Perlmutter led. What Prompted the Copyright Office Firings? Reports from outlets like CBS News and Politico, seemingly corroborated by Democratic Representative Joe Morelle, suggest the firings were swift and lacked clear legal basis. Morelle, the ranking member on the Committee for House Administration, didn’t mince words, calling it a “brazen, unprecedented power grab.” He also suggested the timing was no coincidence, linking the termination directly to Perlmutter’s alleged refusal to “rubber-stamp Elon Musk ’s efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works” for AI training. Perlmutter, who took the helm in 2020 during Trump’s first term, was appointed by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, who was also reportedly fired this week. Trump himself alluded to the news on Truth Social, his social network, by sharing a post from attorney Mike Davis. While Davis’s post linked to the CBS story, his accompanying text, “Now tech bros are going to attempt to steal creators’ copyrights for AI profits,” added a layer of confusion, seemingly criticizing the outcome despite the apparent alliance between Trump and Musk. The Copyright Office Report and AI Training Central to the controversy is a recent report from the U.S. Copyright Office focusing on Copyright and Artificial Intelligence. This document, part three of a larger series, addresses the complex legal questions raised by AI ‘s reliance on vast datasets, often containing copyrighted works. While the report acknowledges that the outcome of individual legal cases cannot be predetermined, it sets important boundaries regarding when AI companies can rely on “ fair use ” as a defense when training their models on copyrighted content. Here’s a breakdown of key points from the report: Research and Analysis: The report suggests that using copyrighted material for research and analysis purposes in AI training would likely fall within the bounds of fair use . Commercial Use & Competition: However, the report states that using “vast troves of copyrighted works” for commercial purposes, especially when the resulting AI -generated content competes with the original works in existing markets, likely “goes beyond established fair use boundaries.” This is particularly true if access to the copyrighted material was obtained illegally. Despite these points, the Copyright Office report stopped short of recommending immediate government intervention or new legislation, stating it “would be premature at this time.” Instead, it expressed hope that “licensing markets” would continue to develop, allowing AI companies to pay copyright holders for access to training data. It also suggested considering “alternative approaches such as extended collective licensing” to address potential market failures. Elon Musk, AI, and Copyright: What’s the Connection? The report’s stance on fair use and licensing directly impacts AI companies, many of which currently face lawsuits accusing them of copyright infringement. OpenAI, a leading AI research company, is one such entity. Interestingly, Elon Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI (though he later left) and now leads a competing AI startup, xAI (which is merging with X, formerly Twitter). Musk has also publicly aligned himself with controversial views on intellectual property, recently supporting Square founder Jack Dorsey’s call to “delete all IP law.” This position starkly contrasts with the concerns of creators and copyright holders who rely on IP law to protect their work and livelihoods. The alleged link between Perlmutter’s firing, the Copyright Office report, and Elon Musk highlights the intense political and economic pressures surrounding the future of AI development and intellectual property rights. The firings, particularly given the timing just after the report’s release, raise significant questions about the independence of government agencies and the influence of powerful tech figures. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Copyright? The situation underscores the deep divide between those who believe AI development requires broad access to data, potentially with relaxed copyright restrictions, and those who advocate for strong protections for creators and their content. The U.S. Copyright Office report attempted to navigate this complex landscape by outlining existing legal interpretations like fair use while encouraging market-based solutions like licensing. However, the reported intervention from the highest levels of government, allegedly influenced by figures like Elon Musk , suggests that the debate is far from settled. The firings could signal an attempt to steer copyright policy in a direction more favorable to large-scale AI training, potentially at the expense of individual creators and traditional copyright principles. This event serves as a stark reminder that the legal and regulatory frameworks governing AI are still under construction and are subject to significant political influence. The outcome of this struggle will have profound implications for the creative industries, the tech sector, and the development of AI itself.

The digital currency broke through $104,000 by May 12. Traditional markets such as the S&P 500 were in the red simultaneously. Based on market data, Bitcoin’s resilience has stood out in the face of sell-offs and tariff negotiations. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Bitcoin Outpaces Stocks According to reports, the S&P 500 declined almost 1% during April, but Bitcoin rose. Other financial markets experienced losses during the same weeks. Bitcoin’s increase was made while traders considered concerns over escalating tariffs. The world’s most sought-after crypto asset was seen by some as a means to avoid fees on foreign trade. However, there is no evidence that any country utilized crypto to avoid tariffs. Settlements Via Bitcoin Based on examination by crypto expert Daan Crypto Trades, there was speculation that countries could bring trade settlements to Bitcoin. The concept gained traction since BTC stood firm even when supply chains and markets were in trouble. $BTC Has outperformed stocks since “Liberation” / Tariff Day on the 2nd of April. It held up incredibly strong during a sharp sell off on stocks in April. It then also proceeded to outperform as the markets bounced and tariffs were implemented.

Regulators would catch any large cross-border payments made in crypto. There has not been a reported case of governments turning to Bitcoin in order to sidestep duties. Testing Key Resistance Levels According to chart analysis by Rose Premium Signals, Bitcoin is currently testing a crucial barrier at $105,000. If BTC breaks down there, it might retreat into the $100,000 zone. Some pattern observers claim an Inverse Head & Shoulders configuration could develop. 💰 $BTC Market Update#Bitcoin is currently testing the Weekly Supply Zone around $105,000 👀 🧠 The most likely scenario is a rejection from this level, leading to the formation of an Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern — a setup that could create space for a mini #altseason 📈… pic.twitter.com/aLSPi5qhuq — Rose Premium Signals 🌹 (@VipRoseTr) May 11, 2025 That pattern requires two distinct shoulders and a lower trough in the middle. Currently, the swings have been unbalanced, muddying the image. A rejection might be followed by a brief period of altcoin accumulation before Bitcoin takes off again where it left off.

Analyst Believes This Cycle Is Unique Long-Term Outlook Stable As per market observers, most investors will be looking to purchase dips if Bitcoin breaks resistance. They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin’s extensive runs persist for several months, not days. Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US–China trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin’s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

The meme coin has been on an ongoing rally since mid-May with a spike in futures open interest. According to data on crypto.news, the Solana ( SOL )-based token featuring the viral Thai pygmy hippo Moo Deng ( MOODENG ) has soared as high as $0.28 in the past 24 hours. At press time, the token has gone up by 114.3% in the past day. The meme coin is currently trading hands at a price of $0.267. However, it is still around 60% shy of its previous all-time high In the past few days, the token has skyrocketed to new heights previously seen earlier in January. So far, Moo Deng crypto has jumped over 576% in the past week and nearly 970% in the past month. Price chart for Moo Deng crypto shows a significant surge after its Binance Alpha listing, May 12, 2025 | Source: CoinGecko Read more: MOODENG rallies over 130% as open interest soars and exchange balances drop Moo Deng has also seen a massive surge in trader activity following its recent rally. Compared to the previous trading day, Moo Deng’s trading volume has increased by 416.3%. This indicates a renewed interest in the token among traders. In addition, the ongoing surge also coincides with a nearly 120% spike in the token futures open interest, hitting $276 million, according to data from CoinGlass. Just three days ago, Moo Deng crypto’s open interest was still around $125 million, following a meteoric 440% surge from only $13.4 million. Now, its open interest has more than doubled that amount. This price surge in Moo Deng crypto could be due to the token’s recent listing on Binance Alpha. On May 11, the crypto exchange’s pre-listing token selection pool announced that it would be listing MOO DENG alongside the AI -inspired meme coin GOAT ( GOAT ). Similar to Moo Deng’s surge, GOAT also experienced a significant boost; rising as high as 70% shortly after the notice was posted. Moo Deng crypto’s origins Launched in September 2024, MOODENG is a Solana-based meme coin inspired by a viral pygmy hippopotamus calf from Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand. The hippo, nicknamed Moo Deng, went viral on social media, particularly TikTok, for its charm and adorable expressions. Last April, local media outlets reported that Suvarnabhumi Airport workers began giving away plush dolls of the iconic hippo Moo Deng to visitors for free in honor of the nation’s Songkran festivities. Songkran is a local festival that celebrates the traditional Thai New Year, held in April and marked by the throwing and sprinkling of water.

According to data from crypto.news, Solana-based memecoin Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) soared to an intraday high of $0.248, its highest level since Jan. 25, and up nearly 600% from last month’s low. The surge came alongside a massive 178% spike in trading volume, with nearly $373 million worth of GOAT traded in 24 hours. There are three main catalysts driving GOAT crypto’s gains today. First, GOAT was recently added to the Binance Alpha platform , a spotlight section within crypto exchange Binance designed to highlight early-stage or trending crypto projects to users. While a listing on Binance Alpha does not automatically mean Binance will list the token, projects featured on Alpha often gain significant exposure, and if they demonstrate strong community interest, trading volume, and sustainability, they stand a higher chance of being fully listed on Binance in the future. You might also like: Bitcoin surges past $105k on the heels of a U.S. and China trade deal Second, GOAT’s rally comes amid a broader rally among Solana-based memecoins with the sector gaining 10.5% over the past day as other major players like dogwifhat ( WIF ), Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ), cat in a dogs world ( MEW ), and Moo Deng ( MOODENG ) are experiencing gains ranging between 25-100% respectively. Lastly, activity in the derivatives market has picked up sharply over the past day. Data from CoinGlass shows open interest in GOAT futures was up 61% in the past 24 hours when writing, sitting at a four-month high of $161.7 million. Meanwhile, the long/short ratio on Binance was far above 1 as of last check, which is a sign that more traders were betting that GOAT will continue climbing in the short term. Together, the data points to a growing wave of speculative optimism, with traders seemingly positioning for a breakout if GOAT secures a full Binance listing. GOAT price analysis Looking at GOAT’s price action, the technical charts are also flashing bullish signals. On the daily USDT chart, the 20-day exponential moving average just crossed above the 50-day moving average, forming a bullish “golden cross.” GOAT price, 50-day and 200-day EMA chart — May 12 | Source: crypto.news The Supertrend indicator has also flipped green, suggesting the trend remains upward. GOAT Supertrend and MFI chart — May 12 | Source: crypto.news On top of that, the Money Flow Index hit 91, pointing to strong buying pressure and fresh funds pouring into GOAT, suggesting bulls remain firmly in control despite the overbought reading. Given this bullish setup, the next target for GOAT is likely around the $0.39 to $0.41 area, a crucial support-resistance zone. If GOAT breaks through this zone, it could rally toward its yearly high of $0.59, which represents around 150% upside from its current level. As of the latest update, GOAT has slightly pulled back from its daily peak, trading around $0.22 per coin.

Cryptocurrency custodian BitGo has received a Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation — also known as MiCA — license from Germany ‘s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, allowing it to offer crypto services across Europe. In a Monday blog announcement , BitGo said the license was granted to BitGo Europe GmbH, its European entity established in 2023, which is already registered in several EU countries, including Italy, Spain, Poland, and Greece. “BitGo is now well-positioned to serve both crypto-native companies and traditional financial institutions — such as banks and asset managers — looking to engage with digital assets through a secure, compliant infrastructure provider.” BitGo Commenting on the license, BitGo said the European Union is a “global hub for digital asset innovation, driven by MiCA’s clear, harmonized approach to regulation,” and stated that the new rules have helped “accelerate institutional participation while increasing trust in the market.” However, not everyone in the crypto industry shares BitGo’s view. Some still believe that MiCA could lead certain firms to shut down or merge as they seek greater scale to meet regulatory demands. MiCA officially came into effect in late 2024, aiming to replace the previously fragmented regulatory landscape with a single set of rules across all 27 EU member states. According to analysts at TRM Labs, only 17 crypto businesses had received authorization under MiCA across seven EU countries, citing data from the European Securities and Markets Authority.

BTC price action is giving increasingly bullish signals, joined by a key cross on the weekly MACD indicator. The weekly close fell just short of expectations, raising doubts over whether price discovery will return in the immediate future. CPI and PPI headline the week’s US macro data drops, but markets are all about the US-China trade deal and its implications. Bitcoin supply in loss drops below 2% in a rare test of hodlers’ staying power. Despite the gains, crypto market sentiment remains cool amid a lack of mainstream interest. Bitcoin MACD cross copies October 2024 Bitcoin managed to preserve its highest levels since January around the weekly close as bulls battle resistance below all-time highs. Volatility was visible over the weekend thanks to BTC/USD staying sensitive to developments around US trade tariffs. On the hourly chart, these manifested as snap moves up and down before a broad sideways trend continued, resulting in several “long wick” candles. That pattern continued into the week’s first Wall Street open, with Bitcoin hitting new highs of $105,706 on Bitstamp, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView . BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView “Price action was making it seem like something big was coming. Any tiny dip was getting scooped up instantly and price started to move ~1 hour prior to the announcement,” popular trader Daan Crypto Trades wrote about the tariffs phenomenon in part of a post on X . “We're seeing quite a lot of ‘aware’ price action precede big announcements lately.

To the upside, $106,000 was the key area to break through on low timeframes. BTC liquidation heatmap.

Bitcoin bulls narrowly miss key weekly target Despite hitting its highest levels in three-and-a-half months after the weekly close, Bitcoin failed to flip a key support line that would secure a fresh breakout.

As Cointelegraph reported , BTC price targets already included $150,000 and higher during June. CPI week dawns with uncertainty “everywhere” Another crunch macroeconomic data week for risk-asset traders makes for a potentially volatile environment for Bitcoin and altcoins. Two key inflation markers, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) print for April, are due in the coming days. At the same time, markets are on edge over US trade policy, with news of a deal with China sparking flash moves in crypto over the weekend. “We have yet to receive a statement from Trump directly on the US-China trade deal,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter noted in part of ongoing X coverage. “This explains why markets are only up ~1.3% on this otherwise massively bullish news. Uncertainty is still everywhere.” S&P 500 E-mini futures chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Kobeissi added that retail earnings reports could also shape market performance over the coming week. Continuing, trading firm Mosaic Asset argued that trade news aside, risk assets lacked bullish impetus thanks to an ongoing hawkish policy stance from the US Federal Reserve and Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed left interest rates unchanged at its meeting last week, with markets increasingly pricing out a cut before July. “While there is some easing of tensions on the trade front, the latest interest rate setting meeting by the Federal Reserve isn’t delivering any bullish catalysts,” Mosaic Asset wrote in the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “ The Market Mosaic .” “Despite capital market volatility this year, Fed Chair Powell reiterated his message that the Fed can take a ‘wait and see’ approach to how tariffs are impacting the economy and inflation.” Fed target rate probabilities (screenshot). Source: CME Group The latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool puts the chance of a rate cut in June at under 15%, while the Fed’s July meeting attracts around 50% odds. Euphoria vs. “smart distribution” The proportion of the Bitcoin supply held in profit has reached more than 98% — something barely seen before, new research says. In one of its “ Quicktake ” blog posts on May 11, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant examined whether the Bitcoin investor base was inclined to “smart distribution” at current levels. “When BTC's supply in loss drops to between 0–2%, it typically coincides with late-stage bull runs,” contributor Kripto Mevsimi summarized. “As shown in the chart, these moments cluster near macro tops — a zone often characterized by overconfidence.” BTC supply days in loss (screenshot). Source: CryptoQuant The post added that long-term holders — those hodling for at least six months — may see the return to six figures as a suitable opportunity to reduce BTC exposure. Newcomers and speculators, on the other hand, may only now be planning an entry. “With nearly all BTC holders in profit, distribution risk increases. Long-term holders may see these conditions as a signal to derisk, especially with BTC near all-time highs,” Kripto Mevsimi continued. “Meanwhile, newer entrants could interpret this strength as confirmation to chase, creating a potential sentiment mismatch.” Last week, research nonetheless suggested that buy-side and sell-side pressure was broadly balanced , with the implication that Bitcoin could continue moving higher without a significant rush to the exit. Mainstream retail ignores $104,000 Bitcoin In an interesting development — one potentially supporting sustained BTC price upside — the market is less “greedy” at $104,000 than it was when Bitcoin traded more than 10% lower. Related: Ethereum chart pattern supports ‘moon shot’ rally to new price highs if confirmed — Trader The latest data from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows that while “greed” does characterize the general mood, the initial push to $94,000 on April 23 delivered higher readings. Fear & Greed measured 70/100 on May 12, while on April 23 it reached 72/100, just inches from “extreme greed” territory. Lower levels of greed in the face of higher prices could potentially signal more sustainable price growth as investors resist the urge to act erratically. Crypto Fear & Greed Index (screenshot).

At the heart of this discussion are stablecoins , cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the Korean Won. Recently, a pivotal development emerged from South Korea , highlighting the growing assertiveness of financial authorities regarding these digital assets. Why is the Bank of Korea Focused on Won-Backed Stablecoins? The Bank of Korea (BOK), the nation’s esteemed central bank , has made its position crystal clear: it believes it must be involved from the very outset in the approval process for any won-backed stablecoin seeking to launch in the country. This isn’t just a bureaucratic preference; it stems from fundamental concerns about the potential impact of such digital currencies on core central banking functions. Ko Kyeong-cheol, head of BOK’s electronic finance team, articulated these concerns at a recent financial law conference, emphasizing the significant influence stablecoins could wield over key policy areas. These areas include: Monetary Policy: The central bank’s ability to manage interest rates and control the money supply could be affected if a large volume of won-backed stablecoins circulates outside the traditional banking system. Financial Stability: A large, widely used stablecoin could pose systemic risks. For instance, a ‘run’ on a stablecoin could destabilize its peg and potentially spill over into traditional financial markets. Payment Settlements: Stablecoins could alter existing payment infrastructures, potentially impacting the efficiency and safety of the national payment system which the BOK oversees. Therefore, the BOK argues that early involvement in the approval process is essential to proactively identify and mitigate these potential negative effects, ensuring that the introduction of digital assets aligns with the central bank’s policy objectives. Understanding Stablecoin Regulation: A Global Perspective The stance taken by the Bank of Korea is not isolated. Central banks and financial regulators worldwide are grappling with how to oversee stablecoins. The potential for stablecoins to become widely adopted as a medium of exchange and store of value raises questions similar to those posed by traditional money and banking. Globally, regulatory approaches vary: Some jurisdictions are proposing specific stablecoin legislation, often requiring issuers to hold reserves in a highly liquid and safe manner, subject to audits and regulatory oversight. Others are attempting to fit stablecoins within existing financial regulations, such as those governing e-money or payment systems. International bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) are also developing frameworks and recommendations for stablecoin regulation, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach. The BOK’s insistence on early involvement aligns with a trend towards regulators seeking to understand and control digital asset risks before they become widespread, particularly for those assets, like won-backed stablecoins, that directly interface with the national currency. What Does This Mean for South Korea’s Digital Asset Future? This move by the Bank of Korea signals a clear intent to exert significant influence over the development of the digital asset ecosystem in South Korea , particularly concerning stablecoins pegged to the Won. For potential issuers of such stablecoins, this means: The regulatory path will likely be rigorous and require close consultation with the BOK from the initial planning stages. Proposals will need to clearly demonstrate how the stablecoin project addresses the central bank’s concerns regarding monetary policy, financial stability, and payment systems. Collaboration and transparency with regulators will be paramount. While potentially creating a higher barrier to entry, a well-defined and robust stablecoin regulation framework, with the central bank ‘s input, could ultimately foster greater confidence and legitimacy for won-backed stablecoins within South Korea ‘s financial system. This could pave the way for broader adoption by businesses and consumers, provided the regulatory burden doesn’t stifle innovation entirely. Balancing Innovation and Stability: A Tightrope Walk The challenge for the Bank of Korea and other regulators is finding the right balance. On one hand, digital assets and stablecoins offer potential benefits like faster, cheaper payments, increased financial inclusion, and new avenues for innovation. On the other hand, they introduce risks that traditional financial regulations were not designed to handle. The BOK’s proactive stance suggests a priority on stability and control. By seeking early approval power, the central bank aims to shape the stablecoin market from its inception, ensuring it develops in a way that complements, rather than disrupts, the existing financial architecture and the effective implementation of monetary policy. This regulatory approach is likely to evolve as the technology and market mature. Dialogue between innovators and regulators will be crucial to developing frameworks that protect the public and the financial system while allowing for the safe exploration of digital asset potential. The case of South Korea and the Bank of Korea ‘s position on won-backed stablecoins will be a key example to watch as this global conversation continues. Actionable Insights for the Market For anyone involved in or observing the South Korea n digital asset market, the BOK’s position offers several key insights: Regulatory Engagement is Non-Negotiable: Any entity considering launching a won-backed stablecoin must prioritize early and ongoing engagement with the Bank of Korea and other relevant financial authorities. Focus on Risk Mitigation: Proposals should heavily emphasize how the stablecoin’s design and operations mitigate risks related to monetary policy, financial stability, liquidity, and illicit finance. Transparency is Key: Be prepared for significant scrutiny regarding reserve management, governance, and operational resilience. Understand the Central Bank’s Mandate: Frame your stablecoin proposal in a way that acknowledges and respects the BOK’s core responsibilities for price stability, financial system stability, and payment system oversight. This development underscores that the era of largely unregulated stablecoins, particularly those tied to major national currencies, is drawing to a close. Central banks like the Bank of Korea are asserting their authority to ensure that these new forms of digital money do not undermine their fundamental roles. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Won-Backed Stablecoins The Bank of Korea ‘s call for early involvement in the approval of won-backed stablecoins marks a significant moment for the future of digital currencies in South Korea . It reflects a growing global consensus among central bank s that stablecoins, while promising, pose potential risks that necessitate proactive and robust stablecoin regulation . By demanding a seat at the table from the outset, the BOK aims to safeguard its ability to conduct monetary policy, maintain financial stability, and ensure the integrity of the payment system. This approach, while potentially adding layers of complexity for innovators, highlights the critical need to integrate novel digital assets responsibly into the existing financial ecosystem. The outcome of this regulatory push will shape how won-backed stablecoins develop and operate, serving as a crucial case study for other nations navigating similar challenges.

In a May 12 announcement on X, the company said users in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will be able to trade AED and USD for cryptocurrencies for Tether (USDT), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). The launch comes as part of HashKey Global MENA’s new OTC (over-the-counter) platform, which offers fiat on- and off-ramps along with support for local bank settlements. HashKey’s expansion into the region follows its conditional approval from VARA earlier this year. On January 13, the company announced it had received in-principle approval to operate as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in Dubai. The license permits HashKey to offer both Virtual Asset Exchange Services and Virtual Asset Broker-Dealer Services to retail, qualified, and institutional investors. VARA, Dubai’s dedicated virtual asset regulator, was established to position the emirate as a hub for blockchain innovation while enforcing rigorous investor protections. Any company operating under VARA’s jurisdiction must comply with strict operational and disclosure requirements, especially if its activities extend beyond the emirate. HashKey’s approval adds it to a growing list of global firms entering Dubai under the regulator’s supervision. Before HashKey, similar approvals were granted to crypto firms Crypto.com and OKX by Dubai’s regulatory authorities. Beyond the MENA region, HashKey has actively built out its international presence through a series of regulatory wins. In April, its European arm, HashKey Europe Limited, secured VASP registration from the Central Bank of Ireland, its first such license in the European Union. Over the past years, HashKey has secured licenses across key markets including Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Bermuda, and Ireland . Expanding its suite of services As part of its broader growth strategy, HashKey has rolled out new product lines targeting both retail and institutional markets. One of its key launches this year is ModAI , a multilingual AI assistant built using large language models from providers like OpenAI and Anthropic. Designed to streamline content moderation and customer support, the tool is expected to improve user engagement while reducing operational costs. The firm also expanded its investment product lineup with the launch of the XRP Tracker Fund, offering institutional investors exposure to Ripple’s XRP without requiring direct custody. The product follows its earlier Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF funds listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, in March, Hashkey announced two tokenised money market ETFs in collaboration with Chinese asset manager Bosera. These products, approved by the Securities and Futures Commission, were included under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Project Ensemble Sandbox and structured to provide stable, low-risk investment options in both HKD and USD.

However, the confluence of key resistance factors at this range suggests a likely consolidation before the next major move. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart ETH has been in a strong and impulsive uptrend, reflecting a clear return of demand and buying strength in the market. The price has now reached a critical resistance zone near $2.6K, which aligns with both the 200-day moving average and the previously broken lower boundary of a multi-month ascending channel. This confluence forms a strong resistance cluster, suggesting potential supply at this level and posing a significant challenge to further upward movement. As a result, a temporary consolidation or corrective phase appears necessary for the market to stabilize and gather enough momentum for a potential breakout. The RSI indicator has also entered overbought territory, reinforcing the likelihood of a short-term correction. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Ethereum’s aggressive buying momentum has driven the price through several resistance levels. This rally signals the buyers’ intention to target all-time highs in the coming months. However, ETH has now reached a key supply zone of around $2.6K, which corresponds with a major swing high in March. This area has already capped the rally, suggesting a potential short-term pause or consolidation. While a quick breakout above this resistance is still possible, the overbought RSI levels make a brief correction or sideways movement within this range, which is the more probable near-term scenario. Onchain Analysis By ShayanMarkets The funding rates metric is a key indicator of sentiment in the futures market. Analyzing its recent behaviour offers valuable insight into Ethereum’s latest surge. In healthy and sustainable bullish trends, funding rates typically rise gradually, indicating increased participation from buyers in both the perpetual futures and spot markets. Currently, however, funding rates remain relatively flat, showing no significant uptick. This suggests that Ethereum’s recent price surge has been primarily driven by spot market demand rather than speculative activity in the futures market. This is a bullish sign, as it implies the uptrend is organic and not fueled by excessive leverage, reducing the risk of liquidation cascades and indicating a more stable trend. Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders.

The entrepreneur shared a snapshot of a news update on X on Monday, showing a bill passed by the Texas House last week that bars citizens from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing real estate in the state. According to state records, the SB 17 bill prohibits foreigners from buying homes, farmland, and commercial property. It was passed along party lines of an anti-China sentiment led by President Donald Trump, who is also using tariffs to “nerf” the influence of China and its allies in global trade. Capital controls not tariffs will be the driving force behind the eventual Chi-American divorce. pic.twitter.com/bJpSr7IcI4 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) May 12, 2025 Several commenters on Hayes’ post argued that such land bans are common worldwide and represent basic national security, not capital control. “ Americans cannot buy land there. This is not capital control, it’s basic security ,” one user wrote in response. Another claimed the law was fair because all non-Western countries ban foreigners from owning land and homes. “ Go to any Asian country and their government protects citizens from having foreigners come in and buy up all the desirable properties, ” they argued. According to federal data, as of the end of 2024, Chinese nationals owned around 383,935 acres of US land. Roughly 195,000 of those acres were purchased directly by Chinese investors, valued at an estimated $2 billion. The remainder is held through 62 US-based companies with Chinese shareholders. Texas bill targets “hostile nations” The SB 17 bill would reportedly prevent citizens, companies, and governments from four countries, deemed “hostile” in US federal threat assessments, from purchasing any “real property” in Texas. The bill grants Texas Governor Greg Abbott the power to expand the list to additional countries unilaterally, while enforcement would fall to the state attorney general. Violations could carry civil penalties of $250,000 or more. The legislation applies to future purchases and does not retroactively affect land already owned by foreign nationals. State Representative Cole Hefner, one of the bill’s main sponsors, said the law is about “ securing Texas land and natural resources from adversarial nations and oppressive regimes that wish to do us harm .” However, in a House debate held on the day of the vote, Representative Gene Wu, a Democrat from Houston and critic of the measure, asserted that without clearer language, the bill could affect thousands of foreign nationals working and studying legally in Texas on H-1B and student visas. Democrats bash GOP lawmakers for passing “racist” law Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Austin over the weekend, denouncing the bill as racist and xenophobic. “Stop the hate” and “housing is a human right” were among the slogans seen on placards. Alice Yi, co-founder of Asian Texans for Justice, called the bill a direct attack on immigrants based on national origin. “ This is a racist bill, ” she propounded. State Rep. Wes Virdell, a GOP lawmaker from west of San Antonio, voted “present” and lambasted the legislation for failing to achieve its original goal. “The intent was to prevent hostile countries from buying up large plats of land,” he said, but cautioned the law “entangles everyday people” and hands excessive power to the executive branch. Meanwhile, State Rep. Ray Lopez, a Democrat from San Antonio, withdrew his co-sponsorship of the bill after his requests for scaling back on certain provisions and an appeals process were denied. “ I get what the bill authors are trying to do ,” Lopez surmised, “ but if you took out ‘Chinese Americans’ and you were talking about ‘Mexican Americans,’ that would make me feel terrible.

Costco’s 24-karat gold bars, which debuted in June of 2023, have seen historic demand amid all-time high prices and inflation concerns, reports Bloomberg. A survey from Bloomberg estimated that about 77% of Costco locations across the US that sell bullion bars were out of stock by the first week of October 2024, even after receiving fresh stocks in the previous weeks. Since then, the price of gold has gone much higher, currently trading at $3,248 after hitting an all-time high of $3,500. Now, Costco’s checkout page for its gold bars states , “Limit of one Transaction Per Membership, with a Maximum of two Units Per 24 Hours.” In April of last year, banking giant Wells Fargo estimated that Costco was seeing as much as $200 million per month in revenue from its gold bar sales alone. Said Wells Fargo equity analyst Edward Kelly at the time, “Our work suggests there has been significant interest given COST’s aggressive pricing and high level of customer trust… The accelerating frequency of Reddit posts, quick on-line sell-outs of product, and COST’s robust monthly eComm sales suggest a sharp uptick in momentum since the launch.” In addition to gold, Costco is also selling silver and platinum bars to its customers.

If buyers continue the pressure, they have a good chance to test the resistance at $2.6 next. If they break above that level, then XRP has a good shot at $3. Chart by TradingView 2. Momentum is Picking Up Speed The price is making higher highs and higher lows with a clear uptrend. However, the buy volume remains low compared to previous rallies. Hopefully, this can change as soon as the price breaks above $2.6, since that will encourage buyers to return in numbers. The current support is at $2.3. Chart by TradingView 3. RSI Makes New Highs On Saturday, the daily RSI reached almost 69 points and made a new high before sellers returned to take XRP into a pullback. This shows a clear bullish uptrend. As long as the RSI makes a higher low as well, there is no reason to think this uptrend will stop any time soon.

In the previous week, digital asset investment products recorded $882 million in global inflows last week. This injection of capital gains marks the fourth week of inflows into the digital asset market and brings the total year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. BlackRock’s iShares ETF’s contributed the largest share of inflows last week with $1.02 billion. However, this large amount was offset by outflows from Grayscale, Bitwise, CoinShares XBT as well as other products, which amounted to around $257 million in outflows. The firm’s head of research James Butterfill attributed the rise in both prices and inflows as being driven by multiple factors in the market, some of which include an increase in M2 money supply and stagnant inflation risks in the U.S. On the bright side, Butterfill noted that more U.S. states have started approving bills that involve Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, paving the way for wider crypto acceptance in the market.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong and Canada experienced modest outflows of $8 million and $4.3 million respectively. Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to dominate inflows with $867 million last week. BTC also managed to reach a major milestone, as U.S. listed ETFs accumulated net inflows of $62.9 billion since they were launched in January 2024, as noted by CoinShares. Therefore, BTC inflows have surpassed its previous all-time high of $61.6 billion that was set in early February. Compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH )’s inflows still have a long way to go, contributing a meager $1.5 million from the grand total. In contrast, Sui ( SUI ) was able to surpass major tokens like Solana ( SOL ) and Ethereum with $11.7 million inflows. In fact, Sui has now attracted $84 million in year-to-date inflows, effectively overtaking Solana’s $76 million year-to-date inflows.

The BIS study, published May 8, found cross-border payments using the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ), and the two largest stablecoins, USDt ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ), totaled about $600 billion during the second quarter of 2024, the final observation period covered by the analysis. “Our findings highlight speculative motives and global funding conditions as key drivers of native crypto asset flows,” the BIS said. Cross-border crypto asset flows by quarter. Source: BIS Still, the report noted that stablecoins and low-value Bitcoin transactions are frequently driven by practical use cases, particularly as alternatives to traditional remittances. The researchers pointed out that geographical barriers have less influence on cryptocurrency transactions compared with traditional financial systems. Related: Spar supermarket in Switzerland starts accepting Bitcoin payments Speculative crypto activity remains tied to “global conditions for funding in major crypto markets,” signaling a growing “interconnectedness” between cryptocurrencies and the legacy financial system, the researchers said, adding: “Concurrently, we observe that tighter global funding conditions, known to curtail risk-taking in traditional asset classes, are associated with reduced flows. This indicates increasing interconnectedness between cryptoassets as speculative assets and mainstream finance.” Additionally, crypto-specific risks and heightened public awareness significantly influence crypto investment flows, reinforcing their role as speculative assets, according to the BIS. The findings were published nearly a month after the BIS warned that the number of investors and amount of capital in crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi ) had “reached a critical mass,” posing a threat to financial stability and global wealth inequality, Cointelegraph reported on April 19.

The Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) has officially announced it is working on a detailed South Korea crypto policy framework. This development signals a growing recognition among major political forces of the importance of digital assets in the nation’s future. What is the Democratic Party Crypto Agenda? During a recent press conference where the Democratic Party outlined its top 10 policy initiatives ahead of the upcoming South Korea presidential election crypto discussion took center stage. While full details are still under wraps, expected in a separate announcement later, the party confirmed that a dedicated cryptocurrency policy agenda is actively being drafted. This move follows previous statements from the DPK’s presidential candidate, Lee Jae-myung crypto stances have been relatively forward-looking. He has previously indicated support for key areas within the digital asset space. While the new comprehensive agenda is being developed, his past pledges provide insight into the potential direction the party might take. These include: Introducing Spot Crypto ETFs: A significant pledge that could open doors for broader institutional and retail investment in cryptocurrencies through traditional financial vehicles. Reducing Fees for Digital Asset Trading: Aimed at making cryptocurrency trading more accessible and affordable for individual investors. These points suggest a policy direction focused on both fostering market growth and protecting retail investors by reducing barriers to entry and potentially creating more regulated investment avenues. Why is Crypto Regulation South Korea a Key Election Issue? South Korea has a vibrant and active cryptocurrency market. A significant portion of its population is invested in digital assets, making cryptocurrency policy a potentially influential factor for voters. As such, how different parties approach crypto regulation South Korea becomes a crucial differentiator in the election campaign. The Democratic Party’s decision to dedicate a specific agenda to crypto highlights its strategic importance. It suggests the party sees engaging with the crypto community and developing clear, supportive policies as essential for winning over a key demographic and positioning South Korea as a leader in the digital economy. Developing a comprehensive policy isn’t without its challenges. Regulators globally are grappling with how to balance innovation with consumer protection, financial stability, and preventing illicit activities. The DPK’s policy will likely need to address these complexities while also aiming to create an environment conducive to growth and investment in the sector. What Could Lee Jae-myung Crypto Policies Mean for the Market? If the DPK’s eventual policy aligns with or expands upon Lee Jae-myung crypto pledges, it could have several implications: Increased Market Legitimacy: Official recognition and integration through ETFs could lend significant legitimacy to the crypto market in South Korea. Potential for Increased Investment: Easier access via lower fees and regulated products like ETFs could attract more capital into the market. Regulatory Clarity: A clear policy framework, while potentially introducing new rules, could also provide much-needed certainty for businesses and investors operating in the space. The detailed policy announcement is eagerly awaited by the crypto community both within South Korea and internationally, as it could set a precedent for how major economies integrate digital assets into their financial systems. Conclusion: A New Era for South Korea Crypto Policy? The Democratic Party of Korea drafting a dedicated South Korea crypto policy agenda marks a significant step in the country’s political engagement with digital assets. With the South Korea presidential election crypto issues are set to play a more prominent role than ever before. The forthcoming details of the DPK’s plan, potentially reflecting earlier promises by Lee Jae-myung crypto stances, will be crucial in shaping the future of crypto regulation South Korea and its position in the global digital economy.

The most important development in the time for the token was the agreement reached in the Ripple Labs vs. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) court case. Though the upsurge triggered significant bullishness in the community and XRP accrued strong positive momentum, history shows that the cryptocurrency market can always create unexpected volatility and that major rallies tend to lead to substantial corrections. Under the circumstances, Finbold consulted advanced artificial intelligence ( AI ) about whether the current patterns and circumstances indicate XRP can sustain the trend until June, or if a bearish reversal is in the cards. AI sets XRP price target for June 1, 2025 When setting the price target for XRP for June 1, 2025, ChatGPT-4.5 reflected on the token’s recent momentum and technical setup, but also identified the deal reached with the SEC and the associated regulatory clarity as important factors. The AI also matched the noted community sentiment driven by the optimism that emerged from Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) rally toward $105,000, pulling the cryptocurrency market upward when forecasting XRP’s price for the start of next month. Specifically, ChatGPT explained that $2.85 is the most plausible June 1, 2025, price target. According to the AI, the 17.28% rally in the coming three weeks is reasonable as it accounts for the prevailing optimism, but also for the need for the token to breach the strong resistances near $2.50, and factors such as profit-taking, macroeconomic shifts, or wider unforeseen events.

XRP experts’ technical outlook For example, Ali Martinez published an X post on May 11 stating that a symmetrical triangle chart pattern governs XRP and that a breakout could lead to $15 for the token, more than five times the digital asset’s current value which would see its market cap hit over $700 billion.

The relative strength index ( RSI ) of 59.67 demonstrates there is no particularly strong bullish or bearish pressure on the cryptocurrency, which is, at its press time price of $2.43, aiming for the nearest resistance level at $2.45. On the flip side, similar technical analysis ( TA ) reveals that there is more support for an optimistic attitude. XRP has covered significant ground from its nearest support zone near $2.31 and would need to plunge 4.94% to even risk a bearish breakout.

What’s Happening with Pi Coin’s Price? Pi Network price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Looking at the daily chart with Fibonacci retracement drawn from the March swing high to the April low, Pi Coin price has decisively broken above the 2.618 extension at $1.16 and is now testing the 3.618 Fib level near $1.39.

These figures make MOODENG the best-performing coin in the top 500 over the past day, week and month, with the Solana-based crypto also boasting an incredible 920% increase in the last 30 days. It’s now 61% down from its all-time high of $0.6804 (from November), with its recent spike in momentum giving it plenty of scope to return to this record high in the not-too distant future. Moo Deng Price Prediction: MOODENG Spikes 568% In A Week, Is $0.50 Next? Moo Deng’s price and chart has gone parabolic over the past five or so days, with its indicators now suggesting that the market is overbuying it relative to recent levels. Indeed, after rocketing to 90 a couple of days ago, MOODENG’s relative strength index (purple) has again risen beyond 80. The argument therefore is that it’s only a matter of time before the coin should correct, with its 30-period average (orange) also having risen far beyond its 200-period (blue) equivalent. Source: TradingView Given that Moo Deng had rallied strongly in November and December, and then basically collapsed, the question emerges as to why it’s rallying so strongly now. Well, its trading volume – which has risen from a basically irrelevant $20 million on Thursday to $1.4 billion today – would suggest that whales have begun buying up the token. And based on chain data, it seems that some whales are confident the Moo Deng price will rise higher in the near future. One whale has placed two separate sell orders for MOODENG, one at $0.565 and another at $1.11. As $MOODENG rose, a whale placed limit orders to sell 2M $MOODENG($543K) at $0.565 and 1.1M $MOODENG($298K) at $1.11. Can his limit orders be executed? https://t.co/egAu2Eze6W pic.twitter.com/Gg14bZR6c7 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 12, 2025 Such targets are highly bullish, with the second implying a 300% rise from the current Moo Deng price. It’s hard to say whether the coin will actually rise this high, given that it’s a meme coin lacking fundamentals. Yet it does seem to have caught a second wind, while it also seems that the market is responding bullishly to the news that the US and China have agreed a pause in tariffs . Assuming that this is the opening to a big, permanent climbdown from both nations, and to the US softening its general tariff stance, the market could continue to rise. And with it, MOODENG could reach $0.30 by the end of the month and $0.50 by August. Alternative Altcoins with Strong High-Gain Potential MOODENG is in a good place right now, but it won’t be the only new token to ride an improving market in the coming weeks. There’s also a range of interesting presale coins available right now, with some of these likely to rally strongly once they list for the first time. A good example of this is MIND of Pepe, an ERC-20 token that has now raised an impressive $9 million in its sale, which is ending in 19 days. Nine Million. $MIND pic.twitter.com/wpccWXz38U — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 11, 2025 The exciting thing about MIND of Pepe is that it will launch an autonomous AI agent, which will have two main functions. The first is that it will process large quantities of social media and trading data, using this data to produce market analysis and advice, which MIND holders can access. Secondly, MIND of Pepe will also use its insights into trends to generate its own meme tokens, making them as viral as possible. AI tokens are bullish because they’re more decentralized than their human-issued equivalents, lacking founders and team members who might offload their holdings. As such, MIND of Pepe’s coins could end up doing very well, with investors able to gain early access to them (before they list) by holding MIND. Time is running out, but you can still join its presale by going to the MIND of Pepe website and connecting a wallet, such as Best Wallet. MIND is selling at its final presale price of $0.0037515, although its popularity would suggest that it might rise much higher than this once it lists.

A new report by global banking giant Citi reveals that stablecoins could reach a market cap of $3.7 trillion by 2030 , driven by expanding real-world use cases like payments, remittances, and institutional finance. Here’s a breakdown of the report and what it means for the future of digital assets. Stablecoin Market Overview The total market capitalization of stablecoins currently stands at $245.4 billion , with a 24-hour trading volume of $86.7 billion . Top stablecoins by market cap: Tether (USDT): $149.97 billion USD Coin (USDC): $60.71 billion USDS: $7.72 billion Athena USDe and Dai follow closely Tether also dominates trading volume with over $76 billion exchanged in the past 24 hours. Citi’s Stablecoin Forecast: What to Expect by 2030 Citi’s Future of Finance report outlines two scenarios for stablecoin growth: Base Case: $1.6 trillion market cap by 2030 Bull Case: $3.7 trillion market cap by 2030 According to Ronit Ghose , Citi’s Global Head of Future of Finance, stablecoins are evolving into tools for: Cross-border payments Domestic remittances SME and corporate transactions Settlement of tokenized assets Ghose explains that stablecoins allow global users to hold US dollars or euros affordably and efficiently. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : 5 Key Economic Events This Week That Could Make or Break the Crypto Bull Run , Payment Companies Drive Adoption Supporting Citi’s prediction, Fireblocks shared real-world adoption data showing that: Payment firms represent 11% of their clients But they account for 16% of stablecoin transactions Transaction volumes are growing 30% quarter over quarter Over the last 90 days, Fireblocks processed $517 billion in USDT and USDC $82 billion came from payment-focused clients This data confirms that real-world use is growing rapidly, particularly in the payments sector. Stablecoin Regulation and Bank Adoption The future of stablecoins will also depend on evolving global regulations. One key question remains: Will banks use stablecoins, CBDCs, or both? According to Citi’s Ghose, the answer depends on national strategies: “Some countries may favor stablecoins, others will back CBDCs, and some may adopt both, depending on their regulatory environment.” Conclusion With growing adoption across businesses and payment networks, stablecoins are moving into mainstream finance. Citi’s projection of a $3.7 trillion market cap by 2030 may soon shift from possibility to reality. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

44522296,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66994,1747051142,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ledger’s Discord Admin Account Hacked, CZ Binance Reports",https://timestabloid.com/ledgers-discord-admin-account-hacked-cz-binance-reports/,"In a shocking turn of events for the cryptocurrency community, Ledger, a renowned provider of hardware wallets, has fallen victim to a security breach involving its official Discord server. The incident, reported by CZ Binance , co-founder and former CEO of Binance on X, revealed that the Discord administrator’s account had been compromised. This breach led to the dissemination of a fraudulent message urging users to enter their recovery phrases on a phishing site, creating significant alarm among Ledger users and the wider crypto community. The Nature of the Attack The attack began when the hacker gained control of Ledger’s Discord admin account. Using this compromised position, the attacker sent out an alarming message masquerading as an official communication from Ledger’s team. The fraudulent message falsely claimed the discovery of a critical security vulnerability within Ledger’s systems. It warned that sensitive user data, including shipping details, 24-word recovery phrases, and transaction data, may have been exposed. Just got this security warning. Ledger's Discord admin account was hacked. The scammer falsely claimed a security flaw and urged users to enter their recovery phrases on a phishing site. Lessons: 1. Never give up your private key recovery phrases no matter who is doing the… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) May 12, 2025 The message then urged users to visit a fake website, fakeverify-ledger. appchanged, to verify the integrity of their recovery phrases. The phishing site prompted users to connect their wallets and input their 24-word recovery phrases, under the guise of checking for any security compromise. The message also promised guidance on generating a new recovery phrase and a compensation package as a gesture of goodwill, should the phrase be deemed compromised. Phishing Attacks in the Crypto Space This latest phishing attack underscores a persistent problem in the cryptocurrency ecosystem: the exploitation of social media and community channels. Phishing attacks often use fear, urgency, and trusted communication channels to trick users into divulging sensitive information. In this case, the attackers leveraged Ledger’s reputation and the credibility of an admin account to deceive users. CZ Binance’s quick dissemination of the news on X helped alert many users before they fell victim to the scam. However, the incident highlights the inherent risks associated with community-driven platforms like Discord, where administrators can be targeted and exploited to spread harmful content. Protecting Your Crypto Assets The most crucial lesson from this incident is the absolute importance of safeguarding recovery phrases. Ledger, like most reputable wallet providers, has always maintained that it will never ask users for their 24-word recovery phrases. Users should be vigilant and adhere to the following best practices: We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Never share your recovery phrase, even if the request appears to come from a trusted source. Be skeptical of urgent messages demanding sensitive information, especially from social media or community channels. Always verify the authenticity of communications by cross-checking with official sources. Avoid clicking on suspicious links, particularly those claiming to be official verification pages. Social Media: A Weak Link This attack also serves as a reminder that social media accounts tied to crypto companies are often the weakest link in cybersecurity. Even when the company itself has robust security measures, a compromised social media admin account can still pose a severe threat. Companies must take proactive steps to secure their community management accounts, including enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) and limiting admin privileges. Official Ledger Response Ledger has since clarified that there was no vulnerability in their hardware wallets or infrastructure. The issue was strictly related to the compromised Discord admin account. Ledger reiterated its commitment to user safety, emphasizing that users should never input their recovery phrases on any website. The company is also collaborating with Discord to regain control of the affected account and remove the malicious messages. The Ledger Discord hack serves as a stark reminder of the need for constant vigilance in the crypto world. Users should always remember that private key recovery phrases must be safeguarded at all costs. No legitimate company, including Ledger, will ever ask for this sensitive information. As the crypto ecosystem continues to grow, both companies and users must remain proactive in defending against evolving cyber threats.

Uniswap founder Hayden Adams celebrated the milestone in a May 12 X post , sharing a screenshot of a Dune Analytics dashboard monitoring the approaching total. As of this writing, Dune statistics report Uniswap’s daily volume at $3.3 billion, while DeFiLlama trails slightly at $3 billion, reflective of its 23% of the total DEX trading volume. DEX Market Landscape: Uniswap Leads, PancakeSwap in Second Place Uniswap is still the decentralized exchange market leader. It has the biggest market share by way of daily trading volume, far ahead of PancakeSwap with 21% at $2.7 billion in daily trades. In spite of this hegemony, Uniswap’s value locked (TVL) stands at slightly less than $5 billion—roughly half of its height during the DeFi bubble late in 2021. The aggregate DeFi TVL also indicates this shrinking to, between, $124 billion (DeFiLlama) and $132 billion (DappRadar), with Ethereum still the main network. UNI Token Trails Platform Performance As Uniswap’s platform metrics skyrocket, its native coin UNI has not followed suit. Currently trading for about $7.16, UNI is still over 84% off its May 2021 record of $45. The token declined 3.4% in a day as of reporting, based on CoinGecko. Uniswap Smart Wallet Coming soon with EIP-7702 Support In a separate development, Hayden Adams made a statement that Uniswap is releasing its own 7702-compatible smart wallet and will also support other 7702 wallets. The move is to enable frictionless one-click swaps for consumers. This follows Ethereum’s May 7 Pectra upgrade, which activated EIP-7702—a proposal made by Vitalik Buterin. The upgrade allows externally owned accounts to act like smart contracts during transaction time and includes quantum-resistant components. Trust Wallet already has these features in place, and Uniswap is now in a good position to do the same with native integration.",Altcoins|Cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-12 12:00:00
44522432,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159384,1747051220,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Uniswap Achieves Astounding $3 Trillion Trading Volume Milestone,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/uniswap-3-trillion-volume/,"In a landmark moment for the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), Uniswap has officially crossed an extraordinary threshold, reaching $3 trillion in total cumulative trading volume. This monumental achievement solidifies Uniswap’s position as a leading force in the crypto market and sets a new benchmark for decentralized exchanges. What is this $3 Trillion Trading Volume Milestone? Hitting $3 trillion in total trading volume means that, since its inception, users have collectively swapped assets worth this staggering amount on the Uniswap protocol. This isn’t just a large number; it represents the aggregate value of every trade facilitated through the platform’s automated market maker (AMM) mechanism. It signifies massive user adoption and trust in the protocol. It highlights the sheer scale of liquidity available on Uniswap. It demonstrates the growing maturity and capability of decentralized trading infrastructure. For context, $3 trillion is a figure comparable to the GDP of major countries or the market capitalization of some of the world’s largest companies. Achieving this milestone underscores the significant economic activity now flowing through decentralized protocols. Uniswap’s Dominance in the Decentralized Exchange Space Uniswap has long been a pioneer in the decentralized exchange (DEX) landscape. Launched in November 2018, it introduced the concept of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) to a broader audience, revolutionizing how tokens are traded without traditional order books or intermediaries. Its v3 iteration further enhanced capital efficiency through concentrated liquidity. This $3 trillion volume figure isn’t just a win for Uniswap; it’s a testament to the viability and increasing adoption of decentralized trading models. While other DEXs exist, Uniswap has consistently maintained a dominant market share, often facilitating more trading volume than all other DEXs combined on certain chains. This dominance is built on: Ease of use and accessibility. Deep liquidity pools across a wide range of tokens. Continuous innovation in its protocol design. Strong community support and integration within the broader DeFi ecosystem. Reaching this milestone first among all decentralized exchanges firmly plants Uniswap’s flag as the undisputed leader in the space. The Significance for the DeFi Ecosystem The growth of Uniswap is intrinsically linked to the growth of the overall DeFi ecosystem. As a foundational layer for swapping assets, Uniswap provides the necessary liquidity and infrastructure for countless other DeFi applications to function. Protocols for lending, borrowing, yield farming, and asset management often rely on Uniswap for price discovery and token swaps. The $3 trillion volume milestone indicates a healthy and active DeFi environment. It shows that users are actively engaging with decentralized applications, moving assets, and participating in the on-chain economy. This volume supports: Increased capital efficiency within DeFi. Better price execution for traders. Higher returns for liquidity providers who earn fees from trading volume. Greater confidence in the robustness of decentralized financial infrastructure. This achievement isn’t just about one protocol; it’s a positive signal for the entire decentralized finance movement, demonstrating its potential to handle significant financial activity. Uniswap’s Impact on the Broader Crypto Market While centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance or Coinbase still handle the majority of global crypto trading volume, Uniswap’s $3 trillion achievement highlights the increasing shift towards decentralized alternatives. This growth impacts the broader crypto market in several ways: Increased On-Chain Activity: Higher DEX volume means more transactions occurring directly on blockchain networks, driving demand for block space and potentially impacting network fees (depending on the chain). Reduced Reliance on Centralized Gatekeepers: As DEX volume grows, users have more options to trade without needing to trust a single centralized entity with their funds. Innovation Driver: The success of Uniswap’s AMM model has inspired numerous other protocols and innovations within the crypto space. Liquidity Provider Opportunities: The volume creates opportunities for crypto holders to earn passive income by providing liquidity to Uniswap pools. This milestone serves as a powerful indicator of the crypto market’s evolution, showcasing the increasing preference for permissionless and censorship-resistant trading venues among a significant segment of users. The Role of Uniswap and its Founder’s Vision At its core, Uniswap is an automated liquidity protocol. It allows users to swap ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum (and other supported chains) without needing buyers and sellers to create orders. Instead, it uses liquidity pools funded by users who earn a portion of the trading fees. Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, shared the news of the $3 trillion milestone on X, stating, “Bet its the first to 10.” This brief but confident statement reflects a belief in Uniswap’s continued growth trajectory and its potential to reach even greater heights. It suggests that the team and community see this $3 trillion mark not as a peak, but as a significant step on the path to much larger volumes, potentially rivaling or even surpassing traditional financial markets in the future. Looking Ahead: What’s Next After $3 Trillion? Reaching $3 trillion is a massive accomplishment, but the world of decentralized finance is constantly evolving. The focus for Uniswap and the broader DEX space will likely involve: Scaling Solutions: As volume grows, scalability remains crucial. Integration with Layer 2 solutions and deployment on various high-throughput blockchains will continue. Regulatory Clarity: The increasing volume and importance of DEXs will inevitably attract more attention from regulators globally. User Experience: Making decentralized trading even more accessible and user-friendly for mainstream adoption. New Features and Products: Exploring options like concentrated liquidity improvements, limit orders, and other trading tools within the decentralized framework. Hayden Adams’ prediction of being the first to $10 trillion is ambitious but speaks to the potential he sees in the protocol and the broader shift towards decentralized trading. Achieving that would truly place Uniswap in a category of its own, potentially competing on volume with some of the world’s largest financial institutions. Conclusion Uniswap reaching $3 trillion in total trading volume is a historic moment for decentralized finance and the entire crypto market. It underscores the protocol’s success, the growing adoption of DEXs, and the increasing maturity of on-chain financial activity. As Uniswap continues to innovate and expand, this milestone serves as a powerful indicator of the transformative potential of decentralized technology to reshape global finance.

Cryptocurrency mining, historically energy-intensive, is now seeing innovative approaches. 1 Global Cloud Mining stands out as a platform integrating renewable energy sources, reshaping the mining experience for users worldwide and offering a pathway to passive income in the digital asset space. 2 Cloud mining has emerged as a highly recommended method for participating in cryptocurrency mining. Beyond its energy-saving potential when powered by renewables, it lowers the barrier to entry, providing individuals with an accessible opportunity to explore passive income through digital asset investment. 3 Understanding the Basics of Cloud Mining Cloud mining simplifies the complex process of cryptocurrency mining. 4 Instead of purchasing, setting up, and maintaining expensive, power-hungry hardware yourself, users can rent mining equipment located in remote data centers, often referred to as cloud mining farms. This eliminates the technical hassle, noise, heat, and electricity costs associated with traditional home mining. 5 Users pay a fee to a Global Cloud Mining company (or a similar provider) to effectively “rent” a portion of their collective hash power. In return, they receive a share of the mining income generated by that hash power. Because it’s simple to operate and requires a significantly lower initial investment compared to buying physical miners, cloud mining has become a popular choice, especially for beginners and those seeking passive income opportunities from digital assets. 6 The Rise of Energy-Based Green Mining The cryptocurrency industry is increasingly focusing on sustainability to address global climate change concerns. Energy-based green mining is on the rise, with platforms like Global Cloud Mining leading the charge. These platforms are pioneering the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hybrid systems, to power their extensive mining operations. This shift reduces dependence on fossil fuels, significantly lowers the carbon footprint of mining activities, and actively promotes global carbon neutrality goals within the digital finance sector. By efficiently utilizing or investing excess renewable energy into mining operations, the operational cost of cryptocurrency mining can also be reduced, potentially leading to more favorable returns for users. Global Cloud Mining Platform: Simplicity Meets Scale Global Cloud Mining positions itself as a market leader by combining simplicity of use with significant operational scale. Its user-friendly, scalable platform, coupled with its clear name, resonates with both new and experienced crypto enthusiasts. The company reportedly operates multiple large-scale mining farms strategically located around the world, housing over 300,000 mining machines. Public data suggests that the platform serves a massive user base, exceeding 7 million registered individuals globally. A key selling point, aligning with growing user demand for environmental responsibility, is the claim that the platform’s operations are fully powered by renewable energy.

In a satirical post on X, First Ledger suggested that XRP could hit $2,000 (an 81,500% rally based on the $2.45 price), a controversial topic in crypto circles with strong opinions on both sides. While the post was humorous, it drew attention to the continued fascination with XRP’s long-term value potential and ways the asset might reach this lofty target. When XRP hits $2000, i wont tell anyone, but there will be signs pic.twitter.com/ePg8lrxAHb — First Ledger (@First_Ledger) May 7, 2025 First Ledger’s Vision of the Future In the post, First Ledger presented two images that quickly attracted attention. The first scene features a television broadcast reporting XRP’s price hitting $2,000, while the room includes absurd displays of affluence, including a Mona Lisa painting, an exotic pet, and more luxury items. The second image shows an internet meme character, Pepe the Frog, casually observing a Gundam robot and military-grade vehicles outside a window while wearing a jeweled crown and sipping tea. The caption read, “When XRP hits $2000, I won’t tell anyone, but there will be signs,” suggesting these displays of affluence would be the signs outsiders see when XRP reaches this target. High Expectations from the XRP Army Though meant in jest, the post draws from a real pattern of high-stakes predictions surrounding XRP’s future. Ambitious predictions like these have been criticized by many in the community , including well-respected figures. Some critics have also called out the XRP army’s enthusiasm, accusing Ripple of paying its supporters. However, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has dismissed these claims . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Is XRP Going to $2,000? XRP has shown some resilience in the market, staying above $2 despite notable market-wide declines over the past few months. The asset is currently trading at $2.37 after an announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump caused a market-wide resurgence . The asset also outperformed expectations in late 2024 and early 2025, rising by almost 600% to a multi-year peak of $3.39 in January. While these numbers are far from the $2,000 target, some speculate that XRP could replace SWIFT , dramatically driving the asset’s value. Analyst Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) sees $1,200 as conservative, expecting higher prices. However, a $2,000 price implies a $116 trillion market cap, larger than all global stock markets. At the current price, a $20,000 investment would purchase approximately 8,438.8 XRP. If the price ever reaches $2,000, that investment would grow to $16.87 million. While extremely unlikely, such outcomes remain central to the dream of long-term holders. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Millions of shorts were liquidated within hours that pushed the price beyond the psychological barrier. With this, the trading volume increased, with Bitcoin trading volume soaring above $75 billion from levels around $25 billion. This pointed towards a massive rise in the institutional accumulation, which surged by over 80,000 BTC in just one month of Q2 compared to that of the entire Q1. Alongside, the whales also have jumped in to accumulate. As per some reports, a whale just bought over $93.7 million worth of BTC, which has fueled the bullish sentiments. The rise in the price was a symbol of the rising confidence among the investors. However, a few indicators suggest the price may soon be subjected to a short-term pullback. The Bitcoin long/short ratio has just turned towards the shorts, which suggests the traders are slowly believing the possibility of a rejection as the price marks new highs. On the other hand, the Call vs Puts has surged heavily, which substantiates the bearish claim. The put gives the holder to sell the underlying asset, which keeps up the possibility of a pullback. However, the bearish pressure over the token is expected to remain only for a while as the open interest surges heavily. The open interest is the open trades that are yet to be closed and a rise in the levels suggests more and more traders have entered new trades. However, the nature of the trade may not be ascertained as they hold the possibility of both bullish and bearish actions. However, a rise in the OI raises optimism across the markets. The above data suggests the Bitcoin price may undergo a small pullback but could hold the support at $102,800 firmly. A rebound from these levels may propel the BTC price towards new highs and form a new ATH, probably above $110K.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-12 12:07:20

According to a May 12 X post , Backpack now allows FTX EU users who selected it as the redistribution platform to claim their euro balance. Users must first complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification on the exchange before they can withdraw funds. Backpack’s support page also explains that the KYC details on the platform must match the ones provided to FTX EU: “If they do not, you will need to contact Backpack EU support at support@eu.backpack.exchange to update your Backpack EU account to reflect the same information used for your FTX EU claim. This ensures a smooth verification process and avoids delays in accessing your distribution.” Related: Former FTX exec's wife says gov't ‘induced a guilty plea’ FTX EU claims process begins Backpack opened the claim process for former FTX EU exchange users on April 1. To access their claim through the platform, users had to create an exchange account and go through the aforementioned KYC checks. No deadline has been set for users going through the process. The support page clarifies that not all European Union-based FTX users are FTX EU users. Those users who signed up to FTX before March 7, 2022, are not FTX EU users unless they later specifically signed up on the FTX EU platform. The documentation states: “Generally, EU-based users who signed up to FTX on or after March 7, 2022, are FTX EU customers, in which case they should make their claim with FTX EU.“ Still, no rule is set in stone. Backpack explained that some EU-based users signed up to FTX International after March 7, 2022. The exchange recommends checking the terms of service to determine which FTX platform they signed up for. Related: FTX says Backpack acquisition of EU arm has not been approved by court Backpack’s involvement with FTX EU Backpack acquired FTX EU in January 2025 to offer crypto derivatives, including perpetual futures, in Europe. The deal came after a lengthy battle to buy the European arm of the bankrupt exchange. Backpack CEO Armani Ferrante explained at the time that the firm would return FTX EU funds as fast and as safely as possible. Shortly after the acquisition, Backpack clashed with the FTX estate over ownership rights to FTX EU. The US-based FTX estate claimed at the time that the shares of FTX EU remain under the ownership of FTX Europe AG, a subsidiary of FTX. According to the statement, the previously announced transfer of shares to FTX EU’s co-founders, Patrick Gruhn and Robin Matzke, had not yet occurred. “As of today, 100% of the share capital of FTX EU is held by FTX Europe AG, an FTX subsidiary,” the FTX estate claimed.

44522690,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159386,1747051859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BIS Report Reveals Shocking Truth: Capital Controls Fail Against Crypto Capital Flows,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bis-report-crypto-flows/,"Ever wondered if governments can truly put a lid on money moving across borders in the age of digital assets? A recent BIS report from the Bank for International Settlements sheds some fascinating light on this question, and the findings might just surprise you. If you’re involved in or curious about the world of crypto, this report offers crucial insights into how digital currencies interact with traditional financial regulations. Understanding the BIS Report : What Did They Look At? The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is often referred to as the ‘central bank for central banks’. Its reports carry significant weight in global financial circles. Their latest deep dive, analyzing data from 2017 up to mid-2024, focused specifically on the dynamics of cross-border crypto capital flows . They weren’t just looking at how much crypto is moving, but *what* drives that movement and *how* traditional measures, like capital flow management (CFM) tools, impact it. Think of CFM measures as tools governments use to influence money coming in or going out of their country. This could include taxes on foreign exchange transactions, limits on how much money citizens can send abroad, or restrictions on foreign investment. The idea is to manage economic stability, control exchange rates, or prevent speculative attacks on the currency. The Core Finding: Capital Controls Crypto Can’t Contain? Here’s where the BIS report drops a significant insight: traditional capital flow management measures appear to have very little effect on containing crypto capital flows . In fact, the report suggests something even more counterintuitive – these controls might even inadvertently encourage more crypto activity. Why would this be the case? Let’s break it down: Nature of Crypto: Cryptocurrencies are inherently borderless and operate on decentralized networks (mostly). This makes them fundamentally different from traditional money flowing through regulated banks and financial institutions that are subject to national laws. Ease of Access: Setting up a crypto wallet and sending value across the world is often much easier and faster than navigating complex international banking transfers, especially in regions with strict capital controls. Seeking Alternatives: If traditional channels are restricted or expensive due to capital controls, individuals and businesses might turn to crypto as a viable alternative for moving value, whether for investment, trade, or remittances. The report essentially confirms what many in the crypto space have long suspected: the design of decentralized digital assets makes them incredibly resilient to the kinds of top-down financial controls designed for the traditional system. The Unexpected Twist: Do Controls Facilitate Growth? This is perhaps the most intriguing part of the BIS report ‘s findings. The suggestion that capital controls could *facilitate* the growth of crypto trading volume isn’t about regulators endorsing crypto. Instead, it points to a behavioral response. When traditional financial pathways are blocked or made difficult by controls, the relative attractiveness and utility of crypto as a means to bypass these restrictions increase. People look for the path of least resistance, and crypto can often provide that path for cross-border value transfer. Consider a country where it’s difficult to send money abroad or invest in foreign assets due to strict controls. Crypto offers a way around this. This demand, driven by the friction in the traditional system, can boost trading volume and adoption within that specific jurisdiction. Crypto’s Dual Role: More Than Just Speculation? The BIS report highlights that crypto assets aren’t just toys for speculators. They play a dual role: Speculative Investment: Many people buy crypto hoping its price will increase. This is a significant driver of flow, as investors move capital into and out of crypto markets based on price predictions and market sentiment. Trading Instrument/Utility: Crypto, particularly Stablecoins , are used for actual transactions – paying for goods and services, transferring value, and crucially, for remittances. Understanding this dual nature is key to grasping the full impact of crypto on global finance. It’s not just about price charts; it’s increasingly about practical use cases. Focusing on Stablecoins : A Lifeline in Emerging Markets Crypto ? The report specifically calls out Stablecoins , and for good reason. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This stability makes them much more suitable for transactions and value transfer. The BIS report found a strong correlation between Stablecoins usage and factors like remittance costs and transaction demand, especially in Emerging markets crypto environments and developing economies. Why is this significant? In many developing nations, sending or receiving money internationally through traditional channels (like banks or money transfer operators) can be prohibitively expensive, slow, and cumbersome. Fees can eat up a large percentage of the amount sent, a critical issue for families relying on remittances. Stablecoins offer a potential solution: Lower Costs: Transaction fees on crypto networks, while variable, are often significantly lower than traditional remittance fees, particularly for smaller amounts. Speed: Cross-border crypto transactions can settle in minutes or hours, compared to days for traditional transfers. Accessibility: Accessing crypto can sometimes be easier than accessing formal banking services in underserved areas. This correlation highlighted by the BIS report suggests that Stablecoins are gaining traction not just as investment vehicles, but as practical tools for financial inclusion and economic activity in places where traditional finance falls short. What Does This Mean for Financial Inclusion and Stability? The rise of Emerging markets crypto use, particularly involving Stablecoins for transactions, has profound implications that the BIS report urges policymakers to consider: Financial Inclusion: Benefits: Provides access to digital payments and value transfer for unbanked or underbanked populations. Offers cheaper and faster remittance options, potentially putting more money into the hands of recipients. Enables participation in the digital economy. Challenges: Requires access to smartphones and internet, which isn’t universal. Understanding and using crypto can be complex for newcomers. Risk of scams, fraud, and loss of funds due to user error or platform failure. Regulatory uncertainty can create risks for users and businesses. Economic Stability: Challenges: Circumvention of capital controls can undermine a country’s ability to manage its economy and currency. Increased volatility spillover from crypto markets into the domestic economy (though stablecoins mitigate price volatility risk, platform risk remains). Difficulty in monitoring and taxing crypto transactions can impact government revenue. Potential for illicit activities (money laundering, terrorist financing) due to the pseudonymous nature of some crypto transactions. Impact on domestic monetary policy if a foreign-pegged stablecoin becomes widely used. The report doesn’t offer easy answers, but it strongly emphasizes the need for regulators and governments to reconsider their approach. Simply trying to apply old-school capital controls to new-age digital assets isn’t working. Actionable Insights: What Should Regulators and Users Do? Based on the findings of the BIS report , several takeaways emerge: For Regulators and Policymakers: Rethink Strategy: Acknowledge that traditional CFM tools are ineffective against crypto. New, perhaps more nuanced or technology-aware, approaches are needed. Focus on the Edge: Instead of trying to control the decentralized network itself, focus on the points where crypto interacts with the traditional financial system (e.g., exchanges, on/off-ramps). Understand Stablecoins: Recognize the growing role of Stablecoins , particularly in Emerging markets crypto use cases like remittances, and develop policies that balance potential benefits with risks. International Cooperation: Crypto flows are global. Effective regulation requires coordination across borders. Promote Education: Educating the public about the risks and benefits of crypto is crucial. For Crypto Users and Businesses: Be Aware of Risks: Understand the inherent risks in using crypto, including volatility (less so for stablecoins but still relevant for overall portfolios), security, and regulatory changes. Comply Where Possible: While capital controls may be hard to enforce on crypto itself, individuals and businesses are still subject to local laws regarding reporting income, taxes, and permissible transactions. Understand the Landscape: The BIS report shows the dynamic interaction between traditional finance and crypto. Staying informed about regulatory developments is vital. Consider Stablecoins for Utility: If you’re in an Emerging markets crypto environment or need to send/receive cross-border payments, understand how Stablecoins could potentially offer a more efficient alternative, while also being aware of the associated risks (e.g., the stability mechanism of the specific stablecoin). Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Crypto Capital Flows The latest BIS report provides compelling evidence that the digital age is fundamentally altering the landscape of cross-border finance. Traditional Capital controls crypto simply cannot contain, and in some cases, may even push users towards digital alternatives. The report highlights the growing importance of Stablecoins as practical tools, especially in Emerging markets crypto scenarios, where they offer potential solutions for costly remittances and limited financial access. However, this evolution is not without its challenges, posing new questions for financial stability and regulatory oversight. As the world becomes more interconnected digitally, understanding the dynamics of Crypto capital flows is no longer just a niche interest; it’s essential for policymakers, financial institutions, and individuals alike. The BIS report serves as a critical reminder that the tools of the past are insufficient for the financial challenges and opportunities of the future.

More precisely, the NASDAQ-listed firm spent $1.34 billion to acquire 13,390 BTC at an average price of just shy of $100,000. This means that the acquisition was completed sometime in the middle of last week, when BTC last stood within a five-digit price territory.

According to data from Upbit, South Korea’s largest crypto exchange, DOGE accounted for 10.23% of the platform’s $2.86 billion total trading volume, while XRP followed closely with 9.49%, 3% over BTC and ETH. Both tokens exceeded $250 million in volume, compared to $180 million figures for BTC and ETH. The volume changes come against the backdrop of a bullish momentum in the South Korean crypto market that sparked a $1 billion short squeeze last week. The global crypto market cap also revisited its 3-month high of $3.4 trillion over the weekend, per Coingecko. XRP whale activity, institutional interest boost trade numbers Data from market intelligence firm Santiment shows that in the past month, whales have accumulated over 880 million XRP tokens. The market analysis firm asserted that more holders are reportedly growing confident in the token’s growth potential. XRP recently hit a seven-week high of $2.4712 after word spread around social media that global asset management giant BlackRock may be considering applying for an XRP-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). No confirmations have come since, but rumors were stoked following BlackRock’s undisclosed meeting with the US SEC, where the subject of XRP may have been raised. Both XRP and DOGE have risen more than 11% in the past seven days, surpassing Bitcoin’s 10% gain. Ethereum, meanwhile, has jumped nearly 40% over the same period, its largest weekly rise since 2021. “ We subscribe to the view that this was a classic market short-squeeze against an exceptionally one-sided market ,” said Augustine Fan, head of insights at crypto options platform SignalPlus. “ There’s no evidence of significant ETH ETF inflows, suggesting this was purely a native positioning event .” At the time of this publication, XRP is changing hands at 3,405 KRW, up 3% in the last day, while DOGE has surged 8% in the same period. South Korea’s retail momentum recalls ‘Kimchi Premium’ era The trading behavior in South Korea is similar to previous periods of heightened retail speculation, often referred to as the “Kimchi Premium” era, where South Korean traders paid substantial premiums over global prices to chase high-risk crypto assets. Historically, the South Korean crypto market has served as a barometer for retail investor sentiment. According to market watchers, the current rally spells the easing of geopolitical tensions between the United States and Asia. US and Chinese trade officials announced Monday a mutual reduction in tariffs on select goods, from 145% to 30%, for the next 90 days. Traders are supposedly seeing the agreement as a positive development for global markets, including crypto. Crypto ETFs enter South Korea’s presidential race South Korea’s crypto market retail activity spike is also unfolding weeks ahead of a presidential election set for June 3, 2025. Former President Yoon Suk-yeol, a conservative leader, was impeached last month following his declaration of martial law during nationwide protests in December. Kim Moon-soo, the candidate from the ruling People Power Party, announced on Monday that he will vouch for the introduction of spot crypto ETFs in South Korea. His proposal includes institutionalizing digital currencies through legal reforms that “improve middle-class wealth and investor protections.” According to local opinion polls , Democratic Party candidate Lee is leading the race. A Flower Research poll gave Lee a 54% approval rating, with Kim trailing at 20.6%. Reform Party candidate Lee Jun-seok garnered just 6.9%. Another poll by Realmeter placed Lee’s odds of winning at 52%, Kim at 31%, and Lee Jun-seok at 6.3%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Are you watching the charts? The buzz is getting louder: many experts believe the Bitcoin price is gearing up for something big. Could we be on the verge of seeing a brand new BTC ATH ? Let’s dive into what the crypto analysts are saying. Why Are Crypto Analysts Bullish on BTC ATH Potential? According to a recent report by The Block, analysts are pointing to several key factors that suggest Bitcoin has the potential to surpass its previous record high. It’s not just wishful thinking; there are tangible signals they are observing in the market. Vincent Liu, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at quantitative trading firm Kronos Research, highlighted the strong technical momentum Bitcoin has maintained. Despite being near its record highs, BTC has managed to consolidate rather than experience a sharp rejection. This consolidation phase is often seen as a period where the asset gathers strength before a potential upward move. But technical factors aren’t the only drivers. Liu also emphasized the increasing rate of institutional adoption . We’ve seen significant shifts in how large financial players and corporations view Bitcoin. This growing acceptance and investment from institutions are adding substantial buying pressure and legitimacy to the market, creating a solid foundation for potential future gains and potentially pushing the Bitcoin price towards a new peak. The Role of Institutional Adoption in Driving Bitcoin Price The narrative around institutional adoption has been a game-changer for Bitcoin. Unlike previous bull runs that were heavily retail-driven, this cycle has seen unprecedented interest and capital flow from institutions. This includes: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds in major markets have opened the floodgates for easier institutional access to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership. Corporate Treasuries: More companies are considering or already holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a reserve asset. Asset Managers and Funds: Large investment firms are allocating portions of their portfolios to digital assets, including Bitcoin. This influx of sophisticated capital provides deeper liquidity and stability to the market, making large price swings less likely in the short term but building a strong base for sustained growth. Analysts like Liu see this trend as a major propellant for the BTC ATH narrative. What Does Bitcoin Technical Analysis Tell Us? While the fundamental picture looks bright with institutional interest, technical indicators provide insights into short-term price movements and market health. Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, pointed out a crucial technical signal: Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, an RSI reading above 70 suggests the asset is overbought, while a reading below 30 suggests it is oversold. Lucas noted that BTC’s RSI is currently in the overbought zone. What does this mean for the Bitcoin price in the immediate future? Potential Pullback: An overbought RSI can sometimes signal that a short-term price correction or pullback is due as traders take profits. Sideways Consolidation: Alternatively, the market might enter a period of sideways consolidation, where the price moves within a tight range, allowing the RSI to cool down without a significant price drop. Lucas emphasized that a healthy development for the market would be a retest and consolidation above the significant psychological level of $100,000. Establishing strong support above this level would validate the current strength and provide a robust base for further upside potential, paving the way for a new BTC ATH . Navigating Potential Challenges and What Comes After the BTC ATH ? While the outlook is positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential hurdles. Cryptocurrency markets are known for volatility. Regulatory changes, macroeconomic shifts, or unexpected market events could always impact the Bitcoin price trajectory. Furthermore, even if a new BTC ATH is achieved, it doesn’t necessarily mean the price will only go up from there. All-time highs are often followed by periods of price discovery and potential pullbacks as the market digests the new levels. Understanding basic Bitcoin technical analysis can help traders and investors anticipate these movements. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Keep track of both fundamental news (like institutional moves) and technical indicators. Define Your Strategy: Are you a long-term holder or a short-term trader? Your strategy will dictate how you react to market signals. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Volatility is inherent in crypto. DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Analyst opinions are valuable, but always conduct your own thorough research before making investment decisions. The path to a new BTC ATH might not be a straight line, but the underlying factors, including strong technicals and increasing institutional adoption , are building a compelling case according to many crypto analysts . Conclusion: Is a New Bitcoin Price Record Imminent? The confluence of strong technical indicators, like sustained momentum and consolidation near highs, and powerful fundamental drivers, such as increasing institutional adoption , has many crypto analysts optimistic about the prospect of a new BTC ATH . While short-term pullbacks or consolidation are possible, especially given indicators like the RSI, the overall sentiment appears bullish. The ability for Bitcoin to retest and hold key levels, particularly around $100,000, will be a critical test. As always, the crypto market is dynamic, but the signals currently suggest that the potential for a new record-breaking Bitcoin price is definitely on the horizon.

Quintin Boatwright, a Ledger spokesperson, said that a contracted moderator had their account compromised, allowing a bot to post scam messages. Boatwright further assured users that the bot had been deleted and the compromised account had been deleted. Ledger also reported the phishing website to the appropriate authorities. The phishing website asked users for their seed phrase, which is a serious compromise because the website link was posted on the official Ledger Discord channel by an official moderator contracted by the organisation. The seed phrase is an essential series of words that gives a person complete access to the crypto wallet. The compromised moderator account censored anyone warning others about the phishing website. The attacker used a bot to overwhelm the server, disallowing people to speak out against the attack. However, the Ledger team quickly deleted the bot and deactivated the moderator account. The rapid response of Ledger may have prevented any further damage from occurring. Boatwright assured Ledger users that much work had been done to prevent this attack from happening again. Ledger plans to implement various safeguards and new security features to prevent phishing attacks. Social engineering attacks of this kind have increased lately, with multiple attempts at exploiting crypto wallets. This may be a positive sign for crypto security, indicating that hackers may have exhausted traditional techniques and are now resorting to social engineering instead. Ledger has reiterated its rules for customers never to share their seed phrase and never connect their wallet through a link shared on Discord. Despite the bot being swiftly removed from the server, the damage of this attack could not be ascertained immediately. In April, scammers conducted a widespread attack against Ledger users, posting letters requesting seed phrases so that addresses could be validated. The letter included an official logo, ID number, business address, and QR code, all vital elements for a successful phishing campaign. The letter asked Ledger customers to follow the QR link and post their seed phrase for validation. The attackers could conduct the phishing request because they had access to the July 2020 Ledger breach, where customer data was exposed. In 2024, phishing attacks proved to be the most expensive attacks in the industry, costing over $1 billion in losses. Crypto firms are increasing their security to prevent further losses from phishing attempts, including education campaigns to help customers understand the risks of using crypto. The rise of phishing attacks may indicate that hackers have exhausted traditional attack methods. In January 2025, however, a phishing attack on over 9,000 Ethereum users resulted in over $10 million in losses. Crypto users are encouraged to educate themselves on crypto use risks and take extra precautions to protect themselves from phishing attacks. They can use multiple authentication methods to make the hacker’s task even harder. There is a growing need for security experts to work in the crypto industry, to share their expertise, and to make the industry a safer place to trade. Many crypto exchanges have started communicating with other businesses, sharing details about suspicious activity and learning from past mistakes.Q",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|ledger,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|WALLET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-12 12:20:54

Since its first major legal victory in the Ripple v. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) case, XRP’s market cap has more than tripled, driven by optimism around the legal clarity and broader bullish sentiment in the crypto space. On July 13, 2023, District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors on public exchanges. This landmark decision marked a turning point not just for Ripple but for the entire cryptocurrency industry , which had closely followed the SEC’s lawsuit since it began in December 2020. Following that ruling, XRP’s market performance has been outstanding. Finbold research uncovered that between July 13, 2023, and May 12, 2025, the token added an average of $148 million per day to its market capitalization. At the time of the decision, XRP ended the day priced at $0.81 with a market cap of $42.35 billion. As of Monday, May 12, 2025, 669 days later, XRP was trading at $2.43, a 200% price increase. Its market cap has jumped to $141.96 billion, a $99.61 billion gain, or 235%. This equals $4.53 billion in monthly inflows and $1.04 billion weekly on average. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Ripple’s victories in SEC case While the July 2023 ruling was pivotal, Ripple secured other key legal wins in the controversial court battle. For instance, in October 2023, the SEC’s attempt to appeal Judge Torres’s ruling was denied. Then, in April 2024, the court found that Ripple’s institutional XRP sales did not fully constitute unregistered securities offerings. These rulings provided additional short-term boosts to XRP’s price. However, XRP’s rise wasn’t fueled by legal clarity alone. Broader market sentiment, especially after the November 2024 U.S. presidential election, also played a crucial role. The election of a crypto-friendly administration signaled a shift in regulatory tone, helping the token break through the long-standing $1 resistance level. True to expectations under President Donald Trump, the SEC has moved to resolve the case . On May 8, 2025, a proposed settlement was submitted to the U.S. District Court, outlining a $50 million payment from Ripple to the SEC and the return of $75 million in escrowed funds to the company. The agreement also seeks to lift an injunction against Ripple. Once approved, both parties are expected to dismiss their appeals, including Ripple’s challenge to the fine. Unlocking more capital inflow into XRP With the case nearing its end, many market watchers believe this could unlock a new wave of capital inflows into XRP. In particular, hopes are rising that the SEC could soon approve a spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). Notably, in late April, the agency extended its review of Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF application to June 17, 2025 , an action analysts see as procedural. If approved, the ETF could attract institutional interest and drive a price reaction similar to Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) post-ETF surge. Meanwhile, the SEC has until mid-October to decide on other pending applications.

El Salvador owns 6,174 BTC, while Metaplanet now owns 6,796 BTC. Metaplanet owns 622 BTC more than the nation state of El Salvador. Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet, announced the news on X, stating that the company is now competing with nation states. The latest acquisition totals $129 million at current market prices, which amounts to 1,241 BTC at around $102,000 per token, for a local price of ¥14.8 million. The Metaplanet treasury now totals 6,796 BTC. The average price of these holdings is $91,000 per Bitcoin. The treasury commenced in April 2024. The company now has a treasury worth around $707 million. The latest acquisition is the largest purchase to date. Metaplanet is the largest public company holding Bitcoin in Asia, ranked 11th worldwide. BTC Yield, a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) developed by Metaplanet, stands at 38% Q2. The KPI measures Bitcoin accumulation per share, which indicates the current Bitcoin holdings’ impact on shareholder value. BTC Yield hit 95.6% in Q1 2025 and 309.8% in Q4 2024. Metaplanet aims to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. They still have a long way to go, holding around 6,000 BTC. However, the goal seems to motivate the company to unite and achieve a specific target. This is not to mention the added publicity that ultimately benefits a publicly listed company. However, this pales compared to Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR), which holds a massive 555,000 BTC. Gerovich highlighted the company’s commitment to Bitcoin investment, stating that Metaplanet invested around $600 million worth of Bitcoin, which, according to current prices, is worth around $700 million. The profit equates to roughly 16%. The BTC Yield KPI is 170% Year to Date (YTD) as of 2025. Shareholders can use this metric to track the value added to their shares through the Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Metaplanet increased by 3.8% on the Tokyo stock exchange, trading under the ticker symbol 3350.T. In April 2024, Metaplanet commenced its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The goal was to accumulate 10,000 BTC by 2025. Metaplanet passed the halfway mark just last month, which sets them on a steady pace towards their target value. The company has financed its Bitcoin strategy by issuing company bonds to the public. Metaplanet has issued 14 bond offerings to fund the Bitcoin strategy. Recently, Metaplanet issued its latest bond sale worth $21.25 million. The company ranks 11th worldwide in holding a Bitcoin treasury as a publicly listed company. Strategy, the American company owned by Michael Saylor, ranks number one. Metaplanet has reached out to US investors by raising $250 million, intended for a US audience, extending the business’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Metaplanet wishes to locate the US headquarters in Miami, Florida. The company cites many instances where Florida has been conducive to crypto growth. Florida has numerous crypto startups and a public sector that promotes supportive policies for the crypto industry. Metaplanet envisions Miami as a centre of Bitcoin innovation and blockchain technological research. Florida has so many crypto startups because the public sector supports the industry. As a result, the corporate sector feels comfortable investing in blockchain technology, knowing that the public sector will support their efforts. Metaplanet envisions Miami as an appropriate base for their capital formation strategy and Bitcoin accumulation roadmap to 2025 and beyond.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-12 12:24:38

BitGo established its EU headquarters in Frankfurt in 2023, and can now serve both crypto-native firms and traditional financial institutions in a unified framework. Meanwhile, Gemini also recently expanded its European presence by receiving a MiFID II license from Malta’s MFSA, allowing it to launch regulated crypto derivatives across the EU and EEA. While Gemini hasn’t yet secured a MiCA license, it’s building a strong compliance hub in Malta. Meanwhile, the UK is charting its own path with a tougher regulatory framework that was introduced under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025, reclassifying stablecoins as securities and imposing strict oversight on crypto services. BitGo Wins Key EU License BitGo, the well known cryptocurrency custody firm backed by Goldman Sachs, announced that it received regulatory approval to operate across the European Union under the EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). The license was granted by Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin, and is a major milestone in BitGo’s European expansion strategy. With the MiCA license now secured, BitGo can provide digital asset services to a wide range of clients. This includes both crypto-native firms and traditional financial institutions like banks and asset managers. It can do so throughout the entire EU under a unified regulatory framework. (Source: Cerrix ) BitGo was founded in 2013 in Palo Alto, California, and has long been a key player in the crypto space, particularly for its custodial services for assets like Bitcoin. The company took a major step toward solidifying its European presence in 2023 by establishing its EU headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany. Since then, BitGo Europe secured multiple local registrations in various EU countries, including Italy, Spain, Poland, and Greece. The recent approval under MiCA allows BitGo to consolidate these efforts and expand its services seamlessly across the region. While the company has not shared any more details about the specific services it plans to introduce immediately under the MiCA license, it pointed out that the approval happened as BitGo continues to broaden its institutional-grade digital asset offerings. The license now positions BitGo to compete a lot more effectively in the maturing regulatory landscape and cater to the growing demand for compliant crypto custody solutions among European institutions. BitGo’s announcement is part of the broader trend of increased regulatory clarity in Europe. Germany, in particular, became a favored destination for crypto firms seeking MiCA registration. In fact, BaFin recently approved other major players like Bitpanda and Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody. Gemini Expands into European Derivatives Market Gemini, the crypto exchange that was founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, also recently took a big step toward expanding its presence in Europe by securing a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) license from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). Announced on May 9, the license allows Gemini to offer regulated crypto derivatives, including perpetual futures, to advanced traders across the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA). (Source: Gemini ) Mark Jennings, Gemini’s head of Europe, stated that this regulatory milestone moves the firm a lot closer to launching derivatives products for both retail and institutional users in the region. The license was issued to Gemini’s Maltese subsidiary, Gemini Intergalactic EU Artemis, on May 8. While Gemini has not yet received a full Markets in Crypto-Assets license, the firm announced in January that it will use Malta as its compliance hub for the EU’s MiCA framework. The exchange already secured six virtual asset service provider (VASP) registrations in Europe, including one from the MFSA in December of 2024. This growing regulatory footprint positions Gemini perfectly as a serious contender in the European crypto market, especially as interest in derivatives trading continues to surge. The timing of Gemini’s expansion aligns with other trends in the industry. Major players like Coinbase and Kraken have also been ramping up their involvement in derivatives. On May 8, Coinbase revealed a $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, one of the world’s top crypto derivatives platforms. Just days earlier, Kraken confirmed its plan to acquire NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, to offer its own futures products. With the MiFID II license now in hand, Gemini is more than ready to join the growing competition in Europe’s regulated derivatives space. UK Drafts Tough Crypto Laws Meanwhile, the United Kingdom announced sweeping new draft regulations that are specifically aimed at establishing the country as a global leader in digital asset oversight. The proposal was unveiled by Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves on April 29, and it introduces a comprehensive regulatory regime that brings crypto trading, custody, staking, and related services under the same rigorous standards that are applied to traditional financial firms. The move is a very obvious divergence from the EU’s more moderate MiCA framework, which makes the UK’s intent to impose robust requirements around transparency, consumer protection, capital reserves, governance, and market conduct very clear. According to the UK Treasury , the new regulations are being introduced through the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025. It outlines six new regulated activities. These activities are meant to provide clarity for crypto exchanges and service providers, many of whom have previously struggled with regulatory uncertainty in the UK. Companies like Bitget, which operates a global crypto exchange, see the move as a net positive. Bitget COO Vugar Usi Zade welcomed the framework, and explained that the clarity will help exchanges understand exactly which services require authorization from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), like trading, custody, staking, or lending. The rules also impose a two-year transition period, which allows companies time to adjust their internal systems for compliance, including reporting and capital standards. Interestingly, the draft reclassifies stablecoins as securities rather than e-money. This subjects them to new disclosure and redemption obligations. While this change may dampen the use of fiat-backed tokens in payments, it provides a more predictable regulatory path, according to Dante Disparte , chief strategy officer at Circle, the issuer of USDC. Additionally, foreign crypto platforms offering services to UK retail clients will now require FCA approval, which helps close a previously exploited loophole. The new scope also covers crypto staking, with registration required for liquid and delegated staking services, while solo and non-custodial stakers remain exempt. Although some DeFi provisions require further clarity, the overarching goal appears to be structured, enforceable compliance rather than sweeping limitations. The FCA plans to finalize and implement the new framework by 2026 to lay the groundwork for a regulated digital asset market that prioritizes innovation and consumer safety.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-12 13:30:00

For those tracking the volatile world of cryptocurrency, understanding these macro movements is crucial. Recent news regarding temporary US China tariffs reductions could signal a shift worth paying attention to, potentially impacting the broader global economy and, by extension, the crypto market . Understanding the US China Tariffs Announcement According to crypto news outlet @tier10k on X, a significant, albeit temporary, agreement has been reached between the United States and China regarding import tariffs. This development is particularly noteworthy given the ongoing tensions often described as a trade war between the two nations. Here’s a breakdown of the announced changes: US Tariffs on Chinese Goods: Will be temporarily reduced from 145% to 30%. China Tariffs on US Goods: Will be temporarily lowered from 125% to 10%. Duration: Both reductions are set for a 90-day period. Source: Reported by @tier10k on X. This announcement, if confirmed and implemented, represents a notable de-escalation, even if short-lived. The previous tariff rates were exceptionally high, acting as significant barriers to trade and contributing to the friction in the global economy . Why This Tariff Reduction Matters for the Global Economy The friction between the US and China has had a tangible economic impact felt worldwide. Supply chains were disrupted, costs for businesses and consumers increased, and overall investor sentiment often remained cautious due to the uncertainty surrounding the trade war . A temporary reduction in US China tariffs could have several immediate effects: Potential Boost to Trade: Lower tariffs make goods cheaper, potentially increasing the volume of trade between the two countries during the 90-day window. Relief for Businesses: Companies relying on imports or exports between the US and China could see reduced costs, potentially boosting margins or allowing for lower consumer prices. Improved Sentiment: Any sign of cooperation between the two largest economies can be viewed positively by markets, potentially leading to increased confidence. Easing Supply Chain Pressure: While 90 days is short, it could offer temporary relief to supply chains strained by high tariffs. However, it’s crucial to remember the temporary nature of this agreement. The long-term economic impact and the future of the trade war remain uncertain beyond this 90-day period. Potential Impact on the Crypto Market So, how does this news about US China tariffs relate to the world of crypto? The cryptocurrency market doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It is increasingly influenced by macro-economic factors, global liquidity, and investor sentiment in traditional markets. Here are a few ways this development could potentially interact with the crypto market : Risk-On Sentiment: If the easing of trade tensions is perceived as a positive for the global economy , it might encourage a ‘risk-on’ attitude among investors. This could potentially lead to increased investment in assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Capital Flows: Reduced uncertainty or improved economic outlook could influence how capital flows globally. While direct causation is hard to prove, shifts in major economies can indirectly affect the liquidity available for alternative investments like crypto. Store of Value Narrative: Conversely, some view Bitcoin as a hedge against economic instability or currency devaluation. A temporary de-escalation in trade tensions might slightly reduce the urgency of this narrative for some, though the fundamental drivers remain. Overall Market Confidence: Crypto is still a relatively nascent market. Positive news in major economic spheres often correlates with positive sentiment across financial markets, which can spill over into crypto. It’s important to note that the crypto market is also driven by its own unique dynamics, including technological developments, regulatory news, and market cycles. However, ignoring major shifts in the global economy , especially those involving key players like the US and China and their trade war , would be shortsighted for any investor. Navigating the Trade War Landscape: Actionable Insights For those in the crypto market , this temporary tariff reduction offers a moment to pause and consider the broader economic impact : Stay Informed: Keep an eye on further reports regarding this agreement and whether it holds or is extended beyond the 90 days. Follow reliable sources, including those focused on macroeconomics and global trade, alongside your usual crypto news outlets like @tier10k. Assess Market Reactions: Observe how traditional markets (stocks, commodities, currencies) react to this news. Often, crypto’s reaction can follow or correlate with these movements. Consider Diversification: Macro events highlight the interconnectedness of global finance. Ensure your investment strategy accounts for potential volatility driven by factors outside the crypto-specific world. Long-Term Perspective: Remember this is a temporary measure. The underlying strategic and economic competition between the US and China is likely to continue. Don’t base long-term investment decisions solely on a 90-day tariff pause. While this temporary reduction in US China tariffs is positive news from a trade perspective, its lasting economic impact and influence on the global economy and crypto market depend heavily on what happens next. Will this lead to more permanent dialogue, or is it simply a brief pause in the ongoing trade war ? The next 90 days will be telling.

The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels. Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling. “The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.” Joint statement on US-China meeting in Geneva.

Nansen previously predicted a 70% chance for crypto and stocks to find their bottom by June, with their price recovery depending on the outcome of trade negotiations.

Source: Cointelegraph “There is potential for risk assets to move beyond the January peak levels if we see a generous tax cut package materialize,” Barthere told Cointelegraph, adding: “This would need to go beyond merely extending the expiring tax cuts, and include additional income tax reductions as well as corporate tax cuts on top.” She noted that Bessent hinted such a package could be unveiled by mid-July, which would act as a “significant additional catalyst” for the markets. The constructive trade negotiations, paired with emerging technical chart patterns, have spurred analyst calls for a Bitcoin rally to $150,000 , depending on the outcome of an emerging bull flag pattern on the weekly chart.

The crypto industry has evolved since Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin ( BTC ) in 2009. The revolutionary innovation that birthed Bitcoin also paved the way for countless altcoins. While Bitcoin has retained its dominance and uniqueness over the years, the growing number of altcoins has changed how investors view the crypto market. You might also like: Transitioning to a divine economy: A vision for a new civilization | Opinion There was a time when altcoins felt like the next big thing. During the 2017-2018 ICO boom , developers focused on utility, and the total number of tracked altcoins hovered around 3,000. Today, data from CoinMarketCap reveals a staggering figure: over 13 million altcoins now exist. With that, established projects, like Solana ( SOL ), have become the go-to blockchains for memecoins, because creating a memecoin is now as simple as posting a meme. Projects once drove crypto adoption through white papers and tech promises, but now, in a crowded market, attention is the scarcest resource. The quantity crisis: Too many coins, too little value While the official altcoin count is 13.24 million, the actual figure likely exceeds 36 million. In theory, such explosive growth could signal a thriving ecosystem if these tokens delivered real value. Yet, most of the assets in circulation are born out of the lingering memecoin mania. As part of the industry’s evolutionary trend, there has been a shift from a core dev focus to building new products. Today, protocols have solutions for users to launch their tokens with just a few clicks, resulting in a new wave of largely unvetted assets. The crypto industry remains plagued by an old problem—oversaturation. Countless creators treat token launches as get-rich-quick schemes. Most tokens gain relevance based on short-lived hype and lose it shortly after launch. Previous altcoin eras have driven technological breakthroughs, with altcoins, like Ethereum ( ETH ), ushering in a new generation of composable layer-1 solutions with functional smart contracts. This enabled developers to build the foundational applications that gave rise to decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens. Historically, tokens from innovative projects delivered value. This is no longer the case, as too many speculative assets have overshadowed true builders in the industry today. Narrative control, memes takeover The cryptocurrency ecosystem has many layers of stakeholders that keep the industry functional today. In its formative years, venture capital firms played a crucial role by selectively funding projects with strong product-market fit. In the early days of altcoins, VC endorsement served as the gold standard for project credibility, with retail investors closely following these market movers. Today, the crypto industry is undergoing a major shift—away from purely technical development and toward influencer-driven marketing and community-led growth. Now, projects often skip traditional VC funding and go straight to communities via DAOs and viral Telegram or Discord groups. There’s no denying that this trend creates a major concern for the industry, as altcoins hold a distinct position in web3. This year, as much as $70 billion is set to be unlocked from vested altcoins, further diluting the market valuation. In contrast, Bitcoin ETF inflows have reached just $40 billion, a classic case of massive supply and weak demand. Since most technical advancements target mainstream crypto users, it becomes challenging for altcoins with strong fundamentals to compete against memecoins offering instant gains. One may argue that unless meme coins stop consistently outperforming utility-driven altcoins, the market’s true valuation will be dominated by unsustainable assets with fleeting lifespans. With influencers—with their engaged audiences—cutting through the noise faster than any code commit, it’s easy to dismiss this as a distraction, a sign that crypto has lost its way. But what if the opposite is true? What if the hype isn’t replacing development—it’s funding it by bringing liquidity, users, and attention? Influencers will claim the market soon Indeed, any enduring innovation must be built on strong fundamentals, and crypto is no exception. Despite the observable trend of altcoin dominance, the ETH/BTC ratio signals a shift worthy of note. This ratio is a multi-year low, indicating low confidence in altcoins compared to Bitcoin. This signals a broader retreat from risk assets and a return to fundamentals. As altcoins gradually lose relevance, the entire ecosystem—including builders and investors—needs to adapt strategies accordingly. As key drivers of crypto’s evolution, altcoins will ultimately see a focus shift to projects with sustainable revenue models and engaged communities. Attention is becoming as important as the tech itself. Projects can’t just build in a vacuum anymore—if they want to last, they need to figure out how to connect with people and grow real followings around what they are doing to keep them invested, both literally and emotionally. Builders who leverage this transition—shifting dominance from traditional VCs and exchanges to those who shape narratives and mobilize supporters—effectively, will find themselves operating in a more capable ecosystem. They will be defining which tokens thrive and which disappear in a sea of forgotten assets. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Thanks to its fast transactions and low fees, Litecoin remains a favorite among crypto enthusiasts, especially those looking for daily income through mining. But in today’s world, setting up expensive mining rigs isn’t practical for most people. That’s where cloud mining comes in, allowing users to earn daily profits without needing hardware, software, or maintenance. In this guide, we’ll walk through 7 trusted cloud mining platforms where you can earn Litecoin (LTC) daily . These platforms are secure, beginner-friendly, and legally compliant, making them a great option whether you’re new to crypto or just want a steady income stream. 1. FioBit – Best for Daily LTC Profits with Real Mining Hardware FioBit is one of the most reliable cloud mining platforms in 2025. It stands out because it uses real mining equipment, is supported by AI optimization, and is powered by 100% renewable energy. The platform offers daily payouts in Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, and users can easily convert their profits to Litecoin directly from their dashboard. You don’t need to buy or maintain mining rigs. Just choose a mining plan, pay, and watch your balance grow daily. It’s an excellent option for people who want fast, daily income without the stress of technical setups. Here’s a look at the current plans offered by FioBit: FioBit Cloud Mining Plans (2025) Mining Plan Contract Price Duration Daily Profit Total Net Profit Antminer T21 190Th/s $100 1 Day $1.20 $1.20 WhatsMiner M63S+ 424Th/s $200 1 Day $7.00 $7.00 Antminer L7 8.8Gh/s $600 2 Days $16.80 $33.60 Antminer S21 Hyd 335Th/s $1,200 3 Days $37.20 $111.60 Antminer L7 9.3Gh/s $3,600 5 Days $126.00 $630.00 Antminer L7 9.5Gh/s $7,800 6 Days $312.00 $1,872.00 Antminer S21 XP Hyd 473Th/s $16,800 7 Days $840.00 $5,880.00 VolcMiner D1 17Gh/s $32,000 3 Days $2,080.00 $6,240.00 Antminer S21 XP+ Hyd 500Th/s $60,000 2 Days $4,800.00 $9,600.00 Click to visit the FioBit official website to get $100 for free Although these contracts are primarily based on BTC, users can convert their profits into LTC automatically, making FioBit an easy and flexible solution for Litecoin investors. 2. NiceHash – Reliable But Fee-Heavy NiceHash has been around for years and offers a marketplace for mining power. You can rent hashpower and earn various coins, including Litecoin. While it’s relatively secure and widely used, fees can be high, and navigating the system might feel overwhelming for beginners. It doesn’t offer guaranteed profits like FioBit and requires more manual setup. Still, for users comfortable with crypto tools, NiceHash is a decent option. 3. ECOS – Cloud Mining with Daily Payouts ECOS is a cloud mining platform based in Armenia’s free economic zone. It offers contracts for multiple cryptocurrencies and provides daily payouts, including LTC. While the interface is friendly, plans often have longer durations — usually six months to one year — so don’t expect immediate returns like with FioBit. ECOS can be a safe bet if you're planning for the long haul. But it might not be the fastest option if you want daily Litecoin income immediately. 4. TrustMining – Beginner-Friendly LTC Mining TrustMining is another cloud mining provider offering short-term and long-term contracts. They support Litecoin and several other coins, making it easy for new users to start with as little as $50. The platform provides daily returns, although profits vary depending on market fluctuations. TrustMining is a decent choice for smaller investors, but make sure to read the terms clearly. Some contracts include extra service charges that reduce your net return. 5. BitFuFu – Backed by Bitmain BitFuFu has gained popularity due to its connection with Bitmain, one of the biggest names in mining hardware. It offers cloud mining contracts that include Litecoin, and payouts are pretty regular. However, its plans are mostly long-term and better suited for large investors. The main drawback is that it requires a higher upfront investment and doesn’t offer the fast return cycles that FioBit provides. 6. Genesis Mining – Trusted But Slower Payouts Genesis Mining was once the biggest name in cloud mining. While still active in 2025, it focuses more on large-scale clients and institutional contracts. It offers Litecoin cloud mining, but daily returns are relatively low, and many users report slow support response times. If you’re looking for a modern, fast, and beginner-friendly experience, platforms like FioBit or TrustMining might be more suitable today. 7. Binance Pool – Secure but Limited LTC Options Binance, a well-known crypto exchange, also offers mining services through its Binance Pool. While it’s one of the most secure platforms, its Litecoin mining support is limited, and profits are often shared with large pools, which reduces individual earnings. Still, if you’re already using Binance for trading, their mining services can be a convenient add-on. Just don’t expect high daily LTC payouts unless you're investing big. Final Thoughts: Earning Litecoin daily used to be a technical and costly challenge. But thanks to cloud mining platforms like FioBit, it's now possible for anyone to start earning LTC daily, without needing any hardware, coding skills, or mining know-how. FioBit offers short, high-return contracts that pay out daily and can be easily converted into Litecoin. It’s perfect for anyone who wants fast profits, transparent results, and full control over their earnings. Other platforms, such as NiceHash, ECOS, and TrustMining, offer alternatives with their own benefits. But if you want the best mix of speed, profitability, and simplicity, FioBit should be your first stop. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

The news is that the global trade giants have struck a deal to temporarily cut reciprocal tariffs. Specifically, the U.S. will slash tariffs on most Chinese imports from a high of 145% to 30%. Meanwhile, China will lower its duties on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. “We have reached an agreement on a 90-day pause and substantially move down the tariff levels.

Driven by macro tailwinds—including easing tariff tensions and a dovish shift in the Fed’s tone—the breakout aligns with a broader risk-on shift and has seen BTC outperform equities. Importantly, capital rotation into Bitcoin appears sustained, as reflected in the realised cap reaching a new all-time high and ETF inflows exceeding $920 million over the past two weeks. On-chain data also confirms a significant drop in coins held at a loss, with over 3 million BTC returning to profit. Coupled with rising spot volumes and institutional-led ETF flows , Bitcoin now sits on a structurally solid footing. As long as macro conditions remain supportive, short-term dips are likely to be absorbed quickly, reinforcing the upside bias and leaving BTC well-positioned for a potential new leg toward fresh highs. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve has held interest rates steady as concerns rise over both increasing inflation and unemployment, highlighting the risk of stagflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stressed the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, noting the Fed’s need for more data before deciding on further policy action. Despite market expectations of a rate cut by July , the Fed’s stance remains cautious, prioritising price stability over reacting quickly to slowing growth. In the energy sector, crude oil prices have plummeted due to OPEC+’s shift to higher production targets, yet gasoline prices in the US remain firm due to tight refining capacity and seasonal demand. This divergence, driven by refinery bottlenecks and widening crack spreads , suggests that retail fuel costs may only ease if these supply issues resolve and oil prices stay low. The highly touted US-UK trade agreement also offers limited economic relief, even though there are now reductions on select goods like UK vehicles and US agricultural exports. However, the deal lacks comprehensive scope, offering modest gains while broader trade challenges remain unresolved. Adding to economic strain, US labour productivity declined for the first time in nearly three years while unit labour costs surged, exacerbated by tariffs and trade disruptions. Businesses are struggling with rising compensation costs and reduced efficiency, which may lead to tighter margins and hesitant investment, unless productivity rebounds or trade tensions ease. In the cryptosphere, new developments signal rising institutional and governmental interest in crypto markets, though political and regulatory hurdles remain. New Hampshire has taken a bold step in financial innovation, becoming the first US state to enact a law permitting investment in cryptocurrencies and precious metals. This move reflects the growing state-level momentum around digital asset integration amid evolving national policy debates. Meanwhile, legislative gridlock in Washington continues. The US Senate narrowly failed to advance the GENIUS Act by a vote of 48-49, with three senators not voting and a motion to reconsider filed. This highlights the current difficulties in reaching a bipartisan consensus on key economic and innovation-focused legislation.In the private sector, BlackRock deepened its regulatory engagement by meeting with the SEC to discuss introducing staking features and refining options trading rules for crypto ETFs. The meeting marks a significant development in crypto asset regulation, with BlackRock advocating for staking in Ethereum-based ETFs and broader product functionality. It also reflects a shifting regulatory tone as the SEC becomes more active in shaping the digital asset space.

44525152,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159373,1747057209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Breakthrough: Korean Presidential Candidate Vows to Allow Spot Crypto ETFs,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/korean-candidate-crypto-etfs/,"The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and political landscapes are increasingly reflecting this shift. In a significant development for the digital asset space, especially within East Asia, a prominent figure in South Korean politics has thrown his support behind a move long awaited by many investors: the introduction of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). South Korea Crypto Policy Takes Center Stage in Election As South Korea gears up for its 21st presidential election, the topic of digital assets is unexpectedly taking a central role in policy discussions. Traditionally, economic policies might focus on traditional markets, housing, or employment, but the growing influence and adoption of cryptocurrencies have brought them into the political spotlight. This election cycle appears to be one where candidates are recognizing the significant portion of the electorate involved in or interested in the crypto market. The pledge by Kim Moon-soo, a presidential candidate representing the People Power Party (PPP), highlights a potential shift in the official stance towards digital assets. His inclusion of allowing spot crypto ETFs within his top 10 policy promises signals a strategic move to appeal to a demographic increasingly invested in this new asset class. This focus on crypto policy suggests that politicians are beginning to view digital assets not just as a fringe topic, but as a legitimate area for economic policy development. Spot Crypto ETFs South Korea: The Core Pledge The most impactful part of Kim Moon-soo’s announcement is his clear commitment to enabling spot crypto ETFs in South Korea. For those unfamiliar, a spot crypto ETF is an investment fund that directly holds the underlying cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) as opposed to futures contracts or other derivatives. These ETFs are designed to track the real-time price of the cryptocurrency, offering investors a more direct exposure without the complexities of buying and storing the digital assets themselves. Why is this significant for Spot crypto ETFs South Korea? Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making it easier for retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to crypto through familiar brokerage accounts. Regulation & Oversight: ETFs are subject to regulatory oversight, potentially offering a layer of investor protection that individual crypto exchanges might not always provide. Institutional Capital: Spot ETFs can attract significant institutional investment, which has historically been hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies due to regulatory and custodial concerns. Market Legitimacy: The approval of spot ETFs by regulatory bodies is often seen as a sign of legitimacy and maturity for the underlying asset class. This pledge directly addresses a key barrier for many potential investors and could significantly broaden participation in the Korean crypto market. What This Means for the Korean Crypto Market The potential introduction of spot crypto ETFs could have a transformative effect on the Korean crypto market. South Korea already has a highly active and tech-savvy population with a significant interest in digital assets. However, regulatory uncertainties have sometimes created hurdles for both investors and businesses in the space. The approval of spot ETFs could lead to: Increased Liquidity: More accessible investment vehicles typically lead to higher trading volumes and market depth. Price Impact: Increased demand from both retail and institutional investors flowing through ETFs could potentially have a positive impact on the prices of the underlying cryptocurrencies traded in the Korean market. Innovation: A more favorable regulatory environment signaled by ETF approval could encourage further innovation in the Korean blockchain and crypto sector. Global Standing: Becoming one of the first major economies in Asia to approve spot crypto ETFs could bolster South Korea’s position as a leader in the digital asset space. Kim Moon-soo frames this pledge within a broader campaign theme focused on enhancing middle-class asset growth. By making crypto investment more accessible and potentially safer through regulated products like ETFs, he aims to provide new avenues for citizens to build wealth in what he describes as a nation of opportunity. This explicitly links digital asset policy to traditional economic goals. Korean Presidential Candidate Crypto Stance Explained Kim Moon-soo’s stance on crypto is not entirely new. His current pledge builds upon previous ideas he has floated regarding digital assets. During an earlier primary race within the People Power Party, he proposed the creation of a dedicated digital asset secretary within the presidential office. This earlier proposal indicates a consistent belief that digital assets require focused attention at the highest levels of government. Having a specific office or secretary dedicated to digital assets could streamline the development of Digital asset regulation Korea, coordinate policy across different ministries, and provide a central point of contact for the industry. This proactive approach suggests the candidate views digital assets as a significant sector requiring dedicated governmental strategy, not just piecemeal regulation. His current policy pledge on spot ETFs is a concrete action point stemming from this broader view. It’s a specific, tangible policy that resonates directly with investors and the crypto industry, making his Korean presidential candidate crypto position clear and actionable. Digital Asset Regulation Korea: A Look Ahead The path to implementing such a policy is not without its challenges. Digital asset regulation Korea has been evolving, with efforts to enhance investor protection and combat illicit activities. Introducing spot crypto ETFs would require careful consideration and likely new frameworks from financial regulators like the Financial Services Commission (FSC). Key regulatory hurdles might include: Custody Rules: Establishing secure and compliant custody solutions for the underlying cryptocurrencies held by the ETFs. Valuation Methods: Defining reliable and transparent methods for valuing the assets within the ETF. Investor Protection: Ensuring adequate safeguards are in place for investors, including clear disclosure requirements. Market Surveillance: Implementing robust systems to monitor trading and prevent market manipulation. The success of implementing this pledge would depend heavily on cooperation between the executive branch, legislative bodies, and financial regulators. While a candidate’s pledge is a strong signal, navigating the regulatory landscape requires significant effort and consensus building. Benefits and Challenges Summary Potential Benefits Potential Challenges Increased investor access and participation Navigating complex regulatory approvals Attraction of institutional capital Ensuring robust custody and security Enhanced market legitimacy and liquidity Developing appropriate valuation standards Alignment with middle-class asset growth goals Protecting investors from potential risks Potential boost to the Korean crypto sector Political opposition or delays This table provides a snapshot of the potential positive outcomes versus the obstacles that would need to be addressed should this policy move forward. Conclusion Kim Moon-soo’s pledge to allow spot crypto ETFs is a significant moment for the Korean crypto market and South Korea crypto policy. By including this specific digital asset policy in his top election promises, he is directly acknowledging the importance of cryptocurrencies to a segment of the population and proposing a concrete step towards integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. While the path to implementation involves overcoming regulatory hurdles and gaining broader political support, the fact that a major Korean presidential candidate crypto stance is so explicitly pro-ETF signals a potential turning point for Digital asset regulation Korea and the future of Spot crypto ETFs South Korea.

In the Nevada desert last November, a crypto entrepreneur, fresh off hosting a blockchain event in downtown Las Vegas, saw kidnapping at gunpoint and lost $4 million in cryptocurrency and NFTs. According to police reports , three teenagers executed the kidnapping, confronting the man at his home before whisking him away to an isolated desert location. The harrowing details emerged in a report from 8 News Now on May 10. The suspects allegedly warned the victim that they had his father and would kill him if he didn’t cooperate. Under threat of death, he was coerced into revealing passwords to his digital wallets. Throughout the ordeal, a fourth person reportedly gave instructions to the teens via speakerphone. Once the attackers drained his accounts, the victim was left stranded in the desert. He trekked five miles through rugged terrain to reach a gas station, where he was finally able to call a friend for help. Kidnapping Suspects Face Serious Charges Two 16-year-olds from Florida have now been charged with robbery, kidnapping, and extortion. One is being held on a staggering $4 million bail, while the other is under house arrest with electronic monitoring. Prosecutors say a third teen believed to be involved has already fled the country. A preliminary court hearing has been scheduled for June, and both minors will be tried as adults. Digital asset attorney Sasha Hodder reacted to the case on X, stating, “Crypto theft is evolving. It’s not just social engineering or SIM swaps anymore.” Her warning underscores a disturbing shift from digital exploits to physical coercion. Rise in Real-World Crypto Crimes This case is just one in a string of offline crypto-related crimes . Earlier this month, a crypto entrepreneur’s father was rescued in Paris after facing kidnapping in a €7 million ($7.8 million) extortion plot. In February, a UK-based broker jumped off a balcony to escape captors demanding crypto under threat of torture. Jameson Lopp, co-founder of self-custody firm Casa, has been tracking these incidents. His GitHub list documents over 20 in-person crypto robberies so far in 2025 alone, with similar cases going back to 2014—when Hal Finney was allegedly extorted for 1,000 Bitcoin.

Pepe, Pepeto, Dogwifhat, Bonk or Floki?",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/which-meme-coin-to-buy-now-pepe-pepeto-dogwifhat-bonk-or-floki/,"The post Why are Meme Coins Dominating 2025? Which Meme Coin to buy now? Pepe, Pepeto, Dogwifhat, Bonk or Floki? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In today’s rapidly shifting crypto landscape, meme coins are no longer just jokes; they are powerful financial instruments. As the bull market gains momentum, tokens like Pepe, Dogwifhat, Bonk, and Floki have already proven their potential, each delivering gains of over 1,000 percent for early believers. These coins show what is possible when timing meets hype, and that is why meme coins are increasingly seen as one of the smartest plays in crypto today. But while those projects have already made headlines, a new name is emerging: Pepeto. Still in its presale phase and priced at fractions of a cent, Pepeto offers the kind of early entry point that historically leads to life-changing returns. With zero-fee trading, cross-chain compatibility, and major listings on the horizon, Pepeto presents a rare chance to get in before the wave. As history has shown, wealth in crypto is not just built by buying the biggest names, but by spotting the next big thing before the crowd. Pepeto Presale Gains Attention as It Builds the Next Meme Coin Exchange Hub In the current cycle of meme coin innovation, the smartest opportunities often lie in the earliest stages—before public listings and major hype begin. This is the foundation of every successful ICO: access to a token while its price is still low and its roadmap is still unfolding. Pepeto, now in presale, offers exactly that. Unlike many meme coins that stall at viral success, Pepeto introduces real infrastructure, including its own zero-fee exchange designed to support both emerging and established tokens like Shiba, Bonk, Dogwifhat, Floki, and Pepe. While Shiba introduced swap capabilities, Pepeto expands on this model by combining meme coin appeal with cross-chain support and an open listing strategy for new projects. It’s a strategic move at the intersection of timing, utility, and adoption—positioning Pepeto as a key player in the next phase of crypto growth. Pepeto Presale Builds Momentum as Rumors Tie It to Pepe’s Origins and Tier 1 Listing As meme coin narratives continue to dominate 2025’s bullish market, Pepeto is quickly emerging as one of the most talked about presale opportunities. Priced at just $0.000000128 and sharing the exact same max supply of 420 trillion tokens as Pepe, Pepeto has sparked renewed speculation about its origins. Community rumors continue to grow that an ex founder of Pepe, allegedly cut out before its launch, is now behind Pepeto, rebuilding the vision and restoring the value that was lost when Pepe was rushed to market. The upcoming listing of Pepeto on a tier 1 exchange is expected to significantly boost visibility and credibility, supported by a wave of planned marketing campaigns and a renewed push to reveal the untold story behind the original Pepe documents. As more investors begin shifting away from saturated meme tokens like Solaxy, Bonk, and even Pepe itself, attention is turning toward Pepeto’s lower entry point, promising utility, and cleaner narrative. If timing, structure, and story matter in crypto, as history suggests, Pepeto could be the project that defines this cycle’s next breakout. The presale is nearing its end ahead of exchange listings. Investors can still grab $PEPETO at $0.000000128 via pepeto.io. Payment options include USDT, ETH, BNB, and card payments through MetaMask or Trust Wallet.

Having suspended bullish, it currently appears weak daily. The month of April was quite eventful for Venice’s VVV as it recovered nicely from a two-month bearish phase with a closing gain of 150% in the space of two weeks. That brought a notable relief in the bleeding and the market sentiment quickly turned bullish. Unfortunately, it lost momentum after failing to push above the $5.34 level in the first day of this month. Recovering briefly from the $3.46 support level this week, it faced another rejection and remained calmly above the key $4 level throughout yesterday. Following a 7% loss today, VVV lost this key level and now looks weak on the daily chart. A drop below the mentioned weekly support could trigger more reductions until it finds a solid support level for a rebound. Despite that, there’s still hope for the bulls. If they manage to intercept the ongoing drop above this week’s support, we can anticipate a rebound with a new bullish signal in the form of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. If that comes into play, a huge bullish rally should be expected. VVV’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview As VVV takes a downturn today, the potential support level to watch is $3.46. A breakdown there could bring us back to the $2.38 support that flipped as resistance during April’s recovery. The main support level to keep in mind is $1.8 in case of more drawdowns. If the buying volume increases, we can expect a climb back to the $5.34 resistance level. A break through it could propel more surge to the $6.84 and $8.95 resistance level before rallying hard. Key Resistance Levels: $5.34, $6.84, $8.95 Key Support Levels: $3.46, $2.38, $1.8 Spot Price: $3.92 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The news has seen Bitcoin and many of the best altcoins surge again, reflecting the power of world headlines to nudge the needle. Trump himself broke the good news of the ceasefire on Saturday in a Truth Social post . The conflict officially started on May 7, 2025, after India launched multiple rockets into Pakistani territory as part of Operation Sindoor . India justified the attack by invoking Pakistan’s April 22 Pahalgam attack, which resulted in 26 civilian deaths. The war between the two nuclear powers could’ve had a different outcome were it not for Trump’s prompt intervention. The US President congratulated the two countries for reaching an immediate ceasefire and potentially saving millions of lives as a result. Vice President, JD Vance’s also addressed the conflict in an interview with Fox News , three days ago, where he said: ‘What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit, but we’re not going to get involved in the middle of a war that’s fundamentally none of our business. Our hope and our expectation is that this will not spiral into a nuclear war.’ Fortunately, the two parties involved in the conflict reached a consensus after Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, discussed the matter with both Indian and Pakistani officials. Following the ceasefire, India and Pakistan are expected to hold broader talks on a neutral platform to seek long-lasting peace. Positive Macro News Trigger a New Bull Run Aside from avoiding a nuclear holocaust across the Middle East and South Asia, the relief of a ceasefire may have lit a fire under Bitcoin over the weekend, with $BTC peaking at $105,626, according to CoinMarketCap . The news was part of several hopeful geo-political developments this past weekend, including renewed tariff talks between China and the US, and Russian President Putin saying on X that he was “in the mood for serious talks with Ukraine.” The combined effect has been that Bitcoin is pushing to $105K again as we speak, standing just above $104K at the time of writing. This is not only good news for Bitcoin, but for several new crypto projects as well. Here are three of the best altcoins that could reward your vote of confidence with a juicy ROI if you act now. 1. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – AI-Driven Content Creator Offering Exclusive Rewards and Tools SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is the token behind the first AI-driven content creator platform.

SUBBD Token relies on tools like the AI Assistant to manage the post-production process, giving creators more time to create engaging content for their fans. The AI Creator is another innovative tool that lets users create, market, and monetize their virtual content creator, exploiting a niche that could prove very lucrative. SUBBD Token is one of the best presales right now , having accumulated over $375K in no time. $SUBBD currently stands at $0.055375 and comes with fixed staking rewards of 20% APY.

BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Meme Coin Project Offering Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the hottest meme coins today because it offers investors $BTC airdrops as Bitcoin grows by $50K. The first airdrop is scheduled for the $150K price point, while a massive $BTCBULL airdrop of 10% of the total token supply is scheduled for when Bitcoin reaches $250K.

Pi Network ($PI) – Cryptocurrency You Can Mine On Your Phone Pi Network ($PI) is the first cryptocurrency you can mine on your phone thanks to its Stellar Consensus Protocol . The decentralized network makes mining easier and more affordable than ever, reducing the electricity footprint and making it more accessible to more people. You no longer need a high-end PC or a specific mining device to get your crypto; your phone will do. More importantly, the mining process won’t stress your device and won’t drain your phone’s battery either. It’s easy to see why $PI is trending on CoinMarketCap , with a 30-day token boost of 105% and a market cap increase of 44%. $PI currently stands at $1.31, but it seems to be on a bull run. If you’ve never fulfilled your dream of becoming a crypto miner, this may be the perfect time to do it. The project enjoys a positive community sentiment of 88% and a lot of FOMO-inducing hype on social media, so tune in while it lasts. Recent World Events May Have Angered The Meanest Bitcoin Bull in Recent Times Bitcoin’s steroid-fueled run slowed down after it surpassed the critical threshold of $105K, but it definitely didn’t stop. If anything, $BTC’s chart performance over the weekend is a reminder of how world events, both positive and negative, can impact the crypto-sphere. Now, the end of the India-Pakistan conflict could signal the start of the bull era, not only for Bitcoin but for altcoins like SUDDB Token ($SUBBD) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . Remember, this isn’t financial advice. Even in a bull environment, the crypto market remains volatile and unpredictable.

BTC: VanEck’s onchain economy ETF launch on May 14 VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF , with the ticker NODE, is scheduled to begin trading on May 14, 2025. As the first actively managed ETF focused on the crypto and blockchain sector, it will allocate across stocks of companies involved in digital assets, decentralized infrastructure, and on-chain applications, with up to 25% exposure to crypto-linked ETPs. The momentum of VanEck’s ETF could further fuel Bitcoin ( BTC )’s ongoing rally after it surpassed the $105k mark. METIS: Andromeda Network Upgrade on May 14 On May 14, Metis will activate its Andromeda Upgrade, the first phase of its “ReGenesis” evolution. This upgrade introduces on-chain fraud proofs and migrates data availability onto Ethereum ( ETH ) mainnet blobs, enhancing security and decentralization on Metis Layer 2.

STX: sBTC Cap Increase on May 15 On May 15, Stacks ( STX ) will enact its third sBTC cap increase, raising the total deposit cap from 2,000 BTC up to 5,000 BTC. This move unlocks additional Bitcoin collateral within the Stacks DeFi environment, enabling more users to mint sBTC, which is a Bitcoin-backed ERC-20 token, for decentralized lending and trading.

In a post on X Monday, Schiff argued that reducing tariffs is a loss for Washington. According to an official statement from the White House, the United States and China have agreed to a temporary rollback of trade tariffs following two days of talks in Geneva. The deal suspends some duties by as much as 115% for 90 days. Tariffs on Chinese imports would be reduced to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US goods would remain at 10%. “ China called America’s bluff and won, ” Schiff wrote . “ The ‘great’ China trade deal simply pauses Trump’s trade war for 90 days. We’re back to where we were before, except Americans are now paying 30% tariffs while the Chinese are only paying 10% .” Has Trump lost the trade war, or is China conceding? Per one commenter on Schiff’s post , data from the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) places average US tariffs on Chinese exports at 124.1% from 2019 to 2025. The Tax Foundation estimates that US households will bear an average cost of $1,300 due to tariffs in 2025. “ The deal just kicks the can down the road ,” they said, adding that the short-term pause does very little for Americans if China’s currency valuation or the long-term trade deficit is not addressed. In response, Schiff noted, “ I doubt Trump goes back to 145%. But there’s a lot of added uncertainty. ” The 62-year-old stockbroker predicted that American businesses would rush to place orders before the 30% rate expires. There is no outcome. We just have lower tariffs for 90 days than the ones we already imposed on ourselves since Liberation Day. So nothing had changed other than we agreed to harm ourselves less for now. China has higher tariffs now then they did before Liberation Day. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) May 12, 2025 Over the weekend, officials on both sides described the Geneva negotiations as “positive.” US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer stated that the agreement would help reduce the country’s $1.2 trillion trade deficit. US Treasury Secretary Bessent, an official involved in the talks, called the outcome “substantial progress.” President Trump also celebrated the results through a social media post on Truth Social, claiming that “change had been negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner.” “ We want to see, for the good of both China and the US, an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!! ” the US president posted. The White House Fact Sheet addressing the negotiations reported that America will retain some of existing duties. Tariffs imposed before April 2, 2025, including those under Section 301, Section 232, and those related to the fentanyl emergency and Most Favored Nation status, will remain in place. When asked about rumors that the timing of the tariff reductions was meant to benefit Trump’s business friends, Schiff replied, “ Most likely. That’s why Trump said 80% seemed right, knowing he already gave Bessent the green light to go to 30%. I’m sure Trump insiders made a bundle .” Optimism or delay? Statements from both delegations may have spelled that the war is coming to an end, but both countries are still in talks over several policies. If no concessions are made by the end of the 90-day window, the standoff will likely continue. Chinese commerce ministry diplomat Li Chenggang stated that China has always pursued “win-win outcomes” in trade negotiations. “Any possible deal to be reached will definitely be in the development interest of China’s own,” he told reporters earlier today. The joint statement from the delegations confirmed plans for continued negotiations in the US, China, or a neutral location. Talks will reportedly now focus on increasing China’s purchases of American goods, almost similar to a commitment made during the 2020 trade war. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Alt Season is here again with meme coins gaining the spotlight in the past weeks, although Base projects like Toshi, Ponke and Ski stole the show during yesterday’s rally following an over 50% increase in a single day. Skicat was not left behind in the increase as it regained momentum this week after staying well above the $0.00065 level, which now stands as support on the daily chart. Facing multiple rejections under $0.00195, the buying pressure has stopped and is now looking weak on the day. This weakness has caused a minor reduction and is now changing hands at around $0.00113 at the time of writing. A further daily rejection could bring more setbacks in the market with a potential reset to the bottom.

Recent reports suggest that American investment banking behemoth, JPMorgan, is significantly increasing its exposure to Bitcoin ETF products, with holdings reportedly approaching a staggering $1.7 billion. This development, shared by crypto commentator Crypto Rover on X, points towards a growing trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption, a narrative that has gained considerable momentum since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Unpacking the News: What Are JPMorgan’s Reported Holdings? According to the information shared, JPMorgan’s substantial exposure is primarily concentrated in two leading spot Bitcoin ETFs: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ). While specific details regarding the exact breakdown between IBIT FBTC holdings were not immediately available in the initial report, the combined figure signals a significant commitment from one of the world’s most influential financial institutions. This move is particularly noteworthy given JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s historically skeptical stance on Bitcoin, highlighting a potential shift in the bank’s strategy regarding digital assets, or at least its willingness to facilitate client access to the asset class through regulated investment vehicles. Let’s consider the context: Spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched in the U.S. in January 2024. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity launched their own ETFs, quickly accumulating billions in assets under management (AUM). JPMorgan, as a prime broker and wealth manager, is positioned to facilitate client access to these new investment products. The reported Bitcoin ETF Holdings by JPMorgan could represent proprietary trading, client investments facilitated by the bank, or a combination of both. Regardless of the exact allocation, the sheer magnitude of the reported figure underscores the increasing comfort level and demand within traditional finance for regulated Bitcoin investment avenues. Why is JPMorgan’s Involvement in Bitcoin ETFs So Significant? JPMorgan Chase & Co. is not just any bank; it’s a global leader in financial services, with vast assets under management and deep ties to institutional and high-net-worth investors. Their reported large-scale engagement with Bitcoin ETF products sends a powerful signal to the market for several reasons: Validation: Despite previous skepticism from its leadership, JPMorgan’s substantial holdings lend a degree of legitimacy and validation to Bitcoin as an asset class in the eyes of mainstream finance. Accessibility: By holding and potentially offering access to IBIT and FBTC, JPMorgan makes it easier for its vast network of clients, including large institutions and wealthy individuals, to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Liquidity and Market Depth: Large purchases by institutions like JPMorgan contribute to the liquidity and overall market depth of Bitcoin ETFs, potentially making them more attractive to other large investors. Trend Indicator: This move could be indicative of a broader trend among other major banks and financial institutions that are now more willing to engage with crypto assets through regulated products. For years, the crypto community eagerly awaited the arrival of institutions. This reported development with JPMorgan, coupled with the success of ETFs like IBIT and FBTC , suggests that institutional adoption is not just coming; it’s already here in a meaningful way. The Role of IBIT and FBTC in Driving Institutional Bitcoin Adoption BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC have quickly emerged as frontrunners in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market. Their success is not accidental. Backed by the reputations and distribution networks of their parent companies, these ETFs have attracted significant inflows since their launch. JPMorgan’s reported IBIT FBTC holdings are a direct consequence of the success and accessibility offered by these specific products. What makes these ETFs attractive to institutions? Regulatory Clarity: Operating within a regulated framework (like the U.S. exchange-traded fund structure) provides a level of comfort that direct Bitcoin ownership might not for many institutions. Ease of Access: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them easy to buy and sell through existing brokerage accounts and infrastructure. Custody Handled: The ETF structure handles the complexities and risks associated with directly holding and securing Bitcoin. Liquidity: High trading volumes in ETFs like IBIT and FBTC ensure that large positions can be entered or exited relatively easily. The reported size of JPMorgan’s Bitcoin ETF Holdings highlights the effectiveness of the ETF structure in bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, facilitating significant Institutional Bitcoin investment. Comparing Institutional Stances: Is JPMorgan an Outlier? While JPMorgan’s reported $1.7 billion figure is substantial and attention-grabbing, they are not the only major financial institution engaging with Bitcoin ETFs. Other banks and investment firms have also disclosed holdings in their regulatory filings. However, the size attributed to JPMorgan in this report positions them among the more significant players currently reported. Historically, major banks have held varying stances on Bitcoin: Institution Historical Stance (General) Current Engagement (Post-ETF) JPMorgan Often skeptical (CEO Jamie Dimon) Reported significant Bitcoin ETF Holdings (IBIT, FBTC) BlackRock Shifted from cautious to proactive (launched IBIT) Leading spot Bitcoin ETF provider Fidelity Early explorer of crypto, offered custody Leading spot Bitcoin ETF provider (FBTC) Goldman Sachs Explored crypto trading/services Offering some crypto-related services, likely facilitating ETF access Morgan Stanley Offered limited Bitcoin exposure to clients Likely facilitating client access to ETFs This table illustrates that while direct holdings vary, the trend towards facilitating access to Institutional Bitcoin via ETFs is widespread among major financial players. JPMorgan’s large reported position underscores the potential scale of this trend. What Does This Level of Bitcoin ETF Holdings Mean for the Market? The accumulation of significant Bitcoin ETF Holdings by institutions like JPMorgan has several potential implications for the broader crypto market: Increased Demand: Large institutional buys create consistent demand pressure on Bitcoin, as ETF providers purchase BTC to back the shares bought by investors. Price Impact: Sustained institutional demand can contribute positively to Bitcoin’s price, especially as supply is limited (e.g., via the halving events). Reduced Volatility (Potentially): As more long-term focused institutional capital enters the market via ETFs, it could potentially lead to a more stable market structure over time, although Bitcoin is known for its volatility. Further Adoption: JPMorgan’s move might encourage other hesitant institutions to explore Crypto Institutional Adoption , creating a virtuous cycle of mainstream acceptance. Integration with Traditional Finance: It accelerates the integration of Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios and financial planning. While it’s crucial to remember that market movements are influenced by many factors, the scale of institutional engagement through ETFs like IBIT and FBTC is undoubtedly a major bullish factor for Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. Actionable Insights for Investors What can individual investors glean from this news about JPMorgan Bitcoin ETF holdings and the broader trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption? Monitor Institutional Flows: Keep an eye on reports and regulatory filings (like 13F forms in the U.S.) that disclose institutional holdings in Bitcoin ETFs. These can provide insights into the pace and scale of adoption. Understand the ETF Mechanism: Recognize that buying a Bitcoin ETF is different from owning Bitcoin directly. While it offers convenience, you don’t control the private keys. Consider Your Own Strategy: If institutions are adding Bitcoin exposure, evaluate whether it fits within your own investment strategy and risk tolerance. ETFs like IBIT and FBTC offer regulated ways to do this. Diversification: Bitcoin is still a volatile asset. Even with institutional backing, it’s essential to approach it as part of a diversified portfolio. Stay Informed: The landscape of Crypto Institutional Adoption is rapidly changing. Follow reliable news sources to stay updated on regulatory developments, new products, and institutional moves. The fact that a titan like JPMorgan is reportedly holding significant Bitcoin ETF Holdings underscores the shift in how the financial world views this asset class. It’s moving from the fringes to becoming a legitimate, albeit still evolving, part of the global financial ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption While the news about JPMorgan and the success of ETFs like IBIT and FBTC are overwhelmingly positive for the narrative of Institutional Bitcoin , it’s important to acknowledge that challenges remain: Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved in the U.S., the global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still fragmented and evolving. Future regulations could impact institutional strategies. Market Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. Institutions must navigate significant price swings, which can impact their portfolio performance and risk management. Custody and Security (for direct holders/providers): While ETFs handle custody for the end investor, the underlying security of the Bitcoin held by ETF providers remains a critical consideration. Public Perception: Despite growing acceptance, skepticism about cryptocurrencies persists in some traditional financial circles and among the general public. These challenges mean that the path of Crypto Institutional Adoption , while promising, may not always be smooth. However, the reported actions of major players like JPMorgan suggest a commitment to navigating these complexities. Looking Ahead: The Future of Institutional Bitcoin ETF Holdings The current trajectory suggests that Bitcoin ETF Holdings by institutions are likely to continue growing. As more financial advisors and wealth managers become comfortable recommending these products, and as more institutions allocate capital, the inflows into ETFs like IBIT and FBTC could increase further. Potential future developments include: More banks and institutions disclosing significant holdings. Increased integration of Bitcoin ETFs into traditional investment platforms and model portfolios. Potential approval of other crypto-related ETFs (e.g., spot Ethereum ETFs), further expanding the avenues for Crypto Institutional Adoption . Greater research and analysis of Bitcoin as an asset class from traditional financial research desks. The reported $1.7 billion figure for JPMorgan is not just a number; it’s a data point illustrating a significant shift in the financial landscape. It signifies that Bitcoin, through regulated products, is increasingly becoming a part of the institutional investment conversation and portfolio allocation. Conclusion: A New Era of Institutional Engagement The news that JPMorgan’s Bitcoin ETF Holdings are reportedly nearing $1.7 billion, concentrated in prominent funds like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC , marks a pivotal moment in the journey of Institutional Bitcoin adoption. It underscores the effectiveness of the ETF structure in providing a bridge between the traditional financial world and the burgeoning digital asset space. While challenges remain, the willingness of a financial titan like JPMorgan to accumulate such substantial positions signals growing confidence and acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This trend of Crypto Institutional Adoption is poised to reshape the market, bringing increased liquidity, validation, and potentially greater stability over the long term. For investors, it highlights the increasing accessibility of Bitcoin exposure through regulated and familiar investment vehicles, solidifying its place in the modern financial ecosystem.

Global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs ) recorded $6.3 billion of inflows in the past four weeks, accounting for 93% of total inflows year-to-date (YTD), according to data from European crypto investment firm CoinShares. Total YTD inflows now stand at $6.7 billion, closing in on the record $7.3 billion posted in early February, according to CoinShares’ head of research James Butterfill. Weekly crypto ETP inflows since late 2024. Source: CoinShares Amid strong investor demand, crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States reached a record $62.9 billion in cumulative net inflows since launch in January 2024, surpassing the previous high of $61.6 billion set in February, Butterfill noted in a May 12 fund flows update. US-China trade deal could shed light on Bitcoin’s use case Bitcoin’s potential price reaction to a trade deal between the United States and China could give insights into whether Bitcoin is being used as a safe-haven asset in the current market. Bitcoin ( BTC ) outperformed stocks and held up “incredibly strong” during a sharp sell-off on stock markets in April, following Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on “Liberation Day,” observed crypto trader “Daan Crypto” on May 11. Following its plunge to $75,000 on April 7, Bitcoin recovered strongly to trade 27% higher at around $95,000 by the end of the month. Meanwhile, indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined in April. Source: Daan Crypto Trades At the time, people wondered if Bitcoin’s relative strength came from the narrative that countries were using Bitcoin to bypass tariffs. The analyst said the opposite should theoretically occur if the trade deal is confirmed. “Theoretically speaking, if the trade uncertainty was what was making BTC outperform, it should stop outperforming after we hit the most important deal, which includes China.” On May 11, the White House announced that talks between the US and China regarding a trade deal have made “substantial progress.” However, no official agreement had been announced. White House claims trade deal reached with China, but investors remain doubtful The White House announced progress toward a trade deal with China. However, no official details of the purported trade deal were aired alongside the announcement, casting doubt about the substance of the agreement. According to an announcement from the White House, details of the supposed trade deal will be revealed in a briefing on May 12. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent released this statement about the trade talks: ""I am happy to report that we made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks. First, I want to thank our Swiss host. The Swiss government has been very kind in providing us with this wonderful venue."" While investors continue to monitor the ongoing trade talks for any potential deal that could restore confidence in financial markets, many market participants say the details of the agreement may be underwhelming or lack any real substance that would establish a long-standing trade deal between the two countries. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tells the media that the US-China trade talks were productive.

44525305,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67001,1747058184,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,This XRP Whale Knows Something Big Is Coming. Here’s What He Did,https://timestabloid.com/this-xrp-whale-knows-something-big-is-coming-heres-what-he-did/,"A well-known cryptocurrency whale has recently caught the attention of the crypto community by making a substantial move on XRP, signaling a potential bullish outlook . This high-profile trader opened a leveraged long position worth $12 million, betting on XRP’s future growth. The Whale’s Calculated Move on XRP According to the blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, this crypto whale strategically shifted their focus to XRP after previously capitalizing on Ethereum’s impressive rally in early May 2025. The decision to open a 2x leveraged position on XRP came just hours before Lookonchain’s update . Within a short period, the trade had already accumulated over $260,000 in paper gains, indicating the whale’s calculated timing might be paying off. The whale went long on $ETH right at the start of its rally and is now sitting on an unrealized profit of over $10M. He opened a new 2x long on $XRP 8 hours ago, with a position of nearly $12M and an unrealized profit of $261K. https://t.co/vfdxjFvrkE pic.twitter.com/Rs1ZlwEAuL — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 12, 2025 Building on Ethereum Success Before this XRP move, the whale successfully navigated Ethereum’s early May surge. During that period, ETH’s price surged from approximately $1,800 to above $2,500 in less than a week, fueled by a positive market sentiment and increased trading volume. By May 11, Lookonchain reported that the whale’s long ETH position had secured unrealized gains surpassing $10 million. This lucrative outcome from the Ethereum trade seemingly provided the confidence to dive into XRP with a significant long position. While the crypto market remains dynamic, the whale’s decision to pivot from Ethereum to XRP suggests an expectation of XRP following a similar upward trajectory. An Optimistic Outlook on XRP Despite its recent modest increase of around 11% over the past week, XRP has not yet mirrored the broader market’s bullish momentum. The coin climbed from $2.1 to $2.4, a notable gain but still trailing behind the explosive rallies seen earlier in the year. In January 2025, XRP’s price briefly exceeded the $3 mark before undergoing a correction phase, dropping to just below $2 by April. The whale’s new position, however, indicates a strong belief that XRP is poised for a significant breakout, potentially driven by increased market participation or positive sentiment. The move aligns with the broader narrative of whales anticipating a surge as the asset shows signs of regaining momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Significant Accumulation and Whale Activity Further bolstering the idea of an impending XRP surge, report shows that these large holders have added more than 880 million XRP to their portfolios in the past month. This massive accumulation hints at coordinated buying activity, suggesting that influential investors may be positioning themselves for a potential rally. Moreover, Whale Alert, a blockchain monitoring platform, identified two notable transactions involving XRP. The first involved a transfer of 70 million XRP (valued at around $148.3 million) between undisclosed wallets. The second, even more substantial, saw Ripple itself moving 300 million XRP (worth approximately $633.7 million) to an unknown address. Such large transfers naturally sparked speculation within the XRP community, with some pondering whether strategic moves are underway behind the scenes. A Bold Bet on XRP’s Future By opening a multi-million-dollar long position on XRP , this prominent whale signals confidence in the asset’s potential upside. The combination of successful trading strategies, strategic accumulation, and recent whale movements paints a picture of growing optimism around XRP’s trajectory. If the anticipated rally materializes, this well-timed bet could further cement the whale’s reputation as a savvy investor who knows how to capitalize on crypto market dynamics. As the broader market continues to evolve, traders and enthusiasts alike will be watching closely to see if XRP follows through on these bullish expectations.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $3.54. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $5.76 and an average forecast price of $5.53. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The network has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.913 Market Cap $1.44B Trading Volume $227.69M Circulating Supply 1.56B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4802 (Oct 23, 2017) 24-hour High $0.9754 24-hour Low $0.8718 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 11.83% 50-Day SMA $ 0.682392 14-Day RSI 72.78 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green Days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $ 0.637925 EOS price analysis: EOS surged toward $0.97 but faced a strong rejection TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed a downtrend following $0.97 rejection. The altcoin lost 0.9% of value. EOS coin prices seek support around $0.9. On May 12, 2025, EOS price analysis revealed mixed volatility for the altcoin. The altcoin value surged toward $0.97 high in the past 24 hours. However, sellers strongly defended further surge, resulting in a sharp decline toward $0.9 support line. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of EOS coin confirmed a mixed price trend. EOS/USD value has stepped up to $0.97 in the day. A green candlestick on the price chart signifies a rising bullish support. However, sellers strongly defended further surge, plunging the price toward the low of $0.9. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening, leading to a rising volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the immediate support, has shifted to $0.918. Whereby its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.563. EOS/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the overbought area. The indicator’s value has improved up to index 71.63. This increase confirms a rising buying activity in the market. However, overbought conditions often hints at an upcoming reversal. As a result, the EOS price initiate a bearish drop below immediate Fib levels in the coming hours. EOS /USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of EOS coin confirmed a downward trend in the market. The cryptocurrency value has dropped down to $0.87 in the day. The decline in volatility marks a lower chance of reversal in the market trends. The Bollinger bands are shrinking, leading to a decline in the volatility. This decline in the volatility signifies a lower market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.975, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.838, marking the support. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is present within the neutral area. Currently at 59.82, the RSI level is declining from its previous level, confirming the bearish domination around $0.97. The steep bearish slope on the indicator’s graph refers to a rising selling pressure. If the selling activities continue to dominate over the buying activities, further descent can be expected.

EOS price analysis shows mixed volatility as both side traders compete to push their domination. If sellers remain successful in holding the price below $0.9, we might see an immediate drop toward $0.83 level. On the other hand, a successful push by the buyers above $0.9 might challenge the $0.97 level again. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 35% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS above $1. Why is EOS down? Following the recent rejection around $0.97 level on the EOS price chart, sellers gained control and plunged the price below immediate support channels. Will EOS price recover? If buyers hold the momentum around $0.9 and strongly defend further, we might see a rebound rally in the coming hours. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the end of 2026 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2030. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $5.76 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 63rd ranked cryptocurrency. It also observed good bullish sentiment in November last year when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $5.76 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time. Recent news/opinion on EOS Vaulta announced that its current total value locked (TVL) has reached $261 million. The blockchain also claimed that its ecosystem is under expansion, with its all-time high TVL recorded at $299 million.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April. In May, EOS is changing hands at $0.72.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-12 14:00:00
44525684,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=724992,1747058400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44525684.jpeg,What Dogecoin Miners Don’t Tell You: Bitcoin Solaris Creates 3X Higher Returns with Less Effort,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-dogecoin-miners-dont-tell-you-bitcoin-solaris-creates-3x-higher-returns-with-less-effort/,"Dogecoin became a cultural phenomenon by making crypto fun. But behind the memes and hype, real Dogecoin mining is anything but easy. It demands GPU or ASIC hardware, continuous uptime, power management, and technical setup. Most casual investors never see a real return — and few Dogecoin miners talk about the effort required just to break even. Bitcoin Solaris offers a fundamentally different model: daily rewards, no hardware, and mobile-first mining that actually pays. With the upcoming Nova App, users can mine BTC-S tokens directly from their smartphones using idle storage and background CPU. The setup takes minutes. The earnings start daily. And compared to Dogecoin’s hardware-heavy, competitive mining structure, the returns are not only easier — they’re higher. The Hidden Costs of Dogecoin Mining Mining DOGE may sound simple, but in practice it requires: High-end GPUs or ASIC miners Consistent cooling and energy supply Mining pool fees and reward sharing Difficulty adjustment that reduces solo miner viability Even in optimal conditions, average returns are limited by network competition, hardware lifespan, and rising hash rate difficulty. Moreover, there are no delegation rewards or staking alternatives. Dogecoin mining is designed for those with infrastructure — not mobile users or beginners. Bitcoin Solaris: Mining for Everyone Bitcoin Solaris removes all of those barriers. Through the Nova App, users will be able to: Download and activate mining in one click Allocate 1–5 GB of storage and idle CPU Let the app run silently in the background Earn BTC-S rewards daily with no hardware There’s no competition for block space, no need to join mining pools, and no threat of obsolescence due to rising difficulty. Rewards are predictable, energy-efficient, and user-level by design. For those comparing returns, early projections suggest up to 3X more net token accumulation versus solo DOGE mining, with none of the upfront capital. Built on a Faster, Smarter Chain Bitcoin Solaris is engineered to scale without congestion. It uses a dual-layer blockchain: Base Layer: Uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) to maintain decentralized security Solaris Layer: Built on Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT), enabling 10,000+ TPS with 2-second finality This structure makes Bitcoin Solaris faster than Dogecoin, which is limited by older PoW architecture. And while DOGE lacks support for smart contracts or token utilities, Bitcoin Solaris supports advanced applications from launch. Tokenomics and Presale Access Like Bitcoin, BTC-S has a fixed supply of 21 million tokens. Emissions follow a scheduled halving model, with no inflation and no hidden minting. Early mining and presale participation are the primary entry points for acquisition. The project is currently in Presale Phase 3, offering BTC-S at 3 USDT per token.

A significant milestone has just been reached by a prominent player in this space. The Web3 reward platform , Fablo, has announced it has officially surpassed the remarkable mark of 100,000 users. This achievement highlights the growing appetite among crypto users for interactive ways to engage with and earn from the blockchain ecosystem. What is the Fablo Platform and How Does it Work? The Fablo platform stands out as a bridge connecting the innovative world of blockchain development with a curious and active user base. Powered by Seoul-based blockchain accelerator Factblock , Fablo offers a unique proposition: users can earn valuable points and potentially other rewards simply by participating in activities designed by various blockchain projects . Here’s a breakdown of how the Fablo platform facilitates this connection: Task Completion: Users engage with various tasks, often educational or community-oriented. Earn Points: Completing these tasks rewards users with points within the platform. Learn and Explore: Tasks frequently involve learning about specific blockchain projects, their technology, and their goals. Diverse Activities: Examples include taking quizzes on Web3 topics, participating in surveys about user preferences, joining community discussions, or interacting with project dApps. This model creates a win-win situation. Blockchain projects gain valuable exposure, user feedback, and a growing community, while crypto users get rewarded for their time and effort in exploring new technologies and platforms. The Power of Factblock Behind Fablo’s Growth The success of the Fablo platform is intrinsically linked to its parent company, Factblock . As a well-regarded blockchain accelerator based in Seoul, Factblock brings significant industry expertise, connections, and credibility to the table. Their experience in nurturing blockchain startups and fostering ecosystem growth provides a solid foundation for Fablo’s operations and expansion. Factblock’s influence extends beyond just development support. They are also the organizers of Korea Blockchain Week (KBW), one of Asia’s most influential annual blockchain events. This connection is crucial for Fablo’s strategy, offering unparalleled opportunities to connect with leading blockchain projects , industry experts, and a global audience interested in Web3. Why 100,000 Users is More Than Just a Number Surpassing the 100,000-user mark is a significant indicator of several key factors: Platform Appeal: It demonstrates that the reward-based model for Web3 engagement resonates strongly with a large number of individuals. Market Demand: It highlights a clear demand among crypto users for accessible ways to learn about and interact with the decentralized web without necessarily making significant financial investments upfront. Scalability: The platform has proven its ability to handle a growing user base and the associated tasks and rewards. Project Interest: Reaching this scale makes Fablo an even more attractive platform for blockchain projects looking to acquire and engage users effectively. This milestone positions Fablo as a key player in the Web3 user acquisition and engagement space, moving beyond early adopters to attract a broader audience interested in the practical benefits of Web3 interaction. Looking Ahead: Expansion and Community Building With the 100,000-user milestone achieved, Factblock has clear plans for the future of the Fablo platform . A major focus is expanding its reach, particularly into the vibrant and rapidly growing Southeast Asian market. This strategic move aims to tap into a new pool of potential crypto users and blockchain projects , further diversifying Fablo’s ecosystem. Furthermore, Factblock is committed to enhancing Fablo’s identity as a strong Web3 community. Leveraging events like Korea Blockchain Week will be instrumental in this effort. KBW provides a platform to showcase Fablo’s capabilities, forge partnerships with more blockchain projects , and engage directly with the community, reinforcing Fablo’s position as a central hub for Web3 interaction and rewards. How Can Crypto Users Benefit from Platforms Like Fablo? For individuals interested in or already involved in the crypto space, platforms like Fablo offer several compelling benefits: Earn Passive Rewards: Users can earn points or tokens for activities they might find interesting anyway. Learn About New Projects: It’s an excellent way to discover and understand emerging blockchain projects without financial risk. Skill Development: Engaging with tasks can improve understanding of Web3 concepts and technologies. Community Connection: Fablo helps connect users with like-minded individuals and project teams. Low Barrier to Entry: Often, participation requires only time and effort, not significant investment. As the Web3 space matures, platforms that effectively onboard and engage users through tangible incentives like rewards will likely play an increasingly vital role. Challenges and the Road Ahead While the 100k user count is impressive, the journey for any Web3 reward platform involves navigating challenges. These include maintaining user engagement over time, ensuring the quality and legitimacy of partnered blockchain projects , adapting to evolving regulatory landscapes, and scaling the platform technically to handle continued growth. Fablo’s connection to Factblock and their strategic use of events like KBW suggest they are well-equipped to address these challenges by fostering strong industry relationships and focusing on sustainable community growth. Conclusion: A Promising Future for Web3 Engagement Fablo’s achievement of surpassing 100,000 users is a significant milestone, underscoring the growing demand for interactive and rewarding ways to participate in the Web3 ecosystem. Backed by Factblock and with strategic plans for expansion into Southeast Asia and leveraging major events like Korea Blockchain Week, the Fablo platform is well-positioned for continued growth. For crypto users and blockchain projects alike, platforms offering tangible incentives for engagement represent a promising path forward in building vibrant, active decentralized communities.

Why? Because macro-economic events, like significant developments in US China trade relations, often ripple across all asset classes, influencing investor sentiment and the broader economic outlook . Recently, a positive turn in trade talks between the United States and China sent a clear signal of optimism, leading to a substantial surge in stock futures , particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 . Let’s dive into what happened and why this traditional market rally is a signal worth watching. A Breakthrough in US China Trade Discussions For years, the relationship between the U.S. and China has been marked by trade tensions, tariffs, and uncertainty. These factors have often weighed heavily on global markets, creating volatility and impacting business decisions worldwide. However, recent discussions have yielded a more positive outcome. A joint statement issued by both nations signaled a commitment to continuing trade talks and working towards a resolution on key issues. While the specifics of the agreement or path forward weren’t fully detailed in the initial announcement, the mere fact that constructive dialogue is progressing and seemingly yielding positive steps was enough to alleviate some of the prevailing market anxiety surrounding US China trade relations. This shift from confrontation to cooperation, even if tentative, was interpreted by investors as a significant de-escalation. Nasdaq 100 Leads a Powerful Stock Futures Rally The immediate reaction from the markets was overwhelmingly positive. Before the opening bell, stock futures across the board saw impressive gains, indicating strong buying interest fueled by the news. The gains were particularly pronounced in the technology sector, which is heavily represented in the Nasdaq indices and often sensitive to global trade dynamics and growth prospects. Here’s a snapshot of the market’s initial reaction: Nasdaq 100 futures: Jumped an impressive 3.5% Dow futures: Rose a solid 2.2% S&P 500 futures: Climbed nearly 3% These are significant moves for futures contracts, which often act as a bellwether for the day’s trading session. The widespread nature of the gains, from the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 to the broader S&P 500 and industrial-heavy Dow, suggests a broad-based improvement in investor confidence. Adding to the picture of improved sentiment, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond also hit a one-month high. Rising Treasury yields can sometimes indicate that investors are moving money out of safe-haven assets (like government bonds) and into riskier assets (like stocks), or that they anticipate stronger economic growth and potentially higher inflation, both of which can be positive signs for the broader economic outlook . Why This US China Trade Development Sparks Optimism To understand the magnitude of this market reaction, it’s important to remember the backdrop of recent years. The tit-for-tat tariffs and trade restrictions imposed by both the U.S. and China created a climate of uncertainty that directly impacted multinational corporations, supply chains, and global economic growth forecasts. Businesses delayed investment decisions, consumer confidence wavered, and market volatility became the norm. A potential easing of these tensions offers several key benefits: Reduced Uncertainty: Predictability is crucial for markets and businesses. Progress in US China trade talks removes a significant overhang of uncertainty. Potential Tariff Reduction: While not immediately announced, successful talks could lead to a reduction or removal of tariffs, lowering costs for businesses and consumers. Improved Business Environment: Companies operating in or trading with both countries face fewer hurdles and potential disruptions. Boost to Global Growth: Smoother trade relations between the world’s two largest economies can provide a significant boost to the global economic outlook . This positive step in US China trade negotiations is seen as paving the way for potentially smoother economic relations, which is inherently bullish for assets that thrive in environments of stability and growth. Connecting the Dots: How a Stock Futures Rally Can Influence Crypto Sentiment While the crypto market operates 24/7 and has its own unique drivers, it is not immune to macro-economic forces and shifts in global investor sentiment. The strong market rally in traditional finance following the positive US China trade news is a prime example of how macro events can create ripple effects. Here’s how this connection often works: Risk-On vs. Risk-Off: When traditional markets are confident and rising (a ‘risk-on’ environment), investors are generally more willing to take on risk in other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, during periods of fear and uncertainty (‘risk-off’), capital tends to flow into safer assets, sometimes at the expense of crypto. The stock futures rally signals a shift towards risk-on sentiment. Liquidity: A positive economic outlook and rising traditional markets can lead to increased overall market liquidity. More capital circulating can potentially find its way into the crypto space. Investor Confidence: Improved sentiment in major global markets can boost overall investor confidence, making them more receptive to investing in emerging or volatile asset classes like crypto. It’s important to note that this is not a direct, one-to-one correlation, and crypto markets have their own internal dynamics (like technological developments, regulatory news, and adoption rates). However, ignoring the influence of significant macro events and traditional market movements, especially a widespread market rally driven by positive news like the progress in US China trade talks, would be shortsighted for any investor. What Does This Mean for the Economic Outlook? Progress on the US China trade front is a significant factor influencing the global economic outlook . Reduced trade barriers can lower import costs, potentially easing inflationary pressures on certain goods. It can also make it easier for businesses to plan and execute international strategies, encouraging investment and potentially leading to job creation. Analysts are watching closely to see if this positive momentum continues. A sustained improvement in trade relations could lead to upward revisions in global growth forecasts, which would be a positive signal for markets worldwide. The initial reaction in stock futures , including the strong performance of the Nasdaq 100 , reflects this anticipation of a potentially brighter economic future. Potential Hurdles: Is This Market Rally Sustainable? While the immediate reaction was a strong market rally , it’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective. Trade negotiations are complex, and past talks have seen setbacks. Key questions remain: Will both sides follow through on commitments? What are the specifics of future agreements? Are there other geopolitical or economic factors that could derail progress? Investors will be watching for concrete details and continued positive steps. The sustainability of this initial market rally will likely depend on tangible progress in future negotiations and the broader global economic outlook . Expert Takes on the Future of US China Trade and Markets Market analysts generally view this development as a significant positive step, but many remain cautiously optimistic. They highlight that while the de-escalation of tension is a major win, the path to a comprehensive, long-term trade agreement may still face challenges. Commentary often centers on: The importance of implementation details. Watching for signs of commitment from both sides. Recognizing that other points of friction between the nations still exist. However, the consensus is that this progress in US China trade talks has significantly improved near-term market sentiment and the perceived economic outlook compared to the recent past. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Market For investors, whether in traditional stocks or cryptocurrencies, this event underscores the importance of staying informed about major global macro-economic developments. Here are a few takeaways: Macro Matters: Don’t dismiss news about traditional markets or global economics. Events like progress in US China trade talks can and do influence overall market sentiment and liquidity. Watch for Sentiment Shifts: The strong stock futures rally, particularly in the Nasdaq 100 , is a key indicator of improving risk sentiment. Pay attention to whether this sentiment holds. Diversification: While positive news is welcome, markets can reverse quickly. Maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes and sectors can help manage risk. Long-Term View: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on single news events. Focus on your long-term investment strategy. Conclusion: Hopeful Signs Emerge from US China Trade Progress The recent breakthrough in US China trade talks has undeniably injected a dose of optimism into global markets, triggering a significant stock futures rally led by the impressive gains in the Nasdaq 100 . This development reduces uncertainty, improves the potential business environment, and offers a more positive angle on the global economic outlook . While challenges may still lie ahead in the path towards a complete resolution, this initial progress is a powerful reminder of how interconnected global economies and markets are. For those navigating the crypto landscape, understanding these macro shifts and the resulting changes in risk sentiment is vital for making informed decisions. The hopeful tone set by this trade development could well contribute to a more favorable environment for risk assets moving forward.

The total crypto trading volume at the time of writing is $164.94 billion, only slightly reduced from $213 billion on May 9. Though slowing down currently, the aggregate market cap is still higher by 1.66% at $3.3 trillion, indicating sustained dynamism and investor confidence. With rising bullish pressure across the crypto ecosystem, several altcoins have recorded impressive double-digit growth. Ethereum (ETH) surged on May 8 by 20%, breaking above the $2,000 resistance level for the first time since March and resting at the time of writing at $2,413.32. The surge is a dramatic change of market fortunes as ETH outperforms Bitcoin, a fairly rare phenomenon in recent months. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) also joined the rally, up 9% to $0.2231, driven by renewed retail buying and strong social sentiment. Such behavior is reflective of off-the-charts investor sentiment and potential alt season rebound as liquidity flows into promising tokens. Bitcoin (BTC), priced at $102,992, remains 40% higher than the recent month’s low, recording 10% year-to-date appreciation during a modest 4% retracement.
