From market giants to early-stage breakouts, these five cryptos are poised to define the next big rally. One stands out above the rest: MAGACOINFINANCE , the rising contender that’s capturing early investor attention. 1. MAGACOINFINANCE (MAGA) MAGACOINFINANCE has become the most popular presale of the year. Its presale has raised over $8 million and it is aiming for a $0.007 listing. MAGACOINFINANCE is still trading for below $0.001, but offers massive upside potential. In fact analysts think early-stage investors can see returns of between 25x and 36x. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Presently in Stage 7, the project awards a MAGA50X bonus. This conveys the message that everyone still has the chance to participate. MAGACOINFINANCE is not like the other meme tokens, thanks to its structured tokenomics and viral growth which are highly scarce. The message is very clear for all those who want to get ahead of the game. This is not the end but just the beginning. 2. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is back in the spotlight, trading just below its all-time high of $109,000. Institutional inflows, ETF momentum, and positive macro signals suggest BTC could soon enter a new price discovery phase, with targets of $110K–$120K in the near term. 3. Solana (SOL) Solana has recovered impressively, hovering between $140–$150 after bouncing from $95 lows. Bulls are eyeing a push past $160, which could pave the way toward $200–$220, or even all-time highs near $300–$350. Solana’s high-speed ecosystem and scalability continue to attract both developers and institutional players. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB) The Shiba Inu coin is slowly making a comeback. Currently, SHIB is a little above $0.00001325. The community backing is strong, and the Shibarium upgrades continue. Analysts believe that price could rise to $0.0000286 by the end of the month and $0.0000326 long-term. 5. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi and NFTs, trading at $3,762.59 and up nearly 30% in the past week. With forecasts projecting year-end prices near $2,751–$2,900, ETH continues to be a cornerstone asset for institutional and retail portfolios alike. Conclusion: Why MAGACOINFINANCE Leads This List CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT While Bitcoin, Solana, SHIB, and Ethereum offer strong long-term narratives, MAGACOINFINANCE’s early-stage position, rapid growth, and record-breaking presale make it the standout play for asymmetric upside. With Stages 7, 8, and 9 still open, investors have a rare window to position before listings — and before the wider market catches on.

Following the development, Lido DAO announced that it will initiate an emergency voting process to replace the relevant oracle node. The protocol’s official statement stated that despite the security threat, Lido’s operation continued uninterrupted and user funds were safe. Lido’s oracle system has a multisig structure that requires signatures from 5 out of 9 participants. No security breaches were detected in the eight oracle nodes other than Chorus One. The DAO's statement included the following statements: “Emergency Lido DAO vote announcement: Due to the compromise of the oracle private key belonging to Chorus One, the Lido oracle node in question will be rotated.” Related News: Watch Out: We Are Entering a Critical Week, Even Trump Has Warned - Numerous Economic Developments and Altcoin Activity Expected - Here Is the Hour-by-Hour Schedule Authorities stated that the leaked key did not directly control funds and that there were no flaws in the oracle software. The oracle system in question is responsible for transferring data from Ethereum’s consensus layer to smart contracts. This information includes validators’ earnings and possible penalties. According to the evaluation, it was stated that even if the entire oracle system was compromised, there would be no significant damage other than a limited deviation in the stETH value, thanks to the security limits of the system. It was stated that in this incident, the attacker only stole a transaction fee of 1.4 ETH, and that this amount was not directly related to the protocol. *This is not investment advice.

With Bitcoin In His Corner, Anything’s Possible",https://bitcoinist.com/mcgregor-for-president-with-bitcoin-in-his-corner-anythings-possible/,"Ex-UFC champion Conor McGregor has suggested Ireland construct a national reserve of Bitcoin. He called on May 9, 2025, in a message posted on X that doing so would give “power back to the people’s money.” He’s contesting the presidency as an independent candidate and would like to turn attention toward crypto policy. McGregor’s Bitcoin Proposal In his blog post, Ireland ought to have a reserve of Bitcoin in a strategic reserve. He did not specify where the funding would originate or how much it would cost. He just said that a reserve would put power back into the hands of common citizens. He further mentioned that “crypto in its origin was founded to give power back to the people.” That phrase resonates with the very premise of Bitcoin and decentralization. Crypto in it’s origin was founded to give power back to the people. An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people’s money. I will be cohosting a Twitter space to talk about what I want to see changed. Victory to Ireland! — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) May 9, 2025 Reaching Out To Crypto Leaders According to reports, McGregor invited experts to collaborate with him. He tagged Anthony Pompliano, host of The Pomp Podcast, and requested feedback. He also contacted David Bailey, an expert who consulted former US President Donald Trump on crypto issues. In his responses, McGregor stated, “Message me and let’s talk on my space” and “David message me, let’s talk about your ideas!” His idea is to conduct an X Spaces session to develop details. Political And Legal Challenges Ireland is required to conduct its next presidential election by November 11, 2025, when President Michael D. Higgins’ term ends. Any initiative to establish a Bitcoin reserve would require support from lawmakers and the central bank. Ireland is a member of the European Union, so its monetary policy is connected to the euro. A candidate from a small party who is independent has slim chances of getting a coalition for this notion. Additionally, McGregor is contesting a civil court decision that ruled him guilty of sexual assault. He’s also been investigated on charges of hate speech before. These factors may damage his credibility with the voters. Irish politicians roundly reject Conor McGregor’s presidential bid https://t.co/irxI4kyoyK — Sky News (@SkyNews) March 30, 2025 Track Record In Crypto McGregor is not inexperienced in crypto projects, but his previous attempt didn’t work out. In early April 2025, the Real World Gaming team conducted a 28-hour presale of a token named REAL . They wanted to raise a minimum of $1 million. They only raised around $392,300 and refunded all buyers. That flop illustrates how challenging it is to get people to support you, even with a celebrity name on it. Next Steps And Outlook McGregor says he will reveal more about his X Spaces session in due course. He hasn’t specified a date yet. It’s unknown how many experts will accept his offer. Governments that have established Bitcoin reserves are the US, El Salvador and Bhutan, but those actions came from the highest government authorities. A grassroots initiative by one candidate would be unique in Ireland. Voters will decide if they want a fighter-turned-politician handling complex financial policy. For now, McGregor’s plan remains at the idea stage, waiting to be tested in the political arena.

Crypto Veterans Think it has the Potential to Skyrocket and Grow by 20,000% Thanks to AI Innovation",https://timestabloid.com/could-ruvi-ai-ruvi-be-the-next-avalanche-avax-crypto-veterans/,"Avalanche (AVAX) , with its current price of $24.77 and a market cap of $10.35 billion , remains a cornerstone in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Known for its three-blockchain architecture that ensures scalability without compromising efficiency, Avalanche has set the bar high for blockchain innovation. Yet, a new contender, Ruvi , is making waves with its cutting-edge focus on AI-powered blockchain utility . Could Ruvi capture the same meteoric rise Avalanche enjoyed by addressing entirely new blockchain frontiers? Avalanche’s Legacy vs. Ruvi’s Potential Avalanche’s unique architecture divides its network into three blockchains — the X-Chain for asset creation and transfer, the C-Chain for smart contracts, and the P-Chain for managing validators and subnets. This modular design is optimized for high transaction speeds and scalability, allowing Avalanche to handle up to 6,500 transactions per second. This performance has made it a favorite for DeFi applications, gaming platforms, and custom blockchain deployments. Meanwhile, Ruvi is carving its niche by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into blockchain technology. Ruvi’s platform enables users to create content (like text, video, and images) while earning $RUVI tokens for their contributions. Where Avalanche emphasizes DeFi and custom ecosystems, Ruvi’s ecosystem extends its impact to creators, marketers, and educators, marrying blockchain with real-world practicality . Investment Opportunities with Ruvi Ruvi is currently in its presale phase , offering tokens for $0.01 , along with hefty bonuses for early buyers. Here’s a breakdown of potential earnings across investment tiers, assuming Ruvi’s token price climbs to $1, $2, or $3 over time. Entry-Level Investment ($800) Tokens purchased at presale price: 80,000 Ruvi . 40% bonus adds an extra 32,000 tokens , giving you 112,000 tokens . At $1 per token, your investment grows to $112,000 . At $3, it could reach a staggering $336,000 . Mid-Level Investment ($1,500) Tokens purchased at presale price: 150,000 Ruvi . 60% bonus grants 90,000 additional tokens , totaling 240,000 tokens . If the price rises to $2, your investment is worth $480,000 . At $3, it becomes an impressive $720,000 . High-Level Investment ($7,000) Tokens purchased at presale price: 700,000 Ruvi . 100% bonus doubles your holdings to 1.4 million tokens . If Ruvi’s price hits $3, this investment could generate a jaw-dropping $4.2 million . Investing during the presale phase allows you to secure tokens at a fraction of their potential future value, making Ruvi an enticing prospect for both cautious newcomers and seasoned crypto veterans. Why Ruvi Stands Out Avalanche’s success stems from solving the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. Ruvi addresses a different challenge by democratizing content creation and introducing blockchain to industries like education, entertainment, and marketing. Its capped supply of 5 billion tokens ensures long-term scarcity and value retention. What sets Ruvi apart is its broader appeal. While Avalanche primarily serves developers, institutions, and DeFi enthusiasts, Ruvi’s AI-linked tools are designed for everyday users . This accessibility gives it a high potential for mass adoption, even among non-crypto natives. Don’t Miss Out on Ruvi’s Presale Few opportunities rival the early-stage gains seen in projects like Avalanche. Ruvi’s presale is shaping up to offer the same life-changing potential for those who get in early. The combination of blockchain innovation and AI-powered tools makes it one of the most exciting projects today. The presale won’t last forever , and as more investors snap up tokens, availability will only diminish. Don’t look back and wish you had joined earlier. Secure your $RUVI tokens today and position yourself at the cutting edge of blockchain’s next evolution.

BlockDAG Hits $235M While BNB Grows, DOGE Rebounds, and AVAX Gains Ground",https://thecoinrise.com/the-next-crypto-to-explode-blockdag-hits-235m-while-bnb-grows-doge-rebounds-and-avax-gains-ground/,"As the crypto world enters a fresh cycle in 2025, digital asset enthusiasts are shifting focus from pure hype to deeper engagement and authenticity. While market performance and strong fundamentals still matter, today’s most talked-about coins are winning attention through real transparency and active community presence. This is why the next crypto to explode includes not just the usual market leaders, but also newer platforms that bring real people into the spotlight. BlockDAG is proving this model with a bold move: combining developer transparency and consistent public engagement through a dedicated podcast. In doing so, it’s rewriting what it means to build trust in the open. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Where the Dev Team Speaks Directly to the Community Among the strongest contenders for the next crypto to explode is BlockDAG, which is turning developer engagement into its competitive edge. Unlike many projects that operate behind closed doors, BlockDAG is taking a vocal approach through its ongoing podcast series. In these sessions, core developers not only explain technical progress but also share project goals and respond to questions from their user base. These regular podcasts have quickly become central to BlockDAG’s strategy, helping to anchor its growing community. And the results are hard to ignore. The project has already raised $235 million in presale, with Batch 28 currently underway. Until May 13, BDAG is priced at $0.0019, offering a substantial opportunity for those joining now. Early backers from Batch 1 have already seen a return of 2,520%, and over 20 billion BDAG coins have been distributed so far. These milestones reflect strong interest built not just on buzz, but on visibility, connection, and clear communication. BlockDAG’s choice to connect directly with the community isn’t a passing trend. It’s a strategy that makes its infrastructure feel more human and trustworthy. In a market still dominated by anonymous teams and stale whitepapers, BDAG is showing that authenticity can drive real traction. If ROI, connection, and active engagement matter, BlockDAG is clearly a leading choice for the next crypto to explode. 2. Binance Coin (BNB): Real Utility That Keeps Expanding Binance Coin remains a steady force in the market, and its continued relevance comes from practical, real-world use. Whether it’s trading discounts, project launches, or seamless cross-chain activity, BNB consistently supports the vast Binance ecosystem. Binance has continued to grow across multiple jurisdictions, adapting to new regulatory conditions while keeping liquidity high. BNB’s value also benefits from quarterly token burns and expanding use cases across both centralized and decentralized applications. New features such as Web3 identity services and tools with integrated AI are also being introduced regularly, helping BNB maintain attention without relying on cheap tactics. For anyone evaluating the next crypto to explode, BNB stands out for its reliability and evolving ecosystem. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE): Humor, Community, and Unexpected Strength Dogecoin refuses to fade. While many wrote it off early as a passing meme, it has outlasted hundreds of technically superior coins. Its staying power comes from its vibrant community, easy-to-understand branding, and sheer visibility. Dogecoin is still being discussed as a serious contender in conversations about the next crypto to explode. The coin continues to receive support from a wide base of smallholders as well as influencers like Elon Musk. There’s also growing speculation about DOGE being integrated into micro-payment systems, particularly on X (formerly Twitter). Behind the scenes, development is still ongoing. New upgrades are making the project more usable over time, even if slowly. For those who believe social energy can push a project forward, Dogecoin remains a wild card worth watching. 4. Avalanche (AVAX): Speed and Scale with Real-World Impact Avalanche has moved beyond marketing claims by delivering real scalability. With its fast finality and subnet system, AVAX appeals to companies, game developers, and institutions looking for high-speed and flexible blockchain solutions. Its growth in real-world asset tokenization is especially promising. Through partnerships with financial firms and gaming enterprises, Avalanche is gaining serious ground. The ability to spin up custom blockchains within its network gives developers tools that Ethereum still struggles to provide. With regular funding rounds for ecosystem projects and steady technical improvements, Avalanche is a strong pick for those tracking utility-focused contenders in the race for the next crypto to explode. Connection Is the Real Catalyst for the Next Crypto to Explode Looking ahead to 2025, the strongest digital assets will succeed by offering more than just code. They’ll need to deliver transparency, real usability, and lasting trust. BlockDAG is demonstrating exactly that, using podcasts and open conversations to show that people, not just protocols, can drive confidence. With $235 million raised and a clear vision ahead, the window to get in at $0.0019 before May 13 is quickly closing. BNB, DOGE, and AVAX each bring their own strengths to the table. But in a time when users crave clarity and connection, BlockDAG is creating the kind of transparency that sets new standards. In the end, the next crypto to explode will be the one that people believe in, and BlockDAG is working hard to earn that belief every day. The post The Next Crypto to Explode?

Analyst Believes This Cycle Is Unique,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/new-xrp-rally-incoming-analyst-believes-this-cycle-is-unique/,"XRP investors are keeping an eye on a crucial price level this week. Bitcoin has managed to reclaim above $100,000 and Ethereum is over $2,300. XRP has recorded a modest increase as well but still hovers at the lower part of the $2 price range. From a chart of a market observer who goes by the name of “Guy on the Earth,” XRP has held above a persistent horizontal trendline at $2. Historical Price Rollercoaster Back in March 2017, XRP burst in price, rising from $0.0055 to a high of $3.80. After peaking at that all-time high in January 2018, it fell hard. XRP initially broke through $2 on December 30, 2017. By January 13, 2018—two weeks later—it dipped below again. That initial test revealed the $2 level was more resistance than support for new buyers. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Failed Breaks After Rally XRP attempted to break past that level once more in April 2021. It peaked at $1.96 but could not make further progress. From January 2018 all the way up to December 2024, the $2 line acted as a ceiling. Traders watched it cap price action for almost seven years. Every time XRP hit against that wall, it fell back into the $1 zone. $XRP Thats about as clean as it gets. This time it is different. This time it’s XRP. pic.twitter.com/9mK8QVuQVX — Guy on the Earth (@guyontheearth) May 9, 2025 Recent Break Above Two Based on reports, XRP finally cleared the $2 trendline in December 2024, when broader markets jumped on a bullish wave. Since then, the coin has stayed above this line for almost five months. That’s a first in XRP’s history. While its bounce hasn’t been as fast as Bitcoin’s or Ethereum’s, holding this level longer than ever feels different. Analyst Predictions And Warnings As per “Guy on the Earth,” remaining above $2 would pave the way for greater prices. He previously predicted an increase to $3.30, which already occurred. His next goal rests at $5.30, where he advises traders to take profit. He said “this time is different” for the altcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Wider Risks And Outlook This trend in prices is just half the story. Ripple’s legal battle against the SEC and regulatory updates for crypto would do the trick. On-chain metrics such as active accounts or large transfers would put some perspective behind that $2 hold. Traders should pay attention to sudden spikes in daily volume around this line. If XRP drops below $1.80 on a daily chart, some analysts will declare the setup invalid. For the moment, however, many view this extension above $2 as a signal that XRP’s next act could be better than its previous one.

During the company’s earnings call on Thursday, the CEO told analysts that within five to ten years, he wants Coinbase to be the number one financial services app on the planet. Brian wants to take on retail, businesses, institutional clients, and developers. His bet? That everything people do with money will eventually happen on crypto rails. Brian said he’s not looking at what traditional finance has been. “We want to look forwards and skate to where this opportunity is going,” he said. He made it clear that Coinbase is still mainly focused on trading and payments, but that’s just the start. “Crypto is eating financial services,” he said . Brian believes asset classes like money market funds, securities, real estate, and debt are all moving on-chain. And he sees Coinbase as the platform that will power that change. Coinbase eyes banks as future clients, not enemies Right now, Coinbase serves both regular people and big players. On top of its core exchange, it has rolled out services like stablecoin payments, staking, and institutional custody. Brian said more than 200 major institutions use these features, including BlackRock, Stripe, and PayPal. The timing is no accident. Over the past two months, US regulators have started to ease up on crypto. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency just gave the green light for banks it oversees to offer crypto services. That decision comes right after the Federal Reserve and the FDIC made similar moves, reversing warnings they gave out last year. With President Donald Trump back in the White House and regulatory pressure easing, Brian said old institutions are now racing to figure out how to plug into the space. Congress is also getting ready to pass legislation focused on stablecoins, which would clear the path for banks to offer more crypto-related products. In February, Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, said the bank could issue a stablecoin if regulation allows it. Brian said it’s only a matter of time. “We think that every major bank is going to be integrating crypto at some point,” he said. He explained that Coinbase can be the engine behind that. “For some of them, it’s a custodial solution. Others are interested in having a stablecoin solution.” He also said some banks want to make their own stablecoins, but he thinks that’s a bad idea. “Our view is that that’s not necessarily the best path because stablecoins have network effects,” Brian said. He added that for a stablecoin to really work, it needs to be usable across multiple institutions. That’s not possible if every bank tries to create its own version. Stablecoins are now Coinbase’s second biggest source of income after trading. In the first quarter of this year, stablecoin-related revenue went up 50% compared to the same time last year. From the last quarter alone, it increased by 32%. The growth came mainly from USDC, which Coinbase helped create. The company has a 50% revenue-sharing deal with Circle, the stablecoin’s issuer, and takes all the interest from USDC products on its platform. Brian said his “stretch goal” is for USDC to become the top stablecoin globally. Right now, Tether’s USDT holds that title. “If you can get shared economics, I don’t see why we wouldn’t see more of these banks partnering with USDC,” Brian said. He said even if banks don’t want to fully commit to USDC, they can still use Coinbase to support their back-end infrastructure. “Regardless, we at Coinbase can help power infrastructure for all these folks that are coming into the industry,” Brian said.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tells the media that the US-China trade walks were productive. Source: Fox News ""We will be giving details tomorrow, but I can tell you that the talks were productive,"" Bessent continued, without mentioning the word ""deal"" once in his statement. Greer made mention of the deal but did not give any details on the talks, leaving investors in doubt about the substance of the announcement, as market participants continue to monitor the ongoing trade tensions for signs of relief for financial markets. Related: Bitcoin nears $100K as Trump set to reveal trade deal with UK Trump's tariffs cause chaos in markets and draw widespread criticism Although traditional financial and digital asset markets have recovered and retraced some of the value lost following the initial price shock brought on by US President Donald Trump's sweeping trade tariffs , investor uncertainty still looms over asset markets. The Trump administration has flip-flopped on its tariff policies, reversing course on trade proposals or softening its rhetoric several times, leaving investors on edge and uncertain about investing in riskier assets like tech stocks and crypto. In April 2024, the US Customs and Border Protection, at the behest of the Trump administration, announced that select tech products would be exempt from tariffs including, smartphones, processing chips, computers, and other electronics. However, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick walked back the electronic tariff exemptions one day following the announcement. Lutnick said that the tariff exemptions would only be temporary until administration officials decided on a comprehensive tariff regime that featured different tariff rates for economic sectors. The lack of a comprehensive, decisive trade policy has called the Trump administration's plans into question , with many observers saying that the trade tariffs will only create more discord in financial markets and the broader economy.

Instead, the spotlight is on MAGACOINFINANCE , an early-stage contender that’s quietly turning into one of the most talked-about opportunities in the market. What’s Next for MAGACOINFINANCE With over $8 million raised , MAGACOINFINANCE has already surpassed presale expectations. But the real story isn’t just how much capital it has secured — it’s what’s coming next . Currently in Stage 7 of its presale, the project still offers investors an exceptional opportunity to enter before the masses. The $0.007 listing target is now in clear sight, and the project is still priced under $0.001 , setting the stage for a 25x–36x base ROI . On top of that, early buyers can activate the MAGA50X promo code to secure a 50% bonus on token allocations — a rare advantage at this stage of a presale. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! What the Future Holds Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, MAGACOINFINANCE has built a strategic framework designed for sustained growth. It’s running a scarcity-driven model, reinforced by timed unlocks, referral-based expansion, and the absence of centralized exchange exposure — all of which preserve early-stage pricing dynamics. Analysts point out that projects launched under similar models have historically achieved gains of 18,500% or more , making MAGACOINFINANCE’s roadmap even more compelling. With Stages 8 and 9 still ahead, the potential catalysts include exchange listings, media exposure, and viral community growth — all set to unlock during the next growth phase. Why It’s Still Worth Joining Now LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X The key message for investors? You’re still early. While the headlines around MAGACOINFINANCE’s $8 million milestone are impressive, the project is just getting started. Stage 7, 8, and 9 represent some of the last windows for strategic entry before major price discovery begins. It’s not about chasing what’s already happened — it’s about positioning for what’s about to unfold. Analysts agree: this isn’t the end — it’s just the beginning. For those seeking a high-conviction, early-stage crypto play in Q2, MAGACOINFINANCE is fast emerging as the smartest bet on the table.

White House claims trade deal reached with China, but investors remain doubtful The White House announced progress toward a trade deal with China. However, no official details of the purported trade deal were aired alongside the announcement, casting doubt about the substance of the agreement. According to an announcement from the White House, details of the supposed trade deal will be revealed in a briefing on May 12. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent released this statement about the trade talks: ""I am happy to report that we made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks. First, I want to thank our Swiss host. The Swiss government has been very kind in providing us with this wonderful venue."" While investors continue to monitor the ongoing trade talks for any potential deal that could restore confidence in financial markets, many market participants say the details of the agreement may be underwhelming or lack any real substance that would establish a long-standing trade deal between the two countries. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tells the media that the US-China trade talks were productive. Source: Fox News Pectra lets hackers drain wallets with just an offchain signature Ethereum’s latest network upgrade, Pectra, introduced powerful new features aimed at improving scalability and smart account functionality — but it also opened a dangerous new attack vector that could allow hackers to drain funds from user wallets using only an offchain signature. Under the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032 , attackers can exploit a new transaction type to take control of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring the user to sign an onchain transaction. Arda Usman, a Solidity smart contract auditor, confirmed to Cointelegraph that “it becomes possible for an attacker to drain an EOA’s funds using only an offchain signed message (no direct onchain transaction signed by the user).” At the center of the risk is EIP-7702, a core component of the Pectra upgrade. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal introduces the SetCode transaction (type 0x04), which enables users to delegate control of their wallet to another contract simply by signing a message. If an attacker obtains this signature — say, via a phishing site — they can overwrite the wallet’s code with a small proxy that forwards calls to their malicious contract.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that a previous ruling from the United Kingdom Competition Appeal Tribunal, throwing out the claims of undue damage from the delisting, should be examined again, according to legal outlet Law360 . BSV has experienced a long-term price decline since 2021.

44494164,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66948,1747000714,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Predicts How Much $1000 In XRP Could Be Worth This Year,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-how-much-1000-in-xrp-could-be-worth-this-year/,"Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, recently shared his optimistic outlook on XRP’s price trajectory, suggesting that holding just 1,000 XRP tokens could be a financially significant decision by the end of 2025. In a recent video, Farina presented a detailed case for why XRP may outperform expectations in the coming market cycle. XRP’s Unusual Market Performance This Cycle Farina emphasized that the current crypto market cycle is not following typical patterns. Traditionally, XRP tends to experience price surges later in the cycle, often after Bitcoin and other major altcoins have rallied. However, in this cycle, XRP has already shown substantial growth early on. He pointed to XRP’s sharp increase in late 2024, when the token surged from under $0.60 to over $3.30 in weeks. This was its highest price since 2018 and occurred while Bitcoin’s dominance in the market remained relatively high. Farina interprets this as a sign that XRP may be moving independently of broader market trends, a shift he believes signals greater strength and potential for sustained growth. Legal Clarity and Institutional Access A key factor supporting Farina’s bullish view is the resolution of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) legal case against Ripple. With XRP now classified as a non-security, Ripple can freely partner with financial institutions, a development that removes a major barrier to adoption. In addition, Farina highlighted the growing interest in XRP from institutional investors. The approval and launch of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is viewed as a major step toward broader market participation. According to him, the intersection of legal certainty and increasing institutional access creates favourable conditions for XRP’s value to rise. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s broader business strategy may also contribute to XRP’s upward trajectory. Farina mentioned the company’s recent acquisitions, including that of Hidden Road , and suggested that a potential acquisition of Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, could significantly increase Ripple’s influence in the financial sector. Farina projects that XRP reaching $10 by the end of 2025 is within reach, based on ongoing shifts in market dynamics, such as a potential decline in Bitcoin dominance and growing demand for crypto investment products like ETFs. He further proposed a scenario in which XRP could hit $100 , though he acknowledged that such an outcome would depend on widespread adoption and using XRP in tokenizing real-world assets. Under that scenario, a holding of 1,000 XRP tokens would be valued at $100,000. Farina notes that while this might not be transformative for everyone, it could represent meaningful financial progress for many investors. While the video highlights the potential of owning just 1,000 tokens, Farina recommends that investors consider accumulating 10,000 XRP if they have the means. At current prices, approximately $2.42 per coin, this would require an investment of around $24,000. In his view, holding this amount allows greater flexibility in profit-taking and positions investors for long-term wealth generation should XRP reach the $100 mark, which would equate to $1 million in value. At present, 1,000 XRP tokens can be acquired for roughly $2,400. Farina concludes that whether one holds a small or large amount, the coming years could be key for XRP investors.

Experts Are Convinced",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-mutuum-finance-mutm-50x-when-bitcoin-btc-reaches-170000-and-ethereum-eth-hits-7650-experts-are-convinced/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) eyes a potential $170,000 target and Ethereum (ETH) aims for $7,650 in the next bull cycle, analysts are also turning their attention to high-upside altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently trading at just $0.025, a 50x rally would place MUTM at $1.25, a realistic leap considering the historic performance of small-cap tokens during major market surges. Currently in Phase 4 in presale, Mutuum Finance has already pulled in over $7.9 million from more than 9,700 investors. The token is currently priced at $0.025, but that’s set to increase by 20% to $0.03 once Phase 5 begins. With over 65% of Phase 4 already sold out, this is the ideal moment for investors to get in before prices climb. Experts argue that if BTC and ETH reach their projected highs, it could trigger a liquidity wave into emerging projects, with MUTM poised to benefit from its DeFi use case and growing community. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the headlines, Mutuum Finance could quietly deliver life-changing returns for early investors. Mutuum Finance: The Next Big Thing in DeFi Mutuum Finance presents itself as an outstanding innovator in decentralized finance through its dual-lending model that has impressed the entire crypto community. The project stands out for its combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models through its new uniquely connected system. The project has gained substantial investor trust as it already surpasses 9,700 investors together with its $7.9 million presale total. Despite the $0.025 token price in Phase 4 it is expected to rise to $0.03 in the upcoming phase as demand intensifies before the supply dwindles. Mutuum Finance has introduced a dynamic dashboard featuring real-time leaderboards of the 50 highest token holders and provides additional MUTM tokens for leaders. The additional MUTM token rewards for board leaders create friendly competition which motivates investors to spend more time in the platform. This gamified aspect contributes to the development of an extremely interactive environment. How Mutuum Finance’s Dual Lending System Works At the heart of Mutuum Finance’s appeal is its hybrid lending system. Through the P2C model, users can earn passive income by lending USDT to smart-contract-powered liquidity pools that handle everything automatically. On the other hand, the P2P model eliminates third-party interference entirely giving users the freedom to borrow or lend directly ensuring more privacy, flexibility, and control. This blend of two systems strikes a strong balance between decentralization and efficiency, offering something that appeals to both cautious and adventurous DeFi users alike. The $100,000 Giveaway and Growing Community Mutuum Finance isn’t stopping at just building tech, it’s also building a thriving user base. To that end, the team has launched a $100,000 token giveaway, in which ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. There’s also a referral program designed to reward users for bringing others into the ecosystem, with incentives for individuals and organizations alike. Holders of MUTM tokens gain access to exclusive updates and features, helping them stay closely connected to the platform’s progress and direction. Bitcoin heading to $170K and Ethereum aiming for $7,650 in 2025 could ignite a major altcoin rally, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is perfectly positioned. With over $7.9M raised and 65% of Phase 4 sold out at $0.025, a 50x move to $1.25 is firmly on the table. Phase 4 buyers lock in 140% gains before listing. Momentum is building fast, act now or miss out on DeFi’s next breakout.

TRUMP appears ready for a breakout, with potential to hit $13.70 if upward momentum holds. Meanwhile, Ethereum is focused on improving scalability and decentralization, aiming to climb to $2,200. Yet, for those evaluating long-term opportunities in crypto, Unstaked is drawing significant interest. Unstaked brings something different to the table. Instead of market-driven hype, it presents a real growth path from its stage 8 presale price of $0.00799 to an expected launch price of $0.1819, offering a 2700% ROI. What truly separates it is the way its governance works. It gives every $UNSD holder a say, avoiding centralized decisions or insider control, making it a platform that shares direction with its users. TRUMP Forecast: Will It Break Past $13.70? TRUMP is gaining traction as it tries to exit its downward pattern. With a 3.5% uptick, its price action is being closely watched. Analysts point to resistance at $12.15, with a breakout potentially pushing it toward $13.70 if bullish sentiment persists. Technical signals present mixed results. The MACD histogram shows a decline in bearish momentum, suggesting a possible bullish shift. But the 50-day and 200-day EMAs remain significant resistance zones. TRUMP’s future trajectory depends on overcoming these levels and regaining momentum. While Trumo coin can deliver strong short-term moves, its long-term reliability remains uncertain. High volatility may lead to big wins or steep losses. This has led some to explore more predictable growth paths. Ethereum Targets $2,200: Will it Reach? ETH remains a key player in the altcoin space, though not without hurdles. Following a consolidation phase, Ethereum’s development plans are getting noticed. The team is working to boost scalability using advanced rollups. Vitalik Buterin has underlined the role of reliable proof systems to secure the network under growing demand. In terms of price, Ethereum is targeting a potential rise to $2,200. Analysts from Amberdata have noted a rise in demand for call options at this level, along with a possible ETH/BTC rebound, which may give Ethereum added strength against Bitcoin. However, progress in Ethereum’s roadmap may take time, and market conditions will influence its trajectory. This has prompted some to consider alternative projects with clearer paths to user-led growth. Unstaked: Transparent Governance and Equal Access TRUMP may face volatility, and ETH continues working on technical advancements, but Unstaked brings a straightforward approach focused on transparency. It’s structured so that each $UNSD holder plays a role in the platform’s direction, without a central authority. Its governance is fully open, enabling users to suggest ideas, vote on developments, and decide key platform actions. There’s no preferential access, no hidden allocations, and no dominant whales steering the course. This setup means that active participants genuinely shape what Unstaked becomes. Alongside that, Unstaked’s AI-based platform is still in development and will become active after the presale concludes. The crypto presale has already raised over $4.1 million, including $1 million in just 24 hours. With a stage 8 price of $0.00799 and a launch price of $0.1819, it presents a clear 2700% ROI. Fair pricing for all participants ensures equal entry, avoiding early adopter advantages often seen elsewhere. In a space where fairness is rare, Unstaked prioritizes shared governance and open access, making every user part of the platform’s progress. Summing Up! TRUMP could surge if it breaks resistance levels, and Ethereum stays strong with continuous upgrades. But Unstaked presents a clearer case for those focused on the long run. With its 2700% ROI potential and a governance system designed to give every participant a say, Unstaked stands out. It’s not driven by hype or insider agendas.

Chainlink Staking Up 7% & Hedera Sees $15.6 Trillion Volume,https://thecoinrise.com/web3-ais-presale-pulls-in-500k-within-a-day-chainlink-staking-up-7-hedera-sees-15-6-trillion-volume/,"When decisions are based on feelings instead of facts, outcomes often go wrong. Chainlink is now focused on long-term user support with its new structured reward plan for stakers. Meanwhile, Hedera is seeing a huge jump in stablecoin use, pushed forward by tools meant for safe and regulated usage. Both are solid steps that push real use of blockchain. But Web3 ai has taken another path by using deep-learning AI models to make accurate crypto price forecasts. Unlike changes that follow user actions or staking, this tool reads current market data in real time. This makes Web3 ai stand out by giving users a clear edge in choosing the right time to act. That’s the main reason why it’s gaining attention in the latest Web3 ai update. Web3 ai’s Price Prediction Shows Rally to $1 Guesswork based on social media trends or gut instinct often leads to losses. That’s where Web3 ai is proving its strength. Its Price Prediction Tool is built with LSTM and GRU neural networks that go beyond guesswork, offering data-backed insights. Rather than promoting speculation, it gives calculated signals for upcoming short- and mid-term price changes. This tool offers real-time analysis of technical patterns, key data points, on-chain trends, and market mood. This lets users avoid poor entry points, plan better exits, and ride price swings before they become obvious to the crowd. Because of this reliability, Web3 ai pulled in $500K in just one night. Early users also jumped into the presale, now topping $2.5 million in only a few days. Priced currently at $0.00033 in stage 3, with a future listing price of $0.005242, the possible return sits at a massive 1747%. As word spreads about a $1 price goal, more people are calling $WAI the best crypto to buy now . The market is clearly moving from hype-based actions to smart tools. Relying only on feelings might leave many behind. Web3 ai is about smart decisions, not random guesses. Hedera (HBAR) Update: Stablecoin Growth Hits New Highs Hedera (HBAR) is gaining attention with its rising stablecoin activity, showing it’s being used more in the real world. Just in 2024, stablecoin transfers on Hedera crossed $15.6 trillion, proving the network can handle heavy workloads with ease and low costs. Hedera is quickly becoming a top pick for developers and financial services aiming to grow stablecoin systems. A big reason for this growth is the launch of Stablecoin Studio. It helps businesses build and manage stablecoins while staying within legal rules. For example, banks in the Philippines are using Hedera to issue PHPX, a peso-backed stablecoin that makes sending and receiving money faster and cheaper. Also, Hedera’s stablecoin market cap jumped from $81 million to $130 million in just two weeks, a 980% rise over the last year. This sharp growth is attracting more eyes to Hedera (HBAR) news across finance and tech sectors. Chainlink Update: New Rewards Drive Long-Term Participation The latest Chainlink (LINK) update brings a rewards program that aims to build trust among those who stake. It’s made to boost active validator roles and add strength to the network. In this setup, LINK holders earn rewards for helping to keep data feeds secure and active. This method also gets users to hold onto their LINK, which could shrink the supply and possibly push prices higher. Chainlink is now leaning into long-term support, and this payout model adds another reason to stay involved. Overall, it signals a smarter approach to building deeper community ties, especially with those aiming for steady returns. With fixed rules for who can join and clear reward steps, this Chainlink (LINK) update brings new focus to staking and shows its value for consistent earners. Final Verdict! While Chainlink grows through better staking and Hedera expands through stablecoin use, both are reacting to existing demand. Web3 ai, on the other hand, is focused on reading signals before they trend. By using LSTM and GRU neural networks, Web3 ai shifts the model from reacting after the fact to preparing in advance. This gives users an upper hand and removes the stress of emotional calls. Web3 ai is not just another crypto project, it shows that many are now looking for smart tools that are based on real analysis. As crypto grows up, smart data tools are becoming a must-have.

But while the majors hold their ground, two rising stars — NEAR Protocol (NEAR) and MAGACOINFINANCE (MAGA) — are rapidly gaining attention, offering fresh opportunities for investors seeking the next big play. Cardano (ADA): Stable but Testing Resistance Currently, Cardano is practicing around the psychological level of $0.68, which is above the support of $0.66-$0.63. Even so, this is occurring despite mixed technical indicators. ADA is up 44% year over year but faces a critical area of resistance at $0.70-$0.74. Investors are keeping a watchful eye as the platform progresses with scaling upgrades and governance improvements. Ethereum (ETH): Momentum Holds Strong Ethereum is still the backbone of DeFi and Web3 and is presently trading at $3,762.59 (almost 30% in a week). May price is forecasted to average $1,665, long run forecasts pegging it at $2,900 by the end of the year. Ethereum’s ongoing strength at these levels is maintained by institutional flows and growing layer-2 solutions. XRP: Building Toward a Summer Breakout XRP holds firm between $1.77–$1.90 , trading around $2.08–$2.10 after a mild pullback. Analysts remain bullish, with some projecting a $7–$10 range for the summer, citing strong institutional interest and upcoming ecosystem milestones. XRP’s stability at support makes it one of the top assets to watch. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Quietly Gaining Ground NEAR has been quietly rising under the radar. Known for its scalable sharding technology and developer-friendly tools, NEAR is increasingly finding traction in DeFi and gaming. As adoption grows, analysts believe NEAR could become one of 2025’s surprise leaders — offering compelling upside for early movers. MAGACOINFINANCE: Rapid Growth Grabs the Spotlight MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW While NEAR climbs quietly, MAGACOINFINANCE is making noise. With over $8 million raised , the project is in Stage 7 of its presale, offering a $0.007 listing target and a 25x–36x ROI potential from its current price under $0.001 . The MAGA50X bonus code offers an additional 50% token bonus , further amplifying investor excitement. What’s even more remarkable is that MAGACOINFINANCE has built a loyal community that continues to grow by the day, fueling viral momentum across crypto spaces. This is not the end, it is the beginning most importantly. The investment opportunity with MAGACOINFINANCE now is quite attractive as Stages 7, 8 and 9 are still open. Soon the coin will be listed and it will attract attention from more users. Final Takeaway LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X With a strong support from Cardano, Ethereum, and XRP, NEAR appears to be the next big gainer that investors should not miss out on. Also, MAGACOINFINANCE is breaking out. They’re showing dynamic mix of blue-chip stability and early-stage excitement defining the current crypto landscape.

Ripple’s rise comes after the SEC settlement which brought much needed clarity and boosted investor confidence and institutional interest. Ripple’s comeback shows the potential in the crypto space especially for new tokens that are about to grow exponentially. Enter Ruvi , a new cryptocurrency project that’s expected to capture the next wave of innovation and investment. Combining blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI), Ruvi has a unique value proposition for forward thinking investors. Just like Ripple’s trailblazing work in cross border transactions, Ruvi is targeting real world problems with real solutions. Here’s why Ruvi might be the next big thing. Ripple’s Lessons for Early Investors Ripple has revolutionized global payments by providing faster, cheaper and more efficient cross border transactions. With 3-5 second transaction times and costs of just $0.0002 per transaction , XRP has carved out a space in sectors that were once dominated by traditional financial systems. But the real lesson investors can learn from Ripple is the power of early adoption. Those who saw XRP’s potential years ago turned small investments into life changing returns during its price rise. With its current comeback, Ripple shows how innovation that meets market demand creates value for both enterprises and investors. Ruvi offers the same opportunity for those who are ready to identify the next growth story at its earliest stage. Why Ruvi Stands Out While Ripple is focusing on streamlining global payments, Ruvi is redefining innovation by marrying blockchain with AI to solve complex problems in industries like healthcare, resource management and logistics. Here’s how Ruvi is uniquely positioned for success: AI Integration : Ruvi uses predictive analytics to provide real time insights and actionable solutions that businesses can rely on. Scarcity by Design : Ruvi’s token supply is capped at 5 billion so scarcity is controlled and demand will increase over time. Presale Bonuses : Early investors can get up to 100% presale bonuses making this the best time to get in on the project.Just like Ripple, Ruvi’s focus on utility means it’s more than just a speculative asset. It’s a tool for real world applications and long term growth. Timing Is Everything Ruvi is in presale now and tokens are available at $0.01 each. This early entry point comes with huge growth potential especially with presale bonuses. Act now and you could be the difference between small returns and big profits. Ruvi Returns To see Ruvi’s potential, check out these investment examples: Entry-Level Investor ($500) Tokens Bought: 50,000 Bonus Tokens (40%): 20,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 70,000 Projected Value (at $2 per token): $140,000 Mid-Tier Investor ($3,000) Tokens Bought: 300,000 Bonus Tokens (80%): 240,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 540,000 Projected Value (at $2.50 per token): $1.35 million High-End Investor ($10,000) Tokens Bought: 1,000,000 Bonus Tokens (100%): 1,000,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 2,000,000 Projected Value (at $3 per token): $6 million These examples show Ruvi’s potential to deliver big returns just like Ripple’s early investors. Ruvi vs Ripple Ripple’s appeal is in its utility as a bridge currency for global transactions and partnerships with enterprises across borders. Ruvi follows the same utility philosophy but broadens its scope. By solving problems in industries beyond payments, Ruvi’s use cases have wide applications and long term relevance. Ripple focuses on financial systems, Ruvi’s AI driven approach pushes the boundaries of what blockchain can do and positions it as a game changer in multiple sectors. Should You Get Ruvi Now? Ruvi is a once in a lifetime chance to get in on the ground floor of a high potential cryptocurrency. Just like Ripple made way for blockchain based global payments, Ruvi is changing industries with AI. With its $0.01 presale price and bonuses, there’s no better time to get in on Ruvi. Conclusion Ripple’s success and ongoing growth shows how innovation and timing can create huge opportunities for investors. Ruvi with its AI backed solutions and capped token supply brings a new dimension to the crypto space. Don’t miss the chance to be an early backer of what could be the next big name in blockchain. Join Ruvi now and be part of the future of cryptocurrency innovation. Get your tokens, act now and watch your investment grow with this project.

From market giants to early-stage breakouts, these five cryptos are poised to define the next big rally. One stands out above the rest: MAGACOINFINANCE , the rising contender that’s capturing early investor attention. 1. MAGACOINFINANCE — Political Meme Power with 35x Potential MAGACOINFINANCE is more than a meme — it’s a movement. With over 50,000 holders , nonstop presale momentum, and a sharp political theme that resonates with U.S. retail investors, it’s become the fastest-growing presale of 2025 . This early Ethereum investor cited several reasons for making MAGACOINFINANCE his #1 altcoin for this cycle: $132,000+ on-chain whale buy (largest of any presale so far) Listing price target of $0.007 — Stage 7 still under $0.0003 35x ROI forecast based on presale metrics and media growth Coverage across major crypto sites and political finance spaces Community growth fueling FOMO ahead of listings If meme coins like DOGE and SHIB were driven by culture, MAGACOINFINANCE is powered by ideology, identity, and timing . 2. Ripple (XRP) — ETF Narrative and Global Expansion Ripple is back in the headlines as ETF rumors, expanding global adoption, and strong legal positioning make XRP one of the few legacy coins with major institutional upside. Key support: $2.08 Breakout targets: $2.46 to $5.00 Catalysts: ETF speculation, central bank integrations 3. SHIBA INU (SHIB) — Burn Rates and Shibarium Adoption SHIB’s growth story continues thanks to deflationary pressure via token burns, renewed Shibarium usage, and a loyal community. The Ethereum whale sees $0.00008 as a reachable target if momentum holds. 4. Cardano (ADA) — Technical Strength and Network Growth With ADA regaining support at $0.80 and heading toward $1.10, the investor noted its staking growth and dApp development as key signs of a 2025 resurgence. 5. Arbitrum (ARB) — Rebound Play for Layer 2 Value At $0.28, ARB is undervalued. As Ethereum’s Layer 1 continues to deal with congestion, Layer 2 projects like Arbitrum stand to benefit. He sees a mid-cycle breakout coming once gas savings and migration hit critical mass. 6. Chainlink (LINK) — Data Backbone of DeFi and RWA With its integration across AI, RWA, and traditional financial infrastructure, LINK is being called the “invisible engine” behind Web3. Price targets: $19.50 to $22 once $16.80 is reclaimed. Final Takeaway This isn’t your average meme coin list. From institutional-grade assets like XRP and LINK to the explosive presale energy of MAGACOINFINANCE , this Ethereum millionaire is positioning his portfolio for maximum asymmetric upside in 2025. If you’re watching for the next big mover, MAGACOINFINANCE might be it —with 35x gains projected and the political narrative heating up.

Known for community driven growth and astronomical returns Shiba Inu went from an internet joke to a serious player in the crypto space with a market cap of over $9.44 billion . While SHIB’s recent run shows the power of digital assets, a new crypto project called Ruvi is making waves as it gets ready to deliver similar life changing returns. By combining blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI) Ruvi is going to solve real world problems across industries like healthcare, logistics and data analytics. With its presale Ruvi is an opportunity you can’t ignore. Could it be the next SHIB? Here’s everything you need to know. Shiba Inu’s Rise to Fame Shiba Inu’s story is legendary. Launched by the pseudonym “Ryoshi” in 2020 this Ethereum based token turned a joke into a global movement. Fueled by community passion and endorsements from the likes of Elon Musk, SHIB shattered expectations and turned early adopters into overnight millionaires. One of the key factors behind SHIB’s success was its accessibility. The token was affordable and had a massive circulating supply so even small investors could hold millions of SHIB. Paired with ecosystem developments like ShibaSwap and a growing use case in the metaverse Shiba Inu has evolved into more than just a meme coin. But if you missed the SHIB train, Ruvi might be your chance to catch the next one. Why Ruvi Deserves Your Attention Ruvi isn’t just jumping into the crypto scene with hype, it’s backed by innovation and utility. Here’s what sets Ruvi apart: AI Integration Ruvi combines blockchain with advanced artificial intelligence to provide predictive insights and decision making tools to solve complex problems in industries like logistics, resource management and healthcare. Limited Supply With a token supply capped at 5 billion Ruvi ensures scarcity which could drive long term value as demand increases. Compare this to SHIB’s 589.55 trillion supply and you can see the value retention with Ruvi.* Presale Bonuses Early adopters can get up to 100% presale bonuses effectively doubling their investment before the token launches. Ruvi’s presale is just $0.01, a great entry point with huge upside. The SHIB phenomenon showed us that early participation in projects can lead to big fortunes and Ruvi could be the next one. Big Returns, Structured Approach By investing in Ruvi now you can be an early participant in a potentially revolutionary crypto project. Here’s a look at the potential returns: Entry-Level Investment ($500) Tokens Acquired: 50,000 Presale Bonus (40%): 20,000 Total Tokens: 70,000 Potential Future Value (at $1.50 per token): $105,000 Mid-Tier Investment ($3,000) Tokens Acquired: 300,000 Presale Bonus (80%): 240,000 Total Tokens: 540,000 Potential Future Value (at $2 per token): $1.08 million High-End Investment ($10,000) Tokens Acquired: 1,000,000 Presale Bonus (100%): 1,000,000 Total Tokens: 2,000,000 Potential Future Value (at $3 per token): $6 million Imagine multiplying your investment as Ruvi grows and gets adopted across industries. Ruvi vs Shiba Inu While Shiba Inu is about entertainment and community, Ruvi is about a next level utility model that solves real world problems. Both offer big returns for early adopters but Ruvi’s AI backed solutions and capped supply makes it a strong alternative for investors looking for value beyond speculation. Don’t Miss Out With crypto thriving on innovation and timing Ruvi is an opportunity you can’t miss to invest in a high potential project at ground level. The lessons from Shiba Inu showed us how early stage investments can deliver exponential returns. Ruvi with its game changing technology and presale bonuses could very well be the success story of tomorrow. Conclusion Shiba Inu made millions for early adopters. Ruvi will change the game for blockchain and AI. Get in Ruvi today and grow with the crypto market. The future is for the early birds.

With a market cap of $29.15 billion this proof-of-stake blockchain is showing why it’s considered a leader in decentralization and innovation. But as good as Cardano has been, there’s a new contender catching the attention of blockchain enthusiasts and investors. Enter Ruvi , a cryptocurrency project that’s going to redefine blockchain by adding artificial intelligence (AI) to its core. Ruvi isn’t just another token. By combining AI with the blockchain’s transparency and security it’s going to solve problems across industries like supply chain, healthcare and resource allocation. If you were impressed by Cardano’s growth, Ruvi might just be the project to watch for the next wave of exponential returns. Lessons from Cardano’s Success Cardano has carved its name not just as a technological powerhouse but also as a model for sustainable growth. Its focus on peer-reviewed research and academic rigor sets it apart and builds trust among stakeholders. Initiatives like smart contract support via the Alonzo upgrade and its recent moves to optimize scalability with mechanisms like Ouroboros have been key to its growth. For investors who saw ADA’s potential in 2017 when it was priced at $0.0024 today’s prices are a 345x return . That’s the power of spotting a good project early. This is where Ruvi comes in, offering a ground floor opportunity for those looking for the next exponential growth story. Why Ruvi Stands Out Ruvi isn’t competing with the blockchain giants; it’s carving its own path by using blockchain and AI to solve real world problems. Here’s why Ruvi has all the hallmarks of a breakout: AI-Blockchain Fusion Ruvi is unique with its focus on AI, data driven solutions for logistics and healthcare. Its predictive capabilities will enhance decision making in real time.* Scarcity and Value Creation With a capped supply of only 5 billion tokens Ruvi ensures scarcity, as adoption grows long term value. Compare that to Cardano’s larger circulating supply and Ruvi’s strategy looks even better. Generous Early Incentives With bonuses up to 100% Ruvi’s presale is the best chance to max out your holdings before the project launches.

Analysts Suggest it Will Reach $2.00 and Deliver 20,000% Profits to Early Investors",https://timestabloid.com/can-ruvi-ai-ruvi-follow-trons-trx-legacy-analysts-suggest/,"Tron (TRX) has mastered its role as a blockchain ecosystem focused on decentralized content sharing and applications (dApps), with a current price of $0.2625 and a market cap of $24.91 billion . Tron’s decentralized approach has enabled millions of transactions and positioned it as one of the leaders in the crypto space. Yet, while Tron continues to flourish, a newcomer named Ruvi is stepping into the spotlight, offering a compelling mix of AI-driven blockchain solutions that could redefine the way we use cryptocurrency. Could Ruvi claim a spot alongside giants like Tron? Tron’s Achievements vs. Ruvi’s Vision Tron’s decentralized ecosystem has disrupted the content industry by allowing creators to share directly with their audiences, eliminating intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. This transparency has helped creators retain more earnings while offering consumers lower costs. Tron’s ecosystem also supports decentralized games , fast transactions, and dApps, boasting throughput that outpaces many competitors. Enter Ruvi , a game-changer blending blockchain with AI-driven content creation tools . Unlike Tron’s broader focus on dApps and decentralized web services, Ruvi hones in on empowering users to create valuable digital content such as text, video, and images while earning $RUVI tokens . This focus positions Ruvi to appeal not only to blockchain enthusiasts but also to educators, marketers, and content creators seeking more practical, everyday utility. Why Ruvi’s Presale Is Generating Buzz Ruvi is making waves in its token presale stage , offering buyers the chance to secure $RUVI tokens at just $0.01 each. Better yet, early investors receive significant bonuses , ensuring more value for their initial contributions. Here’s how the potential for returns stacks up across investment levels. Entry-Level Investment ($800) Tokens bought at presale price: 80,000 Ruvi 40% bonus adds 32,000 tokens for a total of 112,000 Ruvi If Ruvi’s price rises to $1, the investment’s value soars to $112,000 . At $3, this could hit a staggering $336,000 . Mid-Level Investment ($1,500) Tokens purchased at presale price: 150,000 Ruvi A 60% bonus adds 90,000 additional tokens , totaling 240,000 Ruvi At $2 per token, the investment grows to $480,000 , or $720,000 at $3. High-Level Investment ($7,000) Tokens acquired at the presale rate: 700,000 Ruvi With a 100% bonus , holdings double to 1.4 million Ruvi If Ruvi’s price hits $3, this could result in a massive $4.2 million return. These enticing early-stage potential gains make Ruvi a standout opportunity for investors seeking the next big thing in crypto. Ruvi’s Focus on AI vs. Tron’s Decentralization Tron disrupted the content world by decentralizing how creators share and monetize their work, supported by a rich dApp ecosystem and scalable transaction speeds. It excelled in areas like decentralized gaming and stablecoin activity while maintaining nearly 10 billion active accounts globally. Ruvi, however, brings a novel twist with its AI-infused platform , offering content creators the tools to directly generate and monetize their original work. Think of Ruvi as a blockchain-based assistant for creators, enabling them to effortlessly produce and share high-quality materials while being rewarded in crypto. When paired with its limited 5 billion token supply , Ruvi’s economic model ensures strong potential for token valuation as demand scales. The Time to Act is Now If you regretted missing Tron’s early days, or the chance to capitalize on its disruptive growth, now is the perfect time to consider Ruvi. Just as Tron revolutionized content sharing, Ruvi is expected to lead the next evolution by making blockchain accessible to creatives and everyday users alike. The presale won’t last forever , and opportunities like these pass quickly. Secure your $RUVI tokens today and position yourself at the forefront of this innovative AI-powered blockchain solution.

The hype isn’t just about the latest meme or fleeting trend anymore. Now, it’s about substance, real utility, and early access to tech that people actually want to use. And with presale stages moving quickly, the window to get in on these emerging opportunities is narrowing by the day. Right now, three crypto ICOs are making waves for all the right reasons: BlockDAG, Cold Wallet, and Dragoin. They’re offering more than buzzwords. We’re talking about mobile-based mining, true privacy layers, and gamified ecosystems that turn participation into profit. If you’re watching the early-stage crypto scene, here are the names you need to know. 1. BlockDAG ($BDAG): Mobile Mining, Real Momentum, and a $235M ICO Milestone BlockDAG has become a headline act in the world of crypto ICOs, and for good reason. With over 1 million users already engaging through its X1 mobile mining app, it’s making it possible for anyone with a smartphone to join the mining revolution. No complicated rigs. No gatekeeping. Just open access to earning, and it’s working. The numbers speak for themselves. The project has now raised over $235 million, with more than 20 billion coins sold so far. Currently in Batch 28, BlockDAG is offering a limited presale price of $0.0019 until May 13, while the batch pricing has already climbed to $0.0262. Early participants from Batch 1 have already seen a staggering 2,520% ROI. What’s fueling this momentum is not just utility but the project’s clear lead in usability. As exchange listings near and the mobile app continues to attract new users daily, BlockDAG is setting a new standard in how crypto ICOs scale, and it’s doing it visibly, transparently, and fast. 2. Cold Wallet ($CWT): Privacy-Powered Tools for the DeFi Generation Cold Wallet is stepping into the crypto ICO scene with a bold mission: to make privacy non-negotiable. Forget overshared data and invasive trackers. Cold Wallet puts users in control by offering zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology baked into a hot wallet that thinks like a cold one. That means no IP tracking, no balance visibility, and no unnecessary data leaks. But it doesn’t stop at safety. $CWT serves as the project’s utility core, unlocking staking rewards, governance options, and exclusive app features. Now in Stage 4 of its presale, Cold Wallet is priced at $0.00743, and early backers are looking at an impressive projected ROI of 4,900%. In a market where privacy often takes a backseat to marketing gimmicks, Cold Wallet is taking the opposite approach, by putting technology and user trust first. If you’re exploring crypto ICOs with serious upside and longevity, this one offers both. 3. Dragoin ($DDGN): Fantasy Battles Meet Play-to-Earn Profitability Dragoin isn’t your typical meme coin wrapped in a Game of Thrones theme. It’s a fully interactive gaming experience that lives on the Ethereum blockchain and operates through a play-to-earn format. Users participate in dragon battles directly in Telegram, earning $DDGN in the process. Dragoin’s presale is currently in Stage 4, with the coin priced at $0.0000444. Based on current projections, early participants could see an ROI of up to 6,700%. What’s more, the project includes a deflationary burn mechanic, unsold tokens will be permanently destroyed at launch, tightening supply and adding urgency for those still on the fence. With a renounced contract, transparent tokenomics, and a focus on community-led fun, Dragoin is creating more than a meme moment. It’s building a decentralized, gamified world that rewards users both emotionally and financially. For those looking at crypto ICOs with a creative edge and strong fundamentals, Dragoin is one to watch closely. Final Word: These Crypto ICOs Offer More Than Hype There’s no shortage of early-stage coins launching in 2025. But very few are bringing both traction and tangible use cases to the table. BlockDAG has already shown it can move massive numbers with a mobile-first strategy. Cold Wallet is filling a critical gap in user privacy with real cryptographic infrastructure. And Dragoin is turning community engagement into entertainment and earnings through its battle-ready game economy. Whether you’re exploring crypto ICOs for utility, narrative, or long-term value, these three projects check all the boxes. But remember, the best entries come early. Once listings begin and prices shift, today’s opportunity becomes tomorrow’s missed chance. Want in early? Now’s the time to take a serious look.

Ronnie Atkinson of Macon, Georgia, who owns his own logging company, is accused of conspiring with a high-ranking executive at a community bank through “materially false and fraudulently pretenses, representations, and promises,” local CBS-affiliate 13WMAZ reports . Prosecutors say Atkinson had friends and relatives act “straw borrowers,” or people with good credit history who apply for loans in order to transfer funds to those who don’t. Those applications were meant to benefit Atkinson, and the high-ranking bank employee was well aware of the scheme but approved the loans anyway, according to the charges. Atkinson is also accused of giving the bank fake bills for logging equipment he supposedly needed loans for. Some bills were real but with inflated prices, and others were completely fabricated for things that were never even purchased. One of the documents provided was a real bill for $56,000, but Atkinson managed to get a loan of $149,500 for it, prosecutors allege. Says court documents, “(The market president) thus let Atkinson exceed his $500,000 lending limit without the proper approvals by making it appear these loans belonged to a different (person)… (The market president) also did not seek the required approval for (Atkinson’s) loans that were graded substandard.” A grand jury determined there is enough evidence to charge Atkinson with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and identity theft. He is facing up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. The government is also looking to seize any of his assets that were the result of the fraud.

On May 8, frontrunner Lee Jae-myung, of the Democratic Party, said that South Korea “needs to create a won-based stablecoin market.” Lee Jae-myung insisted that Seoul should “enter the stablecoin market quickly” or risk an “outflow of national wealth.” Korea's major conservative party went through one of the most tumultuous weekends in its history after the party tried to overthrow its own presidential candidate and failed — all within 24 hours. https://t.co/05W70jtJKm — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) May 11, 2025 However, his remarks drew criticism from Lee Jun-seok, the candidate for the Reform Party. South Korea’s Digital Daily quoted Lee Jun-seok as saying: “Lee Jae-myung’s take on economics is always dangerous and experimental. He is irresponsibly throwing unverified ideas around. And he repeats plausible-sounding words without understanding anything about the market.” South Korean Presidential Candidates: Stablecoin War-of-Words Lee Jun-seok added that South Korean investors have already had their fingers burned with Terra’s KRW-pegged KST stablecoin. On his social media pages, the candidate wrote: “South Korea already has experience with a won-pegged stablecoin called KRT. That same coin was at the core of the Terra-Luna incident.” Lee Jun-seok, the candidate for the South Korean Reform Party. (Source: @junseoktube/YouTube/Screenshot) The Terra ecosystem collapse of May 2022 saw the firm’s stablecoins lose their pegs. The crash wiped millions of dollars from global crypto markets. Thousands of South Koreans were affected. Lee Jun-seok continued: “Terra’s KRT started out as a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Korean Won. But it had no real assets to back it up. Instead, operators tried to maintain its price by utilizing the highly volatile sister coin, LUNA (now LUNC). But the results were disastrous.” The Reform Party candidate explained that when market confidence collapsed, LUNC’s value plummeted. He said: “All of Terra’s coins, including KRT, collapsed. That rendered the ‘stable’ in stablecoin meaningless.” PPP loses public trust after failed gambit to replace presidential candidate https://t.co/Ms0GOwKHeC — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 11, 2025 Collateral Question Lee Jun-seok hit out at Lee Jae-myung, saying that the latter was calling for the creation of a KRW stablecoin “without explaining what asset collateral will be included in.” He said that the Democratic Party candidate has not spoken about how this coin would manage market risks to overcome the “causes of past failures.” Lee Jun-seok, a former leader of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), founded the Reform Party in January 2024 following his split from the party. He has resisted calls from the PPP leadership, who last month asked him to rejoin the party as they head into next month’s election. But Lee Jae-myung’s defenders took to social media to rebut the Reform Party candidate’s claims. The former Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Byeong-wook claimed that Lee Jun-seok’s comments were “out of touch” with international regulatory trends. Ex-Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Byeong-wook (left) with presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung in 2016. (Source: @777byung1/X) Kim noted that “almost every international regulator” has already ruled that “algorithm-based tokens are too volatile to even be classified as stablecoins.” South Korean polls favor the opposition, and Lee Jae-myung won an overwhelming primary victory in late April. However, he faces several legal charges that could preclude his candidacy, @Doug_Bandow writes. https://t.co/UnyFZQ8ALP — Foreign Policy (@ForeignPolicy) May 6, 2025 He claimed that regulators everywhere from Washington to Brussels and Tokyo shared this view. Kim added: “Structures like those used by Terra are out of the question. The focus of policy discussions is now on collateralized stablecoins backed 1:1 with cash and government bond deposits. These coins would have real-time reserve disclosure protocols and immediate redemption obligations.” A War of Words Kim accused Lee Jun-seok of “lumping” algorithm-based and collateralized stablecoins together. The ex-DP MP said that Lee Jun-seok’s logic was that “Terra failed, so stablecoins are dangerous,” adding: “If he had only familiarized himself with the basic concepts of global financial regulation, Lee Jun-seok would have avoided making such a radical generalization.” Kim argued that won-pegged tokens could help cut overseas remittance fees and revitalize the domestic digital economy. The media outlet quoted an unnamed official from a domestic crypto exchange as welcoming public discourse on stablecoins and other crypto-related matters. The official said: “We are seeing politicians engage in a range of technical debates regarding virtual assets. These have not been made public until now. We are positive about seeing an institutional reorganization in the crypto sector after the election.” South Korea goes to the polls on June 3. The PPP’s candidate, Kim Moon-soo, earlier this month pledged to allow the national pension and soverign wealth funds to buy tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) .

Co-op Food, one of the largest grocery chains in the UK employing approximately 70,000 people, disclosed last month that it had suffered a cyber-attack from “highly sophisticated” criminals. Co-op CEO Shirine Khoury-Haq said that “the cyber criminals were able to access a limited amount of member data.” However, the hackers have since reached out to the BBC and reportedly gave proof that they had breached the company’s IT networks and “stolen huge amounts of customer and employee data.” Anonymous hackers operating under the name “DragonForce” reportedly showed BBC screenshots from a Microsoft Teams chat where the group told Co-op’s head of cyber security that the company was being extorted. The screenshots reportedly show the hackers saying, “Hello, we exfiltrated the data from your company…We have customer database, and Co-op member card data.” The hack has forced Co-op to begin limiting grocery deliveries to only “essential items” after its electronic data interchange (EDI) system was damaged by the exploit. In a government press release , Pat McFadden, the UK’s Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said that that “companies must treat cyber security as an absolute priority.” “These attacks need to be a wake-up call for every business in the UK. In a world where the cybercriminals targeting us are relentless in their pursuit of profit – with attempts being made every hour of every day – companies must treat cyber security as an absolute priority. “We’ve watched in real-time the disruption these attacks have caused – including to working families going about their everyday lives. It serves as a powerful reminder that just as you would never leave your car or your house unlocked on your way to work.

The breach triggered alarm among community members, raising fears over the safety of their crypto assets . Ledger team member Quintin Boatwright said that one of their contracted moderators had their account compromised, which allowed a malicious bot to post scam links in one of the channels. The hacker then prompted users to a secondary website and type in their recovery phrase, a private code that gives users complete access to their crypto wallets. Individuals who attempted to caution others in the chat were either muted or banned. The attacker employed computer bots to overwhelm these users and prevent them from speaking out against the scam enough to prevent its rapid spread. The Ledger team moved fast. They uninstalled the bot, deactivated the account, flagged the reported scam website, and audited all permissions. This helped cut the losses before the fallout could spread. Ledger responds swiftly to security breach After the server was regained, the Ledger was set to work on increasing security. Boatwright said that additional safeguards had been put in place to ensure that that couldn’t happen again. He also called attention to a fundamental rule for the community: never enter a recovery phrase or connect a wallet through any links shared on Discord. The phony website had already been removed by Sunday morning. But the harm could not be entirely assessed immediately. This is not the first time scammers have attempted to deceive Ledger users. Some Ledger customers were recently targeted in a separate scam, receiving physical letters that directed them to a site where they could “verify” their device by entering their seed phrase. The letters bore Ledger’s official logo, and the information may have been gleaned from a prior hack of Ledger’s database in 2020. Industry leaders tighten crypto security in response to threats The Ledger Discord hack is the latest escalation in phishing attacks against the crypto industry. In 2024 , phishing scams caused more than $1 billion in losses across nearly 300 events, making it the most expensive attack vector in the industry. One of the deadliest thefts in 2025, cryptocurrency firm Bybit said hackers stole $1.5bn (£1.1bn) worth of digital currency in what could be the biggest crypto theft in history. In January 2025, over 9,200 individuals were defrauded of $10.25 million in an elaborate phishing campaign against Ethereum users. To counter these threats, the crypto industry is upping its security game. Platforms are deploying multi-factor authentication, making user education on cybersecurity risks and best practices part of their priority to limit phishing attempts. Security allies and white-hat hacker collectives have also organized to pool information and collaborate on responding to new threats. Nationally and internationally, worries about politically motivated cyberattacks have mounted. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has been connected to several high-profile crypto thefts, such as July 2024’s $234.9 million hack of India exchange WazirX. According to people familiar with the plans, G7 leaders may discuss North Korea’s malicious cyber activities and crypto hacks at a summit in Canada next month, reflecting mounting global concerns over Pyongyang’s growing online thefts.

In a new interview on the Milk Road YouTube channel, Tapiero says that monetary policies need to align before digital assets can truly take off. Tapiero says Fed Chair Jerome Powell is currently “holding back” on policy shifts – but once he acts, the macro investor believes Bitcoin and the broader crypto market will soar. “[Fiscal tightening] needs to be offset by some sort of monetary offset to keep things in balance [so] the economy doesn’t have too aggressive [of] a pullback in liquidity [and] in demand side drivers. Fiscal policy has been contributing to demand, and now it’s not, and I think monetary policy needs to offset that and the dollar is already sensing that and that’s why it’s weakened… Ideally, in a perfect world, [Treasury Secretary] Bessent and Trump or whoever should have gone down to Jay Powell and said, ‘Hey guys, we’re going to be undertaking the greatest fiscal tightening of the last 50 years, give us some slack on the monetary side, let’s work together on this…’ But Powell for whatever reason is really holding back here, and I think the next few months the data will confirm that he needs to move and that’ll help Bitcoin and the whole digital asset ecosystem – Ethereum, Solana, the whole world sort of take off again because there is a part of our world that is driven by this liquidity from the old world.” According to Tapiero, relying on liquidity from traditional finance will be necessary no matter how strong Bitcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) present themselves and if his conditions are met, BTC could rally close to $200,000. “Regardless of the good fundamentals that are relating to Bitcoin, regardless of the good fundamentals relating to some of the other projects and the activity in the space, the growth of DeFi, stablecoins, even non-fungible tokens (NFTs) might be coming back a little bit, so I think you just have a little bit of liquidity from the old world come in [and] you have Bitcoin head up to my target, [which] has been $180,000 for a long time.” BTC is trading for $103,159 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

While Binance coin (BNB) shows signs of a technical push following AI integration and Shiba Inu (SHIBA) draws interest as Shibarium’s network activity picks up, both moves rely heavily on internal ecosystems to sustain traction. BlockDAG, by contrast, is capturing attention through external alignment. Its collaboration with Inter Milan ahead of the Champions League final isn’t just publicity, it’s a calculated play for trust. In a climate where visibility is easy to buy but credibility is earned, BlockDAG ’s approach stands apart, reinforcing investor confidence during a critical phase of its breakout crypto presale. BlockDAG Taps Into Inter Milan’s Spotlight to Boost Credibility In a space where trust is often elusive, partnerships can speak louder than whitepapers. In this context, BlockDAG’s recent appearance alongside Inter Milan as the club prepares for the Champions League final is more than a branding play; it’s a strategic alignment. For example, for a project deep into a $600 million presale push, visibility matters, but credibility matters more. By doing so, associating with a globally respected football club helps position BlockDAG not as just another breakout crypto but as one willing to put its name beside institutions known for discipline and excellence. Moreover, this collaboration comes at a time when investor skepticism is high, and presale participants seek tangible signals of legitimacy. With $235 million raised, over 19.7 billion coins sold, and a return of 2,520% since its first batch, BlockDAG’s presale success is already turning heads. Nevertheless, the limited-time offer of $0.0019 per coin, marked down from the current batch 28 price of $0.0262, adds urgency for newcomers who want in before the May 13 deadline. Consequently, in a market crowded with promises, BlockDAG’s alignment with Inter Milan places it in front of millions at a moment of peak attention. It’s a calculated move to reinforce long-term vision with short-term proof. For that reason, for those watching from the sidelines, this might be the signal that turns interest into action. Binance Coin Price Movement Hints at Breakout Binance coin (BNB) price movement is showing signs of renewed momentum following the announcement of AI integration through the BNB Chain’s plug-and-play module. Specifically, the integration offers developers easier access to AI-powered applications, boosting utility and user engagement across the ecosystem. As a result, this shift has added fresh energy to BNB’s technical outlook, which recently flipped a key resistance level into support. At the same time, market participants are now watching closely as BNB eyes the $635 mark, with indicators supporting a potential upward continuation. With this in mind, with AI adoption expanding and on-chain fundamentals aligning, Binance Coin is positioning itself for a possible breakout phase. Shiba Inu (SHIBA) Price Outlook Strengthens Shiba Inu (SHIBA) price outlook is gaining traction as the Shibarium network’s total value locked (TVL) nears the $3 million mark. This development indicates a surge in TVL that reflects growing confidence in the network’s capabilities. Furthermore, SHIBA’s transaction volumes have spiked by nearly 300% within 24 hours, reaching 6.93 trillion tokens. From a technical standpoint, technical analysis reveals a double-bottom pattern on SHIBA’s weekly chart, often indicative of a potential trend reversal. If this occurs, if SHIBA can surpass the neckline resistance at $0.000033, it may target a price of $0.000045, suggesting a possible 4x rally from current levels. Additionally, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) histogram bars have turned green, signaling waning bearish momentum. However, confirmation of a strong uptrend would require the AO to move into positive territory. Trust, Timing, and Traction Shiba Inu may ride the momentum of its network growth, and Binance Coin continues to evolve through technical enhancements, but both rely on internal catalysts to justify price speculation. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is building trust by associating with institutions already recognized for excellence. Its alignment with Inter Milan offers something less common in presales, public validation. As the project surpasses $235 million raised with a presale ROI of 2,520%, its strategy reflects not just timing, but intent. For those weighing which project carries the weight of credibility, BlockDAG puts a clear signal on the scoreboard.

Cardano followed with a methodical but rewarding rally, proving that solid foundations and narrative timing can still drive serious returns. Now in 2025, a new rotation is underway — and XRP, Litecoin, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing renewed investor attention. While Solana and Cardano paved the way, this next group could define the mid-year breakout phase of the altcoin cycle. XRP: Ready for the Next Leg Up XRP has re-entered bullish territory, trading above $2 after consolidating gains from earlier this year. With legal clarity mostly behind it and institutional use cases expanding — especially in global remittances — XRP is once again on the radar for smart money. RSI is holding near 64, signaling steady upward pressure Analysts forecast a near-term push to $2.40–$2.65 , with potential to challenge $3 On-chain whale activity is climbing, showing conviction at current levels Litecoin: The Reliable Macro Hedge Litecoin (LTC), long considered the “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s gold, is seeing a quiet resurgence. Traders are increasingly turning to LTC for its speed, cost efficiency, and legacy status in a maturing market. Current price action is approaching resistance zones from early 2023 Analysts eye a breakout to $120+ if volume surges continue Historical data shows LTC often outperforms during mid-cycle rotations MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Wildcard With Parabolic Potential While XRP and LTC are returning to the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as a fresh contender. Still in its presale phase and trading under $0.001 , the token is gaining traction for its high-engagement community, viral momentum, and scarcity-driven model. With Stage 7 now live and a projected listing target of $0.007 , the opportunity to enter early remains intact. Investors using the MAGA50X promo code unlock a 50% token bonus , amplifying upside at this critical stage. More importantly, this is where the real narrative begins. Investors are asking: What’s next for the presale? What does the future hold post-listing? And most critically — why is it still worth joining now? The answer is simple: this isn’t the end. It’s the beginning. Coins launched from similar structures have delivered 18,500%+ gains in past cycles — and MAGACOIN FINANCE may be next in line.

The investors are continuing to assert that Binance’s decision to remove Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) from its platform caused substantial market damage to the cryptocurrency. Legal representatives for the BSV holder coalition have filed to challenge the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal’s July 2024 dismissal. According to recent court documents, they argued that the court failed to properly consider the full economic impact of the delisting action. You might also like: Ether.fi breaks out: Staking surge sends TVL to record high Multi-billion pound claim at stake The revived case could result in one of the largest damages claims in cryptocurrency history, with BSV investors pursuing compensation that reportedly exceeds £10 billion (approximately $13 billion) for alleged market manipulation and anti-competitive behavior. Market analysts note that the renewed legal action coincided with a temporary price spike for Bitcoin SV. The coin saw a 15% gain before settling at the $42 range at press time. Despite this momentary rally, the cryptocurrency trades below its all-time highs. The controversy arose from Binance’s decision to delist BSV in April 2019, during a contentious industry discussion about the coin’s founder and his dubious claims about the beginnings of Bitcoin. Several other major exchanges followed with similar delisting actions shortly thereafter. Industry observers suggest this case could establish important precedents regarding the authority exchanges have in determining which cryptocurrencies remain accessible to traders, and whether delisting decisions can be considered anti-competitive practices under existing regulatory frameworks. BSV, which emerged following a contentious hard fork, has faced several technical and security challenges in recent years. Critics say its network vulnerabilities are justification for the original delisting decisions. The exchange has previously maintained that its listing policies are applied consistently based on technical merit and community standards rather than targeted action against specific projects.

Boatwright said the security breach was an isolated incident and that Ledger has taken additional measures to strengthen its security on Discord, a chat platform many crypto projects use to share protocol developments and engage with their community. Using the compromised Ledger community manager account, the hacker told Ledger Discord members that there was a recently discovered vulnerability in the firm’s security systems and strongly urged all users to verify their recovery phrases with a scam link, according to several screenshots shared on X. Ledger users were asked to connect their wallets and follow on-screen instructions. Source: ecurrencyholder It isn’t clear whether anyone was affected by the security breach. Cointelegraph has reached out to Ledger for comment. Ledger scammers were sending physical letters last month In April, scammers were mailing physical letters to owners of Ledger hardware wallets, asking them to validate their private seed phrases in a bid to access and empty the wallets. The letter used Ledger’s logo, business address and a reference number to feign legitimacy and asked users to scan a QR code and enter the wallet’s recovery phrase. One Ledger user who received the letter speculated whether scammers were sending letters to Ledger customers whose data was leaked in July 2020. Related: Jameson Lopp: Most don’t realize how easy self-custody has become That incident saw a hacker breach Ledger’s database and dump the personal information of over 270,000 of its customers online, which included names, phone numbers and home addresses.

One veteran trader recently revealed he’s steering clear of SOL in 2025, citing concerns over centralization risks and recurring network outages that could hinder long-term growth. Instead, his focus has shifted to an emerging altcoin trading under $0.05, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance tokens are available at $0.025 in phase 4 backed by innovative approach to decentralized finance. The project has raised over $7.9 million and attracted over 9700 investors. Over 65% of the phase 4 has been sold out meaning inventors have less time before the phase concludes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Low-Price Giant Waiting in the Wings Mutuum Finance is selling for $0.025 in Phase 4 of its presale and already making waves with its fast pace. Over $7.9 million has been raised from more than 9,700 investors. With a Phase 5 price increase to $0.03 and a projected public listing price of $0.06, Phase 4 investors are looking at a 140% return by the time the token lists on exchanges. That kind of upfront potential is catching serious attention, not just from retail investors, but also from Ethereum whales quietly buying up behind the scenes. Mutuum Finance is taking a bold step in the DeFi market with a hybrid lending framework that incorporates the best features of Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer functionality. The architecture allows for passive returns by way of smart contract-managed pools as well as peer-to-peer lending between users for increased discretion and control. It’s an adaptive, dual-lane approach to borrowing and lending that’s not typical of decentralized finance. Gamified Engagement and Smart Tokenomics To make it more attractive, Mutuum Finance has recently introduced a leaderboard gamified in the form of a top 50 token holders leaderboard. Such users are eligible for additional rewards, thereby creating a competitive atmosphere that encourages long-term holding as well as community engagement. The platform has also partnered with CertiK on a full smart contract audit, increasing investor confidence and transparency. mtTokens and Yield Without Lockups One of Mutuum Finance’s key features is its mtToken program, which allows users to earn yield on tokenized assets like ETH and DAI without necessarily locking them up. This stands in stark contrast to typical staking protocols in which liquidity gets sacrificed for the sake of passive returns. Complementing this is a sensible loan-to-value framework, such as $5,000 lent against $7,000 value of ETH, for a safe-borrowing environment. As top traders move away from Solana over centralization and outage concerns, attention is shifting fast to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a low-price DeFi gem still under $0.05. Now in Phase 4 at $0.025 with 65% sold out and over $7.9M raised, investors are racing to secure 140% gains before the Phase 5 price jump. With smart tokenomics, audited contracts, yield without lockups, and a gamified ecosystem, MUTM isn’t just another altcoin, it’s the one elite insiders are quietly stacking. Time is running out, get in before the rest of the market wakes up. Mutuum Finance is offering something truly innovative with its dual-lending system, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality, making it a standout in the DeFi market. This is your chance to get in on the ground floor, before everyone else catches on. Don’t miss out on what could be the next big DeFi breakthrough.

Contracts tied to the S&P 500 climbed about 1.3 percent as of 6:20 p.m. in New York, while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.5 percent. The gains followed a weekend meeting in Switzerland, the first face-to-face encounter since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, who headed his delegation, called the session “an important first step” toward settling differences. No new policies were unveiled, yet he said the two sides agreed to open a permanent channel led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and himself. Bessent told reporters that Washington will release more details on Monday, and He said a joint statement is in the works. The stakes are high for American businesses that sell into China or rely on Chinese demand. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence , Gillian Wolff and Gina Martin Adams, estimate that the average S&P 500 company booked 6.1 percent of its 2024 revenue in the Chinese market. Exposure is much larger for some well-known names: Apple Inc. drew 17 percent of its sales from China in the three months ended in March, and Tesla Inc. generated 22 percent of its revenue there, according to the firms’ latest earnings reports. Successive rounds of retaliation have pushed US tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent, while Beijing’s levy on American goods stands at 125 percent. Before the weekend talks, Trump floated cutting the headline US tariff to 80 percent, down from the existing 145 percent, if progress could be achieved. The S&P 500 slipped 0.5 percent last week, giving back part of a rebound that began after Trump’s April 2 call for “reciprocal tariffs” knocked the index to the edge of a bear market. Even with the modest weekly drop, milder rhetoric helped Wall Street regain ground. Outside the stock market, many large companies say shifting trade rules are starting to squeeze their plans. United Parcel Service Inc., Ford Motor Co. and toy maker Mattel Inc. have all withdrawn earnings guidance in recent weeks, saying supply snags and unpredictable tariffs make forecasting too risky. Optimism also lifted sentiment around Asian stocks Japan’s Nikkei 225 futures were quoted at 37,830 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, compared with Friday’s cash close of 37,503.33. A weaker yen added to the upbeat mood for exporters as both the Japanese currency and the euro opened lower against the dollar after the Swiss meeting. Washington and Beijing each spoke of “substantial progress,” yet investors still seek concrete steps. “It’s not yet clear what exactly is involved, so we’ll have to wait and see what comes out going forward,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management. “The yen is weakening, and at the very least, there doesn’t seem to be a negative market reaction. As we wait for specific announcements, the general trend of recovery is likely to continue.” The Nikkei 225 has gained about 5 percent since April 2, one of the best gains among major stock benchmarks. Japan was among the first nations to enter formal trade talks with Washington after the tariff shake-up, though a final deal has yet to be struck.

The comment came just as Washington was also claiming headway in a separate negotiation with Beijing. Peter Hoekstra, who became U.S. envoy to Canada last month, told Global TV’s “The West Block” that President Donald Trump’s 25 percent duty placed on most Canadian goods in March may not disappear soon. “I’m not sure they’ll be totally removed,” Hoekstra said when asked about the levy, which the White House has justified by linking fentanyl trafficking to Canadian supply chains. Customs data indicate that less than 1 percent of the fentanyl seized at U.S. borders arrives from Canada, though officials say some production does take place north of the border. Hoekstra’s remarks followed a fresh trade pact between Washington and London that offered the United Kingdom only limited relief on car, steel, and aluminum duties while keeping a 10 percent base tariff on British imports. The ambassador stressed that Canada and the United States can move past months of tension during which Trump urged Canada to become the “51st state” and mocked then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as “Governor Trudeau.” The president struck a more cordial tone last week when newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney visited the White House. “I think the president wants a very positive relationship,” Hoekstra said. “We have moved beyond the 51st state, at least as far as I’m concerned.” Substantial progress has been made in US-China tariff deal While the North American discussion played out, senior U.S. and Chinese officials were working behind closed doors in Switzerland on the deepest trade rift of all. After two days of meetings in Geneva, both sides said on Sunday that they had made real progress. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the sessions “productive and constructive.” China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng used the words “in-depth” and “candid” to describe the talks, the first face-to-face encounter since Mr. Trump hit Chinese goods with a 145 percent tariff in January. Beijing had replied with its own 125 percent charge on certain American products, jolting financial markets and raising fears of a global downturn. Full details of the Geneva discussion are to be released jointly on Monday. Still, the tone from negotiators was upbeat. U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer said “the deal we struck with our Chinese partners” would help narrow America’s 1.2 trillion-dollar trade deficit. Bessent reported “substantial progress” on lowering the temperature of the dispute, while He Lifeng told reporters that the outcome was “of great significance to the two countries but also has an important impact on the stability and development of the global economy.” Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, inspector general of the World Trade Organization, welcomed the breakthrough. “I urge both nations to build on this momentum by continuing to develop practical solutions that mitigate tensions, restore predictability, and strengthen confidence in the multilateral trading system,” she said in a written statement. Trump, commenting after the first day of the meetings, praised what he called a “total reset” in relations. In a social-media post on Saturday, he said the talks were “very good” and that change had been “negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|CAD|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-12 01:06:03

The attack resulted in the theft of nearly 1.5 ETH, prompting an emergency DAO vote to rotate the oracle’s address. According to Chorus One, the operator of the oracle, the incident appears to be an “isolated event” with no further threats to the protocol. The operator continued to say that they have thoroughly audited their entire infrastructure and found no evidence of broader compromise. Blockchain data shows that the attacker drained 1.46 ETH worth about $3,800 from the compromised address. Chorus One says the investigation is ongoing, and a full postmortem will be shared once it is concluded. The exploiter’s activity suggests using an automated system rather than a targeted attack. Lido breach sparks renewed focus on oracle security and DeFi resilience While the breach led to the drain of the oracle address’s ETH balance (which was purposely held at a low level, Chorus One said), the attack did not affect Lido’s operations, as its protocol reporting oracles needs a 5-of-9 consensus. Lido’s head of validators, Izzy, commented that in the worst-case scenario, compromised oracles could cause delays in stETH rebases, whether positive or negative. This would primarily affect stETH holders, but the impact would be negligible, except for those using stETH in leveraged DeFi strategies. The Lido DAO vote to rotate the compromised address currently has unanimous support, though it has not yet reached a quorum. Izzy continued to say that oracles are complex and have different usages across DeFi. He noted that in Lido, they’re an integral part of the protocol, and possible negative impact is meaningfully mitigated through effective decentralization, segregation of duties, and multiple layers of checks. The breach underscores the urgent need for strong cybersecurity protocols in decentralized finance as global monetary, trade, and business systems increasingly transition onchain into complex digital infrastructures with expansive attack surfaces. Crypto industry urged to act as hacks soar to $2B in Q1 losses The crypto industry has suffered a series of thefts, prompting questions about the security of customer funds, with hacking hauls totaling more than $2 billion in 2024 – the fourth straight year where proceeds have topped more than $1 billion. Earlier this year, the crypto exchange Bybit suffered the industry’s largest hack at $1.4 billion, with North Korea’s Lazarus Group pegged as the culprit by cybersecurity firms, which was later confirmed by federal authorities. Hacken also reported that crypto hacks were responsible for $357 million in losses in April 2025, a significant increase from losses incurred in March. Speaking at Token2049, Hacken CEO Dyma Budorin noted that the crypto industry needs to adopt more robust cybersecurity and code auditing measures to stem the tide of hacks and exploits plaguing the asset sector. Cybersecurity threats in crypto have become so pronounced, particularly from hacking groups associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea (DPRK). Leaders from the Group of Seven countries are reportedly looking to discuss how the numerous crypto hacks and malicious cyber activities that North Korea has engaged in for years could be addressed and mitigated.

In a recent social media post , Ju shared why censorship-resistant stablecoins might become necessary as traditional stablecoin issuers face increased scrutiny. According to Ju, while Bitcoin ( BTC ) was designed to be censorship-resistant by the cypherpunk community, stablecoins currently need centralized management to bridge digital and traditional finance.

As per Ju, it has served as a safe haven for various groups including Chinese miners. “Governments, except when tackling money laundering, haven’t really interfered with stablecoins,” noted Ju. Ju predicts that government-issued stablecoins will soon face regulations similar to traditional banking. This could potentially need automatic tax collection through smart contracts and implementing wallet freezes based on government mandates. These changes could drive users who rely on stablecoins for large international transfers to look for alternatives that resist censorship. How? Ju presents two ways: 1. Algorithmic stablecoins that aren’t controlled by governments. 2. Stablecoins issued by countries that don’t censor financial transactions. One technical approach could include decentralized stablecoins that track regulated coins like USD Coin using oracle networks such as Chainlink ( LINK ). However, Ju stated that he hasn’t yet identified projects that have successfully implemented this model. Interestingly, Ju suggested that USDT could turn into a dark stablecoin if the company opts not to comply with U.S. regulations under future administrations. The CryptoQuant CEO noted that dark assets might present investment opportunities in internet capital markets.

According to analysts, XRP is showing early signs of a bullish turnaround and it has also broken above a previous high in Relative Strength Index (RSI). This, according to analyst Josh of Crypto World, could mean the end of the bearish trend. Additionally, if Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins also continue to rise, XRP could make a bigger move. XRP Important Price Targets: XRP is facing resistance around $2.45 to $2.46, an important level within a downward-trending price channel. While there was an attempt to break through this resistance, a confirmed breakout hasn’t happened yet. Until that happens, short-term resistance is expected to hold. On the support side, XRP could find short-term buying interest around $2.31 to $2.33. Below that, additional support lies near $2.17, and even stronger support is expected between $2.05 and $2.10 if prices fall further. XRP Elliott Wave Analysis A key pattern visible on the chart is a triangle that formed after the 2017-2018 peak. This triangle likely ended with a breakout to the upside, starting a fifth wave that has pushed XRP much higher—an aggressive move that aligns with how these patterns typically behave. XRP has formed what looks like a five-wave rally from its April 7 low, potentially completing the first wave of a new uptrend. The price recently hit around $2.46, which matches projections. While a further push toward $2.56 or even $2.68 is possible, there’s no confirmation yet that the wave has topped. If the price falls below $2.26, it could signal the start of a corrective wave (wave 2).",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-12 01:35:47

Posting on Truth Social , the president vowed that the order, due at 9 a.m. in Washington on May 13, would slash prices “almost immediately by 30 per cent to 80 per cent.” He said the policy would create a “most favoured nation” rule so America never pays more than whichever country gets the lowest price for the same medicine. A similar idea stalled during Trump’s first term after fierce pushback from drug makers. This time he said that he is ready to confront them. “Campaign contributions can do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party,” he wrote. “We are going to do the right thing, something that the Democrats have fought for many years.” Industry lobby group PhRMA, which led the earlier resistance, did not respond to comment requests by The Financial Times. The group has long argued that price caps would drain money from research. Trump addressed the claim directly, writing that companies “would say, for years, that it was research and development costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the ‘suckers’ of America, ALONE.” He said the new order means the country will “finally be treated fairly.” Republican leaders who favor a lighter regulatory approach have not yet responded publicly, but several senior lawmakers opposed the earlier proposal when it surfaced in 2020. Shock waves spread through Asian pharma markets Shares in Japanese drugmaker Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. fell as much as 7.2% in early trading on Monday, their steepest slide in a month. Daiichi Sankyo Co. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. each lost about 5%. In South Korea, SK Biopharmaceuticals Co., Celltrion Inc. and Samsung Biologics Co. all dropped more than 3%. Analyst Hidemaru Yamaguchi at Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc. said in a note that, although the legal path is “questionable,” the announcement is negative for the whole sector. Firms that depend on the United States for a big share of revenue—such as Takeda, Astellas Pharma Inc. and Otsuka Holdings Co.—are especially exposed, he added. Shares of Astellas and Otsuka also traded lower. Investors worry that any American move to squeeze prices could prompt tougher talks in other countries and shrink profit margins. The concern surfaces as many drug makers rely on U.S. sales to fund high-cost trials for cancer and next-generation therapies. The White House has not released the full text of the order. Executives and lobbyists are expected to study the language once it is published to see whether it can be challenged in court. For now, both Wall Street and health-care watchers are waiting to see if Monday’s signing sets off a long legal fight—or a quick gain for shoppers at the pharmacy counter, for everyday American families.

XRP Rises & DOGE Aims High,https://thecoinrise.com/unstaked-pulls-in-1m-within-24-hours-xrp-rises-doge-aims-high/,"What’s linking XRP and Dogecoin this month isn’t just price action; it’s renewed energy from headlines and speculation. XRP is building momentum as institutional demand rises, especially after ETF green lights and Ripple’s massive $1.25B purchase. Dogecoin (DOGE) is also drawing attention, with charts signaling a possible move toward $0.18, driven by ETF rumors and political memes. Yet, while these well-known names make noise, a lesser-known contender is starting to build traction under the radar. Unstaked’s $UNSD is currently in presale for $0.00799, and experts are projecting long-term targets above $4, equating to a 27x gain. With over $1 million coming in within just 24 hours, it’s clear that major buyers are paying attention. The AI agents are still in progress and will become active once the presale ends and the project launches. Utility and demand are expected to rise sharply after that, positioning Unstaked as a strong layer 1 crypto to watch. Unstaked: AI-Driven Presale Gem Set to Reach $4 Unstaked has entered stage 8 of its presale, pricing $UNSD at $0.00799. It’s capturing attention across the space, as predictions above $4 put the potential return at 27x. What’s more telling is the speed at which interest is building; more than $1 million was raised in a single day, pushing total crypto presale funding over $3.9 million. This isn’t just another early-stage project, it’s attracting large-scale participation. A standout feature of Unstaked is that there are no private allocations involved. This means that general participants don’t have to worry about insider dumps at listing, giving them a clear advantage. The presale has allocated 60% of the supply, with prices rising stage by stage. The launch price is set at $0.1819, already offering a nearly 28x increase from the current presale rate. The AI agents, still under development, are set to operate on platforms like Telegram and X around the clock. These tools will need $UNSD for activation, upgrades, and management. Once they go live following the token listing, demand is expected to rise rapidly. With supply being limited, a crunch could follow, benefiting early supporters the most. For those seeking a standout layer 1 crypto before it gets listed, Unstaked stands out as a top option. It’s being viewed as one of the strongest upcoming projects in its category, an opportunity to catch early before the broader market reacts. XRP Market Analysis: Price Action and Institutional Growth XRP’s current outlook presents a mix of progress and caution. It’s trading at around $2.20, slightly off April’s high of $2.34, with bearish patterns like a descending triangle forming. Still, major developments are keeping long-term interest alive. Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road suggests a bigger move into institutional territory. The SEC also approved ProShares’ XRP futures ETFs, helping XRP push past $2.16 when the news broke. What lies ahead? CME is preparing to roll out XRP futures later this month, indicating a growing appetite from institutions. Ripple’s executives have ruled out any IPO plans for now, highlighting strong internal finances. From a technical viewpoint, targets range from $2.40 to even $10, depending on support levels and momentum. The base is there for future growth if XRP can hold its current ground. DOGE Price Outlook: ETF Buzz and Chart Movement Dogecoin (DOGE) is gaining strength as it trades near $0.182 and breaks above key barriers. Hype around a possible ETF has reignited interest, with more volume and bullish movement showing up on charts. There’s also renewed chatter about political memes, which often help drive DOGE spikes. Elon Musk has reportedly stepped back from DOGE-related efforts to focus more on Tesla, though attention around the coin hasn’t faded. Projections are currently varied. CoinCodex suggests a possible dip to $0.135, while Benzinga forecasts highs up to $0.731, a potential 326% jump. The overall trend is showing strong support levels, meaning DOGE could see a sharp rise if interest holds. With prices still under $0.20 and the ETF story unfolding, any breakout could surprise latecomers. Final Say! Between XRP’s major acquisition, fresh ETF approvals, and upcoming futures listings, the XRP market analysis remains focused on institutional momentum. At the same time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is back on watch with bullish charts, ETF discussions, and targets as high as $0.73. However, if large returns are what you’re chasing, Unstaked is showing the most promise. At $0.00799 in stage 8 of presale, $UNSD has already attracted more than $1 million in a single day. Analysts are predicting prices above $4, and with tools launching after the listing and utility tied directly to the coin, demand could explode. No private allocations give general buyers a fair advantage. If you missed early entries like MATIC at $0.01, this might be one to watch. It’s rare to find a layer 1 crypto project this early with such potential.

Ethereum (ETH) volume has surged to $14 billion for the first time in over a year, a clear sign that large players could be preparing for significant moves. Meanwhile, Binance Coin price is steadily testing $600, with a decisive break above $625 needed to unlock the next leg higher. Despite these encouraging signs, seasoned traders know that top returns often do not come from coins already in motion. Instead, major profits tend to emerge from early-stage projects, especially presales. That is exactly where Web3 ai ($WAI) stands apart. This platform combines 12 AI-powered tools to scan and analyze market signals before they become obvious. Priced at just $0.000331 in Stage 3 of its presale and targeting a launch price of $0.005242, Web3 ai offers a clear path to a projected 1,584% ROI, reinforcing its position as the best crypto presale to watch in 2025. Ethereum Volume Surge Signals Whale Accumulation Ethereum (ETH) volume has witnessed a remarkable increase, reaching its highest point in more than twelve months. Data reveals that trading volume has now crossed $14 billion, largely driven by heightened market activity and substantial transactions. Experts believe this volume spike may reflect growing interest from major players who are preparing for possible price moves. The rebound in Ethereum (ETH) volume is notable, especially after a long period of flat trading earlier this year. Although ETH prices have yet to surge, this volume growth suggests momentum could be building quietly. If the current trend holds, Ethereum’s position in the crypto spotlight may soon become even more prominent. Binance Coin Price Struggles to Clear $625 Resistance Binance Coin (BNB) has started to show signs of recovery following its recent dip. The current Binance Coin price hovers around $598.90, fluctuating between key support at $570 and resistance at $625. This range remains vital for short-term price action. Analysts indicate that if Binance Coin holds above $570, it could target resistance levels near $615 and eventually $630. However, a decisive breakout above $625 is needed to confirm a bullish trend. Over the last 24 hours, Binance Coin price has remained steady, gaining about 1.65% in the past week. While the outlook is cautiously optimistic, traders are closely monitoring whether BNB can push through the upper levels and sustain upward momentum. Web3 ai: The Smart Solution to Finding Best Crypto Presale Opportunities While Ethereum and Binance Coin are catching attention, real opportunities often come from presales. These early-stage projects offer far higher upside potential but are also difficult to evaluate due to market noise and frequent overhype. Web3 ai addresses this challenge with precision. By using 12 AI-driven tools, Web3 ai simplifies the process of identifying quality presales. It assesses tokenomics, on-chain data, team backgrounds, smart contract security, and overall market sentiment. Machine learning and natural language processing enhance its ability to spot risks and opportunities early, ensuring users are ahead of major trends. Additionally, Web3 ai’s Scam Detector and Risk Manager strengthen its appeal, alerting users to potentially dangerous projects before trouble arises. The platform’s seamless access across mobile, browser, and desktop makes it even easier for users to manage crypto activity without switching between multiple apps. While Web3 ai was designed to analyze other presales, its own presale has captured the spotlight. The $WAI token is currently available at $0.000331, with a launch target of $0.005242. This implies a remarkable 1,584% ROI for early participants, positioning Web3 ai as the best crypto presale to enter in 2025. Final Observations Ethereum (ETH) volume reaching $14 billion suggests major market players are preparing for future moves, while Binance Coin price eyes a breakout beyond $625. Both assets reflect growing optimism but may offer limited upside compared to presale opportunities. That is why Web3 ai stands out right now.

While most of the top cryptocurrencies stayed quiet or posted decent gains of around 2-3% over the weekend, Pi Coin defied the trend and made an impressive move up to the 16th spot on the crypto rankings. This sudden jump comes just a little over a month after Pi Coin hit an all-time low of $0.40, weighed down by market uncertainty and token unlock events. Since then, the coin has bounced back strongly. What’s Next For Pi Coin Price? Looking at the monthly chart, the price has recovered well from its previous dip around $0.40, which was the lowest point since its earlier all-time high above $3. The formation of a bullish hammer candlestick pattern on the chart now hints that the long-running downtrend might be coming to an end. With Pi’s price returning to its monthly trading range, analysts are setting their sights on higher targets. The next possible price levels being discussed are around $2.30, $2.40, and potentially even $3, depending on how much momentum the market can build in the coming weeks. In the short-term, Pi Coin is trying to break above the $1.50 level. Big Announcement on May 14? Adding to the excitement is the upcoming Consensus Summit, set to begin on May 14. The Pi Network community is eagerly waiting for some major updates, especially with Pi Network co-founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis scheduled to speak at the event. Rumors are swirling about announcements, including the launch of new decentralized apps (DApps), the long-awaited listing of Pi on major crypto exchanges like BitMart, HTX, or maybe even Binance, and a full roadmap for the official launch of Pi’s mainnet. With excitement building and prices on the rise, all eyes are now on Pi Network to see what surprises it might reveal next.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-12 02:28:17

Stablecoins have been used for various groups to store assets due to a lack of government interference; however, with regulations pending, that could soon change, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, said in a May 11 X post. “Soon, any stablecoin issued by a country could face strict govt regulation, similar to traditional banks. Transfers might automatically trigger tax collection through smart contracts, and wallets could be frozen or require paperwork based on government rules,” he said. “People who used stablecoins for big international transfers might start looking for censorship-resistant dark stablecoins instead.” On the heels of US President Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration assuming power earlier this year, lawmakers are weighing stablecoin legislation, which seeks to regulate US stablecoins, ensuring their legal use for payments. The European Union has already brought in its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which, among other measures, mandates that stablecoins be regulated and transparent. Source: Ki Young Ju Ju speculates that a dark or private stablecoin could be created as an algorithmic stablecoin , with the value maintained through algorithmic mechanisms rather than being pegged to an external asset like gold, which makes it susceptible to interference from authorities. “One possible example could be a decentralized stablecoin that follows the price of regulated coins like USDC using data oracles like Chainlink,” he said. Another way would be stablecoins issued by countries that don’t censor financial transactions, or, for example, if Tether chooses not to comply with US government regulations in the future. “USDT itself used to be considered a censorship-resistant stablecoin. If Tether chooses not to comply with US government regulations under a future Trump administration, it could become a dark stablecoin in an increasingly censored internet economy,” Ju said. Privacy technology in crypto is already being used Zcash ( ZEC ) and Monero ( XMR ) — while they aren’t stablecoins —already shield transactions and allow users to send and receive funds without revealing their transaction data on the blockchain.

PARScoin also hides user identities, transaction values, and links to past transactions. The market cap of US dollar-denominated stablecoins has continued to grow, crossing $230 billion in April, a report from investment banking giant Citigroup found. That’s an increase of 54% since last year, with Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) dominating 90% of the market. Meanwhile, total stablecoin volumes hit $27.6 trillion in 2024, surpassing the combined volumes of Visa and Mastercard by 7.7%.
