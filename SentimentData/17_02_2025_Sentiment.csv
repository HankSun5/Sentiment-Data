40423382,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675961,1739741459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40423382.jpeg,Solana records fifth straight week of DEX volume decline,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-fifth-week-dex-volume-decline/,"Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Solana recorded approximately $20.2 billion in the week that ended February 16. The numbers extend a streak of declining weekly trading volume for the fifth straight week, based on DeFiLlama data. The data analysis site also revealed that in the week ending February 10, 2025, Solana’s on-chain transaction volumes fell by 28%, totaling $31.8 billion. The slide in Solana DEX activity has been linked to a broader market trend. Similar volume reductions have been observed across other blockchains like BNB Chain, Ethereum, Sui, and Polygon. Solana’s declining numbers According to DeFiLlama , the weekly trading volume has fallen by 24.35%, totaling $28.893 billion over the past week. Meteora reported the most activity as the top DEX with a volume of $875.8 million, followed by Raydium at $836.37 million and Orca at $322.32 million. The cumulative trading volume for the top DEXs reached $155.172 billion over the entire period. Meteora had a weekly Total Value Locked (TVL) of $8.024 billion with a volume/TVL ratio of 0.84, which indicates strong liquidity. Raydium had a higher weekly TVL but a lower volume/TVL ratio of 0.5. While Solana DEXs have witnessed a volume decline, those on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have picked up, and the chain currently has the highest trading volume among decentralized exchanges. This is a stark difference from March 2024 stats when BSC DEXs trailed in third place by trading volume at $47.81 billion, behind Solana and Ethereum, while the fourth spot went to Arbitrum’s $27.74 billion. The increase in BSC’s trading volume indicates a significant increase in activity and coincides with the return of memes to the ecosystem, which is ironic because many believe one reason Solana DEXs are declining in volume is because of meme fatigue. Solana currently has the moniker of the “home of memes.” However, this cycle has seen many bad actors and selfish players extract millions from the ecosystem thanks to Pump.fun’s effectiveness in proliferating memes, even without any technical knowledge. Factors implicated in the Solana DEX decline The decline in Solana’s DEX volume can be partially attributed to the gradual cooling in the memecoin trading craze that has gripped Solana since the bull run started. Many memes have come and gone, and users seem to have been exhausted by the continuous pump-and-dump schemes, rugpulls, and insider trading. The sentiment of traders could also be because they are just about ready for something different. Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), came forward with a meme that drove trading traffic back to BSC and has seemingly now jump-started meme season on the chain. The Solana chain remains a top competitor in the DEX market. The value of the SOL token has significantly declined by over 50% in the past year, but many analysts still remain optimistic about the network’s long-term potential. A good example of those who still believe in Solana’s supremacy is Mert Mumtaz , the Helius Labs CEO. Following the latest Libra memecoin debacle led by Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, Mert went off on trolls calling the Solana chain a scam chain because of the number of memecoin scams that occur on it. In a series of tweets, Mert talked about the toxic sentiments surrounding the chain, pointing out that the network itself has no control over what it is used for. As far as Mert is concerned, the tech works, which is why memes have been so successful on the chain, and nothing else matters.

In contrast, PEPE and TRUMP tokens are experiencing sharp declines, losing double-digit percentages. Meanwhile, a new contender called XYZ is making waves by surpassing $7 million during its presale phase. What’s driving these contrasting fortunes in the cryptocurrency market? XYZ’s Rise to Glory: The Meme Coin Fighter Punching Through the Crypto Arena XYZVerse is the next heavyweight champion of meme coins. Crowned Best NEW Meme Project , it blends the electric energy of sports with meme culture, drawing in millions of fans who want to be part of something bigger. Every great story needs a hero. Not the biggest, not the strongest—just the one crazy enough to keep pushing forward. That’s XYZepe , the masked fighter, the die-hard believer, and the relentless holder of $XYZ . His mission is to bring XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap and carve XYZ into crypto history. In response, the CMC community is totally behind this future champ: 95% are super bullish on $XYZ. But greatness isn’t handed out—it’s earned in the ring. $XYZ has already passed through 9 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a mindblowing take off. Undervalued at $0.002, $XYZ is a bet worth making. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the start of something legendary. XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? Dogecoin: From Meme to Mainstream – Is the Doge Still Barking? Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun take on cryptocurrencies. It used the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there is no cap on how many can exist. Initially seen as a joke, Dogecoin’s value soared in 2021. It climbed into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with its total value surpassing $50 billion. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, helped fuel this rise. The coin’s creators, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, meant it as a light-hearted project. But it quickly showed the power of community and social media in financial markets. As for its potential, Dogecoin relies on its strong online community. Its technology is similar to other cryptocurrencies, but it doesn’t offer unique features like smart contracts. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as a risky but exciting asset. Other coins, like Ethereum, have more established uses and technologies. Market trends show that social media can greatly impact Dogecoin’s price. So, whether it’s attractive depends on one’s appetite for risk and belief in the community driving it. PEPE Coin Soars: How a Frog Meme Became a Billion-Dollar Cryptocurrency PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum, inspired by the popular Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Aiming to join the ranks of meme-based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE embraces its meme origins without pretense. With no taxes and no promises of utility, it keeps things simple and appeals to the fun-loving side of the crypto community. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap reaching a staggering $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive returns, and a strong community of enthusiasts rallied behind it. This frenzy sparked what some call a “memecoin season,” with new meme-based tokens popping up and experiencing wild price swings. As the crypto world anticipates the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, many are watching to see if PEPE will reach new heights. Its roadmap includes ambitious goals like listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover,” suggesting that PEPE isn’t just a fleeting fad. In the unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, PEPE stands out as a symbol of the power of internet culture and community-driven success. Trump Coin ($TRUMP) Surges to $15 Billion Market Cap Before Pullback Trump Coin ($TRUMP), a newly launched meme coin backed by President-elect Donald Trump, quickly surged in value, reaching a peak market capitalization of $15 billion early Sunday before settling around $9 billion. The token, built on the Solana blockchain, saw an explosive 300% gain within hours of its release, briefly trading above $75 per coin. Despite its rapid rise and subsequent pullback, $TRUMP remains a significant player in the meme coin space, leveraging Trump’s branding power ahead of his inauguration. With an initial 200 million coin supply, developers plan to gradually expand circulation to 1 billion tokens over three years. However, 80% of the total supply remains locked, controlled by CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, two Trump-affiliated entities set to earn revenue from trading activity. While the coin’s website states that $TRUMP is not an investment or political asset, its association with Trump has fueled speculation and investor interest, positioning it as a unique crossover between crypto, branding, and political influence. Conclusion While DOGE, PEPE, and TRUMP show positive signs, XYZ stands out as an all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and targeting notable growth with its community-driven platform.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen some interesting price movements recently. Over the past week, its price rose by 4.50%. However, in the last month, it dropped by 22.19%. Looking back six months, SHIB’s price is up by 24.65%. Currently, SHIB trades between $0.0000125 and $0.0000178. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0000200. If it breaks this level, the next target could be $0.0000254, which is about a 42% increase from current prices. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.00000939. If the price falls below this, it may find support around $0.000004040. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.0000166, slightly above the 100-day average of $0.0000160. This suggests a short-term upward trend. The relative strength index is at 50.70, indicating a neutral market. The stochastic oscillator is low at 8.81, which may mean SHIB is oversold. This could lead to a price increase soon. The MACD level is positive at 0.0000001193, hinting at possible bullish momentum. Conclusion With SHIB’s bullish momentum evident, XYZ emerges as the pioneering sports memecoin aiming for massive growth and community-driven success in the current bull run.

His endorsement caused a brief surge in the token’s value before it crashed, leading to accusations of fraud. Critics claim this was a pump-and-dump scheme , and some are calling for his impeachment. The government has formed a task force to determine if Milei or others committed illegal acts. On February 14, Milei promoted LIBRA on X, suggesting it could boost Argentina’s economy and support small businesses. This caused the token’s market cap to jump beyond $4 billion , with insiders cashing out over $100 million in profits. However, the surge was short-lived. LIBRA lacked a structured financial model, its website was set up only hours before launch, and over $87 million was withdrawn within the first three hours. The token’s value collapsed soon after, showing clear signs of a pump-and-dump. According to The Kobeissi Letter, large holders quickly liquidated their assets, some making $4 million or more as the market cap peaked at $4.6 billion. At 5:40 PM ET, when the price hit its highest point, LIBRA’s value plummeted. In response to public backlash, Milei deleted his promotional post and claimed he had not fully understood the project. Later, he explained that after learning more, he decided to stop promoting it. Argentina’s presidential office tried to downplay the issue, calling it a standard blockchain-related promotion. However, officials admitted that Milei had met with Hayden Mark Davis, a figure connected to LIBRA’s infrastructure through KIP Protocol. The government has now launched an official probe to examine whether any officials, including Milei, acted improperly. Investigators will also scrutinize KIP Protocol for possible legal violations. To contain the damage, Milei ordered the creation of a special Investigation Task Unit (UTI), consisting of financial, crypto, and anti-money laundering specialists. This unit will analyze LIBRA’s launch and those involved. The government stated that all findings will be turned over to the courts to determine if any crimes were committed. Beyond cryptocurrency, the controversy has triggered a political crisis. Critics argue that Milei’s reckless endorsement of a speculative asset led to financial losses for investors. Argentine lawmaker Gabriela Estevez accused him of engaging in a classic pump-and-dump scheme, where token creators buy at a low price, hype it up, and sell at a peak, leaving others with losses. The scandal has even led to impeachment threats. A political faction has officially started proceedings, calling the incident unprecedented in Argentina’s history. Buenos Aires Governor Axel Kicillof called it a large-scale financial fraud, warning that both local and international investors had been misled. He compared the situation to a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme. This case highlights the dangers of political figures endorsing meme coins, a trend that has grown since former U.S. President Donald Trump launched his own token. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin had already warned that such political meme coins could damage the crypto market’s credibility. Since Trump’s involvement, scammers have launched fake tokens based on political figures, with LIBRA being the latest example of these risks.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-16 21:46:29

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. ChowWow is gaining traction, with analysts predicting a massive surge and the potential to be Solana’s next top meme coin. Table of Contents Solana: Strong on-chain metrics ChowWow: Surging presale and secure transactions Conclusion The crypto market shows growing interest in ChowWow (CHOW) as it builds momentum this first quarter. Analysts project a significant increase in the coin’s value that could mirror Solana’s (SOL) fast market growth. As excitement builds, the main question is whether CHOW could become the top Solana meme coin. ChowWow continues to achieve increasing prominence in both the crypto space and social media platforms thanks to its strong presale performance. The platform provides a virtual gaming environment alongside special rewards and distinctive collectibles. With the DeFi coin price at $0.008, alongside massive forecasted growth, CHOW could emerge as the next big crypto following SOL. Solana: Strong on-chain metrics Solana maintained stable values above the crucial threshold in January 2025 while the market showed stability as investors displayed positive attitudes and new technological developments emerged. Investor confidence rose further as the price returned from losses experienced in November 2024. Total Value Locked experienced a 48% increase during the last 30 days. Solana achieved a major accomplishment in the previous month by reaching the benchmark where its decentralized exchange (DEX) processed $3.8 billion in 24-hour trading volume. The DeFi sector continues to recognize the growing dominance of Solana based on its strong on-chain metrics.

With its presale structured in ten stages and currently in the early phase, both top and new investors can join. Notably, the presale requires minimum purchases of $25. The cryptocurrency’s presale is selling out fast, with analysts predicting a price rise to $0.0288 upon launch. The anticipated 260% price increase could deliver massive returns on investments. Due to its implementation of Proof of History and Proof of Stake mechanisms, ChowWow could shine by providing quick and secure transactions at affordable rates. The platform is also undergoing regular third-party audits that build up both its credibility and security. ChowWow’s stake-to-earn model acts as a key growth driver by providing an additional revenue source. Users can receive monthly rewards by staking their CHOW tokens, with APYs between 8% and 15%. The project’s play-to-earn game further attracts investors by providing rewards through gameplay activities. Token holders within the game have exclusive access to in-app purchases even though the game operates as an open and free platform available to all players. Conclusion As analysts predict a massive surge for ChowWow and its potential to become the top Solana meme coin, smart investors are joining its presale. With the DeFi coin price at $0.008 alongside features like stake-to-earn and play-to-earn models, CHOW is emerging as a dominant force in the meme coin space.

40424536,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675958,1739742604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40424536.jpeg,France demands an emergency global meeting over Trump’s economic and geopolitical actions,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/france-demands-an-emergency-global-meeting-over-trumps-economic-and-geopolitical-actions/,"French President Emmanuel Macron has summoned European leaders for an emergency meeting in Paris to discuss the escalating global tensions caused by Donald Trump’s latest economic and geopolitical decisions. The meeting is scheduled for Monday, according to a report from Fox. Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski first hinted at the gathering while speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. He said the leaders would address Trump’s actions “in a very serious fashion” and described the U.S. president’s strategy as a form of military-style testing. “President Trump operates using what the Russians call ‘razvedka boyem’—reconnaissance through battle. He pushes forward, watches what happens, then adjusts. And we need to respond,” Sikorski told attendees. Europe scrambles to react as Trump threatens new tariffs Trump has announced sweeping tariffs, including a 25% duty on U.S. steel and aluminum imports, set to take effect on March 12. He has also instructed his administration to prepare additional automobile tariffs, expected to be revealed in April. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking in an interview with Bloomberg, said the European Union is preparing to counteract any economic harm but remains open to negotiations. “We are strong enough to respond to anything that damages the European economy,” Scholz said on Saturday. “But we should always leave room for an agreement, because it benefits everyone, especially on both sides of the Atlantic.” The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, is already reviewing countermeasures. If Trump moves ahead with the tariffs, Brussels is ready to hit back with retaliatory duties on U.S. goods. Officials have reportedly reactivated lists of American products that were targeted during Trump’s first term. “The EU will respond firmly and immediately against unjustified trade barriers, including tariffs designed to attack legal and non-discriminatory policies,” the European Commission said in a statement on Friday. The tariffs aren’t just about trade. Trump’s economic aggression is unfolding at a time when Germany’s economy is under immense pressure. The country is grappling with high energy costs, a slowdown in exports, and rising support for the far-right AfD party, which advocates for leaving the eurozone and scrapping environmental policies. Trump had said on Truth Social that: “I have decided, for purposes of Fairness, that I will charge a RECIPROCAL Tariff meaning, whatever Countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them – No more, no less! For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff. Sending merchandise, product, or anything by any other name through another Country, for purposes of unfairly harming America, will not be accepted.” He also warned that foreign government subsidies designed to undercut American businesses will be dealt with, along with hidden trade barriers that block U.S. products or shut out American companies. “We know exactly how much these sneaky trade barriers cost us,” Trump said, making it clear that the U.S. will fight back against unfair economic tactics. His message to the world? Either lower your tariffs against the U.S., or deal with the consequences. He reminded everyone that countries have been leeching off America for decades, whether they were allies or adversaries. That’s over. “If you manufacture in the U.S., you don’t have to worry about tariffs. Simple as that.” Trump ended by saying he’s already given the green light to his top officials—State, Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR—to make sure America gets exactly what it deserves. “We’re bringing real fairness back to trade. No more one-sided deals. It’s about time these countries remember everything America has done for them.” Macron walks a tightrope with Trump amid economic tensions Macron has maintained cordial relations with Trump since the November election, despite the looming trade war. After Trump’s victory, Macron posted a message on X (formerly Twitter), writing: “Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump. Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.” The relationship appeared warm in December when Trump visited Paris for the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening. Macron personally welcomed him, saying: “It’s a great honor for French people to welcome you five years later. You were president at that time, and I remember your solidarity and immediate action. So, welcome back. We are happy to have you here.” Behind closed doors, however, European officials are growing uneasy about Trump’s economic unpredictability. The Paris meeting signals that Macron and other EU leaders are preparing for a serious confrontation with Washington. Trump’s strategy is clear—he believes in economic retaliation. On Thursday, he instructed his team to develop new tariffs targeting countries he deems unfair trading partners. The move, described by Politico as his most aggressive trade action yet, has sent shockwaves across Europe’s political and economic circles. EU disses Trump for being reckless The European Union, which prides itself on having some of the world’s lowest tariffs, is furious. In a direct rebuke, the European Commission slammed Trump’s “reciprocal tariff” policy, calling it economically reckless and warning that it will increase business costs, hurt American consumers, and drive inflation higher. Brussels is not backing down, said Sikorski, who added that officials are now reassessing past retaliatory measures, which were previously imposed on Trump’s administration during his first term. Sikorski said if necessary, the EU would act immediately. The tariffs, if implemented, could worsen Germany’s financial woes and further destabilize Scholz’s already fragile political standing ahead of the February 23 election. Brussels’ retaliation strategy will be multi-layered. According to a Bloomberg report, EU officials have also confirmed that past tariff models from Trump’s first term have been updated and prepared for immediate deployment. The scope of countermeasures could range from targeted tariffs on U.S. goods to diplomatic pressure on key American industries. The White House has yet to respond to Macron’s emergency summit, but sources inside Washington indicate that Trump has no intention of backing down. His administration is moving full speed ahead, with officials drafting tariff policies that will be announced in the coming weeks. Sikorski, speaking on behalf of several EU leaders, said Europe’s message to Trump is this: “We act together, and we will stick together. The European economy is strong enough to take action, and that’s exactly what we will do.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",Economy|France|United States,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-16 21:50:04

One of the latest figures to make a surprising prediction is Davinci Jeremie , a long-time Bitcoin proponent who has previously dismissed the token. In a recent social media statement, Jeremie projected that XRP could rise to $20 to $24 during this market cycle. Given the token’s current value of approximately $2.78, this forecast implies a 763% increase. The prediction has generated mixed reactions, with some community members viewing it as an unexpected turnaround and others remaining wary of his new stance. Former XRP Critics Now Reevaluate Jeremie has been vocal about his skepticism toward XRP for years, frequently criticizing its fundamentals and suggesting that the asset could become worthless. However, as the token’s price and adoption gain momentum, many former skeptics, including Jeremie, have started reconsidering their views. Other critics who recently voiced a more positive outlook on XRP include Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, and trader Peter Brandt . Brandt, for instance, has suggested that the token’s market capitalization could reach $500 billion, translating to a price of $8 per token. This shift in sentiment from influential figures has caught the attention of XRP community members, with many questioning the motivations behind these revised perspectives. Community Response: A Shift or an Attempt to Save Face? Jeremie’s updated stance has sparked debate among XRP supporters that critics are now adjusting their narratives to avoid being proven wrong. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Tony Edward, the founder of the Thinking Crypto podcast, responded sarcastically to Jeremie’s remarks, describing the shift as an “XRP hater capitulation.” He pointed out that several high-profile individuals who previously dismissed the token, including billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, are now attempting to reposition themselves. According to Edward, these critics are trying to downplay their earlier comments to avoid losing credibility within the crypto space. Jeremie Maintains Skepticism Despite Price Prediction While Jeremie acknowledges the potential for significant short-term gains, he remains unconvinced about XRP’s long-term viability. He has reiterated his belief that the asset is too closely aligned with the traditional banking system, making it an unsuitable investment for those seeking long-term returns. Jeremie argues that XRP’s association with financial institutions introduces an element of unpredictability, similar to centralized banking entities like the Federal Reserve. This view has led him to caution against holding the token as a long-term asset. His disclaimer has drawn further criticism from the community, with some dismissing it as an attempt to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Despite the backlash, his prediction has added fuel to the ongoing debate about the token’s future trajectory and the changing perspectives of its most vocal critics.

40424406,https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-falls-solana-struggles-while-blockdags-5-usdt-cashback-drives-massive-demand-presale-hits-195-5m/,1739743229,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/40424406.jpeg,"Cardano Falls, Solana Struggles While BlockDAG’s 5% USDT Cashback Drives Massive Demand– Presale Hits $195.5M!",https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-falls-solana-struggles-while-blockdags-5-usdt-cashback-drives-massive-demand-presale-hits-195-5m/,"As market liquidity tightens and key players influence pricing, alternative cryptocurrencies such as Solana and Cardano face challenges in gaining ground, illustrating the wider market’s unpredictability. Solana’s price analysis places SOL between crucial price points, with $190 as support and $199 as potential resistance. A surge past these markers could catalyze gains, yet any pause might cause a decline. The Cardano crash paints a stark contrast, with ADA’s value dropping below $0.71 following a sharp sell-off that triggered $240 million in market liquidations. While SOL and ADA prices fluctuate, BlockDAG (BDAG) progresses in a contrasting trajectory—strengthening with each presale phase. A staggering $195.5 million has been amassed, and its 5% USDT referral scheme is currently the talk of the market. As this initiative broadens BlockDAG’s global base, BDAG ascends the ranks among top crypto picks. Solana Price Analysis: Is $199 the Turning Point? Recent assessments of Solana’s price suggest a pivotal range, with $190 providing substantial support and $199 acting as a critical resistance level. Advancing beyond $199 could shift the momentum towards a positive breakout, but hesitation could lead to a further decrease. Present indicators deliver mixed signals. The RSI is near 43.77, suggesting slight bearish pressure, whereas the OBV at 69.05 million shows consistent interest. Moreover, a rise in network activity, evidenced by daily additions of millions of new addresses, fosters optimism for Solana’s future despite ongoing price instability. However, failure to overcome the $199 mark could drive prices back down toward the support level, placing traders at a crucial juncture. Cardano Crash: A Brief Setback or Extended Decline? The recent plunge in Cardano’s value has alarmed investors, with ADA falling below $0.71 as market liquidations exceeded $240 million. This downturn coincided with a decrease in decentralized exchange (DEX) activity, dropping from $31.3 million in transactions in December to merely $7 million by February, reflecting a decline in investor engagement. Additionally, Cardano’s total value locked (TVL) has halved, plummeting from $701.4 million to $355.7 million, and significant sell-offs by whales have exacerbated the decline. With Bitcoin and Ethereum also experiencing downturns, pressure mounts on ADA. Traders now question whether Cardano will stabilize or continue to suffer. The coming days will be pivotal. BlockDAG’s 5% USDT: Why Traders Find It Appealing Unlike typical crypto offers that require waiting for gains, BlockDAG’s referral program immediately rewards. This limited-time opportunity provides a unique 5% USDT cashback instantly upon a BDAG purchase, making it a standout offer. What sets this program apart? It benefits both the referrer and the purchaser with 5% USDT back, enticing traders globally to buy BDAG at its current rate before another likely price increase while accumulating extra USDT. Furthermore, another factor contributes to BDAG’s prominence among top crypto picks—not just the cashback. BlockDAG has become a viral phenomenon, raising over $195.5 million, selling 18.4 billion BDAG, and delivering a 2380% ROI to early buyers. This presale, nearing $200 million, is not just substantial—it’s record-setting in the crypto realm. Yet, here’s the highlight. BDAG’s current price is only $0.0248. Despite its popularity in a competitive market, BDAG remains affordable—but not for long. Each new batch raises the price, and analysts project BDAG could reach $1 this year, positioning it as a top choice for traders currently. Moreover, the referrals do more than attract new buyers—they propel BDAG’s momentum. As demand for BDAG increases, supply tightens, and with a robust and expanding community of 170,000 supporters behind it, BDAG’s future looks increasingly promising. 2025’s Top Crypto Picks– Final Call! Solana’s price analysis indicates the coin is testing resistance at $199, while the Cardano crash has erased $240 million. As one coin tests crucial levels and another faces significant losses, traders anticipate their next moves. However, some are not just waiting—BlockDAG’s presale is redefining strategies, attracting traders worldwide. With BlockDAG’s crypto presale soaring past $195.5 million, it’s evident that demand continues robustly. Its 5% USDT referral program is driving quick expansion, with the community eagerly accumulating BDAG before the anticipated price rise. Despite shifts in the crypto market and evolving trends, BlockDAG maintains its course. The next increase is imminent. Those hesitating may miss the most significant crypto opportunity yet.

Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is turning heads in the crypto world, and its unique presale model is making waves. Meanwhile, TST and Apu Apustaja are also making headlines with recent developments. Arctic Pablo Coin is already in its 10th presale phase, Aqua Frost, having raised over $1.3 million in under a month. Its deflationary structure and high staking rewards make it one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins—Arctic Pablo Coin, TST, and Apu Apustaja. Scarcity Meets Value: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Token Burn Strategy One of Arctic Pablo Coin’s standout features is its powerful token burn mechanism.

Once the presale ends, any remaining tokens will also be burned, reinforcing a deflationary model designed to benefit early investors.

Here’s How,https://timestabloid.com/cardano-ada-holders-can-now-transfer-ada-to-solana-heres-how/,"A new cross-chain solution has enabled Cardano users to move ADA to the Solana blockchain. Wanchain , a blockchain interoperability company recently launched the bridge that facilitates this transfer. New Cross-Chain Bridge for ADA Transfers On February 13, Wanchain announced the launch of a new interoperability route, allowing ADA holders to transfer their tokens from the Cardano network to Solana. This feature is limited to one-way transfers, meaning ADA can move to Solana, but users cannot yet bridge assets in the opposite direction. The company’s official statement described this as a significant step toward increased connectivity between the two ecosystems, emphasizing the removal of previous barriers that separated them. Bridging Process and Transaction Fees To transfer ADA assets to Solana, ADA holders need to use Wanchain’s bridging platform The process requires connecting a Cardano wallet, selecting Cardano as the source blockchain and ADA as the asset, and then designating Solana as the destination network. At the time of writing, the transaction fee for using the bridge is 2.29 ADA, equivalent to approximately $1.85. Addressing Cardano-Solana Rivalry Before unveiling the feature, Wanchain acknowledged the long-standing rivalry between the Cardano and Solana communities. In a social media post on February 11, the company humorously referenced the differences in perception between the two groups, pointing out that some Solana users dismiss Cardano due to its perceived lack of adoption, while certain Cardano supporters criticize Solana for being heavily focused on meme coins. Despite these differences, Wanchain positioned the bridge as an opportunity to foster greater interoperability, allowing users to benefit from the unique features of both networks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Future Developments: SOL to ADA Transfers Although the current integration only supports ADA-to-Solana transfers, Wanchain has confirmed that a Solana-to-Cardano bridge is in progress. However, no official release date has been provided. Additionally, the company has hinted at the launch of a new product update on February 19, describing it as a significant enhancement to one of its existing solutions. More details on this development are expected in the coming days. The bridge enables seamless interaction between Cardano and Solana, allowing users to leverage Solana’s ecosystem for enhanced cross-chain transactions and DeFi capabilities. The growth of interoperability solutions like Wanchain’s bridge could play a crucial role in connecting different blockchain networks and reducing fragmentation in the industry. As adoption grows, it will be exciting to see how ADA and SOL benefit from increased accessibility and collaboration.

On Sunday, People’s Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng told global leaders at the AlUla Conference for Emerging Market Economies in Saudi Arabia that while other currencies are crumbling against the rising U.S. dollar, the yuan has stayed steady. “Recently, a number of factors have pushed up (the) dollar index, and non-dollar currencies have mostly depreciated. But RMB (yuan) has remained largely stable despite the high market volatility,” Pan said at the event, which was organized by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Saudi Arabia’s Finance Ministry. China pushes domestic spending over investment Pan said China is moving away from relying on massive infrastructure projects to drive growth and instead focusing on domestic consumption. The government is raising household incomes, offering subsidies, and rolling out pro-consumption policies to keep the economy moving. China has made 2025 the year of consumption growth. The goal is simple: get people to spend more money instead of relying on exports and investment-heavy growth. Pan said China’s price growth and consumer demand could be stronger, but he’s confident that the economy is on solid ground, with risks from local government debt and the real estate sector shrinking. Monetary policy is also changing a bit. Pan said that China will use proactive fiscal policies and accommodative monetary measures, with an emphasis on counter-cyclical adjustments to keep financial markets stable. China is facing headwinds, though. “Rising trade protectionism, geopolitical tensions, and the fragmentation of the global economy” are challenges Beijing cannot ignore, Pan said. Still, he stressed that China is committed to keeping its markets open and pushing forward with economic reforms. Asian central banks take on the dollar with currency forwards China isn’t the only country fighting back against the dollar’s strength. Across Asia, central banks are turning to derivatives to defend their currencies, using a strategy that raises concerns about how long they can sustain these interventions. India’s central bank has ramped up its use of currency forwards, pushing its net dollar short forward position to a record $68 billion in December. Indonesia has also piled on risk, with its short forward book hitting $19.6 billion, the highest level since at least 2015. On January 20, when Trump officially returned to office, a White House fact sheet outlined his plan to crack down on currency manipulation. The very next day, U.S. Treasury has labeled countries as currency manipulators before, and Trump previously put China in that category. Malaysia is also in the game, with its forward book reaching $27.5 billion by November, after swelling by $4 billion in 2024. The Philippines, on the other hand, has taken a more cautious approach, cutting its net long forward position down to just $874 million, according to IMF data. Asian central banks are also up against U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade strategies, which are mostly just tariffs and threats of tariffs. Last week, Trump made it clear that he doesn’t like foreign governments intervening in currency markets when he said via a post on Truth Social that: “I have decided, for purposes of Fairness, that I will charge a RECIPROCAL Tariff meaning, whatever Countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them – No more, no less! For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff.” Currency forwards give central banks an edge. Unlike direct interventions, these derivatives don’t drain foreign exchange reserves and don’t attract as much attention from Washington. That makes them an attractive tool for countries trying to stabilize their currencies without landing on Trump’s radar. The dollar has recently taken a hit, giving central banks some breathing room. Trump has delayed or canceled tariffs on Canada, Colombia, and Mexico, raising doubts about whether he will follow through on his biggest trade threats. A broad dollar index has slipped 1.8% this year, showing signs of softening. India’s Reserve Bank (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra is also making changes. The RBI has scaled back its non-deliverable forward market bets, opting instead to conduct onshore interventions to improve domestic liquidity. While this is great, JPMorgan analysts believe currency forwards will remain a go-to tool for central banks for the foreseeable future, according to a note they sent their clients on Friday.

BTFD Coin ($BTFD) , Dogecoin , and Shiba Inu are three of the top meme coins to invest in now, each bringing something unique to the table. BTFD Coin is making waves with its presale success, while Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to defy bearish pressures, proving their staying power in the meme coin space. But why are these coins gaining so much attention, and which one should you invest in? Let’s dive in and find out. The Rise of Meme Coins Meme coins have surged in popularity over the past few years, with coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu becoming household names. These projects are powered by vibrant, engaged communities and viral potential. BTFD Coin has emerged as the latest contender, entering the meme coin market with a bang. Its innovative approach, which includes a Play2Earn game, staking rewards , and a referral program , has captured the attention of investors. What sets BTFD Coin apart is its focus on community engagement and utility, offering more than just the speculative nature typical of meme coins. Despite recent bearish pressures affecting the broader crypto market, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to hold strong, with Dogecoin showing resilience thanks to its strong backing and adoption as a payment method by major companies. Shiba Inu has similarly grown its ecosystem, including the launch of the Shiba Inu metaverse. These coins have proven their ability to stay relevant in a market that often sees wild price swings, and their continued success is a testament to their community-driven power. Now, with BTFD Coin entering its final run of presale, it’s a prime time to consider these top meme coins to invest in now. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin Revolution in the Making When it comes to BTFD Coin , this is not just another meme coin trying to capture the internet’s attention. With a presale that has already raised over $6 million, BTFD Coin has proven its potential. Investors are flocking to the presale as BTFD Coin enters its final stages, and analysts are predicting that this coin will experience massive gains once it lists on major exchanges. A big part of what makes BTFD Coin stand out is its Play2Earn game , which went live on January 1, 2025. This game allows players to earn rewards in BTFD tokens, providing real utility for the coin and ensuring that its value is tied to something tangible. Additionally, BTFD Coin offers staking rewards with an impressive 90% APY , which incentivizes long-term holding and creates a sense of stability for investors. The referral program further strengthens its community-driven approach, encouraging users to bring others into the fold while earning rewards for doing so. The Bulls Squad —a dedicated group of BTFD Coin holders—has proven that strong, engaged communities are essential for the long-term success of meme coins. BTFD Coin ‘s community power has been a driving factor behind its rapid presale growth, and with more than 70 billion coins sold to over 10,700 holders, the momentum is undeniable. The Bulls Squad continues to drive excitement through social media, online forums, and grassroots initiatives, creating a sense of belonging and ownership among its members. In fact, the BTFD Coin presale has been a major success, and with Stage 14 offering a 100% bonus through the LAUNCH100 bonus code, there’s no better time to get involved. For every BTFD Coin purchase in Stage 14, investors will receive double the number of tokens, making this a rare opportunity to maximize returns. See Your Investments Multiply with BTFD Coin The BTFD Coin presale is currently priced at $0.00016 per coin, and analysts predict that once BTFD Coin is listed on major exchanges, its price could skyrocket to $0.006. For example, if you were to invest $40,000 at the current presale price, you’d receive 250 million BTFD tokens. If the coin rises to $0.006 post-listing, your investment could grow to $1.5 million—an incredible return. With the BTFD Coin presale showing no signs of slowing down, it’s clear that this coin is set for a meteoric rise. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin That Defies All Odds Despite facing significant bearish pressures recently, Dogecoin has shown remarkable resilience. Once considered a joke, Dogecoin has risen to prominence thanks to its strong community, major endorsements, and use cases in real-world applications. What started as an internet meme has become one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the world. Dogecoin has found success because of its broad adoption. Companies like Tesla have started accepting DOGE as payment for products, and Dogecoin has been incorporated into various online platforms and payment systems. This real-world use case is what keeps Dogecoin strong, even when the market is facing turbulence. Unlike some other meme coins, Dogecoin benefits from its established position in the market and is supported by a growing number of institutional and retail investors. With the broader crypto market experiencing downturns, Dogecoin continues to hold strong as one of the top meme coins to invest in now. The price fluctuations are expected as always, but Dogecoin ’s long-term value has only increased as it gains more institutional backing and real-world use cases. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin with a Massive Ecosystem While Dogecoin is the most well-known meme coin, Shiba Inu has rapidly emerged as its main competitor. Created as an “experiment in decentralized community building,” Shiba Inu has quickly gained a massive following, and its ecosystem is constantly growing. With the launch of the Shiba Inu metaverse , ShibaSwap , and a decentralized exchange (DEX), Shiba Inu has established itself as more than just a meme coin. What makes Shiba Inu stand out is its ShibaSwap platform , where users can earn rewards by staking and participating in liquidity pools. The growing Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to add value to its SHIB token, ensuring its place as one of the top meme coins to invest in now. Despite the market’s ups and downs, Shiba Inu has continued to grow, with a loyal following that believes in the project’s long-term vision. Like Dogecoin , a dedicated community supports Shiba Inu, and the project’s developers continue innovating with new initiatives to maintain momentum. With so many features in development, Shiba Inu is set to remain a key player in the meme coin market.

This prediction is based on ETH’s current price action in the four-hour time frame. Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ETH appears to be forming an ascending triangle pattern on the four-hour time frame but is currently facing resistance from the descending trendline and seems to be falling toward the pattern’s support level. Based on the recent price action, if ETH fails to hold the $2,680 level and closes a four-hour candle below $2,670, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 4.5% to reach the $2,560 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View Along with the bearish outlook, ETH is currently trading below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame, indicating that the asset is in a downtrend and has the potential to continue this bearish trend further. Ether Liquidation Risk With the bearish outlook, intraday traders’ $74 million worth of long positions are on the verge of liquidation. Data shows that a significant $72 million worth of long positions was opened when traders became over-leveraged at the $2,657 level. This massive amount of ETH will be liquidated if the price falls below this over-leveraged level. Conversely, traders holding long positions are over-leveraged at the $2,730 level, with $275 million worth of long positions at risk of liquidation if the price falls further. Source: Coinglass Current Price Momentum Currently, ETH is trading near the $2,685 level and has experienced a modest price drop of 0.55% in the past 24 hours.

40426888,https://timestabloid.com/?p=57526,1739746453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ripple Rebrands Website, Here are the Key Changes",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-rebrands-website-here-are-the-key-changes/,"Ripple has introduced a major redesign of its website and branding, signaling a shift in its strategic direction. In a recent X post , the company announced the changes and emphasized a renewed focus on financial innovation and the Internet of Value (IoV) development. This rebranding effort reflects a broader vision for the company’s role in the evolving digital asset landscape. Renowned XRP community figure WrathofKahneman analyzed the updates, identifying significant changes that could indicate a shift in Ripple’s priorities. His observations raise questions about the company’s evolving approach to key sectors, including Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Ripple’s Updated Focus The redesigned website highlights Ripple’s core offerings, which include cross-border payments, digital asset custody, and stablecoins. The company’s priorities include seamless, cost-effective international transactions while expanding into new areas. Its acquisition of Standard Custody has strengthened its presence in the digital asset custody space, allowing banks and fintech firms to store digital assets on behalf of their customers. Additionally, its stablecoin initiative, Ripple USD (RLUSD) , is positioned as a tool for instant global transactions and increased liquidity in digital asset markets. CBDC Reference Removed: A Shift in Strategy? The website’s content has significantly changed, with no mention of CBDCs. Ripple previously collaborated with governments and financial institutions on CBDC initiatives , working on pilot projects with countries like Palau and Georgia. The company also launched a dedicated CBDC platform to support central banks in developing digital currencies. The decision to remove references to these efforts has sparked speculation within the XRP community. WrathofKahneman questioned whether Ripple is deliberately stepping back from CBDC-related projects or simply avoiding drawing attention to them. This shift comes amid a changing regulatory environment in the U.S., where former President Donald Trump issued an executive order restricting efforts to develop and promote CBDCs . Given this backdrop, Ripple’s decision to exclude CBDCs from its website could indicate a strategic move to align with current U.S. policies or reduce regulatory scrutiny. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Key Observations Beyond the repeal of CBDC content, Ripple’s rebranded website reflects several other notable changes. Unlike previous versions, it does not introduce new customers, raising questions about the company’s recent business developments. However, there is a stronger emphasis on Web3 investments, with Ripple now highlighting over $600 million invested in the sector and more than 70 direct investments in blockchain-related projects. Additionally, the rebrand focuses more on developer engagement. The website now makes developer documentation more accessible, suggesting an effort to encourage innovation and broader participation within Ripple’s ecosystem. What This Rebrand Signals for Ripple’s Future Ripple’s updated branding and website redesign indicate a strategic effort to refine its public image and messaging. By emphasizing cross-border payments, digital asset custody, and stablecoins, the company appears to be reinforcing its commitment to institutional adoption while navigating regulatory challenges. As Ripple continues to evolve, industry observers and XRP enthusiasts will closely monitor its next moves. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

40426955,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675979,1739746574,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40426955.jpeg,Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E looks to update US gold reserves with Bitcoin after Fort Knox audit,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musks-d-o-g-e-looks-to-update-us-gold-reserves-with-bitcoin-after-fort-knox-audit/,"Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) has its next mission: find out if Fort Knox actually holds the 4,580 tons of gold it claims to have. Elon was pulled into the debate today when an X user asked him to check if the US gold reserves still exist. Elon responded , “Surely it’s reviewed at least every year.” The US Treasury claims that Fort Knox holds $425 billion worth of gold at market rates, but the last time anyone actually saw it was in 2017, when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin visited. Before that? 1974, when journalists and lawmakers were allowed inside after rumors of missing gold started spreading. The vault remains one of the most restricted locations on Earth, and no single person knows all the steps to open it. Rand Paul demands answers, Lummis says Bitcoin is the solution That single reply set off a political chain reaction, with Senator Rand Paul calling for an official audit and Senator Cynthia Lummis reiterating her favorite radical alternative—replace gold with Bitcoin. Rand Paul, who has long supported government transparency, jumped in immediately after Elon’s post. “Nope. Let’s do it,” Paul wrote, making it clear he wants a full-scale audit of the reserves. His father, Ron Paul, pushed for gold audits for years, arguing that Americans have no proof the gold even exists, which is quite interesting, isn’t it? Anyway, Lummis told Elon, “Bitcoin fixes this. A bitcoin reserve could be audited anytime 24/7 with a basic computer. It’s time to upgrade our reserves.” Elon responded to her recommendation with an emoji that symbolizes thinking, likely meaning he’s gonna think about it. Bitcoin is transparent to a fault, unlike Fort Knox, which remains locked away with no public verification. Her proposal? Ditch gold, buy Bitcoin, and create a US strategic BTC reserve. The US Mint claims Fort Knox holds 147.3 million ounces of gold, but here’s the problem—the government values it at $42.22 per ounce, which puts the official total at just $6.2 billion. That valuation is a joke—gold trades at nearly $2,900 per ounce, making the real value around $425 billion, as aforementioned. Meanwhile, Lummis has already introduced the BITCOIN Act in the Senate, which lays out a plan for the US to create its first official Bitcoin reserve. According to the BICTOIN Act, the plan includes 1 million Bitcoin acquisition program, which would make up 5% of all BTC supply. Lummis also wants to secure Bitcoin vaults run by the US Treasury, designed with both physical and digital security measures. Funding will be pulled from existing Federal Reserve and Treasury funds, meaning no new taxpayer spending, according to the BITCOIN Act. Lummis also wrote that there should be legal protections for Bitcoin self-custody, which will make sure Americans can hold their BTC without interference. Via a post on X, Lummis called the plan a “Louisiana Purchase moment”, comparing it to the massive land acquisition that doubled US territory in 1803. The crypto-loving Senator didn’t expect it, but Trump endorsed the Bitcoin reserve idea. His administration is of course officially crypto-friendly, and he’s openly considered creating a sovereign wealth fund backed by Bitcoin. His support could mean the difference between Congress approving the reserve or blocking it entirely. The US government already holds 200,000 BTC, mostly from asset seizures handled by the US Marshals, and so Lummis wants that Bitcoin moved into the Treasury to kickstart the reserve. She’s also looking at converting old US gold certificates into BTC, which would tie Bitcoin directly into the federal financial system. Meanwhile, states aren’t waiting for Washington. Pennsylvania, Texas, Wyoming, Arizona, Wisconsin, and many others are already exploring state-based Bitcoin reserves, with even more states expected to follow.

Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.000016, meaning a surge to $0.00025 would require a 1462% increase. Meanwhile, Dogecoin, now at $0.259, would need a 383% gain to hit $1.25. While these targets are achievable, they rely heavily on market sentiment, retail hype, and potential ETF approvals rather than core technological improvements. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to reach $2 much sooner. Currently priced at $0.01 in its first phase of the presale, MUTM offers real DeFi utility with its dual lending model, allowing stable and variable borrowing. With its structured roadmap and growing investor interest, MUTM is poised for an explosive rally well before mid-2025. A surge to $2 would mark a 19,900% increase, 200x returns for early investors.

Mutuum Finance is committed to continuous innovation, focusing on advanced analytics, projected smart contracts, and strengthened security.

The Web3Bay presale, featuring its 3BAY token alongside other cryptocurrencies, has already achieved remarkable success, surpassing $1.2 million. This accomplishment underscores the substantial investor interest in Web3Bay’s innovative decentralized e-commerce platform. With over 292 million tokens sold at $0.004562625 each, the project demonstrates significant potential within the Web3 commerce sector. The Web3Bay presale numbers speak for themselves, demonstrating a strong belief in the project’s vision. Web3Bay: A Deep Dive into Blockchain-Enhanced E-Commerce What exactly is Web3Bay, and what makes it unique? Web3Bay is a decentralized marketplace built to eliminate intermediaries and facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions. Unlike traditional centralized platforms that impose substantial fees and control user data, Web3Bay empowers buyers and sellers to transact securely using smart contracts. This approach significantly reduces costs while providing transparent and trustless interactions. The platform also offers diverse payment options, encompassing both cryptocurrency and established fiat methods like PayPal, expanding accessibility to a wider audience. Web3Bay’s smart contract escrow system further strengthens security, ensuring that payments are only released when both parties have fulfilled their commitments. This feature safeguards buyers from potential scams and promotes fair trade. Furthermore, Web3Bay token holders can stake their tokens, generating passive income while contributing to the ecosystem’s health. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early presale participants could realize a substantial return on their investment, positioning Web3Bay as a compelling opportunity in 2025. The Web3Bay concept is centered around user empowerment and security. Web3Bay’s Distinctive Approach in the Evolving Blockchain Commerce Arena While Web3Bay is not alone in exploring the integration of blockchain with real-world applications, its approach sets it apart. While other projects might emphasize supply chain transparency, tokenized assets, or DeFi-driven commerce, Web3Bay distinguishes itself with a functional marketplace that delivers a smooth user experience. Rather than solely focusing on backend blockchain integrations, Web3Bay prioritizes user adoption, multi-currency support, and efficient transactions. Its hybrid payment system, accommodating both crypto and traditional payments, facilitates a seamless transition for mainstream users. Another key differentiator for Web3Bay is its commitment to low transaction fees. In contrast to centralized marketplaces that can charge up to 15% per sale, Web3Bay operates with minimal costs, benefiting both buyers and sellers. The platform’s escrow-backed dispute resolution mechanism and community-driven marketplace governance enhance trust within the ecosystem. This user-centric philosophy explains the rapid growth of the Web3Bay community, evident in the increasing activity across its Telegram and other social media channels. The Web3Bay team is focused on building a platform that is both powerful and accessible. Web3Bay’s Presale Success: A Testament to its Potential The impressive performance of the Web3Bay presale, exceeding $1.2 million, reflects investor confidence in the project’s long-term vision. The stage-based pricing model rewards early adopters, allowing them to acquire tokens at lower prices before each subsequent phase increases the token’s value. With the current presale price at $0.004562625, the token is projected to reach $0.1959 after launch, presenting a significant potential upside. With a well-defined roadmap, practical real-world utility, and a thriving presale, Web3Bay is emerging as a promising crypto investment in 2025. The Web3Bay presale numbers indicate a strong belief in the project’s future. The success of the presale is a validation of the Web3Bay team’s hard work.

With its recent price surge, investors are wondering: Will SHIB reach $0.000025, or is there a new player on the block that will take the spotlight? WallitIQ (WLTQ) , the under-the-radar altcoin with massive potential, is currently in its presale stage, priced at $0.0420 , and analysts predict it could soar to $250. That’s a potential return of over 5000%! WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Hidden Gem Set To Outperform Soar With AI-Driven Features While Shiba Inu is still grabbing headlines, a hidden gem in the crypto market could outperform it by leaps and bounds: WallitIQ (WLTQ) . This under-the-radar altcoin is an AI-powered token with cutting-edge technology and strong utility that offers a unique value proposition. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale investors can stake the altcoins and earn up to 180% annual percentage yield (APY). The platform’s staking program gives early investors a massive edge, creating a passive income stream that could yield impressive returns. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has the potential for explosive growth, with its secure AI-powered platform as the foundation for this success. SolidProof has audited the platform’s smart contract, and the built-in anomaly detection feature continuously monitors transactions to safeguard investors’ assets. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) beta version launching soon, investors are rushing to secure their tokens at the presale price. The platform’s MVP build includes live market data, allowing users to track crypto prices through a CoinGecko API integration. In addition, the platform simplifies crypto transactions with its Scan & Pay QR technology, making sending and receiving crypto payments more effortless than ever. But there’s more.

They’re also gaining access to exclusive educational content , market research, and in-depth analytics. As if that wasn’t enough, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers bonus tokens for investors who participate in the presale and refer others. The more people join, the more demand for the token grows, and the higher the value could go. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has its charm, it’s clear that WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a unique opportunity to secure a long-term position in a promising project. The presale is ongoing, and the price is ridiculously low at $0.0420 . Shiba Inu’s Next Breakout: Will It Reach $0.000025? Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00001603, and its recent price action has investors wondering if it can reach and break through its key resistance level at $0.000025. In recent weeks, the meme coin saw a promising 14% surge. However, this path is not without its challenges. Shiba Inu is facing significant hurdles in sustaining momentum. Trading volumes have been relatively low, which raises concerns about whether it can maintain enough buying pressure to push past the $0.000025 level. Even if Shiba Inu manages to break the resistance, it must hold above this level for a sustained period to target higher levels. In addition, the volume of transactions involving the meme coin has dipped below $400 million to $262 million. This reduction in liquidity suggests that the excitement around Shiba Inu may be cooling off, and sustaining upward momentum could prove difficult without more large trades. So, as investors keep an eye on Shiba Inu’s performance and whether it can reach $0.000025, there’s another rewarding opportunity they should not overlook—WallitIQ (WLTQ), the under-the-radar altcoin that’s ready to take the spotlight and outperform the meme coin in a significant way. Conclusion: Buy The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Altcoin Presale Before It’s Too Late Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be on the brink of a breakout, but its potential pales compared to the opportunity that WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers . With its ongoing presale, investors can get in at an unbelievably low price of $0.0420 per token. The under-the-radar altcoin could easily take the spotlight and soar to incredible heights. Buying the WallitIQ (WLTQ) under-the-radar altcoin presale guarantees investment in the future of crypto technology with high staking rewards, cutting-edge security, and exclusive educational content. By investing early, investors will capitalize on WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) utilities and potentially make huge profits. Don’t let this presale opportunity pass you by.

Qubetics Could Be the Answer to Your What-Ifs,https://thecoinrise.com/still-thinking-about-missing-binance-qubetics-could-be-the-answer-to-your-what-ifs/,"The crypto world never sleeps, and lately, it’s been buzzing with some eyebrow-raising developments. Just recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hit the pause button on its lawsuit against Binance, signaling a potential shift towards a more crypto-friendly approach. This move comes on the heels of Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, stepping down after pleading guilty to federal charges and the company agreeing to a hefty fine. With such shake-ups, investors are searching for the next best performing crypto that can offer stability and explosive potential. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a rising star aiming to tackle the very issues that have tripped up its predecessors. Positioning itself as the world’s first Layer 1, Web3 aggregated ecosystem, Qubetics is on a mission to unify leading blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. By enhancing scalability, security, and interoperability, Qubetics promises to create a seamless experience for users and developers alike. Qubetics: Bridging the Gaps Qubetics is making history as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, addressing the very issues that have plagued other platforms. At its core, Qubetics focuses on interoperability, ensuring that various blockchains can communicate seamlessly. This groundbreaking approach is a game-changer for businesses, professionals, and individual users, eliminating fragmentation and enabling a truly decentralized and connected crypto ecosystem. Imagine a freelance graphic designer who prefers payments in Ethereum working with a client who transacts in Bitcoin. With Qubetics’ platform, this exchange becomes effortless, eliminating the need for multiple wallets or third-party exchanges. Developers, too, stand to benefit. Building decentralized applications (dApps) that can operate across multiple blockchains becomes more straightforward, expanding the potential user base and enhancing functionality. The excitement around Qubetics is palpable. The project is in its 21st presale stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.0733. The presale has already raised over $12.9 million, with more than 474 million $TICS tokens sold to over 20,000 holders. Analysts are buzzing with predictions, suggesting that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating into a 209.67% return on investment. Looking further ahead, forecasts indicate potential prices of $1 post-presale and up to $15 after the mainnet launch, offering returns that could turn a modest investment into a substantial gain. Binance: The Giant’s Stumbles Binance has long been a heavyweight in the crypto arena, offering a vast array of services from spot trading to futures. However, its journey hasn’t been without hurdles. The recent legal entanglements, culminating in a $4.3 billion fine and the resignation of its founder, have cast shadows over its operations. These events have led to increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide, causing some users to question the platform’s stability and long-term viability. Despite these challenges, Binance continues to operate globally, processing over $100 trillion in transactions over the past seven years. The appointment of Richard Teng as the new CEO marks a strategic shift towards compliance and transparency. Teng, a former regulator, aims to rebuild trust and steer the platform through these turbulent times. Yet, for many, the question remains: Is Binance still the best performing crypto platform to bet on? While Binance has dominated the market for years, the writing’s on the wall—regulation is coming, and it’s hitting centralized exchanges hard. Users worldwide have faced account restrictions, frozen withdrawals, and regulatory crackdowns that have forced them to look elsewhere. If past cycles have taught anything, it’s that the next big thing is usually brewing just as the old guard starts to crumble. Conclusion While Binance has been a dominant force, its recent challenges highlight the need for innovation and adaptability. Qubetics , with its emphasis on interoperability and practical solutions, offers a compelling alternative for those looking to invest in the next big thing.

33767162,[object Object],1739748613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Sees $1 Billion In Exchange Inflows – Is A Bloodbath Coming?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sees-1-billion-in-exchange-inflows-is-a-bloodbath-coming/,"Bitcoin is currently hovering around $97,000 within the past 24 hours, which is an extension between its range trading between $98,600 and $95,000 throughout last week. Amidst these back and forth motion, data shows a negative trend among Bitcoin traders, which could intensify a price drop. According to data from on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin saw around $1.4 billion net inflows into crypto exchanges in the just-concluded week. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Spike Amid Market Uncertainty IntoTheBlock’s data , shared on social media platform X, highlighted that $1.04 billion were sent into crypto exchanges last week. Unsurprisingly, this run of inflows erased the outflows in the previous three weeks. As noted by IntoTheBlock, this shift in capital movement suggests growing hesitancy among Bitcoin holders, largely driven by prevailing global political and economic uncertainties. Adding to concerns, the Bitcoin network saw a notable drop in transaction fees. On-chain data shows that fees declined by 10.74% compared to the prior week. This decline in fees signals lower network activity, which is often a bearish indicator. A rise in transaction fees typically suggests increasing demand and higher market engagement, while a drop implies reduced interest and weaker momentum for Bitcoin’s price. Image From X: IntoTheBlock Spot Bitcoin ETFs Could Be Driving Exchange Inflows A major factor behind the surge in Bitcoin exchange inflows could be outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs. US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been a major cause of Bitcoin’s bull run this year, with consistent inflows fueling upward momentum. However, last week played out very differently for these Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Particularly, data from SosoValue reveals that US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $651.83 million in net outflows over the past week. Interestingly, this is the largest weekly outflow recorded in these Spot Bitcoin ETFs since the first week of September 2024. This suggests that some institutional investors have been offloading Bitcoin, either to secure profits or in response to lingering uncertainty after the drastic price crash at the beginning of February. Image From SosoValue The Bitcoin inflows into crypto exchanges open up a bearish case for Bitcoin, especially since it creates a selling pressure on exchanges. Technical analysis shows that Bitcoin is currently trapped between key supply and demand levels. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, there is a significant 1.43 million BTC demand wall between $94,660 and $97,540, while a 1.16 million BTC supply wall sits between $97,650 and $99,470. A breakout in either direction will potentially set the trend for the next major move. If Bitcoin breaks above the $99,470 resistance, it could trigger fresh buying momentum and push the price substantially above the $100,000 mark again. However, a more extended correction could unfold if selling pressure intensifies and BTC falls below the $94,660 support.

While meme coins and AI-driven projects are generating excitement, a different kind of opportunity is emerging: Web3Bay (3BAY). This decentralized e-commerce platform is quickly becoming a top contender among the best crypto ICOs for 2025. Alongside projects like Wall Street Pepe and MIND of Pepe, Web3Bay is poised for substantial growth, offering both practical utility and impressive presale traction. Web3Bay has already raised $1.2 million in its presale, selling 300 million tokens. Let’s explore why these three projects are attracting attention and why Web3Bay might just be the most promising of the bunch. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Wall Street Pepe has made a significant splash in the meme coin arena, raking in over $68 million in its presale. This project has resonated with investors by combining the power of viral marketing with actual trading tools, adding value beyond mere speculation. A key differentiator for Wall Street Pepe is its VIP Club. This exclusive, token-gated community provides members with real-time trading insights, sophisticated analytics, and “whale-level” market calls. These resources, traditionally available only to large institutional investors, are now being democratized for retail traders through WEPE. Wall Street Pepe has already secured listings on major exchanges, with both DEX and CEX launches planned after the presale concludes. The project also incentivizes early adopters with passive income opportunities, fostering long-term investment. With its Pepe-inspired branding and an aggressive marketing strategy, the question on everyone’s mind is whether Wall Street Pepe can achieve the same level of success as previous meme coin giants. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) Another frog-themed project with a unique twist, MIND of Pepe integrates AI-driven market analysis into the meme coin world. This self-learning AI agent is designed to analyze market data, identify trends, and generate trading signals, essentially offering an intelligent trading assistant for crypto enthusiasts. The $MIND presale has already attracted nearly $5 million in a short period, demonstrating strong demand for AI-powered trading tools. Unlike simple chatbots that merely present market information, MIND of Pepe is designed to manage crypto wallets, analyze market sentiment, and even autonomously launch tokens. With the growing trend of AI-integrated finance, this project is capitalizing on the increasing interest in AI-driven investment solutions. Early investors can acquire $MIND tokens at a discounted presale price, with staking rewards and passive income opportunities providing additional incentives for long-term holding. 3. Web3Bay (3BAY) Among the best crypto ICOs, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out as a potential game-changer, aiming to transform the multi-trillion dollar e-commerce industry using blockchain technology. Unlike centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay facilitates direct, peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating intermediaries and their associated high fees. With the online shopping sector expanding rapidly, Web3Bay is positioned as one of the best crypto investments for 2025. The project has already raised over $1.2 million, with 300 million tokens sold in its presale, demonstrating significant investor interest. Currently priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, 3BAY is projected to launch at $0.1959, representing an estimated 4,200% ROI for early backers who participate in one of the best crypto ICOs. Why Web3Bay is One of the Best Crypto ICOs: Decentralized Marketplace: Buyers and sellers connect directly, bypassing intermediaries and lowering costs. Smart Contract Renouncement: Ensures no single entity can manipulate the ecosystem after the presale. Staking Rewards: Investors can stake 3BAY tokens to earn passive income and enjoy reduced fees. Community Governance: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) empowers token holders to vote on important platform decisions. Blockchain Security: Transactions are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof, utilizing IPFS storage for data integrity. As blockchain technology continues to reshape various industries, Web3Bay is emerging as a compelling presale opportunity among the best crypto ICOs. With its strong presale performance, Web3Bay isn’t just another crypto project; it represents a significant advancement in online commerce. Summing Up While Wall Street Pepe and MIND of Pepe tap into the hype surrounding meme coins and AI, Web3Bay provides a real-world use case with substantial upside potential. Its disruptive approach to e-commerce, impressive presale demand, and significant projected ROI make it one of the best crypto ICOs available. As the crypto market matures, investors are increasingly focusing on utility-driven projects with long-term viability. While meme coins can offer short-term gains, Web3Bay represents a fundamental shift in online commerce, making it a potentially smart investment for 2025. For investors looking for the best crypto ICOs , Web3Bay offers a compelling opportunity. With its innovative approach and strong community support, Web3Bay stands out among the best crypto ICOs. Don’t miss out on the best crypto ICOs; research and invest wisely.

Bitget (BGB) has recently moved to $6.72, sparking renewed market interest. Its price is approaching crucial resistance points, with expectations it might surpass $7.77 soon. At the same time, Solana’s (SOL) future looks bright, with predictions pointing to a possible rise to $300 by 2025, spurred by ETF speculations and increasing institutional engagement. Currently, BlockDAG (BDAG) is the buzz of the crypto community, offering a substantial 350% boost with its FINALCALL700 promotion. The project has already attracted $195.5 million, with 18.4 billion BDAG distributed and rumors of impending major exchange listings. Traders are eager to buy BDAG at its present price, knowing the value could skyrocket post-listing. Bitget Token Price Gains as It Nears Key Resistance The Bitget (BGB) price recently reached $6.72, showing strong market interest. This rise coincides with a boost in trading activity, with experts monitoring crucial resistance points around $7.77 to see if BGB can advance further. The peak price of $8.49 for Bitget is an important milestone, and if the current positive trend continues, it might approach this high soon. Future projections for Bitget’s price in 2025 vary from $8.78 to $21.16, encouraged by its platform’s growing popularity and broader use. Yet, some cautious estimates warn of a possible fall to $1.73 should market mood decline. Solana (SOL) Price Forecast for 2025: Will It Reach $300? Solana’s price has stirred considerable interest, with a 2025 forecast aiming for a bold $300. Recent policy talks have amplified this outlook, proposing Solana’s inclusion in a crypto initiative backed by reserves, boosting confidence in its potential. Despite a recent dip to $204 from $217, essential technical indicators imply that there might be a buying uptick soon. Solana maintains support at the $180 and $200 levels, emphasizing a positive outlook. Expectations of an ETF by VanEck and continued interest in digital assets from professional circles are propelling Solana’s price upwards. A significant influence on Solana’s future price could be an upcoming press conference with David Sacks, a notable figure in digital asset investment. Positive discussions about Solana’s network growth and wider adoption might further boost its prospects, possibly pushing its price towards $300 by 2025. BlockDAG’s 350% Bonus Sparks Frenzy in the Crypto Community While Bitget and Solana are capturing attention, BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus is currently the main attraction. This limited-time presale offers an extraordinary 350% boost on BDAG, generating an impressive response from those eager to maximize their participation before it ends. BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the standout crypto projects of the year, driven by significant achievements: A presale tallying up to $195.5 million Over 18.4 billion BDAG sold, with increasing demand Plans for listings on 10 leading centralized exchanges An impressive price increase of 2,380% from $0.001 to $0.0248 The figures are telling. Early participants have seen substantial gains, with forecasts suggesting BDAG could reach $1 soon, and possibly $20 by 2027. For those calculating the returns, the numbers are compelling. A $1,000 spending in BDAG now, with the 350% bonus, could grow to $4,500 in BDAG. Should BDAG hit the anticipated $20, this could mean a windfall of $3.6 million. A $10,000 worth of assets might yield $36.2 million. The potential for profit is massive, positioning BDAG as one of the top crypto assets this year. The excitement is further fueled by anticipated exchange listings that could significantly increase BDAG’s price once it hits the market. With these major listings on the horizon, those in the know are securing their BDAG before the presale ends. As the FINALCALL700 bonus nears its conclusion, the window to acquire BDAG at such an attractive rate is closing rapidly. Crypto Market Heats Up: Don’t Miss Out The crypto market is ripe with opportunities as key assets gain momentum. Bitget’s price is advancing towards critical resistance, poised to reach new heights if the trend persists. Meanwhile, predictions suggest Solana could reach $300 by 2025, supported by ETF buzz and strategic discussions. However, the standout narrative is BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus, igniting the market with a substantial 350% BDAG boost. With a whopping $195.5 million raised, 18.4 billion BDAG sold, and a 2380% price leap, BDAG’s potential is unmistakable. The project is gearing up for listings on 10 prominent exchanges, with experts predicting a future price of $20. For those aiming to capitalize on huge returns, BDAG offers an unmatched opportunity. As the crypto presale accelerates, acquiring BDAG at its current price might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity before it debuts on the open market at a much higher valuation.

Turns out, Jerome Powell has been in direct and frequent talks with the White House, despite the president’s very public dislike of him. Kevin Hassett, Trump’s top economic adviser and the director of the National Economic Council, confirmed the regular discussions, saying they were meant to exchange views on the US economy while keeping the Fed’s independence intact. “Jay’s an independent person, the Fed’s independence is respected,” Hassett said on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. “The point is the president’s opinion can also be heard. He’s the president of the United States.” Trump does not like Powell, and he has made sure everyone knows, as he tends to. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump raged against Powell, saying he should be fired and replaced with someone who would do what the Oval wanted. Powell stood his ground in his typical classy fashion, and even said he would sue if Trump ever tried to remove him illegally. The White House meetings may be labeled as friendly economic discussions, but Powell knows that if Trump doesn’t get what he wants, he won’t hesitate to turn on him again. Trump’s White House revives direct Fed talks “I have arranged to begin, once again, regular lunches with Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve,” Hassett said in his interview. “Jay and I have a long and collegial relationship, and I’m going to go over there with him and the other governors. So we’re going to talk about our views about what’s going on, and listen to his.” Inflation has been a major problem for both Trump and Powell. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a 4.6% rise over the last three months, way above the Fed’s 2% target. Prices are still high for food, gas, and everyday essentials. Eggs, in particular, have been a disaster. “I just went to the grocery store,” Hassett said. “I shop for our family, in part because I love to look at prices. And there were no eggs at the store yesterday, just a few.” “We saw the consumer price index come out, and we found out that the stagflation that was created by the policies of President Biden was way worse than we thought,” Hassett said. He pointed out that economists from Biden’s own team, including Jason Furman and Larry Summers, had warned that too much government spending would trigger massive inflation. Now, Trump’s team is working on a multi-layered plan to fix the problem. Hassett said the administration is focused on supply-side tax cuts to increase production, spending reductions through the Department of Government Expenditure (DOGE) and congressional action, more energy production and massive deregulation, as well as industry-specific policies. Moreover, the bird flu outbreak has wiped out millions of chickens, leading to record-high egg prices. Hassett blamed Biden’s response, saying his administration’s solution was simply to kill chickens without a proper containment strategy. “Biden didn’t really have a plan for avian flu,” Hassett said. “They spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken.” The Trump administration is now finalizing a new plan that will focus on biosecurity and medication rather than mass slaughter. Hassett explained that the spread is mostly coming from ducks and geese, not chickens. “So why does it make sense to kill all the chickens when the ducks and geese are spreading the disease?” he said. Trump wants lower interest rates, Fed remains firm Trump publicly called for lower interest rates, arguing that high rates are hurting consumers. “Interest rates need to come down,” he keeps saying via his posts on Truth Social. “We have inflation under control.” But the Federal Reserve does not seem ready to cut rates anytime soon. Powell has said many times before that rates will remain high until inflation fully stabilizes. Hassett, however, defended Trump’s position. He pointed out that market interest rates are already going down. “The 10-year Treasury yield has dropped about 40 basis points in recent weeks,” he said. “That’s saving the American people about $40 billion just from us talking about what we’re about to do.” Trade is also back in focus. Trump wants to reintroduce reciprocal tariffs on countries that have Value-Added Taxes (VATs), including European nations and China. “Right now, US companies are paying $370 billion in taxes to foreign governments,” Hassett said. “Meanwhile, foreign companies are paying the US government only $57 billion.” The White House is now negotiating with foreign leaders, including the UK’s Minister Reynolds, to fix this trade imbalance. The goal is to recover $5 trillion over the next 10 years, which Trump’s team says will fund tax cuts and boost the economy. “We’re talking to leaders of other countries all the time,” Hassett said. “Last night into the wee hours, I was talking to Minister Reynolds from the UK about this very matter.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",News|The Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|FIAT|TRADING|ASIA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-17 00:10:30

While well-established meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to hold their ground, newer projects like BTFD Coin have grabbed the spotlight with impressive presale figures and unique utility offerings. As the BTFD Coin presale enters its final stages, it’s clear that the Top New Meme Coins to Join for Long Term are offering more than just hype. Let’s dive into why Gigachad and Ponke are gaining momentum and why BTFD Coin is becoming the hottest coin to invest in for the long run. The Growing Popularity of Meme Coins Over the past few years, meme coins have surged from internet jokes to serious financial assets. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way for meme coins, with their strong communities and viral potential driving their success. However, new players like Gigachad and Ponke are quickly gaining traction, thanks to their innovative approaches and enthusiastic followings. BTFD Coin is also joining the ranks, differentiating itself with features like a Play2Earn game , staking rewards , and a community-driven referral program . The popularity of meme coins has exploded recently, with new projects consistently entering the market. But what makes this wave different? It’s not just about the meme anymore—these new coins are creating ecosystems, rewarding users, and building strong communities. BTFD Coin stands out with its Play2Earn game and 90% APY staking rewards , while Gigachad and Ponke are carving out their own unique positions in the market. With the presale for BTFD Coin surging past $6 million, it’s clear that this sector is only getting started. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin for the Future If you’re looking to get in on one of the Top New Meme Coins to Join for Long Term , BTFD Coin is hands-down one of the best opportunities in the market right now. With a presale that has raised over $6 million , BTFD Coin is positioning itself to become a major player in the meme coin world. The presale is nearing its end, and once BTFD Coin hits major exchanges, analysts predict a sharp rise in value—possibly shooting up to $0.006 from its current presale price of $0.00016 . What makes BTFD Coin different from other meme coins is its real utility and the incentives it offers for long-term holders. The Play2Earn game , which went live on January 1, 2025, allows players to earn BTFD tokens while playing, turning the meme coin into something more than just a speculative investment. With staking rewards offering an impressive 90% APY , BTFD Coin rewards its holders for staying committed to the project, creating a sustainable ecosystem. But that’s not all. The referral program and the Bulls Squad community are driving the excitement around BTFD Coin . The Bulls Squad —a group of loyal investors and holders—is playing a key role in spreading the word about BTFD Coin and driving its presale success. With over 70 billion coins sold to more than 10,700 holders , BTFD Coin has a growing community that is excited about the project’s long-term potential. The BTFD Coin presale is currently in Stage 14, where investors get an incredible 100% bonus on their purchases through the LAUNCH100 bonus code. If you’re considering jumping in, this is the time to do it before the coin is listed on major exchanges at $0.0006 . For those considering an investment, here’s a scenario: If you were to invest $40,000 at $0.00016 per coin, you’d receive 250 million BTFD tokens. When the coin lists at $0.0006 , your investment would grow to $150,000 . And if the coin hits the $0.006 mark—an expectation after major listings—you’re looking at a $1.5 million investment. This offers a huge potential return for those who believe in the long-term value of BTFD Coin . Gigachad: The Meme Coin with Strong Community Backing Another rising star in the meme coin space is Gigachad . Known for its bold branding and playful approach, Gigachad is quickly becoming one of the Top New Meme Coins to Join for Long Term . Its popularity has soared, especially among younger investors looking for a coin with a strong community focus and a meme-driven marketing strategy. What makes Gigachad stand out is the unique blend of humor and seriousness. The coin is built around the persona of the “Gigachad” meme, but it’s not just about memes. The Gigachad community is highly active, and there’s a growing demand for the coin thanks to its viral appeal. The project is also focusing on creating utility , like exclusive NFTs and staking opportunities, which could drive long-term growth. While it’s still in the early stages, Gigachad has shown solid momentum. Its community-driven approach and strong social media presence make it a Top New Meme Coin to Join for Long Term for anyone looking to invest in something that has both viral potential and growing real-world applications. Ponke: A New Meme Coin with Long-Term Vision If you haven’t heard of Ponke , it’s time to pay attention. Ponke has been gaining a lot of traction lately, largely due to its focus on community involvement and strong rewards programs . While Ponke doesn’t have the same historical weight as Dogecoin or Shiba Inu , its rise is a testament to the meme coin space’s growing influence. Ponke is positioning itself as a long-term investment by focusing on creating real-world use cases, staking opportunities, and community-driven growth. The project has plans to build out a comprehensive ecosystem that includes not just meme coin rewards, but also features like governance tokens, staking pools, and cross-chain compatibility. The goal is to create an engaging ecosystem that rewards users for their participation, ensuring that Ponke isn’t just another flash-in-the-pan meme coin. With its low starting price and community-driven focus , Ponke has the potential to grow into one of the Top New Meme Coins to Join for Long Term . As meme coins continue to dominate the space, Ponke could very well become one of the key players in the next wave of meme coin investments. Conclusion: The Future of Meme Coins Looks Bright Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the Top New Meme Coin to Join for Long Term . With its Play2Earn game , staking rewards , and Bulls Squad community, BTFD Coin is positioned to revolutionize the meme coin market.

Lawyers Jonatan Baldiviezo, Marcos Zelaya, María Eva Koutsovitis, and Claudio Lozano filed the case on Sunday, accusing Javier of playing a central role in a “rug pull” that misled the public and resulted in huge financial losses. Javier promoted $LIBRA on Friday via X (formerly Twitter), and his post drew immediate attention, triggering massive investments. But just hours later, he deleted the post, sending $LIBRA’s price into freefall, and investors watching the market on Dexscreener saw their holdings obliterated. According to the plaintiffs, Javier’s actions amounted to fraud and a violation of Argentina’s Public Ethics Law. Baldiviezo, speaking to The Associated Press, said, “Within this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president’s actions were essential.” The lawsuit accuses Javier of using his position and influence to pump up a financial asset, only to ditch it without warning, leaving unsuspecting investors in the dust. The Presidential Office, in a statement on Saturday, denied any wrongdoing, insisting that Javier was never involved in $LIBRA’s creation, that his post was made in good faith to support entrepreneurial projects but was removed to prevent speculation. Javier himself responded on X, writing, “I was not aware of the details of the project, and after getting informed, I decided not to continue promoting it (which is why I deleted the tweet).” He also accused his political opponents of trying to exploit the controversy to undermine him by the Opposition party. Despite his denial, documents and online records confirm that Javier and members of his administration had met with representatives of KIP Protocol, the team behind $LIBRA, before its launch. The Anti-Corruption Office, which operates under the Executive Branch, has opened an internal investigation. In a statement, the Presidential Office said, “All the information gathered in the investigation will be handed over to the judiciary to determine if any of the companies or individuals linked to the KIP Protocol project committed a crime.” KIP Protocol, Jupiter Exchange, and Hayden Davis react Hayden Davis, the CEO of KIP Protocol, publicly blamed Javier Milei for $LIBRA’s downfall. In a video statement released on Saturday, Hayden said, “Despite prior commitments, Javier and his team unexpectedly changed their position, withdrawing their support and deleting all previous posts on social media.” Meanwhile, crypto exchange Jupiter Exchange acknowledged that some of its team members knew about $LIBRA’s launch before Javier’s tweet. In a statement, Jupiter admitted, “A few members of the Jupiter team knew that there would be, at some point, a token project associated with Argentine President Javier Milei. We learned of this ~2 weeks ago directly from Kelsier Ventures.” Jupiter, however, denied any insider trading and said the coin had already hit a $1.5 billion market cap before receiving the “Verified” tag on their platform. “LIBRA did not get the ‘Verified’ icon in our default token search until roughly one hour after launch,” they said. Despite the denial, the exchange confirmed that dozens of imposter tokens flooded the market immediately after $LIBRA’s launch, making it easy for traders to buy the wrong token by mistake. “We take allegations of insider trading extremely seriously. If you have evidence of Jupiter employees leaking information or otherwise sniping, please reach out directly. If we discover any team members acted on non-public information, we will take quick and decisive action.” $100 million in LIBRA funds still under Hayden’ control Despite the massive price collapse, Hayden Hayden still controls $100 million in LIBRA treasury funds. He announced that he would reinvest and burn all repurchased tokens, insisting that he remains committed to transparency. “Unless a more viable alternative is presented, I intend to begin the process of executing on this plan within the next 48 hours,” Hayden said. He also denied any involvement in fraud, placing the blame squarely on Javier for the coin’s catastrophic crash. Hayden added, “Javier’s associates had secured his public support at launch and had assured me that his continued backing was guaranteed throughout the launch.” He claimed that Javier’s sudden reversal shattered investor confidence and led to the price collapse. While the legal battle intensifies, investors are left with millions in losses, the Argentine government faces mounting scrutiny, and Javier Milei is now at the center of one of the biggest crypto scandals in history.

In a market where investors are transitioning from speculative to practical blockchain applications, Web3Bay is setting itself apart. By utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate a peer-to-peer marketplace, it eliminates intermediaries, slashes fees, and enhances user control over finances. In its fourth presale stage, Web3Bay has successfully raised over $1 million, distributing more than 305 million 3BAY tokens at $0.00456 each. Web3Bay directly targets the multi-billion-dollar e-commerce sector, promising secure and transparent transactions through blockchain. In parallel, DeXe and Render are advancing their own specialties—DeXe in decentralized asset management, and Render in decentralized GPU computing. Analyzing Web3Bay’s presale achievements alongside DeXe and Render’s developments offers insights into potentially lucrative gains for 2025. Web3Bay Presale: Unlocking Exceptional Returns Web3Bay is rapidly becoming a central player in decentralized e-commerce. Its presale strategy involves 28 stages, each progressively increasing in price. Now in Stage 4, the platform has accumulated over $1 million, selling 305 million 3BAY tokens. With an anticipated listing price of $0.1959, early investors are projected to achieve an ROI of 6,430%, making early investment significantly rewarding. Beyond the allure of financial returns, Web3Bay addresses the inherent inefficiencies of traditional online shopping platforms that levy high fees and restrict consumer choices through centralized governance. Web3Bay offers a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers transact directly, thus reducing unnecessary costs. A notable aspect of Web3Bay is its governance model. Unlike centralized platforms, Web3Bay allows token holders to collectively decide on platform fees, policies, and updates, ensuring that it remains governed by its users and adaptable to their needs. Moreover, Web3Bay supports transactions in multiple currencies, including stablecoins, providing transactional stability. This inclusive financial system effectively bridges traditional and crypto payment methodologies, broadening its user base. DeXe: Innovating in Decentralized Asset Management DeXe stands out with its decentralized asset management solutions, allowing users to autonomously manage investments and emulate successful trading strategies. Currently trading at approximately $19.97, DeXe emphasizes transparency and security through blockchain, offering a self-governing investment platform. Investors are keeping a close eye on DeXe’s growth and market adoption, assessing its potential to disrupt traditional finance within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Its innovative asset management model positions it as a potential powerhouse in DeFi, particularly appealing to traditional investors moving towards blockchain solutions. Render: Pioneering Decentralized GPU Rendering Render is redefining GPU rendering by decentralizing the process, linking individuals needing rendering services with GPU owners. With a current trading value of about $4.24 and a daily volume increase of 3.2%, Render offers scalable and cost-efficient rendering solutions, democratizing access to high-performance computing for various industries, including film, gaming, and AI. As the demand for AI and 3D rendering escalates, Render is strategically positioned to benefit from these growing sectors. Its integration with leading creative tools and strategic partnerships could enhance its standing in the tech market. In Summary As the presale of Web3Bay advances with a promising ROI of 6,430%, it emerges as a notable opportunity for investors interested in decentralized e-commerce innovations. Simultaneously, DeXe and Render are expanding their market influence, with DeXe enhancing decentralized asset management and Render advancing in distributed computing resources. Each project offers unique benefits, targeting different market segments and showcasing distinct potential for investment growth.

While the market is flooded with short-lived trends, a select few stand out as the best meme coins to join for long term growth and potential wealth generation. These aren’t just coins; they’re immersive narratives that bring investors on an adventure of excitement, community engagement, and financial rewards. Among the best meme coins to join for long term, three unique projects have emerged as true pioneers: Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT), and Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT). Each of these coins carries a compelling story, innovative tokenomics, and strong community backing, making them potential game-changers in the meme coin landscape. Arctic Pablo Coin leads the charge of all three, offering a groundbreaking narrative that merges myth and reality. This isn’t just about investing in a meme coin—it’s about embarking on an epic journey across undiscovered lands, following Arctic Pablo as he unearths the mystical treasures of the crypto world. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Mystical Journey to Fortune Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a token—it’s an exploration of hidden realms, a journey through uncharted lands, and a ticket to financial success. Investors aren’t merely holders; they become part of the expedition, traveling alongside Arctic Pablo as he unveils ancient mysteries and untapped riches. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on hype, Arctic Pablo Coin blends storytelling with real-world tokenomics. The presale isn’t divided into stages but into locations, each unveiling a new chapter of Pablo’s adventure. The expedition has reached Aqua Frost, having already raised over $1.3. With each new location, the token price increases, rewarding early investors with skyrocketing ROI potential. Arctic Pablo Coin doesn’t just stop at an engaging story—it ensures long-term value through weekly token burns during the presale and the elimination of unsold tokens after launch. This deflationary mechanism enhances scarcity and investor confidence, boosting demand while reducing supply. Arctic Pablo offers a 66% APY staking program for those who want to maximize their holdings. Investors can stake their APC tokens, allowing them to grow their assets while participating in the grand expedition. All staked tokens will be vested for two months post-launch, ensuring stability and continuous growth. With every new location, Arctic Pablo’s journey becomes more exhilarating. Those who join early are in for a ride filled with adventure, wealth-building, and an ever-growing community that believes in the legend of Arctic Pablo. It is one of the best meme coins to join for long term. Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT): From Internet Sensation to Crypto Star Peanut the Squirrel is proof that virality and crypto make an unstoppable duo. What started as a heartbreaking news story became a multi-million-dollar meme coin phenomenon. After Peanut’s tragic euthanasia due to rabies concerns, the internet rallied around the beloved squirrel, catapulting $PNUT into the spotlight. However, Peanut’s owner, Mark Longo, wasn’t thrilled. Feeling exploited, he launched his own cryptocurrency, JUSTICE, to fund his animal sanctuary. This led to a clash between investors and Peanut’s real-life legacy. The controversy brought even more attention to $PNUT, keeping it in the limelight. While its initial rise was driven by virality, the coin now focuses on utility. Developers are integrating NFTs and staking rewards to ensure longevity. For those who love a good underdog story, $PNUT remains one of the best meme coins to join for long term potential. Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT): Mythology Meets Meme Culture While internet trends inspire many meme coins, Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) taps into the power of ancient mythology. This coin reimagines the Greek god Zeus as the ultimate meme overlord, merging historical storytelling with crypto innovation. Goatseus Maximus isn’t just a meme—it’s an entire mythos. The project features an exclusive NFT collection depicting legendary figures and mythical creatures, giving holders access to staking rewards, voting rights, and limited-edition digital assets. Unlike meme coins that fade after their viral moment, $GOAT has built a devoted following. Its community-driven approach fosters long-term engagement, making it a solid option for meme coin investors seeking sustainability. Developers have hinted at a play-to-earn (P2E) game and metaverse integration, adding layers of utility that could sustain the coin’s growth. As a result, $GOAT remains a strong contender among the best meme coins to join for long term potential. Conclusion: Which Meme Coin Holds the Crown? Based on research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) stands out as the most promising long-term investment. Unlike short-lived meme trends, Arctic Pablo’s journey unfolds in real-time, creating an ongoing narrative that keeps investors engaged and rewarded. For those looking for high potential ROI, token burns, and 66% APY staking make it a standout pick. Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) thrives on viral momentum, while Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) offers mythological appeal, but neither can match Arctic Pablo’s innovative approach to long-term wealth generation.

40432964,https://invezz.com/?p=2568370,1739757284,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Shiba Inu bottoms as whales withdraw billions and burn rate skyrockets,https://invezz.com/news/2025/02/17/shiba-inu-bottoms-as-whale-withdrawals-billions-and-burn-rate-skyrockets/,"Shiba Inu has flashed a bullish signal after a price correction that has lasted since December 5, 2025, with the cryptocurrency showing signs of recovery and potential growth. Notably, the Shiba Inu has been abuzz with activity, particularly following significant whale movements and an unprecedented spike in the token’s burn rate. These events suggest that SHIB might be setting the stage for a notable price breakout. Whale withdrawals 144.29B SHIB tokens In a recent development that caught the eye of many in the crypto community, a mysterious transfer activity was noted involving Shiba Inu. A wallet with the address “0xB768” withdrew a colossal 144.294 billion SHIB tokens, valued at about $2.39583 million, from the leading US digital assets exchange, Coinbase. Source: Arkham This transfer was significant in volume and because the wallet was newly created, never used before, which often hints at strategic moves by large investors or ‘whales’. The immediate climb of this wallet to the top spot for SHIB inflows within the last 24 hours further fueled speculation and interest. While some view such large withdrawals as accumulation by big players, others consider them routine exchange operations. However, the market reacted positively, with SHIB’s price rising, although not directly attributable to this single event, it’s currently trading at $0.00001676, up by 10% over the last week. Shiba Inu burn rate skyrockets by 2000% Adding to the optimistic outlook, the Shiba Inu burn rate has seen a dramatic increase of 2000% on February 14, with 410,744,432,366,375 tokens removed from circulation since the token burn started, according to data from Shibburn . This surge isn’t just a one-off; over the past week, 58.28 million tokens have been burned, and this month alone, the figure stands at 98.85 million. Such aggressive burning reduces the supply, which, under the basic economic principle of supply and demand, can elevate the price if demand stays constant or grows. The community’s active participation in burning tokens is a testament to the strong engagement and dedication towards enhancing the token’s value, bringing the total supply down to 589.25 trillion tokens, with a staggering 410.7 trillion tokens permanently removed. Shiba Inu (SHIB) technical analysis From a technical standpoint, SHIB has broken out of a descending trend line, suggesting that buyers are stepping in at crucial support levels. SHIB’s price has already crossed above the 9-day Moving Average (MA), demonstrating short-term bullish momentum. It is now testing the 21-day MA, a critical threshold. If SHIB manages to close above the 21-day MA, we could be in for a major bullish trend, signaling a stronger conviction among investors and potentially attracting more capital into the token. Shiba Inu price chart by TradingView Furthermore, the upcoming intersection of the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) might validate an upward trend, directing prices toward essential resistance levels. With the MACD showing a bullish crossover, indicating weaker bearish momentum, the technical indicators collectively suggest that Shiba Inu is demonstrating potential signs of recovery. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also moved into bullish territory, currently sitting slightly above 44 after recovering from an oversold region. This shift in RSI indicates that the selling pressure has eased, and buying interest is rising. Shiba Inu team working to enhance its utility During these developments, Shiba Inu’s leadership has proactively steering the project towards long-term sustainability. Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer, recently teased significant updates for the SHIB Metaverse during a discussion at “Bill It Up” with Cypher Capital co-founder Bill Qian. Kusama highlighted that Shiba Inu is not merely riding the wave of meme coin trends but is instead building a robust ecosystem with tangible applications. Among the notable developments for the ecosystem include the introduction of the TREAT token and further SHIB Metaverse developments aimed at providing real utility, moving beyond the speculative nature of meme coins. The confluence of large whale withdrawals, a skyrocketing burn rate, positive technical indicators, and strategic community and developer efforts paints a promising picture for Shiba Inu. While the crypto market is inherently volatile, these factors combined suggest that SHIB might be on the cusp of a significant price movement.

The decentralized lending platform, currently in the opening phase of its presale, has already raised $465,878.05 from 710 holders, with its token priced at $0.01. Early investors stand to secure a guaranteed 600% return when MUTM launches at $0.06, while experts forecast a 100x surge to $1. As Solana’s 2021 breakout demonstrated, early recognition of utility-driven projects can unlock generational gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now mirrors that trajectory, combining DeFi innovation with aggressive tokenomics designed to fuel demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Bridges Gaps in Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates as a decentralized protocol enabling users to lend and borrow digital assets through two markets: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). The P2C model allows suppliers to deposit tokens like USDT into liquidity pools, earning variable interest rates tied to borrowing demand. A $10,000 deposit, for instance, could generate $800 annually at an 8% yield. Borrowers, meanwhile, collateralize assets such as ETH to access liquidity without selling holdings, preserving exposure to potential price gains. The P2P market facilitates direct agreements between users, bypassing liquidity pools entirely. Both markets prioritize security, with smart contracts audited by third-party firms to minimize risks. Unlike platforms requiring locked assets or rigid terms, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emphasizes flexibility, letting users set borrowing durations and rates independently. Presale Momentum Builds as Investors Chase 600% Returns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has ignited fervor in its opening presale phase, selling tokens at $0.01 before a scheduled rise to $0.06 upon launch. This structure guarantees a 6x profit for early participants. Over $465,000 has been committed in just days, reflecting confidence in the project’s roadmap. Phase 1 offers the lowest entry price, but slots are dwindling rapidly. Subsequent phases will incrementally hike the token cost, rewarding early adopters with the steepest gains. Investors allocating $1000 today could see their holdings balloon to $7000 at launch, while the projected 12500% growth could deliver $126,000. Tokenomics Fuel Scarcity and Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) employs a buy-and-distribute mechanism to sustain price growth post-launch. A portion of platform fees will automatically purchase MUTM tokens from open markets, redistributing them to stakers. This creates recurring buy pressure, systematically reducing supply as adoption climbs. Additionally, the platform plans to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin, further integrating utility into its ecosystem. Backed by on-chain reserves, this stablecoin will offer borrowing stability while incentivizing users to engage with MUTM for governance and rewards. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will debut a beta version of its lending platform alongside its exchange listing, ensuring immediate utility for token holders. Real-time functionality is critical. Solana’s 2021 ascent coincided with its capacity to onboard developers and users swiftly, a strategy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is replicating. To accelerate momentum, the team has announced a $100,000 giveaway split among 10 participants. Eligibility requires simple social media engagement, a tactic already swelling community channels. Act Now or Regret Later Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well engineered to merge DeFi utility with investor incentives. The presale’s guaranteed returns, paired with a $1 price target, offer a dual-layered opportunity: short-term profits at launch and long-term wealth generation. Time is slipping away for investors to secure MUTM at $0.01. Phase 1 is advancing swiftly, and each passed hour narrows the window for maximum gains. With Phase 1 nearing its cap, delaying action could mean paying 20% more in Phase 2. The same market forces that propelled Solana to triple-digit growth are aligning for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Missing this entry point risks forfeiting one of 2025’s most explosive opportunities.

Analysts suggest SOL may hit $520 by 2025, driven by increasing liquidity and developer activity. Simultaneously, LINK’s price movements are gaining attention, as whale transactions hit their highest level in over a year, sparking renewed interest. The BlockDAG (BDAG) presale is also making headlines, with funding surging past $195 million and over 18.4 billion coins already sold. The network’s 5% USDT cashback incentive is fueling excitement, pushing it closer to a remarkable $600 million milestone. Many experts now recognize BDAG as one of the top bullish cryptos, thanks to its explosive presale growth. Will Solana’s Price Surge to $520? Analysts Weigh In Crypto analyst VanEck has forecasted a major Solana price surge, projecting a potential price of $520 by 2025. Factors influencing this prediction include an expected increase in M2 money supply from $21.5 trillion to $22.3 trillion, which could benefit risk assets like SOL. Additional liquidity often leads to increased investments in smart contract platforms. Experts also highlight the rising volume of decentralized exchanges, higher revenues, and a surge in active users as key contributors to Solana’s potential climb. Market chatter surrounding a possible Solana ETF approval is further fueling speculation about its upward movement. Chainlink’s Price Trends See Major Whale Activity Recent data indicates a major shift in Chainlink’s price trends, with whale activity reaching peak levels. On-chain reports show 1,659 daily transactions surpassing $100,000, the highest figure recorded since late 2023. This trend suggests significant accumulation, especially within the consolidation range of $15.88 to $22.76. With active wallet addresses rising, analysts predict LINK could rebound, setting price targets around $32. Despite a 20% dip in value, heavy whale transactions typically signal preparation for a potential bullish reversal. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, anticipating the next breakout. BlockDAG’s 5% USDT Cashback—Why Everyone’s Jumping In BlockDAG’s presale has become the hottest crypto opportunity, drawing massive interest due to its 5% USDT cashback offer. Early investors are already seeing a staggering 2,380% gain, while new buyers scramble to secure their share before the next price jump. Currently, BDAG is priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, with total funding soaring past $195 million. A major driving force behind this surge is BlockDAG’s viral Affiliate Program, which rewards both referrers and buyers with 5% USDT cashback on every purchase made via a referral link. The process is seamless—generate a link, share it, and receive instant rewards once a transaction is completed. This aggressive incentive has pushed presale demand through the roof, accelerating BlockDAG’s race toward its $600 million milestone. Previous discount tiers sold out rapidly, and with Batch 27 following the same pattern, FOMO is kicking in for those who missed earlier buying opportunities. The affiliate-driven excitement is spreading across social media, drawing in both crypto veterans and newcomers. As BDAG’s price increases with each batch, those looking for early-stage gains are locking in purchases now rather than waiting. Many traders now rank BDAG among the top bullish cryptos, recognizing its strong momentum and rewarding cashback model. Don’t Miss Out—BlockDAG’s Next Phase is Just Around the Corner! Crypto enthusiasts are keeping close tabs on Solana’s price surge potential, Chainlink’s shifting price trends, and BlockDAG’s fast-selling presale. With SOL projected to climb to $520 and LINK showing strong whale activity, both assets remain in the spotlight. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s presale continues to gain traction, racing toward its $600 million target. The 5% USDT cashback incentive is fueling rapid referrals, with both new and existing investors capitalizing on the opportunity. As BDAG’s price climbs with each new batch, those looking to maximize profits aren’t hesitating. For anyone seeking early-stage crypto gains, BlockDAG’s presale presents a golden opportunity. With every purchase earning cashback and the token’s price steadily increasing, now is the time to secure a position before the next surge.

It has erased some of the gains made in 2024 as the crypto fear and greed index has moved to the fear zone. This article provides an unbiased DOGE forecast and assesses whether it can stage a strong comeback and hit $1 soon. Why Dogecoin price crashed The Dogecoin price has collapsed this year for three main reasons. First, the price action is mostly due to Bitcoin remaining in a tight range in the past few months. It has remained inside the support and resistance levels of $90,000 and $109,000. Bitcoin usually sets the tone in the crypto industry, and when it falls or stagnates, investors dump other tokens. Second, Dogecoin price has dropped as investors sell the news. The coin jumped ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. In most cases, assets rise ahead of a major news event and then fall when the news event happens. Trump’s inauguration was important for the Dogecoin price because he appointed Elon Musk to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk has already become the most powerful individual in the government today. Third, DOGE price has retreated because of the falling greed in the crypto market. The closely watched fear and greed index has dropped to the fear zone of 39. A move from the extreme greed zone of 88 in 2024 to 39 is a sign that investors will remain in the sideline. DOGE price chart | Source: TradingView Elliot Wave points to a DOGE price rebound The weekly chart shows that the DOGE price has remained under pressure in the past few weeks. It has dropped from a high of $0.4832 in December to a low of $0.20. This decline was notable because the coin retested the key support level at $0.22278, the highest swing in March last year. This situation is known as a break and retest pattern and is a popular sign of continuation. Further, the decline is part of the second phase of the Elliot Wave performance. For starters, Elliot Wave has five phases, with the first one being bullish and the second one being a retracement. The first phase started in September last year, while the second one is underway. The third phase is usually the longest, and in Dogecoin’s case, it will likely end at an all-time high of $0.7600. It will then retreat and retest the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. Finally, the coin will jump to the resistance at $1, up by 276% from the current level. The main caveat is that this analysis uses the weekly chart, where patterns take time to form. For example, the second wave has taken over two months to form. Therefore, the Dogecoin price eventual surge to $1 will likely take more time to form. The bullish outlook will become invalid if the Dogecoin price crashes below the key support at $0.0835, its lowest level in July last year. Other catalysts for Dogecoin There are other catalysts that may push the Dogecoin price higher in the long term. First, the ongoing retracement is part of the coin’s recovery. While the DOGE price’s 53% crash is a steep one, it is smaller than the 63% crash that happened last year when it dropped from $0.278 to $0.0834. Second, there are rising odds that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot DOGE ETF this year. While DOGE is a meme coin, it is similar to Bitcoin since it is a proof-of-work token that the SEC sees as a digital commodity. Further, Dogecoin price will be boosted by the eventual Bitcoin price rebound. Bitcoin has formed the bullish flag chart pattern, a popular continuation sign.

In every cycle, a select few early investors secure massive gains, while many others are left wishing they had acted sooner. Right now, the market is gaining momentum, with Bitcoin hitting new highs and altcoins surging.

Analysts foresee a price increase to $0.25 by the end of the presale, yielding a 240.64% return. Following the mainnet launch in Q2 2025, $TICS could soar to $1 (1262.56% ROI), $5 (6712.83% ROI), or even $10–$15, potentially reaching a 20,338.49% return.

Chainlink: The One That Got Away Chainlink, often dubbed the “silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold,” has been a stalwart in the cryptocurrency arena since its inception in 2011. Created by Charlie Lee, a former Google engineer, Chainlink was designed to improve upon Bitcoin’s framework, offering faster transaction times and a different hashing algorithm. As of now, Chainlink is trading at $127.66, reflecting a bullish sentiment in the market. Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network enables smart contracts on various blockchain platforms to securely interact with real-world data. This innovation has positioned Chainlink as a leader in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.

The third largest cryptocurrency hit a high of $2.80 before reversing back. XRP’s price action in the coming sessions will be shaped by key support and resistance levels. As for Bitcoin, the price is trading below important resistance levels, failing to establish a clear trend. Bitcoin is currently trading at $96,500 and is down by more than 2% in the last 24 hours. Possible Bullish Scenarios If XRP breaks above $2.79 to $2.80, the next upside targets could be $2.96 and $3.30. A strong breakout could push the price further toward $4.19 or even $5. However, until the market sees a clear breakout above the resistance levels, there’s always a possibility for further consolidation. What’s Next for XRP? If the price breaks out decisively above the current resistance, it could head towards new highs. But be aware of potential pullbacks into support areas. Analysts are eyeing levels around $2.80 for a breakout, with the ultimate target being the all-time high of $3.40. Current Trend Overview The price saw a strong rally in November, breaking above the 2021 high of $1.96. After reaching a high of $2.90 in early December, it entered a corrective sideways pattern. The market has been volatile, but the range remains quite large. However, the price found support around $1.95 in early February, and this level could act as a key point for future price movements. Key Support Levels (mid-term) The support range for XRP is between $1.96 and $2.35. A rally from the low around February 3rd is currently in play, but some experts believe the price may still see another dip into the support area before a major breakout.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-17 02:31:16

Its recent 100% price surge after getting listed on OKX has sparked talks about a possible Binance listing. But there is no official confirmation from Binance or the Pi Core Team raising a big question—will Binance list Pi, or is it just another overhyped rumor? The Hype vs. Reality of Pi Coin Pi Network is different from traditional cryptocurrencies because it allows mining through smartphones, making it more accessible. While the project has attracted over 100 million users, its path to becoming a fully tradable asset remains unclear. Some argue that Pi Coin was never meant for speculation but rather for real-world utility through a barter system. If it sticks to this model without exchange listings, its adoption could grow slowly but steadily. But if major exchanges list it, the price could surge rapidly, attracting more investors. However, without a strong use case, it could face the same fate as previous overhyped projects Berachain, Hamster, etc that collapsed once the initial hype faded . Meanwhile, Pi Network’s growing popularity on X has overtaken Ethereum and XRP, making it one of the top 5 most followed cryptocurrencies worldwide. But despite this, no major exchange has fully backed it yet.

So far, Bybit has ruled it out, HTX removed its Pi/USDT pair, and Bitget deleted multiple Pi-related posts. This shows that big exchanges are hesitant to list Pi due to concerns about its legitimacy. Another issue is China’s scrutiny of Pi Network, where has been called a pyramid scheme by some . Binance is careful about its listings, and unless Pi proves to be fully launched and legitimate, Binance may not take the risk. Is Pi’s Price Rally Sustainable? Speculation places Pi Coin’s 2025 price between $93 and $220, with an average estimate of $141. But as of now, Pi is trading around $72 after a 10% drop, raising doubts about whether its rally is sustainable.

Technology entrepreneur Jason Calacanis weighed in, taking to X (formerly Twitter) to assert that XRP is a “centrally controlled security.” In his post, Calacanis questioned the legitimacy of XRP as a decentralized asset, stating, “If the SEC allows it to trade like Bitcoin, then securities law will be worthless.” He warned that allowing XRP to operate like Bitcoin could create chaos in the markets, with potential for startups and funds to offload large amounts of coins on retail investors, causing instability. Calacanis also argued that such chaos would not benefit the U.S., as the country is known for its stable and controlled markets, which attract global investments. He suggested that if XRP could only be traded by individuals who pass an “sophisticated investor test,” it would ensure that people are educated about the risks before investing too much into projects like XRP. However, Calacanis’ comments have sparked criticism from various corners of the crypto world. John Deaton, the founder of Crypto Law, responded with a rebuttal, sharing a document that argued XRP, as a digital token, does not meet the legal requirements to be classified as an investment contract under the Howey Test. Deaton said that XRP is not a “contract transaction or scheme,” countering Calacanis’ view that XRP is a centrally controlled security. https://twitter.com/CryptoLawUS/status/1891280912626659526 Another user pointed out and wrote, “Trump doesn’t care about investor protections – look at his approach to CFPB and other depts that lookout for these issues.

With tech giants investing billions into AI research, savvy investors are hunting for the next big crypto breakthrough that fuses cutting-edge AI with blockchain’s unmatched security and transparency. Enter Lightchain AI —a rising star in the AI-blockchain world that’s already turning heads. Currently in Stage 14 of its presale at just $0.006 per token, this fast-growing ecosystem has raised a staggering $15.9 million so far, proving the massive demand for AI-driven blockchain solutions. As AI adoption continues to surge, Lightchain AI could be poised to redefine the blockchain landscape—and deliver exponential returns for early investors. Don’t miss your chance to get in on what could be one of the decade’s most transformative projects! Why AI is the Future of Blockchain Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a system that enables computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and more. With the rapid advancements in technology and growing amounts of data being generated, AI is becoming increasingly relevant and valuable in various industries. And when combined with blockchain technology, AI can become even more powerful. Blockchain provides a secure and transparent platform for storing and sharing data, making it an ideal partner for AI algorithms. As the amount of data continues to grow, so does the need for efficient processing and analysis—something that Lightchain AI aims to provide through its unique blend of AI and blockchain. By leveraging the strengths of both technologies, Lightchain AI is creating a decentralized ecosystem that can handle massive amounts of data and deliver real-time results. Why Lightchain AI Could Be the Smartest Bet of the Decade AI is transforming industries, but most AI models are still centralized, opaque, and controlled by just a few big corporations. That’s where Lightchain AI comes in—it’s changing the game with a decentralized AI ecosystem that puts data privacy, security, and fairness first. Traditional AI companies control user data, which can lead to bias, ethical concerns, and security risks. Lightchain AI takes a different approach, ensuring AI models and decision-making processes are transparent and community-governed. This decentralized approach makes it a standout innovation in the AI and blockchain space. What really sets Lightchain AI apart is its focus on privacy-preserving AI computations. Using advanced cryptographic techniques, it keeps AI operations secure and tamper-proof. As industries like finance, healthcare, and enterprise automation embrace AI-driven blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI is perfectly positioned to lead the charge. Early Investors Are Betting Big—Should You? With Lightchain AI’s presale nearing completion, investors are taking early positions before the token launches on exchanges. Given the growing demand for AI-integrated blockchain projects, Lightchain AI could see a massive price surge as adoption increases. Early adopters of top-tier AI and blockchain projects have historically seen huge gains, and Lightchain AI’s trajectory suggests that it could follow a similar path. For those looking to get ahead of the AI revolution, Lightchain AI may be the smartest bet of the decade—offering a rare opportunity for massive long-term returns in one of the fastest-growing sectors in tech. With its unique blend of AI and blockchain, Lightchain AI is a project to watch closely. It could be the key to unlocking the full potential of decentralized intelligence and revolutionizing industries across the board.

While Dogecoin and Cardano endure uncertain market conditions, Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce approach is gaining traction. Distinct from meme-dependent assets or networks with scaling issues, Web3Bay provides practical value through a well-planned presale aimed at sustainable growth. The cryptocurrency market is rapidly changing, driving investors toward projects backed by solid fundamentals and practical uses. Web3Bay’s model, which cuts out middlemen and boosts user autonomy, introduces a fresh approach to blockchain commerce. As major investors search for the next big thing and confidence in Web3Bay’s novel model rises, could this be the project with the highest investment promise in 2025? Web3Bay Presale: Huge ROI For Early Investors! Web3Bay is quickly becoming a hot topic in the cryptocurrency presale arena. Now in Stage 4, the platform has garnered over $1.20 million, with sales of more than 295 million 3BAY tokens at $0.004562625 each. Investors are gravitating towards Web3Bay as the structured 28-stage presale methodically raises token value, securing a low entry price for early supporters. Beyond the presale, Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce platform cuts out middlemen, reducing transaction costs and providing a more economical option for buyers and sellers. Token owners will also play a vital role in governance, shaping platform policies and updates. This distinctive approach not only strengthens investor trust but also solidifies Web3Bay’s position as a high-potential project this year. Furthermore, Web3Bay plans to support multiple currencies, allowing transactions in various cryptocurrencies and conventional payment methods. This dual approach broadens accessibility for both cryptocurrency aficionados and regular e-commerce shoppers, enhancing Web3Bay’s prospects for widespread adoption. As blockchain marketplaces become more prevalent, Web3Bay is poised to lead this shift, positioning it as a top project to watch in 2025. Dogecoin: Gaining Institutional Eyes Amid High Volatility Dogecoin has always been popular among individual investors, often boosted by social media and celebrity support. Recently, its price dropped by 25%, now at about $0.256. The new Grayscale Dogecoin Trust could bring in institutional investors, potentially stabilizing its future. Yet, Dogecoin is still mostly a speculative investment with limited use beyond basic transactions. Although some businesses accept DOGE, its dependence on popularity and hype marks it as risky. In contrast, Web3Bay offers a systematic strategy and practical applications, making Dogecoin’s appeal for stable, long-term investment uncertain. Additionally, Dogecoin’s inflationary model, which adds millions of new coins daily, raises doubts about its long-term value preservation. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin’s continual issuance could hinder its price growth. Cardano: Will Development Gains Reflect in Its Price? Cardano continues to advance its blockchain technology, introducing Hydra to speed up transactions. However, ADA’s price has been flat, struggling to overcome significant resistance. Investor patience is thinning over Cardano’s slow price movement, with many looking to faster-growing options like Web3Bay, which has a direct profitability plan through its presale stages. Web3Bay’s current traction suggests it may offer better investment returns than ADA’s unpredictable price movements. Cardano also faces slow smart contract integration. Despite launching contracts with the Alonzo update, adoption lags behind competitors like Ethereum and Solana, prompting some developers to switch to more robust platforms. Cardano must quicken its adoption and practical uses to stay competitive. The Bottom Line As Dogecoin deals with fluctuations and Cardano’s growth stumbles, Web3Bay’s crypto presale pulls investors with a projected 6,430% ROI. Its decentralized commerce system, governance focus, and organized presale stage present a strong alternative in the crypto field. Web3Bay’s mix of crypto payments, lower fees, and user-driven governance highlights its market distinction. Facing Dogecoin’s inflation issues and Cardano’s slow uptake, Web3Bay offers innovative solutions with tangible benefits, positioning it as a promising option for those seeking sustainable growth and practicality in their investments.

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2.

While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has.

Technical indicators suggest bulls could trigger an early recovery phase. Litecoin (LTC) Tumbles 5% as Traders Book Profits on Altcoin ETF Hype Litecoin (LTC) was among last week’s top-performing assets, but a sell-the-news event has triggered a notable pullback. While inflation concerns capped gains in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum (ETH), which hovered around $97,000 and $2,700 respectively, Litecoin rode bullish sentiment as the U.S. SEC acknowledged fresh ETF filings for DOGE and XRP by Grayscale and 21Shares. Litecoin Price Action (LTCUSDT) LTC price soared to a 30-day peak of $137 on February 13 before retreating sharply to $126.4 at press time, marking a 5.7% decline within 24 hours. This decline aligns with a classic profit-booking scenario, where traders cash in on gains following a major announcement. However, with no deterioration in network fundamentals or major negative press, bullish investors could take advantage of this correction. If LTC stabilizes above $120, new entrants may seize the dip, mitigating further downside risks and setting the stage for a rebound. Litecoin Whale Demand Surges After SEC Acknowledged DOGE and XRP Filings Beyond short-term volatility, Litecoin’s whale accumulation patterns suggest a potential price recovery. A key metric reinforcing this view is IntoTheBlock ‘s Average Transaction Size, which tracks the average dollar value of transactions on the Litecoin network, providing insight into whale activity. Litecoin Average Transaction Size | LTCUSDT Data from IntoTheBlock shows that on February 8, LTC’s average transaction size fell to a monthly low of $45,190. However, following the SEC’s acknowledgment of DOGE and XRP ETF applications, this figure rebounded to $54,000 as of February 15. This increase suggests that deep-pocketed investors are accumulating LTC despite recent price declines. Whale accumulation typically signals confidence in long-term price appreciation. As more institutional players enter the altcoin space due to ETF speculation, LTC could benefit from heightened liquidity and a renewed uptrend. Litecoin (LTC) Price Forecast: Bullish Momentum Alive if $120 Support Holds Litecoin price forecast indicates that the $120 support level will be critical in determining the next move. If LTC maintains this level, bullish momentum could resume, potentially retesting $130 in the coming days. A successful breakout above this resistance may pave the way for another attempt at $137, the recent high. Litecoin Price Forecast Technical indicators paint a mixed picture. The MACD histogram has flipped into negative territory, suggesting slowing momentum, but the declining selling pressure could allow for a swift recovery. Additionally, Keltner Channel analysis shows LTC consolidating within a tightening range, a potential precursor to volatility expansion. If bears breach $120, LTC could drop to the next key support at $117, where buyers may step in again. However, if whales continue accumulating, the path of least resistance remains upward, reinforcing the bullish outlook.

Lummis, who represents Wyoming in the U.S. Senate, believes that a Bitcoin reserve could be audited 24/7 with just a basic computer, offering transparency and stability for the U.S. financial system. According to Bitcoin Magazine, she said, “A bitcoin reserve could be audited any time 24/7 with a basic computer. It’s time to upgrade our reserves.” As the new chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Senator Lummis is pushing for legislative changes to integrate Bitcoin into U.S. economic policy. She has consistently advocated for regulatory clarity and Bitcoin-friendly policies. In a recent discussion, Lummis also opened up about the growing interest in Bitcoin reserves, not just within the U.S., but also from other countries like the United Arab Emirates. Lummis shared that states like Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin are already considering creating their own strategic Bitcoin reserves, signaling a trend that could eventually influence federal policy. She said that states often act as incubators for innovation, and that a state-level Bitcoin reserve could serve as a model for broader adoption. Lummis Leads Charge for Bitcoin Integration As part of her advocacy, Lummis will be discussing the role of Bitcoin in U.S. reserves and its potential to stabilize the nation’s finances at Bitcoin 2025, a key event for the cryptocurrency community. She encouraged Bitcoin supporters to engage with lawmakers and work towards making a state the first to adopt a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Senator Lummis remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, seeing it as an asset that could help reduce the U.S. national debt and provide a hedge against inflation. She envisions Bitcoin playing a crucial role in protecting the U.S. dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-17 03:33:27

Some investors are now turning to Propichain, a new real estate investing ecosystem that has raised over $2 million from its ongoing presale. Read on to see why experts are confident that Propichain will offer better returns than XRP. Can XRP and Dogecoin Recover in Q1 2025? The altcoin sector has been heavily impacted by the recent market decline, causing sharp losses for XRP and Dogecoin . Both XRP and Dogecoin surged to 2-year highs in late 2024. Their rise was fueled by excitement over Donald Trump’s electoral victory and the broader market optimism that followed. Investors expected both tokens to maintain their bullish performance. However, February came with unpleasant surprises. For XRP, it has fallen by over 20% from its current value of $2.43. Dogecoin has also dropped by 24.2%, now selling at $0.259. With uncertainty gripping XRP and Dogecoin, many investors are looking for alternative assets with stronger stability and profit potential. One project that has gained attention is Propichain, a real estate investing powerhouse that leverages artificial intelligence to uncover high-return opportunities for traders. Propichain (PCHAIN): Real Estate Investing, Reinvented The game of real estate investing has always been exclusive to investors with huge capital and years of experience. However, Propichain (PCHAIN) is flipping the script by using artificial intelligence to offer a faster, smarter, and more inclusive way to build wealth in the housing sector. With blockchain-powered tokenization and AI-driven insights, PCHAIN is turning real estate into a dynamic, accessible asset class for everyone, regardless of their experience levels. Propichain’s transformation of the housing sector starts with lower investing costs, which is based on its fractional ownership model. This platform tokenizes housing properties, breaking them into smaller, more affordable shares, enabling investors with lower budgets to participate in the housing market. Picture a $5 million residential complex becoming 5,000 tokens at $1,000 each. Investors can buy shares in this complex according to the size of the budget, a feature that is largely unavailable in the traditional real estate sector. With these fractional tokens, investors can earn passive income from rental and leasing without the headaches of property management. By tokenizing real estate assets, Propichain is democratizing access to the profits within the housing sector. Not only does Propichain lower the barriers to entry, but it also empowers investors with cutting-edge AI tools to optimize their real estate strategies. Propichain’s AI tools crunch data on rental yields, economic trends, and demographic shifts, highlighting opportunities for amplifying returns. For example, it might detect a surge in demand for co-living spaces in urban areas, notifying you so you can capitalize on the opportunity ahead of other investors. Propichain’s AI tools are great for navigating the housing sector as they offer a personalized experience for both beginners and expert investors. These tools come with customizable search filters that give you more autonomy over your investing experience. Rather than going through a list of random options, you can use factors like rental income growth or capital appreciation to tailor your searches. This way, you find opportunities in line with your investing goals. Traders can also enjoy higher efficiency thanks to the automated trading function that comes with Propichain’s AI tools. This can help reduce the time you spend trading while closing deals on your behalf, using instructions set by you. Propichain complements its AI-backed trading features with metaverse tours that connect traders to global investing opportunities. It uses immersive VR tours to bridge worldwide housing markets, allowing traders in Canada to inspect beachfront villas in Bali, collaborate with local agents, and finalize deals—all from the comfort of their living room. In addition to property tours, these immersive experiences allow investors to connect with global stakeholders in real-time. As Propichain expands access to real estate investing, security remains a top priority. By leveraging BlockAudit-certified smart contracts, the platform ensures seamless and fraud-proof transactions, automating key processes like lease agreements and rent payments. Top Altcoins for 2025: Why Investors Pick Propichain Over XRP Market analysts recognize Propichain’s innovative AI integration as a game-changer in real estate investing, positioning it as a strong competitor to traditional crypto assets like XRP. Furthermore, Propichain’s recent CoinMarketCap listing has also increased excitement around its ongoing presale, which has now sold over $2 million worth of tokens. PCHAIN is now in stage 2 of its presale, selling at $0.011. By the next stage, its value will grow to $0.023. It will keep rising until it reaches its official launch price of $0.032 listing. Additionally, investors have projected a 10,000x increase that could take $1,000 worth of PCHAIN today to over $120,000 by the start of 2026. With early investors already securing their positions, now is the time to act. Don’t miss out—join Propichain’s presale today!

40436911,https://invezz.com/?p=2569257,1739764920,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,I’d avoid Blackrock’s IBIT ETF and buy this Bitcoin fund instead,https://invezz.com/news/2025/02/17/id-avoid-blackrocks-ibit-etf-and-buy-this-bitcoin-fund-instead/,"The iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has done well and broken records in the financial services industry as its assets surged to over $54 billion. This is a great performance since the popular SPDR Gold ETF (GLD), which was started in 2004 has accumulated $80 billion in assets. That is a sign that IBIT will eventually pass GLD in the coming years. This article explains why the IBIT ETF may surge, and why there is a better alternative to buy. The bullish case for the IBIT ETF The IBIT ETF has done well, and there are chances that it will soon have a strong bullish breakout. First, Bitcoin will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the long term. While history is not the best predictor of an asset, we can use historical data to predict what it will do in the future. Bitcoin was started in 2009 and was trading below $1 at the time. It then surged to a record high of $109,200 earlier this year. Bitcoin’s surge to $109,000 was not linear. Instead, it faced major crashes in the last 16 years. For example, Bitcoin’s price peaked at $68,500 in 2021 and crashed by 76% by December 2021, as FTX, Celsius, and Terra crashed. It also crashed by 85% between December 2017 and December 2018. Most recently, it soared to a high of $73,756 in March 2024 and then retreated to $49,325 in July. In all this time, Bitcoin has managed to beat odds and stage a strong comeback. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the coin will emerge from the current consolidation and rebound. Bitcoin supply and demand dynamics Second, Bitcoin has one of the best demand and supply dynamics in the financial industry. It has a supply limit of 21 million of which 19.8 million coins have been mined. This means that there are just 1.2 million coins that will ever be mined, a situation that will take time to happen since mining difficulty is rising. Remember, Bitcoin goes through a halving period every four years that reduces the block rewards by half. As such, there is a likelihood that the 21 million coins will never be mined as the difficulty will keep rising. Bitcoin demand is also soaring. For example, the IBIT ETF has already accumulated $54 billion worth of coins, while all ETFs have over $140 billion in assets. As such, a combination of falling supply and rising demand means that Bitcoin price will keep surging. Bitcoin price has strong technicals The other bullish case for the IBIT ETF is that Bitcoin price has formed a bullish flag and a cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart. A bullish flag has a long vertical line and a rectangle pattern, and in most cases, it leads to more gains. A C&H pattern, on the other hand, has a rounded bottom and a handle section. In this case, a strong bullish breakout will see Bitcoin price surge to $123,000 in the near term. Bitcoin price technical chart | Source: TradingView IBIT ETF is good, but there’s a good alternative While the IBIT ETF is a good fund to buy, it is not the best. Instead, we believe that the Grayscale Mini Bitcoin ETF (BTC) is the best one to buy. It is a highly liquid fund with over $4.1 billion in assets under management, making it the fifth-biggest fund to invest in. It beats the IBIT ETF because of its lower fees. It has an expense ratio of 0.15%, lower than IBIT’s 0.25%, giving it a 10 basis point spread. Therefore, since these are similar funds, why would one pay a higher fee? For example, a $100,000 investment in IBIT will cost you $250 a year, while BTC will cost you $150. Besides, IBIT and BTC share a similar custodian: Coinbase.

The price is showing positive signs and might gain bullish momentum above $2.750. XRP price started a decent upward move above the $2.60 zone. The price is now trading above $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.680 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.750 resistance zone. XRP Price Rally Loses Steam XRP price managed to stay above the $2.50 support and remained in a positive zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . A base was formed, and the price started a decent upward move above the $2.55 and $2.65 levels. The price surpassed the first key barrier at $2.750. It tested the next hurdle at $2.840. A high was formed at $2.8322 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor move below $2.75. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.330 swing low to the $2.8322 high. The current price action is positive. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.680 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.750 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.80 level. The next resistance is $2.840. A clear move above the $2.840 resistance might send the price toward the $2.920 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.0 resistance or even $3.050 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.120. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.750 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.680 level or the trend line. The next major support is near the $2.60 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.330 swing low to the $2.8322 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.60 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.550 support. The next major support sits near the $2.50 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.680 and $2.60.

Ripple now stands out as major news in crypto, and many believe Ripple may soon find use in new markets. Ripple remains a hot topic as experts discuss its future use by the Bank of Japan. At the same time, a new token is showing strong returns and practical solutions. Many call it one of the best cryptos to buy, with a low current DeFi coin price that attracts new investors. Recent updates bring fresh hope to those who want a token that solves real payment problems. Ripple: Surging After SEC ETF Acknowledgement Recent reports show that Ripple has racked up gains after the SEC acknowledged an ETF proposal. Ripple has caught the attention of many financial institutions and traders. News from Nasdaq states that several banks in Japan may soon start using Ripple. This new interest could push Ripple to even higher value. Analysts predict that if more banks join the network, the use of Ripple will grow fast. This shift may help Ripple overcome past hurdles. The idea is that a global financial giant like the Bank of Japan could soon rely on Ripple to cut transaction times and lower fees. Such news makes Ripple one of the best cryptos to buy for those who believe in strong payment systems. The current Ripple price movement shows strong potential for future growth, drawing interest from both retail and large investors. The proposal from regulators and the attention from banks signal a change. Ripple’s role in facilitating fast international transfers remains its key strength. Many banks aim to cut costs and speed up payments. Ripple fits this need by allowing quick transfers at a low cost. Conversely, other analysts believe that XRP will dip within the next few weeks before it recovers. Conversely says that the price of XRP is likely to drop by -3.68% and reach $ 2.67 by March 18. After that, a rally is said to be on the horizon. Remittix: A New DeFi Project Solving Real Payment Problems Remittix is a new token that shows how crypto can fix real-world issues. It brings a fresh method to handle cross-border payments. Remittix offers a system known as PayFi that connects digital assets with traditional banking. Instead of the old, slow ways, Remittix allows users to send money fast and at low cost. This system gives people a way to keep control over their own money while still enjoying modern banking benefits. Imagine someone without a bank account who keeps crypto in a digital wallet.

The current DeFi coin price for Remittix sits at around $0.0599. Early buyers have seen returns above 200%. Some experts predict that Remittix could even go 10x or 50x if the market stays good. Such potential makes Remittix one of the best cryptos to buy for long-term growth. The system Remittix offers does more than just lower fees. It lets users keep the true nature of cryptography. People maintain anonymity and full control over their funds. Yet, the token ties this privacy to modern finance. It brings the benefits of digital money to everyday transactions. When users send money, they get the speed and privacy of crypto along with the trust of traditional banking. Many people around the world struggle with expensive and slow international transfers. Remittix addresses these pain points. It cuts down the extra steps that add cost and delay. With Remittix, individuals can send funds quickly and receive cash for day-to-day living. This practical solution helps those in remote areas or places with limited bank access. Remittix is a tool that brings digital finance closer to the needs of everyday life. Investors see Remittix as a clear answer to real problems. Its design aims to bring control back to the user. In doing so, Remittix may drive broader crypto adoption.

As a result, the stock price surged more than 8% today moving back to 6,500 JPY levels once again. Since the beginning of 2025, the stock has already appreciated more than 78% as of today. Metaplanet Clocks a BTC Yield of 15.3% in 2025 Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich stated that the latest Bitcoin purchase comes at an average price of $97,481 per BTC. Additionally, the company also reported a year-to-date BTC yield of 15.3% in 2025. As of February 17, 2025, the firm holds a total of 2,031.41 BTC, acquired for a cumulative investment of roughly $163.3 million at an average cost of $80,394 per Bitcoin , as per the company disclosure. The company’s BTC Yield, which measures Bitcoin holdings relative to fully diluted shares, reached 309.8% in Q4 2024 and 15.3% in early 2025. Metaplanet funded this Bitcoin purchase through a JPY 4 billion zero-coupon bond issuance to EVO FUND, maturing in August 2025. Additionally, to fund its BTC purchases going further, the company has also approved the issuance of the 13th to 17th Series of Stock Acquisition Rights, which totals 21 million shares in five tranches of 4.2 million shares each. Stock Price Eyeing Fresh All-Time Highs? With year-to-date gains of more than 78%, the stock has been on an unprecedented rally. Moreover, with today’s 8% gains, the stock price has once again moved past 6,520 JPY levels eyeing for fresh all-time highs. Furthermore, with the company initiating the Bitcoin Treasury Operations, the stock has witnessed very high trading activity in the Japanese market over the past year. Metaplanet has announced its inclusion in the MSCI Japan Index, effective after the market close on February 28, 2025. The index serves as a key reference for institutional investors globally, guiding decisions on Japanese equities. This inclusion in the MSCI Index coupled with the company’s plan of acquiring 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026 could further fuel the stock price moving ahead. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Picks Up The recent acquisition from Japan’s MicroStrategy comes as the Bitcoin price has been flirting around $97,000 levels, while facing some selling pressure today. However, the whale accumulation for the largest crypto asset class continues further. SpotOnChain has reported significant Bitcoin accumulation from a newly created wallet. In just four days, the wallet has withdrawn 568.74 BTC from Binance at an estimated average price of $96,769 per Bitcoin, amounting to a total cost value of approximately $55.04 million.

Berachain is an EVM-identical Layer 1 blockchain that leverages the novel Proof of Liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism, setting it apart from traditional proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. By embedding liquidity provisioning into its core security model, PoL aligns incentives across validators, applications, and users—ensuring liquidity and security at the network level. Moby’s pioneering efforts have been recognized through its selection for Berachain’s prestigious Request for Application (RFA) program—an endorsement reflecting the protocol’s robust infrastructure and potential to enhance liquidity across the Berachain ecosystem. Moreover, Moby has secured partnerships with key industry players such as Kodiak, Infrared, PumpBTC and GMX, further solidifying its position within the ecosystem. Moby offers two key advantages for Berachain traders and institutions: deeper liquidity and exceptionally tight spreads, both designed to ensure an optimal trading environment. Meanwhile, liquidity providers benefit from high passive income, underpinned by stable risk management achieved through real-time automatic hedging. Additionally, Moby’s Structured Product Vault (SPV) seamlessly integrates with Berachain’s PoL mechanism, providing an efficient yield-enhancing solution. The SPV aggregates PoL rewards and optimizes their yield through algorithmic options trading. It will integrate LST/LRT and Real World Assets (RWA) to expand the on-chain options market. “The expansion to Berachain is a pivotal step for Moby,” stated Ben, CEO of Moby. “By leveraging Berachain’s PoL model, we are setting the stage for a more liquid and scalable on-chain options market—ushering in a new era of institutional-grade trading and structured products” Coinciding with its official launch on the Berachain mainnet, Moby introduced an incentive program for early access users. This initiative allows users to earn rewards based on their engagement. Moby Contacts Team Moby team@moby.trade About Moby Moby is an on-chain options protocol to lead the next narrative for DeFi.

As the AI chatbot developed by Musk’s xAI prepares to debut, traders rushed to capitalize on the hype, driving the token’s market cap to approximately $33.51 million. At last check, the token was trading at around $0.0053, reflecting heightened investor enthusiasm, despite xAI itself having no direct ties to the Grok token. Source: CoinMarketCap The surge underscores how Musk’s influence continues to drive market activity, even as xAI remains an underdog in the AI space, facing stiff competition from OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. With Grok 3 set to be unveiled on Monday at 8:00 PM Pacific Time, speculation is running high. However, questions remain about the sustainability of this rally, given the lack of fundamental backing behind the token. Grok 3’s launch today The crypto market has a history of reacting sharply to Musk’s ventures, particularly when tied to AI or blockchain. Grok 3’s announcement triggered an immediate response from speculative traders, reminiscent of previous meme coin frenzies. Back in November 2023, several GROK-inspired tokens surfaced in response to Musk’s initial xAI announcement, some witnessing gains exceeding 30,000% before retracing sharply. Similar trends have played out with Dogecoin, where Musk’s endorsements fuelled rallies, only for prices to decline once the hype faded. While xAI has secured $6 billion in funding from investors including Nvidia, AMD, and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, it remains in the early stages of challenging industry leaders like OpenAI. The firm is reportedly valued at $75 billion and is attempting to raise an additional $10 billion, but it still lacks the entrenched user base of its biggest competitors. The question now is whether Grok 3’s launch will provide xAI with meaningful traction in the AI space or if the excitement surrounding its debut will follow the typical boom-and-bust cycle seen in crypto markets. Grok’s token has no clear use case tied to xAI’s development Despite the token’s price surge, its long-term outlook remains uncertain. Unlike other AI-linked tokens backed by blockchain projects integrating AI capabilities, Grok’s token has no clear use case tied to xAI’s development. Speculators may see short-term gains, but sustainability hinges on whether Grok 3’s release delivers tangible advancements that differentiate it from existing AI models. Musk has claimed that the chatbot is the “smartest AI on Earth,” but it remains to be seen whether that claim translates into adoption.

Smartest AI on Earth. 8:28 AM · Feb 16, 2025 51.3K Reply Copy link Read 7.1K replies Broader trends also suggest caution. Musk’s controversies in recent years have impacted his companies, with Tesla facing declining sales and X (formerly Twitter) struggling with user retention. His leadership continues to attract polarised reactions, which could influence investor sentiment toward projects linked to his name. At a time when AI investment is at an all-time high, but scrutiny is growing over the financial viability of new entrants, Grok 3’s success—or failure—could have wider implications for both AI and speculative crypto markets. Grok token rally: AI-driven speculation? The Grok token rally reflects a broader trend of AI and blockchain convergence, where speculative assets linked to artificial intelligence are gaining traction. Investors are increasingly drawn to AI-related crypto projects, even when fundamentals remain unclear. This trend has also been evident in China, where AI-related stocks and tokens saw sharp fluctuations after the rise of DeepSeek, a Hangzhou-based startup challenging US-based AI models. While AI adoption is expanding globally, speculative trading continues to dominate markets, leading to unpredictable price swings.

ADA is now consolidating gains and might aim for a fresh move above the $0.80 level. ADA price started a fresh rally above the $0.720 and $0.750 levels. The price is trading above $0.750 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.770 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.80 resistance zone. Cardano Price Climbs Above $0.750 After forming a base above the $0.720 level, Cardano started a fresh rally beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA was able to clear the $0.750 and $0.80 resistance levels. It even surged above the $0.820 level. A high was formed at $0.8286 before there was a downside correction. The price tested the $0.7620 zone and recently started a fresh increase. It cleared the $0.780 resistance.

There was also a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.770 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. Cardano price is now trading above $0.780 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.80 zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $0.8286 swing high to the $0.7621 low. The first resistance is near $0.820. The next key resistance might be $0.850. If there is a close above the $0.850 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.90 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.00 in the near term. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.80 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.7750 level. The next major support is near the $0.7620 level. A downside break below the $0.7620 level could open the doors for a test of $0.750.

Bitcoin (BTC) price faced market turbulence and stood at $96K, whilst ETH also traded in the red territory. Further, XRP and Solana also faced severe hurdles, with their intraday trading session primarily in the red zone. However, Sonic (S) emerged as the leading gainer on Monday, defying the broader market trend. Here’s a brief report on some of the most trending coins’ prices on February 17. Crypto Prices Today: BTC, ETH, XRP, & SOL Turbulent It’s worth noting that the global crypto market cap was down 1.41% from yesterday, reaching $3.19 trillion as of press time. Besides, the total market volume witnessed a 1.81% increase to $60.87 billion.

The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $2.70 and $2.80, respectively. Notably, the Ripple Labs-backed asset’s futures OI slipped by nearly 5% and is currently at $4.10 billion. Solana Price Follows Downtrend SOL price also tanked by 5% intraday, reaching $184. The crypto’s 24-hour bottom and peak were $184 and $196, respectively. The coin currently mirrors the broader cryptocurrency market trend, showcasing volatility. Nevertheless, SOL futures OI jumped by nearly 9% in the past 24 hours, reaching $5.88 billion. Meme Crypto Prices Today Dogecoin (DOGE) price fell by nearly 2% in the past 24 hours and is trading at the $0.26 level. Shiba Inu (SHIB) price followed, waning over 1% to $0.00001592. Further, it’s worth mentioning that the TRUMP coin followed the market trend and dipped nearly 3% to reach $18.36.

Legal Experts Investigate LIBRA Token’s Sudden Collapse,https://coinpedia.org/news/javier-milei-crypto-rug-pull-legal-experts-investigate-libra-tokens-sudden-collapse/,"The post Javier Milei Crypto Rug Pull? Legal Experts Investigate LIBRA Token’s Sudden Collapse appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Argentina is caught in a huge crypto controversy, with President Javier Milei at the center of a legal mess. It all began when Milei posted about LIBRA, a new cryptocurrency, on X. His support sent the token from $0.006 to almost $5 in just a few hours. Many investors assumed the project had government backing and rushed to buy in. But the excitement didn’t last—six hours later, LIBRA’s price crashed to $0.84, wiping out billions and causing panic. Argentine lawyers charge President Milei with fraud over crypto coin pump-and-dump. Follow: @AFpost pic.twitter.com/cDeP0lDwOo — AF Post (@AFpost) February 17, 2025 Lawyers File Fraud Charges The sudden crash led to immediate legal action. Argentine lawyers Jonatan Baldiviezo and Marcos Zelaya filed fraud charges against Milei, arguing that his promotion of LIBRA misled investors. They claim his post tricked investors and compare the situation to a “rug pull,” a common crypto scam where developers promote a token before abandoning it, leaving investors with huge losses. The law firm Burwick Law also insisted the investors reach out to them in case they want assistance in crypto loss. If you lost money on $LIBRA , contact Burwick Law to learn about your legal rights. Our firm represents thousands of clients that want to get their money back on crypto losses. This is attorney advertising. Your results may vary. — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) February 15, 2025 Assuming the complications, Milei quickly deleted his post and denied knowing anything about LIBRA’s creation. His team released a statement saying they removed the post to stop speculation. But legal experts argue that the damage was already done. Now, Argentina’s judiciary will decide if Milei and his team misled investors. Questions of Insider Trading The situation became even more suspicious when Jupiter Exchange admitted that some of its team members had known about LIBRA’s launch weeks before Milei’s post. According to them, private groups were already discussing an “Argentina Coin.” While Jupiter denied any insider trading, the revelation raised concerns that certain people may have made secret profits before the crash. Meanwhile, Kelsier Ventures CEO Hayden Davis, one of LIBRA’s biggest supporters, blamed Milei for the token’s collapse. He claimed the president’s team had promised to support the project but later backed out, shaking investor confidence. Davis denied any fraudulent activity and said he still controlled $100 million in LIBRA funds, which he plans to reinvest and use to buy back and burn tokens to restore value. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Trader’s $17.6M LIBRA Meme Coin Win Raises Questions on Insider Trading , What Happens Next? Argentina’s Anti-Corruption Office is now investigating whether any crimes were committed. Whether Milei manages to clear his name or faces serious legal trouble remains uncertain. Raising doubts, Argentina’s government officials confirmed that President Javier Milei met with KIP Protocol executives Mauricio Novelli and Julian Peh in October 2024 to discuss a blockchain initiative. Later, in January 2025, Milei also met with Hayden Davis, a key figure behind LIBRA, though the government insists he had no official ties to the state. Milei’s team denied fraud charges, claiming it was a routine social media post to support entrepreneurs, not an official government project. However, the Anti-Corruption Office remains unconvinced and has assembled a special task force of crypto, finance, and anti-money laundering experts to investigate potential fraud or misconduct. The government has pledged to hand over all findings to the courts, but with lawsuits piling up and investors outraged, Milei’s presidency hangs in the balance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Senator Lummis says BTC can be audited at any time,https://invezz.com/news/2025/02/17/bitcoin-backed-national-reserves-senator-lummis-says-btc-can-be-audited-at-any-time/,"Senator Cynthia Lummis is urging the United States to consider Bitcoin as part of its national reserves. With concerns over inflation, government spending, and the long-term stability of the US dollar, Lummis argues that Bitcoin could offer a new level of financial transparency. As chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Lummis is focused on integrating Bitcoin into US economic policy. She highlights that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature allows for real-time auditing, a feature that could significantly enhance trust in the financial system. Unlike gold or fiat reserves, Bitcoin holdings can be verified instantly with a basic computer, eliminating the need for complex audits. The senator’s remarks come as multiple US states explore Bitcoin reserves. Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin are among those considering digital asset reserves as part of their financial strategy. This state-level momentum could pave the way for broader national adoption, with Lummis pushing for discussions at the federal level. US states test Bitcoin reserves Bitcoin-backed reserves are no longer a fringe concept. In the US, individual states have begun exploring Bitcoin as an alternative asset to hedge against inflation and financial instability. Lummis believes that state-level adoption could create a precedent, eventually influencing federal policy. Texas has already embraced Bitcoin in multiple ways, including through mining incentives and legislative support for crypto-friendly policies. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have signaled interest in exploring how Bitcoin reserves could fit into their broader financial strategies. Internationally, the trend is also gaining traction. Lummis recently noted that the United Arab Emirates has shown interest in Bitcoin reserves, reflecting a global shift toward recognizing the asset’s potential role in national financial strategies. Bitcoin and US debt Lummis has positioned Bitcoin as more than just a speculative asset—she sees it as a tool to address national debt concerns and strengthen the US dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency. With US national debt surpassing $34 trillion, policymakers are increasingly seeking alternative strategies to manage long-term fiscal challenges. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, is viewed by some as a hedge against inflation and excessive government spending. If integrated into the US reserves, Lummis suggests that Bitcoin could serve as a safeguard against monetary debasement. The broader adoption of Bitcoin as a national reserve asset faces significant regulatory and political hurdles. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department have yet to signal any shift in policy toward incorporating Bitcoin into national reserves, despite growing support from crypto-friendly legislators. Lummis encourages Bitcoin supporters to engage with lawmakers Senator Lummis is set to discuss Bitcoin’s potential role in national reserves at Bitcoin 2025, a high-profile event focused on cryptocurrency and financial innovation. She has encouraged Bitcoin supporters to engage with lawmakers to push for policy changes at both the state and federal levels. As discussions around Bitcoin reserves gain traction, the financial landscape could witness a major shift in how digital assets are perceived by governments. While resistance remains strong among traditional policymakers, growing interest from states and international players suggests that Bitcoin’s role in sovereign financial strategies is far from settled.

In Texas, the state Senate is set to hold a public hearing on Feb. 18 to discuss the potential establishment of a Bitcoin reserve, a move that could signal further institutional acceptance of digital assets. Meanwhile, a newly released report reveals that the Bitcoin mining industry has already created over 31,000 jobs in the US, contributing more than $4.1 billion in annual GDP. While these initiatives reflect broader economic and political shifts, analysts remain cautious about their immediate market impact, citing macroeconomic factors and regulatory considerations as primary drivers of Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bitcoin Mining in the US Surges: Over 31,000 Jobs Created, Economic Impact Hits $4.1 Billion The Bitcoin mining industry has rapidly grown into a significant economic force in the United States, creating over 31,000 jobs across the country and generating more than $4.1 billion in annual gross domestic product (GDP), according to a new report. Despite being a relatively nascent sector, the study—conducted by the Perryman Group and published by blockchain advocacy organizations Texas Blockchain Council and The Digital Chamber—highlights the industry's profound impact on employment, energy infrastructure, and national priorities. The report found that Bitcoin mining activity is concentrated in 12 U.S. states, with Texas leading the way. The Lone Star State accounts for more than 12,200 jobs, both directly from mining operations and indirectly through industries supporting the sector. The massive expansion of mining operations in Texas has also contributed to strengthening local energy utility infrastructure. Bitcoin miners act as a load-balancing resource for the electrical grid, helping stabilize energy supply by shutting down during peak demand and utilizing excess power during off-peak hours. As a result, mining operations have become a key player in grid resilience strategies, making the industry increasingly indispensable to state and local governments. The industry's growing economic footprint coincides with a shifting political landscape. US President Donald Trump, who campaigned on making the United States the ”crypto capital of the planet,” has emphasized the importance of Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure as matters of national security. Trump has consistently advocated for expanding energy production to maintain dominance in both sectors, stating that the US would need at least double its current energy output to support these high-performance computing industries. ”We will have power plants built at the sites. We will be releasing people from certain ridiculous requirements, and we will be using fossil fuels to make electricity because we are going to have to. We will also be using nuclear,” Trump said. His stance signals a policy shift that could remove regulatory barriers for Bitcoin miners and AI-focused companies, ensuring greater access to energy resources and infrastructure development. Bitcoin mining and AI computing share a common challenge: intensive energy consumption. As mining companies and tech firms seek long-term solutions to sustain operations, the exploration of alternative energy sources has become a priority. One of the most promising developments in this space is small-scale nuclear reactors. These compact nuclear power units, small enough to be transported in an 18-wheel truck, are emerging as a viable solution to provide on-site power generation for data centers and mining farms. In October 2024, Google took a significant step in this direction by signing a deal with Kairos Power , a nuclear power engineering firm, to develop a small-scale nuclear reactor dedicated to powering AI operations. The project is set to be operational by 2030. This technology could have far-reaching implications for the Bitcoin mining industry, providing an alternative to traditional fossil fuels while enhancing energy security and sustainability. Regulatory Landscape and Future Growth While the Bitcoin mining sector is expanding, it still faces regulatory uncertainty. Environmental concerns related to carbon emissions and energy consumption have led to increased scrutiny from federal and state regulators. However, the industry's role in stabilizing energy grids and advancing technological innovation may shift political attitudes in favor of supportive policies. Moreover, with rising geopolitical tensions and increased competition in the global digital asset space, the US is positioning itself as a leader in blockchain technology, AI, and high-performance computing. Bitcoin mining is no longer a niche industry—it has become an integral part of America's energy, technology, and economic strategy. With 31,000 jobs created, $4.1 billion in annual GDP contributions, and ongoing investments in nuclear and renewable energy, the sector is poised for sustained growth. As political and industry leaders continue to prioritize blockchain and AI dominance, Bitcoin mining could play a critical role in shaping the US economy in the coming years. Whether through policy support, infrastructure expansion, or energy innovation, the industry is set to become a pillar of national technological leadership. Texas Senate to Hold Public Hearing on Bitcoin Reserve Proposal: Symbolic Move or Genuine Policy Shift? The Texas Senate is preparing to hold a public hearing on Feb. 18 to discuss the establishment of a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve, a move that could mark a significant milestone for state-level cryptocurrency adoption. However, market analysts remain cautious, suggesting that unless the state unveils a concrete investment plan, the initiative may remain largely symbolic rather than a transformative shift in Bitcoin adoption. The upcoming hearing comes just days after Senate Bill 21 (SB21) was received by the Secretary of the Senate, signaling the state’s increasing interest in integrating Bitcoin into its financial reserves. The bill aligns with Texas’ well-known pro-crypto stance, given the state’s strong mining industry, regulatory support, and business-friendly policies that have attracted some of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining firms. Despite the significance of the hearing, some analysts argue that the market may not react strongly unless Texas makes an immediate commitment to acquiring Bitcoin. “Texas considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset is another chess move in BTC’s march toward institutional legitimacy, but state-level initiatives often make ripples, not waves, compared to ETF inflows or corporate treasury allocations,” said Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at Nexo. Kalchev believes that unless the hearing unveils a near-term purchase plan or a major policy shift, its impact on Bitcoin’s price action may be muted. The announcement comes at a time when Bitcoin is facing macro-driven headwinds, particularly from geopolitical tensions and monetary policy uncertainties. Bitcoin has been trading below the $100,000 psychological level for over nine days since Feb. 7. The cryptocurrency has shown resilience despite ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, which could affect investor sentiment in the near term. “While this headwind remains in the market, with President Trump eyeing more tariff hikes in the coming weeks, Bitcoin has traded with resilience,” said Vugar Usi Zade, COO of Bitget. “With the US retaining its stance as the largest capital market, geopolitical tensions may continue to weigh on Bitcoin’s trajectory.” Additionally, Federal Reserve policy remains a dominant factor in shaping Bitcoin’s price trends. Analysts note that while Texas’ push for a Bitcoin reserve is a positive step toward mainstream adoption, the broader market still reacts primarily to Fed interest rate decisions, regulatory updates, and global economic conditions. “Crypto markets tend to price in expected developments, and while this hearing may add to Bitcoin’s long-term adoption story, macro forces like Fed policy and regulatory shifts remain the real power players in shaping BTC’s trajectory,” Kalchev added. Texas is not the only state exploring Bitcoin reserves. On Feb. 6, Kentucky became the 16th US state to introduce legislation aimed at establishing a Bitcoin reserve fund, which would allow up to 10% of excess state reserves to be allocated into digital assets. Texas’ move, therefore, reflects a broader economic and political shift in the US, where states are beginning to recognize Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes it an attractive alternative to traditional financial instruments, especially in states with strong energy production and mining operations. The Potential Impact of a Texas Bitcoin Reserve If Texas moves forward with acquiring Bitcoin for its state reserves, it could set a precedent for other states and even influence federal policies. Texas already plays a leading role in the US Bitcoin mining industry, with over 12,200 mining-related jobs, and a strategic Bitcoin reserve could further solidify its position as a crypto hub. A state-backed Bitcoin investment could also serve as a model for institutional investors looking for long-term exposure to digital assets. While the upcoming hearing is an encouraging sign, the absence of a clear purchase plan means its immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price may be limited. However, if Texas officially commits to buying Bitcoin, it could lead to a significant wave of institutional and governmental adoption, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as digital gold.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-17 05:30:00

He warns that this could be the biggest economic fallout in history, with massive job losses, plunging stock prices, and a struggling housing market. According to him the warning signs of an economic collapse are crystal clear now. He is sure that the 2025 crisis will be bigger than the Great Depression of the 1930s. Kiyosaki’s Playbook and His Three Rules To confirm this trend change, he is referring to his book published in 1997 to remind his followers of the financial lessons that got his book rejected by major publishers during that era. Despite skepticism from editors, his three money rules have stood the test of time and seem more relevant than ever in 2025. Kiyosaki’s first rule, “The rich do not work for money,” highlights how wealthy individuals build businesses and create assets instead of relying on a paycheck. With job losses mounting in 2025, this concept is proving true as entrepreneurs continue to thrive while employees struggle. His second rule, “Your house is not an asset,” challenges the common belief that homeownership is a guaranteed path to wealth. He defines assets as things that generate money without working, while liabilities drain finances. With home prices crashing and affordability at an all-time low, many are realizing that their homes are not the financial security they once believed. The final rule, “Savers are losers,” addresses the impact of inflation and the dangers of relying on fiat currency. As per him, the US Dollar is “fake money” and you will lose everything if you hold this toilet paper. Kiyosaki suggests investing in gold, silver, and Bitcoin to keep money safe from inflation and losing value. He warns that saving too much cash can be risky because its worth goes down over time, especially during tough economic times. He refers to gold and silver as “God’s money” and Bitcoin as “people’s money,” urging individuals to rethink how they protect their financial future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin, ETH, & XRP Price Prediction: A Bullish Week Ahead? , Crypto Dad Counters Kiyosaki Crypto expert, Crypto Dad responded to Robert Kiyosaki’s financial advice, offering a different perspective on wealth-building. While Kiyosaki emphasizes entrepreneurship as the key to financial success, Crypto Dad argues that not everyone is meant to be an entrepreneur—and that’s perfectly fine. He acknowledges that many people feel pressured to start their businesses, only to struggle or fail because building something from scratch is incredibly challenging. According to him, “The hardest job in the world is to create your job.” Instead, he believes individuals can still achieve financial success and wealth by working for others, as long as they make smart financial choices. His response highlights that entrepreneurship isn’t the only path to wealth, and people should not feel forced into it. Whether through investing, career growth, or strategic money management, there are multiple ways to build financial security without starting a business. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/every-investor-should-hold-at-least-1000-xrp-heres-why/,"XRP has been on a roll since late 2024 and is trading higher than it has for most of its history. The recent price surge showed investors that they should have gotten in early, but with the asset still below its all-time high, there’s still room for accumulation. The digital asset began trading in November at $0.5092, with 1,000 XRP going for $509.2. The digital asset is now trading at $2.7, putting a 1,000 XRP investment at $2,700—almost 3x its price last year. Limited Large-Scale Adoption Edoardo Farina, a prominent crypto CEO and expert, recently called on everyone to hold at least 1,000 XRP , and the asset’s recent performance and potential for growth reinforces this sentiment. However, recent data from the XRP Rich List shows there is still room for larger-scale adoption. Among the 6.1 million existing XRP wallets, approximately 938,123 contain holdings of 1,000 XRP or greater. 84% or 5.18 million accounts, maintain balances below this threshold. These statistics are particularly noteworthy compared to Bitcoin’s broader market penetration, encompassing more than 460 million addresses. Accumulating at least 1,000 tokens now would put investors in an exclusive class, and many other reasons support fast accumulation. Institutional Development and Regulatory Progress The cryptocurrency landscape has witnessed increased institutional engagement with XRP. Several prominent asset management firms have submitted applications for spot XRP ETFs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally acknowledged submissions from Grayscale and 21Shares, while Cboe BZX has facilitated 19b-4 filings for multiple organizations, including WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Canary Capital. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Recent changes in SEC leadership have generated optimism regarding potential ETF approvals, and acknowledgment of these filings is the first step toward that goal. Government Interest in XRP Recent developments also suggest that the U.S. Government is interested in digital assets. A recently signed executive order established a working group dedicated to examining digital asset regulation and the possibility of a U.S. crypto reserve. Industry observers note that XRP’s status as a prominent American-developed digital asset could position it favorably for inclusion in any future government reserve. An Upcoming XRP Bull Run Additionally, crypto analysts have made multiple bullish predictions for the digital asset. EGRAG CRYPTO, a prominent analyst, has predicted a rise to $15 by March 10, a potential subsequent climb that could send XRP as high as $27 . This target is 10x the asset’s current price and would turn a modest investment into significant profit.

Recently, the CBOE filed the 19b for Bitwise’s XRP ETF , along with other companies looking to get approval. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, discussed the potential for these ETFs in a recent discussion, shedding light on the current state of XRP ETFs. XRP ETF Approval: Challenges & Progress In an interview with Thinking Crypto , Hougan explained that there had been several starts and stops with ETF applications in the past, with some applications being filed and later withdrawn. However, the fact that multiple issuers are now refiling their applications suggests that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is open to investigating these products, although approval is not guaranteed. While the conversation around digital assets like XRP and Solana is heating up, Hougan is optimistic that the SEC is increasingly willing to consider these ETFs. He said that the outlook for XRP ETFs has improved over the past few months, and with more progress being made, it’s likely that the SEC will take a more accommodative approach to approving these assets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Attorney John Deaton Defends XRP Against Claims of Being a ‘Centrally Controlled Security’ , “I would say you want to be realistic about the speed. I think even a pro-crypto SEC is likely to take their time, analyze, get public comment. My view is that this is a long game. Our view is that the SEC wants to take an accommodative view and help investors access these assets through ETPs. We’ll find out over the next six months,” He Said. Matt Hougan’s Outlook on XRP ETFs Hougan pointed out that, historically, commodity ETFs have been launched only when there is a regulated futures market for that commodity, such as with gold, and even Bitcoin. While a futures market is not required for XRP ETFs, it would be an important factor in the approval process. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Meanwhile, Pantera Capital’s Dan Morehead is under federal tax investigation over $850 million in investment profits after relocating to Puerto Rico. In India, authorities seized almost $190 million in crypto linked to the Bitconnect Ponzi scheme. Geosyn Mining Faces Criminal Charges The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided to pause its fraud lawsuit against Geosyn Mining and its executives after similar charges were filed by federal prosecutors against the company’s leadership. The agency’s decision was shared in a Feb. 14 filing to a Texas federal court, and happened after Geosyn CEO Caleb Joseph Ward and former operating chief Jeremy George McNutt surrendered to authorities and made their first court appearance. The SEC originally filed its case in April of 2024, accusing the executives of fraudulent activities tied to their cryptocurrency mining business. Original announcement of SEC lawsuit (Source: SEC ) Court documents were unsealed on Feb. 10 and revealed details about the accusations against Ward, McNutt, and Geosyn’s former sales manager, Jared McNutt, who was not named in the SEC’s case but is implicated in the broader scheme. The complaint alleges that the trio deceived their clients by promising to buy and host Bitcoin mining equipment on their behalf in exchange for a monthly fee, with the promise of sharing the mining profits. However, prosecutors claim that in many cases, the equipment was never purchased, and customer funds were instead used to fund a lavish lifestyle. This included the purchase of firearms, luxury watches, and personal trips to Disney World and Miami. According to the affidavit, the executives sent falsified reports to customers, which made them believe their mining rigs were operational and generating revenue. Additionally, they allegedly engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme by using funds from new clients to buy Bitcoin and transfer it to earlier clients, giving the illusion that the mining rigs were actually producing income. Prosecutors also claim that the executives deliberately misrepresented the cost of mining rigs to extract even more profits and maintained a spreadsheet documenting the real and inflated prices, which far exceeded the advertised procurement fees. The SEC’s lawsuit alleges that Ward and Jeremy McNutt defrauded approximately 64 investors out of $5.6 million between November of 2021 and December of 2022. The agency believes that the service agreements offered by Geosyn constituted unregistered securities, which is a claim that Ward has disputed. The SEC also alleges that Geosyn did not procure 400 of the 1,400 mining rigs it had agreements for and neglected to bring most of the acquired rigs online. In an apparent internal dispute, Ward reportedly reported McNutt for embezzlement without mentioning his own misappropriation of funds. Recent political developments have also intersected with the case. Last week, Ward and McNutt responded to a query from Judge Mark Pittman about how the potential regulatory shift under Donald Trump’s administration could influence the lawsuit. The two requested a hold on the SEC’s case due to the parallel criminal proceedings and the need to evaluate Trump’s crypto-friendly policies, which they argued could impact the SEC’s enforcement authority and approach to the case. Despite this argument, the SEC maintained in its filing that the administration’s stance on crypto and the newly established task force should not affect the case. Pantera Capital’s Dan Morehead Faces Tax Investigation Dan Morehead, the founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital, is also reportedly under investigation for possible federal tax law violations after relocating to Puerto Rico. The US Senate Finance Committee (SFC) requested information about over $850 million in investment profits Morehead earned after moving to the island in 2020. A letter from Senator Ron Wyden from Jan. 9 suggested that Morehead “may have treated” these profits as exempt from US taxes. The letter pointed out that in most cases, a large portion of gains earned by people relocating to Puerto Rico still qualifies as US-sourced income, requiring them to report it on US tax returns and pay applicable taxes. In response to this, Morehead shared that he believes he acted appropriately regarding his taxes and clarified that he moved to Puerto Rico in 2021. Morehead founded Pantera Capital , which was the first cryptocurrency investment firm in the US. It even saw some of its early investments grow by more than 130,000%, according to a blog post he published in November of 2024. He also launched the Pantera Bitcoin Fund in 2013, with its initial Bitcoin purchase at $74 generating over 1,000 times its return. Pantera Capital now manages over $5 billion in assets, with more than 100 venture investments and 47% of its capital allocated outside the United States, according to the company’s website. (Source: Pantera Capital ) The investigation into Morehead happened at a time of increased regulatory scrutiny on crypto taxation. In June of 2024, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) introduced new rules requiring US crypto transactions to be subject to third-party tax reporting for the first time. Starting in 2025, centralized crypto exchanges and other brokers will have to report sales and exchanges of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. This move raised a lot of concerns in the industry. Some experts warned that it could push investors toward decentralized platforms, making tax revenue even harder to track. India Cracks Down on Bitconnect Fraud Indian authorities seized almost $190 million in crypto linked to the Bitconnect Ponzi scheme as part of an ongoing investigation into the global fraud that collapsed in 2018. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Ahmedabad conducted the seizure as part of its probe into the scheme, which allegedly deceived numerous investors under the guise of securities investments. Alongside the cryptocurrency, authorities also confiscated cash amounting to approximately $15,582, a sport utility vehicle, and several electronic devices in raids that were conducted on Feb. 11 and 15 in Gujarat. The seized assets reportedly belonged to associates of Bitconnect, which is accused of defrauding around 4,000 investors across 95 countries, leading to an estimated $2.4 billion in losses. Bitconnect was founded in 2016, and lured investors with promises of high returns but collapsed just two years later. Bitconnect’s founder, Satish Kumbhani, was charged by the US Department of Justice in February of 2022 for orchestrating the scheme. Authorities claim he built a worldwide network of promoters who were paid commissions to attract more investors into the fraudulent operation. Between November 2016 and January 2018, the scheme collected funds from investors around the world, including a large number in India. (Source: US Department of Justice ) The fallout from Bitconnect’s collapse led to desperate attempts by some victims to recover their lost investments. In August of 2024, the Enforcement Directorate reported that an investor, Shailesh Babulal Bhatt, who suffered losses in Bitconnect Coin (BCC), took extreme measures by kidnapping two of Kumbhani’s employees. Bhatt and his accomplices allegedly extorted 2,091 Bitcoin, 11,000 Litecoin, and around $1.7 million in cash to recoup his losses.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|MINING|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-17 05:51:17

Technical charts for DOGE flash warning signals amid the formation of a death cross pattern for DOGE MVRV. Confirming the bearish trend, a renowned analyst predicted a likely 44% crash in the top-meme coin’s value ahead. Dogecoin Price Can Correct 44%, Says Analyst Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that DOGE could be heading for a challenging period amid a bearish technical chart pattern. Martinez highlighted a “death cross” between Dogecoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and its 200-day moving average (MA). The analyst stated that historically, such chart patterns have led to significant declines, with Dogecoin price dropping 26% and 44% during the last two instances of this pattern. If this happens, DOGE could collapse all the way to $0.15 from the current levels. Source: Ali Martinez Meme Coins Take A Massive Hit Over the past weekend, the Dogecoin price has corrected 7% as the broader meme coin sector takes a major hit following the launch of Argentina’s LIBRA meme coin , which faced a massive pump and dump. Apart from top players like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu (SHIB), celebrity meme coins have taken the most hit. Furthermore, as per the Coinglass data , the DOGE futures open interest has tanked 5.27% to $2.41 billion while the 24-hour liquidations have shot up to $3.57 million of which, $3.1 million is in long liquidations. Source: Coinglass DOGE Traders Remain Optimistic Despite the technical charts suggesting bearishness for Dogecoin price, traders continue to be optimistic about gains moving ahead. Furthermore, with developments around the SEC’s potential approval of a spot Dogecoin ETF , the optimism remains intact. Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged the DOGE ETF filing by asset manager Grayscale raising further hopes within the crypto community. Crypto analyst Bluntz has expressed optimism about Dogecoin (DOGE), highlighting its stability after two weeks of consolidation following a recent capitulation event. “$DOGE is looking pretty solid here, in my opinion,” Bluntz noted, adding, “If there’s one saying that’s always stuck with me, it’s never short a dull market.” Source: Bluntz The analyst’s remarks suggest that Dogecoin’s current quiet phase could indicate potential strength, with traders keeping a close watch for future price movements.

However, this hasn't deterred traders from continuing to bet bullishly on the leading cryptocurrency. This month's most preferred options play has been buying the $110,000 call expiring on March 28, with buyers paying a cumulative net premium of over $6 million for the bullish exposure, according to the Deribit options flow tracked by Amberdata. A call option gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish, looking to hedge downside risks. ""Looking at the month-to-date flows for on-screen traders… the buying of March $110K calls has been the most active trade,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a note shared with CoinDesk. Bitcoin has mostly traded within a narrow range of $95,000 to $100,000 this month. The bulls have had some positive developments to chew on, like the continued accumulation by MicroStrategy and Abu Dhabi's recent reveal of a $436 million investment in the bitcoin ETFs. However, renewed macroeconomic headwinds, highlighted by last week's hotter U.S. inflation data and frequent liquidity drains caused by the boom-bust cycles of memecoins and other small-cap tokens, appear to be capping the upside potential. Over the weekend, a token called LIBRA zoomed to a market cap of over $4 billion, only to erase 90% of that within minutes. Argentina's President, Xavier Milei, initially promoted the coin late Friday but backtracked in a few hours, causing a controversy that has him facing legal issues in his home country. ""Some bullish headlines hit for BTC last week, but that didn't materialize into any real spike higher for spot prices,"" Magadini said, referring to Abu Dhabi's investment. ""Combine this news with bearish memecoin market drag (a source of bearish headlines) such as the $Libra drop, pump-fun mania and growing supply of alts [altcoins] and I see this market in stand-still. Together, this reinforces my 'sideways' market, lower volatility market thesis,"" Magadini added.",Markets|Bitcoin|Options|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-17 07:10:11

Analyst Reveals Timeline",https://coingape.com/when-xrp-price-can-hit-8-13-27-analyst-reveals-timeline/,"XRP price slips more than 4% slipping below the key support of $2.7 sparking concerns over further dip ahead. Although Ripple’s native crypto has soared past the $2.8 mark recently, fueling market sentiment towards a potential rally to $3 next, recent movements have left many questioning the future of the crypto. However, citing technical indicators and other key metrics, a top market expert reveals when the crypto can hit a new ATH of $8, gaining immense market attention. Besides, he also provided an outlook for the crypto’s further rally to $13 and $27. Analyst Highlights Bullish Technical Indicators For XRP Price Crypto expert EGRAG CRYPTO has highlighted crucial technical patterns indicating the next major move for the XRP price. According to his analysis, the 21-week exponential moving average (EMA) has been a key support level for the crypto. Even during the latest flash crash, this indicator held firm, signaling a strong foundation for price stability. EGRAG CRYPTO noted that XRP is currently consolidating between Fibonacci (Fib) levels 0.888 and 1.0, within the $2.25 and $3.30 range. This setup, according to technical analysis, sets the stage for a potential breakout. He outlined a key Fib intersection expected on March 10, 2025, which could push the crypto’s price to $8, representing a 3x surge from current levels. Besides, he projected further rally looking ahead for the asset. According to his analysis, XRP price could climb to $13 by September 22, 2025, and potentially $27 by June 30, 2025, based on further Fibonacci extensions. Besides, a recent report also revealed the timeline for XRP to hit $17 . Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X Short-term Outlook For The Crypto Another analyst, Dark Defender, remains optimistic about the short-term prospects for XRP price. He predicts that reclaiming the $2.7740 level could pave the way for a rally to $3 soon. In his recent analysis, he emphasized that breaking the current resistance zone could signal a much larger breakout toward double-digit price levels. Source: Dark Defender, X Notably, this also resonates with the latest predictions by other experts. For context, in a recent X post, renowned expert Ali Martinez said that Ripple’s native asset is following a “cup and handle pattern”, which indicates a potential breakout to $3.35 ahead. Source: Ali Martinez, X Is XRP Poised To Flip Ethereum? Despite the recent volatile price movements, experts remain optimistic about the XRP price trajectory. Analysts have also predicted that crypto will flip Ethereum soon, which has further sparked market discussions. Meanwhile, Dark Defender compared XRP’s performance to Ethereum, asserting that the former has begun to flip ETH in market performance. He pointed out that, over a period from September 2023 to January 2025, XRP’s price surged by 564%, while Ethereum only gained 80%. This significant difference, according to him, proves Ripple’s native crypto’s growing dominance in the market. Moreover, he criticized skeptics who dismiss technical analysis, stating that mathematical patterns in price movements provide valuable insights into XRP’s future potential. Source: Dark Defender, X What’s Next For XRP Price? As of writing, XRP price was down 4.13% and exchanged hands at $2.67. However, the crypto has added nearly 12% over the last seven days, due to a flurry of positive market developments surrounding Ripple and the crypto. Meanwhile, XRP Futures Open Interest fell 6% to $4.07 billion after recently hitting $4.2 billion. Source: Coinglass However, looking at the current market trends, it appears that XRP is likely to witness a robust rally ahead. For context, market speculations are soaring over a potential dismissal or settlement in the Ripple Vs SEC case under the upcoming US SEC Chair. This expectation, if comes true, can boost the crypto’s price to a new high. On the other hand, soaring anticipation over a potential XRP ETF approval in the US has further bolstered market sentiment. The investment instrument can significantly raise the crypto’s appeal to institutional investors, paving the way toward a robust rally ahead. The post When XRP Price Can Hit $8, $13, & $27?

40441529,https://nulltx.com/?p=145014,1739776457,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Forget Waiting for the Dogecoin Price to Hit $1, PCHAIN Will Get There Faster",https://nulltx.com/forget-waiting-for-the-dogecoin-price-to-hit-1-pchain-will-get-there-faster/,"The crypto market is full of speculative opportunities, with many investors eagerly awaiting the day the Dogecoin price reaches the coveted $1 mark. However, despite its popularity and strong community backing, DOGE has struggled to maintain momentum, leaving many wondering if and when it will ever hit this milestone. Meanwhile, innovative blockchain projects with strong fundamentals and real-world utility are emerging as more promising contenders. One such project is PCHAIN , the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-based real estate ecosystem designed to power the future of the $600 trillion global real estate. Market experts strongly believe PCHAIN will hit the $1 mark before the Dogecoin price. The PropiChain token stands out in the crowded crypto space due to its unique value proposition to redefine global real estate transactions. Unlike the Dogecoin price, which primarily relies on social media hype and celebrity endorsements, PCHAIN is backed by the multi-trillion-dollar global real estate market and the $16 trillion RWA tokenization market. The Dogecoin Price Slow Pace to $1 Over the past 30 days, the Dogecoin price has fallen by more than 24% due to escalating market pressure. Technical indicators suggest the price could face further crashes, with support levels near $0.24 at risk if bearish trends continue. Additionally, market data shows DOGE trading volumes have crashed by 15% this week, reducing holders’ confidence. DOGE has faced consistent selling activity, with its price down over 20% in the last 2 weeks and social media engagement declining sharply. Market experts strongly doubt that DOGE’s price will soon hit the $1 mark. This weakening sentiment contrasts with rising interest in PCHAIN, which has witnessed the influx of retail and institutional investors in its ongoing presale. With the Dogecoin price trading near multi-month lows, many traders view PCHAIN’s presale as a safer opportunity than volatile memecoins. PCHAIN’s Accelerated Rise Amid Dogecoin Price Slow Momentum In contrast to the slow pace of the Dogecoin price movement to $1, PCHAIN is garnering attention for its ambitious growth projections. Analysts have highlighted the PropiChain token’s potential for substantial returns, with some forecasts predicting a surge of up to 43,408%. This optimism is driven by the PropiChain token’s innovative approach to blockchain technology, particularly its application in global real estate, which positions it uniquely in the market. Furthermore, the ongoing presale offers early investors significant opportunities. Priced at $0.01, market experts strongly believe the token will rally to $1 faster than DOGE’s price. Given the token’s current growth momentum and strategic market positioning, this trajectory offers early investors an impressive 8,990% ROI. Comparative Analysis: PCHAIN vs. the Dogecoin Price Movement While the Dogecoin price movement and the PropiChain token present intriguing investment opportunities, their paths to the $1 mark differ significantly. Community support and market sentiment heavily influence DOGE’s growth, leading to a wide range of price predictions. PCHAIN, on the other hand, is backed by tangible real-world assets in the real estate sector and a structured presale strategy, contributing to its robust growth forecasts. As an RWA altcoin, the PropiChain token gives investors early access to the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. The token’s real-world utility and solid fundamentals give it an edge over DOGE in the race to the coveted $1 mark. With PropiChain poised to capture at least 1% of the $600 trillion global real estate market, analysts strongly believe this will drive the token’s value beyond the $1 projection. PropiChain: Using New-Generation Technological Innovation to Power Global Real Estate PropiChain is transforming the multi-trillion-dollar global real estate industry by deploying cutting-edge technology to redefine property transactions. Its advanced platform enhances efficiency, offering a seamless alternative to traditional real estate processes. At the heart of PropiChain’s innovation is its integration of blockchain-powered smart contracts, which help automate key real estate operations, including property transfers, lease agreements, and rental payments. With these smart contracts, real estate investors eliminate the need for intermediaries such as brokers and agents. By streamlining these processes, PropiChain reduces transaction costs, fast-tracks transactions, and minimizes fraud risks. Beyond automation, PropiChain is reshaping property exploration through an immersive Metaverse experience. By utilizing 3D virtual technology, buyers and investors can conduct detailed property tours remotely, breaking geographical barriers. Whether an investor in Dubai wants to explore a beachfront villa in California or a high-rise apartment in Greece, PropiChain’s interactive Metaverse walkthroughs provide a highly realistic and engaging experience, fostering greater transparency and real-time collaboration between buyers and sellers. Another revolutionary feature of PropiChain’s ecosystem is its Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization model. The platform enables fractional ownership by converting physical real estate into digital tokens, allowing more investors to participate in high-value property markets without requiring significant upfront capital.

40441580,https://nulltx.com/?p=145019,1739776512,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Viral Trader Who Made $1.1 with Solana Memecoins Spot Next Big Bet,https://nulltx.com/viral-trader-who-made-1-1-with-solana-memecoins-spot-next-big-bet/,"In a market largely driven by intrinsically valuable coins, stakeholders profiting from Solana memecoins or any memecoin is a rarity. This makes the report of a trader earning over $1.1 million from Solana memecoins spotlight-worthy. However, the trader’s current fortune pales in comparison to their next target and what it signals for crypto investors. Leading Solana memecoins like $TRUMP, $BONK, and $PENGU have enjoyed relative success with investors, leveraging online traction and a communal ethos. At $16.50 , $0.00001761 , and $0.009797 , respectively, users have the opportunity to scale safely with minimal risk. The rising importance of enhanced DeFi trading platforms like RCO Finance have nonetheless drawn attention to their robust offerings for investors. The Ripple Effect of Solana Memecoin Investor’s Success A trader gained widespread attention on the 11th of February after receiving over $1 million in returns after trading in Solana (SOL) and a Solana memecoin, $HARRYBOLZ. This comes against the run of play, given the coin’s status as a background player on the Solana platform. The development also hints at a further goldmine as the AI-powered trading platform RCO Finance braces for an impactful run. Currently trading at $0.00000000000048 with a trading volume of $4,380, down by 98.11%, $HAIRYBOLZ is the textbook underdog coin. Its valuation rose briefly following Elon Musk’s X name change , indicative of the enduring impact of influencers in the crypto space. With the name change triggering a 120% spike in the value of the Solana memecoin, the whale’s prior purchase of 128.8 million worth of $HAIRYBOLZ was a timely one. With more peak periods on the way for Solana memecoins, it is only natural for investors to spread out their portfolios with more reliable altcoins. RCO Finance is poised to be the next big bet in the crypto market, offering users a vast trove of assets to invest in. Discover New Trading Capabilities with RCO Finance RCO Finance is the undeniable frontrunner in the era of automated trading and AI-fueled scalability. With an AI tool known as the Robo Advisor, RCO Finance balances investors’ prompt capitalization on market trends with organic, sustainable portfolio growth. It also offers trading privacy without the excessive KYC requirements synonymous with other DeFi platforms. With the Robo Advisor, users can take advantage of short-lived goldmines. While many users focused on trending Solana memecoins like $TRUMP and $BONK in January 2025. The Robo Advisor would have referred users to the $HAIRYBOLZ coin following Elon Musk’s X name change. Developments of this nature periodically arise, but it is possible to leverage all with RCO Finance’s Robo Advisor. Additionally, RCO Finance makes the investment process seamless for users by offering access to diverse assets. With over 120,000 asset types on the platform, divided into 12,500 classes. Beginner traders can rely on the Robo Advisor to recommend and include viable real-world, digital, and tokenized assets in their portfolios. RCO Finance recently launched its Beta platform , with over 10,000 users currently signed up to the platform. This gives a glimpse of the platform’s long list of capabilities for new and prospective users. These help position users for more opportunities to profit from leading altcoins, trending Solana memecoins, and viable assets in general. RCO Finance is set to add more tools to its beta platform. Monitoring facilities are also on the way for the Robo Advisor to help users take advantage of rapid crypto developments akin to the $HAIRYBOLZ spike and other Solana memecoins. RCOF Tokens – The New Face of Seamless DeFi Transactions Beyond keeping users ahead of sharp developments, the RCOF token adds an endearing dimension to rapid asset trades. RCOF tokens facilitate trades and add liquidity to the platform. These tokens also enable users to unlock more tools for market automation and sustainable portfolio growth.

This way, RCO Finance doubles down on decentralized governance to yield a platform inclined to users’ preferences and reservations. With over $13 million worth of RCOF tokens sold, RCO Finance is on course to becoming the crypto trading platform of choice for many users. Take a Chance on RCO Finance Today RCOF has undergone four presale stages and is currently priced at $0.1 in its fifth presale stage. It is set to land between $0.4 and $0.6 upon listing, with more spikes on the horizon. With more users and platform enhancements on the way, a price drop is unlikely.

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL has proven to be the standout investment. With $1.9 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL raised over $1.9 million almost instantly.

Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL is exclusively available at MAGACOINOFFICIAL.

How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL. Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL to dominate the market.

BTFD Coin ($BTFD) , Moo Deng , and Turbo are three of the most talked-about new meme coins to buy today. BTFD Coin has been making waves with its presale success, having already sold over 70 billion tokens and raised more than $6 million . Meanwhile, Moo Deng and Turbo are navigating the bullish market trends and have become popular for their community-driven ecosystems. So, what sets these coins apart, and which is worth your investment? Over the past few years, meme coins have evolved from quirky, speculative investments into legitimate assets with strong followings and utility. The rise of meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu opened the floodgates, and now new projects are entering the scene with greater ambition. BTFD Coin is leading the charge with its innovative approach, offering more than just hype— BTFD Coin has integrated features like a Play2Earn game , staking rewards , and a referral program . On the other hand, Moo Deng and Turbo are riding the wave of bullish market trends, with strong community engagement and well-planned tokenomics. As the Top New Meme Coins to Buy Today , these coins offer more than just excitement—they are backed by solid strategies that could result in long-term growth. As BTFD Coin continues to dominate the presale stage with impressive results, it’s clear that its innovative ecosystem is capturing investor attention. But Moo Deng and Turbo are proving that the meme coin market is full of opportunity for those who are willing to explore a range of potential investments. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolutionizing the Space If you’re looking for Top New Meme Coins to Buy Today , BTFD Coin is a strong contender. The coin’s presale success has been remarkable, having raised over $6 million and sold over 70 billion tokens to more than 10,700 holders . What makes BTFD Coin stand out in the crowded meme coin space is its real-world utility and the incentives it offers to long-term holders. The Play2Earn game , which launched its full version on January 1, 2025, is one of the key features that sets BTFD Coin apart from other meme coins. Players can earn BTFD Coin tokens by participating in the game, providing a clear use case for the coin that drives both demand and engagement. The 90% APY staking rewards , which went live on December 2, 2024, further encourage long-term investment by offering substantial returns for those who choose to stake their tokens. Additionally, BTFD Coin has a referral program that rewards users for bringing others into the community. This creates a viral effect, helping to expand the BTFD Coin ecosystem at an exponential rate. The coin also has a strong, passionate community known as the Bulls Squad , which has played a pivotal role in driving the coin’s success. With Stage 14 of the presale currently offering a 100% bonus through the LAUNCH100 bonus code , there has never been a better time to invest. This limited-time offer means that every BTFD Coin token you purchase during this stage will be doubled , making this presale even more enticing. For those considering an investment, here’s an example of how BTFD Coin ‘s price could evolve. If you were to invest $75,000 at the current presale price of $0.00016 , you would receive 468.75 million tokens . When BTFD Coin hits $0.0006 after its presale, your investment would be worth $281,250 . If BTFD Coin skyrockets to its predicted moon price of $0.006 , your $75,000 investment could turn into a staggering $4.687 million —a nearly 62x return. Moo Deng: The Meme Coin with Strong Community Backing Another strong contender for the Top New Meme Coins to Buy Today is Moo Deng . This meme coin has grown in popularity thanks to its strong community support and engagement . Moo Deng has steadily built a dedicated following, and it’s quickly becoming one of the go-to meme coins for investors looking for something new in the market. Moo Deng ‘s strategy revolves around community-driven initiatives , with a focus on creating a loyal user base that can help push the coin’s value higher over time. The coin has gained attention for its tokenomics , offering exclusive rewards to holders and active community members . As a meme coin, Moo Deng ‘s success is driven largely by its ability to keep users engaged and create a sense of belonging. The Moo Deng team has made it clear that they want to create more than just a speculative investment; they aim to build a coin that fosters long-term value. However, the coin does face competition in a crowded meme coin market. While its community is strong, Moo Deng has yet to see the explosive growth that some other meme coins have enjoyed in the past. Still, with the current bullish market trends, Moo Deng could be poised for a big jump if it continues to deliver on its promises of rewards and engagement. Turbo: The Meme Coin with Speed and Innovation Turbo is another up-and-coming coin in the meme coin market that has gained attention due to its innovative approach and strong development team. The project focuses on speed and efficiency , which has made it a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts who are looking for a fast-paced, exciting investment. Turbo is quickly establishing itself as one of the Top New Meme Coins to Buy Today , particularly for those who value technological innovation in their investments. What makes Turbo unique is its focus on blockchain scalability and transaction speed , which makes it ideal for use cases in industries like gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi). The Turbo team is committed to making the coin a key player in these spaces, which gives it significant potential for long-term growth. However, like Moo Deng , Turbo faces the challenge of standing out in a market filled with meme coins. While Turbo is still in its early stages, it’s drawing attention from both investors and the crypto community for its innovative features and engaged development team . The future of Turbo looks promising, especially if it can continue to grow its user base and deliver on its goals.

40441581,https://nulltx.com/?p=145025,1739776585,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Cardano’s Market Struggles While RCO Finance Gains Traction for a 50,000% Upside",https://nulltx.com/cardanos-market-struggles-while-rco-finance-gains-traction-for-a-50000-upside/,"Cardano (ADA), once hailed as a top blockchain project, is facing increasing market struggles as investor sentiment weakens. Despite its strong fundamentals and ongoing development efforts, ADA has been unable to regain its previous highs, with concerns over network adoption and competition weighing on its price. Meanwhile, broader market volatility and a lack of strong bullish catalysts have further slowed enthusiasm for the asset. As a result, many investors are exploring alternative opportunities that offer higher upside potential. One such opportunity is RCO Finance (RCOF), a rising player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector that is gaining significant traction. With its innovative approach to yield farming, staking, liquidity provision, and DeFi trading, RCOF has captured the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Market analysts predict that its rapid adoption and strong utility could lead to an astronomical 50,000% upside, making it an attractive option for those seeking exponential gains. As Cardano (ADA) struggles to find momentum, RCOF’s impressive growth trajectory highlights the shifting dynamics within the crypto landscape. Cardano’s Market Challenges Cardano (ADA) has been facing a downward trend, with its price declining by over 15% in the past two weeks and more than 25% over the past month, according to CoinGecko data. This decline is partly attributed to large investors, or “whales,” offloading substantial ADA holdings in search of better high-yield alternative assets. Technical indicators also point to bearish momentum. The Average Directional Index (ADX), a tool used to gauge trend strength, has risen from 11.2 to 41.6 within five days, signaling a strong downward trend for Cardano (ADA). Additionally, a significant amount of ADA, valued at over $4.66 million, is at risk of liquidation if the price rebounds toward the $0.77 resistance level, indicating aggressive bearish bets in the market. These concerns further reinforce investors’ resolve to diversify to projects like RCO finance (RCOF), which has 50,000% upside potential. RCO Finance’s Rise Amid Cardano Market Struggles Amid Cardano’s struggles, RCO Finance (RCOF) is capturing investor attention with its innovative approach to DeFi trading. Backed by the $450 billion DeFi market, the RCOF token is poised to see a massive surge in the coming months. Unlike traditional systems, which rely on centralized third parties, RCOF provides a secure, low-cost, and highly efficient platform designed for digital asset trading. The ecosystem also provides an AI-powered DeFi trading tool that gives traders an edge in the highly sophisticated decentralized finance market. Some groundbreaking features of the RCOF ecosystem include high-yield staking programs, secure, low-fee transactions, and a governance system for token holders. These features have positioned RCO Finance as a high-potential player in the DeFi space, attracting both retail and institutional investors looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto market. Investment Potential and Market Sentiment The contrasting trajectories of Cardano (ADA) and RCO Finance (RCOF) highlight a shift in investor sentiment. While Cardano (ADA) faces challenges in maintaining its market position, RCO Finance’s innovative features and robust security measures are positioning it as a promising alternative in the DeFi space. Investors are particularly drawn to RCO Finance’s staking opportunities, which offer significantly higher yields than the industry average. Additionally, the platform provides trading fee discounts for investors who hold RCOF tokens, further incentivizing participation. The ongoing presale of RCOF tokens has been met with enthusiasm, raising over $12 million. Currently, in its fifth stage, RCOF tokens are priced at $0.10 each, with expectations of listing at $0.60. Experts anticipate that RCOF could experience an extraordinary rise of 50,000%, significantly outpacing Cardano’s projected growth. RCOF Has Launched Its Beta Platform The RCOF beta platform is live and open so users can have a firsthand feel of all the innovative features and tools before the mainnet launch. Users can test all the features and send their feedback to the RCOF team. The feedback will help the team improve the ecosystem features before the full launch. Over 10,000 users are currently testing the beta platform, an indication of the growing enthusiasm for the project. RCO Finance: A New Dawn For the Future of DeFi Trading RCO Finance (RCOF) is redefining the decentralized finance market by incorporating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to provide traders with a trading edge to thrive in the DeFi space. The groundbreaking tool within the RCOF ecosystem is the Robo Advisor, a sophisticated AI-powered DeFi trading tool. This cutting-edge AI system monitors market movements in real-time, analyzing trends and identifying potential high-growth assets before they take off. By deploying its deep-learning algorithms, the Robo Advisor provides traders with early insights, enabling them to stay ahead of the market and capitalize on emerging opportunities. A prime example of its effectiveness is the explosive rise of the $FULLSEND token , which surged over 600% in the last 24 hours. While most investors only recognized the trend after the rally was well underway, RCOF’s AI is designed to detect such patterns early, allowing users to position themselves and take advantage of such opportunities. Beyond simply identifying trends, the Robo Advisor offers precise, data-driven recommendations for optimal entry and exit points that ensure maximum returns. This ensures traders can maximize profits while reducing risk exposure. Real-time alerts notify users when breakout assets are on the verge of significant price movement. Another standout feature of the Robo Advisor is its ability to mitigate risk. If an asset shows signs of an impending crash, the AI instantly alerts traders, helping them avoid losses before a decline occurs. For instance, the $AIAT token suffered a sharp 35% drop in just 24 hours. RCOF’s predictive technology aims to anticipate such declines and warn traders and investors, helping them safeguard their portfolios against sudden market volatility. Unlike conventional signal-based trading systems, this advanced AI customizes investment strategies based on each user’s financial goals and risk tolerance. Whether an investor prioritizes rapid, short-term gains or long-term wealth accumulation, the Robo Advisor tailors its recommendations to enhance portfolio performance. RCOF is also pioneering real-world asset tokenization, breaking down traditional financial barriers and expanding investment opportunities. Through fractional ownership of high-value assets, the platform democratizes access to assets that were previously available only to institutional investors. By leveraging blockchain technology, RCOF enables users to invest in tokenized real estate, commodities, and other high-yield assets, promoting greater financial inclusivity. Additionally, privacy and financial autonomy remain key pillars of RCOF’s ecosystem. Operating within a decentralized, KYC-free framework, the platform ensures user anonymity while maintaining highly effective security protocols. Investors can explore a vast selection of over 120,000 assets across 12,500 categories, ranging from stocks and bonds to tokenized commodities and digital assets. To enhance user confidence and decision-making, RCOF integrates live market data from top-tier financial sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters. By providing real-time analytics and insights, the platform equips investors with the tools they need to stay ahead of the market trend. RCOF Presale: A Life-Changing 50,000% ROI While the Cardano market struggles, RCOF’s combination of AI-powered trading tools, real-world asset tokenization, and a privacy-centric DeFi framework positions the platform to redefine the future of decentralized investing. The presale is already in its fifth stage, raising over $12 million so far. The token is currently priced at $0.1 and will rise to $0.13 for the next presale phase. According to market experts, a modest $1000 investment in the presale could yield a staggering $545, 600 by Q2 2025. Join the presale now to capitalize on the potential life-changing returns. There are reports that the team is planning a $100,000 giveaway for early investors when the project hits the $250,000 milestone. RCOF’s smart contract has been thoroughly audited by SolidProof, a globally renowned blockchain security company, and they found no vulnerability.

However, analyst Kim Wong has defended the project, highlighting its widespread adoption, decentralized blockchain, and compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations as proof of credibility. Despite his arguments, concerns remain about its referral-based mining system, past data breaches, and potential legal risks. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Wong responded to criticism, emphasizing Pi Network’s unique benefits, including seamless cross-border transactions, free mobile mining, and a vast user base. He claimed that the project has provided financial access to millions worldwide. According to him, Pi coin is distributed in over 200 countries, with over 100 million registered users , including 65 million active participants and nearly 19 million KYC-verified users. Additionally, around 10.5 million people already hold Pi in their wallets. Wong pointed to Pi Network’s in-house KYC system, which ensures compliance with government regulations, adding credibility to the project. He also described its Layer 1 blockchain as decentralized, fast, and scalable, supporting a growing Web3 ecosystem. Wong challenged skeptics, asking them to name another crypto network with the same level of global adoption and real-world use. “If you still don’t understand Pi Network or think it’s a scam, you’re falling behind and need to catch up,” Wong said. Despite these statements, many critics remain doubtful. Some argue that the project is only moving forward now because of recent shifts in regulations. Others believe Pi’s referral-based mining makes it resemble a pyramid scheme. The project has also faced accusations of a data breach , with reports in 2021 claiming that Pi Network was responsible for leaking personal information of 10,000 Vietnamese citizens. The team denied these allegations. Meanwhile, Pi Network continues to gain mainstream traction. The project’s official account recently surpassed Ethereum ( ETH ) in followers on X. Pi coin has also been listed on multiple exchanges, including OKX, Bitget, and MEXC , with Gate.io announcing Pi trading support.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Ahmedabad conducted the operation, tracking the assets through detailed analysis of wallet transactions and dark web activity. Alongside the digital assets, officials also confiscated a luxury vehicle, cash, and electronic devices. The crackdown is part of an ongoing effort to dismantle the fraudulent scheme that operated from 2016 to 2018. BitConnect lured investors with promises of high returns, claiming to use an automated trading bot to generate profits. However, authorities confirmed it was nothing more than a Ponzi scheme, where funds from new investors were used to pay earlier participants. Victims were encouraged to deposit Bitcoin or cash into the platform, believing they would earn massive gains. Instead, the money was funneled into wallets controlled by the scheme’s operators. Investigators traced the movement of these funds across multiple wallets, many of which were intentionally hidden using the dark web. Despite the complex laundering attempts, detailed tracking of IP addresses, wallet flows, and blockchain activity led authorities to the assets. This latest seizure follows legal action against BitConnect’s founder, Satish Kumbhani , and its chief US promoter, Glenn Arcaro. Arcaro was sentenced to 38 months in prison in 2022 and ordered to repay $17.6 million to victims across 40 countries. Meanwhile, Kumbhani faces multiple charges, including wire fraud, commodity price manipulation, and international money laundering. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 70 years in prison. However, he remains a fugitive and has yet to be captured. The BitConnect scheme defrauded investors of an estimated $2.4 billion before collapsing when authorities uncovered its deceptive practices. The ED’s latest action highlights the continued pursuit of justice for victims and reinforces global efforts to combat financial fraud in the crypto sector.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-17 07:22:44

Terrett’s comments addressed speculation about whether the SEC’s acknowledgment of XRP ETFs implies that the agency now considers it a commodity. SEC’s Acknowledgment vs. XRP Classification According to Terrett, the SEC has acknowledged that issuers are applying for an ETF product that treats XRP as a commodity asset within a securities wrapper. This framework is consistent with how Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have been categorized in ETF applications. However, she clarifies that this acknowledgment does not necessarily equate to the SEC explicitly classifying XRP as a commodity. Instead, it signals that issuers are proposing XRP-based ETF products under the same regulatory structure as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Terrett also notes that the SEC has recently acknowledged ETFs tied to other digital assets, including Solana (SOL) , Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA). This suggests that the Commission is willing to consider ETFs for cryptocurrencies that the previous SEC administration may have viewed as securities. For those asking — here are my thoughts on the questions about whether the @SECGov has classified $XRP a commodity by way of the ETF acknowledgements. https://t.co/iSbvYskpi9 — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) February 15, 2025 SEC Litigation and Regulatory Uncertainty Another key point in Terrett’s analysis is the SEC’s approach to ongoing litigation related to digital assets. She highlights that the agency has paused certain legal proceedings while its crypto task force assesses the regulatory landscape. This move indicates that the SEC may be reconsidering its stance on the classification of various digital assets, including XRP. This regulatory pause aligns with broader trends in the crypto industry, where multiple legal battles have shaped the classification of digital assets. Notably, in July 2023, a U.S. federal court ruled that XRP was not a security when sold on secondary markets. However, the SEC has continued to scrutinize the asset, leaving its definitive classification unresolved. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Avoiding the Appearance of Favoritism Terrett also suggests that the SEC’s acknowledgment of these ETF applications may stem from a desire to avoid the perception of favoritism. By recognizing applications for multiple cryptocurrency-based ETFs, including assets that were previously considered securities, the SEC may be attempting to present a more neutral regulatory approach. This could be an effort to ensure consistency and avoid accusations of picking winners and losers within the digital asset industry. What This Means for XRP and the Crypto Market The SEC’s acknowledgment of XRP-related ETF applications is significant, as it indicates a willingness to consider XRP under a regulatory framework similar to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, Terrett cautions against interpreting this as a definitive classification. Until the SEC engages more substantively with these applications, it remains uncertain how the agency ultimately views XRP. The broader implication of these developments is that the SEC’s stance on cryptocurrency regulation is evolving. With the crypto task force actively reviewing various assets and legal challenges shaping regulatory interpretations, the classification of XRP and other cryptocurrencies remains subject to change.

In just two weeks, it has outpaced all similar offerings in both price performance and liquidity. Initially soaring to $100 before settling at $48, STRK continues to trade at volumes seven times higher than the average for comparable securities. On February 15, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor highlighted STRK’s rapid rise, emphasizing its strong demand. He noted that, out of 115 preferred securities listed in the US since 2022, STRK ranked first in price gains and volume. According to data, it rose 1.3% on its first day, gained 8% in its first week, and ended its second week 17.6% higher , outperforming competitors by nearly 19%. The surge in interest reflects investor confidence, despite price fluctuations. STRK peaked at $100 on launch day before dropping to $52 within a week and later stabilizing at $48. Strategy introduced STRK on January 27 to raise capital for Bitcoin purchases, surpassing expectations by securing $563.4 million—nearly three times the initial target. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s biggest advocates, Michael Saylor and Nayib Bukele , recently met at El Salvador’s presidential palace to discuss Bitcoin’s global expansion. Saylor revealed that their conversation focused on increasing adoption, positioning El Salvador as a key player in the crypto industry. Following the meeting, speculation arose about Strategy potentially moving its headquarters to El Salvador, a move similar to Tether’s recent shift. However, this remains unlikely as the company maintains a strong US presence, where regulatory conditions are improving. Under Bukele’s leadership, El Salvador has established itself as a major Bitcoin holder, while Strategy remains the largest corporate investor in BTC. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Strategy holds 478,740 BTC , while El Salvador’s national reserve currently holds 6,079 BTC.",,EN,0,0,STRK|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-17 07:26:08

In an interview with crypto investigator Coffeezilla today, Hayden claimed that the entire thing spiraled out of his control after President Javier Milei publicly endorsed the token, only for the market to crash almost immediately. Hayden, who described himself as a “launch strategist” rather than the mastermind behind the project, said he has been under intense scrutiny, receiving threats, accusations, and pressure from all sides. He claimed that he never had any intention of running off with the money and is waiting to hear from the Milei administration, but with government officials staying silent, the fate of the funds remains uncertain. Hayden also believes that the way Javier handled the situation is why the token failed, accusing the president of lying when he said he didn’t know much about the project and was just trying to support them like he tends to with small businesses. Both Hayden and Jupiter exchange have said that Javier was in on the creation of $LIBRA right from the beginning, which is around 3 weeks ago. Javier’s endorsement, the market crash, and the vanishing act Javier tweeted his support for $LIBRA on Friday night, triggering a massive speculative rush as investors scrambled to buy into what many assumed was a government-backed meme coin. But within hours, $LIBRA’s value plummeted, wiping out $4.6 billion in what is now the largest crypto rug pull in history. Javier then quickly deleted his tweet and distanced himself from the project, providing a very vague explanation for the sudden turnaround, and he has mostly been silent ever since. The backlash has been intense. Argentinian lawmakers have called for Javier’s impeachment, investors are demanding refunds, and over a dozen law firms have sued him. Not to mention the damage this has done to his reputation. You see, Javier is something of an economic genius, and a libertarian. He has managed to do with Argentina what no president has ever done, which is to actually fix its economy and make the peso “great again,” or maybe just “great,” since realistically, it’s never been great before. Now Javier’s a meme, a joke, and even his closest allies are publicly slamming him. Inside the launch: Snipers, insiders, and allegations of market manipulation Moving on, Hayden admitted that $LIBRA’s launch was plagued by insider trading and sniping, with algorithmic traders and select individuals securing massive allocations before retail investors could react. He described the process as a predatory system where sophisticated traders use bots to buy up large amounts of tokens within milliseconds, artificially inflating prices before dumping their holdings onto unsuspecting buyers. “Every single meme coin launch gets sniped. It’s unavoidable,” Hayden said. “A handful of elite traders figure out how to extract liquidity before the public even has a chance.” But he didn’t deny that insiders had access before the public. Hayden acknowledged that some individuals were aware of the launch in advance and had positioned themselves accordingly. “I can’t say nobody knew,” he admitted. “There were people who were in on it before the public. That’s how every meme coin works.” The sniping issue wasn’t unique to $LIBRA. Other high-profile political meme coins—including the Melania Trump token (which Hayden was also a part of creating)—were also structured in ways that benefited insiders first, according to Hayden. “The biggest guys always win,” he said. $100 million in limbo with no plan to return it The biggest unanswered question is what happens to the $100 million that Hayden is holding. Investors who bought into $LIBRA at its peak want their money back, but Hayden said there is no clear process for refunds. Hayden outlined four possible options for dealing with the funds: No refunds, and instead donate the money to an Argentinian nonprofit. A refund process, though tracking individual losses would be complex and time-consuming. Re-injecting the $100 million into the market, essentially artificially pumping $LIBRA’s price back to its all-time high. A hybrid solution, distributing funds while also supporting the token’s market stability. But Hayden also acknowledged that re-injecting money into the market could create another insider opportunity. If traders knew that a massive buy order was coming, they could purchase the token in advance, ride the price increase, and dump at the peak—repeating the cycle of market manipulation. “If I announce the money is going back in, every trader with a brain is going to buy the dip and profit off it,” Hayden said. “It just creates another insider trading situation.” He also claimed that he can’t hand over the money yet because it’s the only “leverage” he has left in negotiating with government officials. “If I give up control of the money, I lose any power I have in this situation,” he said . “I need answers from Javier’s team before I make a move.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",News|ARS|JUP|LIBRA|SOL,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|JUP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-17 07:28:45

The company is refining its product offerings, updating its website, and adapting to the evolving financial landscape. The move signals a new phase in its development as it seeks to transform how value moves globally. On February 14, Ripple shared its rebranding announcement on X, emphasizing its commitment to innovation in financial transactions. The company highlighted that its vision remains the same—creating seamless value transfer worldwide. A major part of this shift includes the introduction of revised product offerings. Ripple is now streamlining its services to focus on cross-border payments, digital asset custody, and stablecoins to meet rising market demands . Ripple’s payment network, built on the XRP Ledger, enables instant global transactions using both fiat and cryptocurrencies. The company recently strengthened its payment infrastructure through a partnership with Unicâmbio, a Portuguese currency exchange provider. This collaboration enhances money transfers between Portugal and Brazil using blockchain-powered solutions. Following its acquisition of Standard Custody last year, Ripple expanded into digital asset custody, offering secure storage services for banks and fintech firms. The firm sees great potential in this market, estimated to grow to $20 trillion , driven by increasing institutional demand for digital assets. Ripple is also advancing into stablecoins with the launch of Ripple USD (RLUSD). Since its introduction in December, RLUSD has reached a market capitalization of approximately $108.6 million. Reports indicate that the asset has already generated over $3 trillion in trading volume within a month, highlighting significant market interest. As part of its rebrand, Ripple has made notable updates to its website. XRP advocate WrathofKahneman pointed out that all references to Central Bank Digital Currencies ( CBDCs ) have been removed. Ripple had previously engaged in CBDC pilot programs, including one in Palau and the launch of a dedicated CBDC platform in 2023. This change suggests a potential strategic shift, with the company now prioritizing stablecoin adoption over government-backed digital currencies.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|FIAT|XRP|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-17 07:28:54

This acquisition, disclosed in a February 14 SEC filing, highlights the fund’s growing interest in digital assets and positions it as the seventh-largest known holder of IBIT. Mubadala’s investment secured over 8.2 million IBIT shares in the fourth quarter of 2024, marking its first reported position in the ETF . The fund now joins a list of major institutional investors, including Goldman Sachs, Millennium Management, and Symmetry Investments. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that this move reinforces Bitcoin’s increasing adoption among large financial entities. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pointed out that Mubadala is just one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth funds, hinting that other state-backed investment firms might also be exposed to Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts suggest this aligns with the UAE’s broader strategy to establish itself as a global blockchain hub . Abu Dhabi has positioned itself as a prime destination for crypto businesses, introducing progressive regulations that attract industry leaders looking for a supportive investment environment. Mubadala’s decision reflects a wider trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption worldwide. Some policymakers have even proposed that Bitcoin be considered as part of strategic financial reserves. US Senator Cynthia Lummis reacted to Mubadala’s investment by stating that a global Bitcoin race is underway. “I told you the race was on. It’s time for America to win,” she posted on X. Lummis has introduced the Bitcoin Act of 2024, which proposes selling a portion of the US government's gold reserves to acquire Bitcoin. The bill aims to secure 1 million BTC , representing approximately 5% of the total supply. Although the federal government’s stance remains uncertain, multiple US states have taken independent steps toward integrating Bitcoin into their financial systems. Over 20 states have introduced or passed legislation to support cryptocurrency investments. Industry leaders see these efforts as a sign that the US is on track to becoming a leading pro-Bitcoin nation, driven by state-level initiatives and growing institutional interest.",,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BNB|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-17 07:31:40

After multiple failed attempts to break key resistance levels despite the previous bullish momentum, the SOL price is now feared to plunge below the multi-month support level, raising concerns over the upcoming price action. One of the major reasons for the downfall is controversy surrounding the ecosystem with scams linked to memecoins like LIBRA, Pumpfun, and Meteora, leading to community concerns. The immense hate towards the memecoins has badly affected the Solana ecosystem, including the SOL price. The total value locked (TVL) has slashed from the highs above $12 billion to $8.9 billion; volume plunged from $35 billion to as low as $2.5 billion, while the number of transactions continues to grow. The above data from Defilama suggests that traders are uncertain about the next price action. The drop in volume suggests there is less demand for the token, while the rise in the transaction suggests a rise in the individual transactions. Besides, the open interest (OI) has also dropped from $6.5B to $4.1B ever since the price faced rejection from its ATH at $296, validating the uncertainty among the market participants. What’s next? Can the Bulls manage to defend the support at $180? Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana Price has been one of the strongest cryptos that has maintained a substantial trend for a long time. Meanwhile, the rise of the memecoins on the platform has circulated bearish waves over the token. The SOL price has broken down from pivotal support, which does not appear to be a part of a healthy ascending trend. The above chart flashes massive bearish signals for the SOL price rally. The price is about to validate a breakdown below the crucial 200-day MA at $183.47 and the OBV is maintaining a descending trend, forming lower highs and lows. The price drop accumulated with a bearish OBV confirms the bearish divergence. Hence, the token that just slipped out of the top 5 is expected to enter the pivotal resistance zone between $181.99 and $178.50. If the bulls fail to hold within the range, a drop below $170 could be imminent for the Solana (SOL) price rally ahead this week.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-17 07:38:15

Virtually all majors have delivered gains well beyond the 100x multiplier, starting with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Let’s explore what makes a moonshot and what to keep an eye on. Finding The Crypto Bluechips Analysts emphasize the importance of identifying projects with real-world utility, strong tokenomics, active development teams, and last, but not least, strong and loyal communities that consistently spread the good word. Unlike vaporware projects and meme coins which rely solely on hype, it’s cryptocurrencies that have a clear use case, a solid roadmap, and partnerships that indicate long-term viability. Researching the team behind the project is crucial—transparent, experienced developers with a history of delivering on promises inspire confidence and reduce the risk of rug pulls. Market timing is also key. Many early-stage projects fly under the radar before gaining mainstream attention. By tracking social sentiment, on-chain data, and presale allocations, investors can get in before these outliers hit the radar of mainstream awareness. Platforms like Solana and Avalanche saw massive runs once their ecosystems matured, rewarding early adopters with generational gains. In addition to this, another key component for surefire success is keeping track of narratives. When DeFi and crypto gaming were hot between 2020 and 2021, most projects in either niche rallied to unprecedented heights, with the likes of Chainlink and Aave leading the charge on the DeFi front. This year’s major narratives are shaping up to be RWA tokenization and AI, with analysts expecting a resurgence of gaming-focused projects as well. This is why, many savvy investors are frontrunning the masses and bidding heavily on Web3 casino Rollblock, which is currently making waves on socials, with them to deliver life-changing returns. With its innovative approach that merges DeFi and online gambling in a unified, first-of-its-kind GambleFi platform, Rollblock promises to change the game forever. Rollblock Is Making Dreams Come True Rollblock is poised to disrupt the $450 billion online gambling industry thanks to its cutting-edge blockchain-native framework. The casino will offer a high-end gambling experience fortified by superior transparency and state-of-the-art security protocols that will make the tampering of bets virtually impossible. Aside from its native token RBLK, Rollblock supports 20 major cryptocurrencies, allowing for greater versatility in payment options. The casino boasts more than 7,000 games, from favorites such as blackjack and roulette to live games, and new, AI-powered titles. More than 50,000 players have already joined the Rollblock ranks and hundreds more are signing up every day. One of the casino’s star features is the novel revenue-sharing mechanism which will allow the community to earn passive income while playing their favorite games. Here’s how it works: Rollblock will reinvest a portion of its weekly profits to buy back RBLK on the open market. 60% of this amount will then be burned creating deflationary pressure which will prime the RBLK token for scarcity-driven growth. The remaining 40% will be redistributed to users as recurring staking rewards, granting some of the highest APY in the space. Stage 10 of the presale is selling out fast and demand is skyrocketing. RBLK tokens are priced at just $0.055, which is the perfect entry point for investors who want to be on the winning side of the GambleFi revolution. By the end of the presale alone, analysts expect an 800% rally and once RBLK hits the markets, the path to 100x will kick off.

He posed the question on X of why BTC isn’t going to be widely adopted and hit seven figures before providing a list of things he expects to see this year. Investor Fred Krueger said the best argument is that Bitcoin doesn’t scale. However, wrapped versions of it on other chains do, he added. “It can be wrapped to interoperate with all sorts of systems. In a way, the ETFs are a wrapper that abstracts custody/trading, and port into traditional financial accounts,” agreed Horsley. What’s the current best argument for why Bitcoin isn’t going to be widely adopted and go to $1M? I see more and more evidence of why it will, and less and less of why it won’t. — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) February 17, 2025 Bitcoin in 2025 The Bitwise boss provided a list of things he expects to see in 2025 that will accelerate the adoption of BTC. There will be more flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, he said. The eleven products in the United States have already seen a cumulative $40 billion in inflows since they launched just over a year ago. Horsley predicted that more corporations and more nation-states would also start buying BTC in 2025. There are already 22 US states that have filed legislation to enable their treasuries to invest in Bitcoin and crypto. US wealth management firms will be buying the asset for their clients while banks and financial institutions will launch services to help clients access Bitcoin, he predicted. Regulators will create “productive clarity” while global geopolitics and monetary policy will “increase in circumstances that drive the need for Bitcoin,” he said. “You’re going to see more reputable people revealing their conviction in Bitcoin,” he said before concluding, “It’s going to be a watershed year.” Bitcoin educator and investor Mark Moss concurred, stating that “this cycle is much different than the last ones,” before adding that there is ETF demand, sovereign buyers, and corporate treasuries. “New money is absorbing supply at scale.” Everyone’s worried about when to sell Bitcoin when they should be worried about never owning enough. This cycle is much different than the last ones. ETF demand. Sovereign buyers. Corporate treasuries. New money is absorbing supply at scale.

The asset has shed 1.5% from its weekend highs to dip below $96,000 during the Monday trading session in Asia.

According to the Bitcoin analyst Julian Fahrer by the end of 2024, 12 states have reported owning a total of $330 million in Strategy stock. This includes major pension funds in California, Florida, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. These investments are helping states indirectly gain exposure to Bitcoin, as Strategy’s massive Bitcoin holdings make it a proxy for investing in the cryptocurrency . International public funds also holding $MSTR : Canada: Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan ($15m) South Korea: National Pension Service ($63m) — Julian Fahrer (@Julian__Fahrer) February 16, 2025 California Leads with Largest Bitcoin-Backed Holdings California is the largest state investor in Strategy, with its State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) holding 285,785 shares worth around $83 million. Other California state funds, such as the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), also have significant investments in Strategy. CalPERS holds 264,713 shares, valued at $76 million. These funds have become heavily involved with Strategy as the company’s business model focuses on Bitcoin acquisition , making its stock a popular choice for states looking to capitalize on the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. Julian Fahrer also noted that international public funds are also holding significant amounts of Strategy’s stock. These include the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan in Canada, with $15 million in MSTR, and South Korea’s National Pension Service, holding $63 million. Strategy’s Bitcoin Playbook and Recent Gains Strategy is not just an ordinary tech company—it has a massive Bitcoin treasury. As of February 2025, it holds 478,740 Bitcoins , worth an estimated $46 billion. Recently, the company acquired 7,633 additional Bitcoins, which cost around $742 million. This strategy of accumulating Bitcoin has proven profitable for the company, with its stock gaining 16.5% in early 2025 and a massive 383% over the past year, far outperforming the broader crypto market. A Risky but Rewarding Bet on Bitcoin Despite its success, Strategy has also faced challenges. In its Q4 2024 earnings report, the company revealed a $670.8 million loss due to a $1 billion impairment charge on its Bitcoin holdings. These losses highlight the risks associated with such a large investment in a volatile asset like Bitcoin. However, Strategy remains confident in its long-term Bitcoin strategy, which is central to its corporate vision. The company is also pushing forward with its “ 21/21 plan ,” aiming to raise $42 billion over the next three years to further expand its Bitcoin investments. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Metaplanet Boosts Bitcoin Holdings to $159M Amid Japan’s Economic Struggles , Why States Are Investing in Strategy For many states, investing in Strategy allows states to gain Bitcoin exposure indirectly, offering a potential way to benefit from Bitcoin’s rise without directly buying the cryptocurrency. Looking at the increasing Bitcoin potential, West Virginia Senator Chris Rose recently introduced the Inflation Protection Act of 2025, which would allow the state treasury to invest in digital assets like crypto and precious metals. This move follows a trend sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President who set up a group to explore a federal digital asset reserve. States like Utah and Kentucky are also making strides in this direction. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

But while Cardano holders celebrate, smart investors are marching towards Panshibi for obvious reasons. The stats don’t stutter! This new viral panda token is making waves with its high-energy presale, which has amassed close to $1M within 4 weeks of its presale. The meteoric rise of Panshibi – a project built on ERC20 coins – has captured the imagination of investors looking for high-growth prospects compared to what Cardano has to offer. The burning question is: Which will deliver in the bull market? Let’s dig in! Panshibi: The viral panda-themed new crypto with explosive potential While Panshibi is a meme coin, its new crypto movement isn’t just about hype but real utility, smart innovation, and explosive growth potential. Over the years, several meme tokens have popped, but this one? It’s different! This new altcoin is different because it’s got both strong tokenomics and actual use cases that make it more than just an internet joke. Panshibi is Inspired by the iconic panda and infused with Asian cultural elements, making it one of the most talked-about projects for 2025. With a Social-Fi and AI ecosystem, the Panshibi project extends beyond just being a token. Token holders get a chance to belong to an inclusive AI-driven social-fi ecosystem that offers limitless possibilities. The crypto team behind Panshibi isn’t just hoping for a pump; they’re investing in a project designed to last. They believe the main problem with meme token adoption is its unsustainable operation over time. Often, meme coins crash because they offer nothing beyond speculative trading. Again, Panshibi is different in these aspects! With a ten-year liquidity lock and two-team token lock, Panshibi provides security and stability that many competitors lack. This long-term vision prevents early adopters from facing the same pump-and-dump schemes that have plagued the meme coin space. Cardano price prediction: Grayscale’s ETF bet sends price soaring to $1.3 Many altcoins, like Cardano (ADA), have posted impressive price recoveries recently despite Bitcoin struggling to maintain the psychological $100,000. Recently, ADA’s positive momentum was boosted by developments involving exchange-traded funds impacting the altcoins. Crypto investment company Grayscale reportedly filed for a Cardano-focused ETF, boosting the altcoins’ performance with a whopping 11% gain. With the application for a Cardano ETF, Grayscale is positioning itself to expand ADA’s offerings, attract institutional interest and buck up use cases for the altcoin. With the latest Cardano price prediction, ADA is expected to ride this positive wave to the $1.3 psychological level. While ADA is still down from its peak of $1 in mid-February, its recent price action has left the market speculating that a continued bullish trend could be on the horizon, especially if the ETF gains approval from the SEC. Early Panshibi investors get the whole package: Act now! Cardano’s recent ecosystem wins have been astonishing! However, it’s nowhere near the potential of Panshibi . Investors and holders earn a whopping 1200% APY on its stake-to-earn program, in-platform rewards and exclusive VIP perks. After raising close to $1M, the Panshibi presale is nearing its next crypto milestone, signaling strong investor confidence. The presale consists of 15 stages, each increasing the price and handing significant gains to investors. Currently, at presale stage 4, Panshibi tokens are available on their official website at a discount of $0.005. During the presale, the price will increase by 1,200%, allowing early investors to benefit from a structured and predictable rise in value. Crypto gurus’ predictions suggest a 145,000% jump post-launch, making Panshibi the breakout star of 2025.

Reddit Investor Gives Insight",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/dogecoin-price-struggles-to-recover-from-recent-35-downturn/,"The post Stick With DOGE or Make 8,200% With Viral Alternative? Reddit Investor Gives Insight appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Dogecoin price’s 35% monthly decline has sparked fresh debates about the long-term viability of meme-driven assets. As DOGE struggles to hold above $0.27, traders are shifting focus toward platforms blending innovation with real-world utility. Meme coins, while culturally resonant, face growing skepticism due to their reliance on hype over technical progress. This has led many to explore emerging projects with audited frameworks and hybrid trading models. Among them, a new DeFi platform has captured attention after raising $14.6 million in its presale. Its unique approach could redefine how retail and institutional traders interact, positioning it as a potential game-changer ahead of its Q2 debut. Dogecoin Price Struggles to Recover From Recent 35% Downturn The Dogecoin price has faced challenges regaining momentum after a steep 35% drop over the past month. Despite a modest 5.5% rise in weekly charts, DOGE remains stuck below the $0.30 resistance level, trading near $0.27 as selling pressure builds. This downturn reflects broader caution in the meme coin sector, where volumes have dipped alongside fading retail enthusiasm. While DOGE’s long-term community support remains strong, its reliance on social sentiment exposes it during turbulent periods. Experts think the project’s limited technical upgrades could further exacerbate the situation, making it harder for DOGE to compete with tokens offering clearer utility. Source: Dogecoin Price, CoinMarketCap In contrast, newer platforms are attracting attention by blending memetic appeal with real-world use cases. For instance, projects emphasizing decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure or hybrid trading models are gaining favor as investors seek stability. Pepe and Shiba Inu Momentum Falters as Meme Coin Sector Slows Pepe and Shiba Inu have mirrored the Dogecoin price struggles, with both tokens failing to revive the explosive momentum that once defined the meme coin market. Shiba Inu’s 22% monthly decline aligns with a sector-wide correction, signaling that traders are rotating capital into assets with clearer roadmaps. Even Pepe, which briefly rallied in June, has seen trading volumes slump as its novelty wears thin. This slowdown highlights the risks of overexposure to projects driven primarily by social hype rather than technical milestones. Industry watchers note that meme coins often face sharper drops during unstable markets due to their reliance on speculative trading. Source: PEPE and Shiba Inu Price, CoinMarketCap While Shiba Inu’s developers continue expanding its ecosystem, progress has yet to translate into sustained price action. Similarly, Pepe’s lack of major partnerships or protocol upgrades limits its appeal beyond short-term speculation. Meanwhile, platforms combining decentralized governance with institutional-grade tools are becoming increasingly attractive. Analysts say projects emphasizing transparency, security, and multi-asset support could outperform meme coins in the coming months. DTX Exchange Gains Traction With Hybrid Model and $14.6M Presale Surge As the Dogecoin price and other meme coins navigate a rough period, DTX Exchange is emerging as a standout contender in the altcoin space. The project’s hybrid trading platform, which unites decentralized and traditional finance, has driven its presale to a staggering $14.6 million. Priced at $0.18 during its bonus stage, DTX tokens offer early access to a platform set to launch in Q2 with support for over 120,000 assets. Unlike meme coins, DTX Exchange prioritizes a research-driven approach, focusing on low fees, high-speed transactions, and regulatory compliance. Third-party audits by firms like SolidProof add credibility to its security promises, addressing concerns common in smaller projects. Market observers highlight DTX’s democratized presale structure as a key differentiator. By reserving tokens for retail investors—not just institutions—the project has cultivated a grassroots following. Experts think this strategy could fuel rapid adoption post-launch, especially as traders seek alternatives to underperforming assets like Dogecoin. While past performance never guarantees future results, DTX’s unique value proposition positions it among the top crypto coins to watch. Conclusion As Dogecoin price faces uncertainty and meme coins struggle to regain momentum, alternative projects are drawing fresh capital from cautious investors. With DOGE consolidating below key resistance levels, analysts believe platforms offering tangible utility could lead the next market cycle. The DTX Exchange ’s hybrid trading model and audited infrastructure position it as a compelling option amid shifting trends. Industry voices suggest early participation in its presale might offer unique advantages ahead of the Q2 launch.

In a strategy session, pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 65,700 YouTube subscribers that BTC bears had many chances to drive prices lower in the past weeks after President Donald Trump restarted trade war talks and considered acquiring other countries. According to the crypto strategist, any of those headlines could have catalyzed a deeper Bitcoin correction. But DonAlt says the fact that BTC is still trading above $90,000 despite an onslaught of bearish news makes him believe that Bitcoin is gearing up for much higher prices. “I’m not bearish. My gut feeling is that this resolves to the upside, but I also acknowledge that as long as we’re trading below $101,000 or below the weekly mid-range [around $98,000], TA (technical analysis)-wise slightly leaning bearish. I just don’t necessarily think it’s very conclusive, especially given how strong the uptrend has been and how weak the sell-off has been considering that Trump has basically been throwing around tariffs, been talking about annexing Canada [and] Greenland… You can make a list and if you threw any of these items on that list at me two or three years ago, and you asked me, ‘Hey, how are markets looking?’ I’d be like ‘Everything is dead, you know.’ [But] then nothing has happened. It’s barely led to any sell-off, so it’s hard for me to be too bearish. I think just generally, it makes sense to be either neutral and wait for the momentum or be bullish even though the TA is not necessarily too bullish right now.” Source: DonAlt/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $96,310, down 1.43% in the past day.

In contrast, PEPE and TRUMP tokens are experiencing sharp declines, losing double-digit percentages. Meanwhile, a new contender called XYZ is making waves by surpassing $7 million during its presale phase. What’s driving these contrasting fortunes in the cryptocurrency market? XYZ’s Rise to Glory: The Meme Coin Fighter Punching Through the Crypto Arena XYZVerse is the next heavyweight champion of meme coins. Crowned Best NEW Meme Project , it blends the electric energy of sports with meme culture, drawing in millions of fans who want to be part of something bigger. Every great story needs a hero. Not the biggest, not the strongest—just the one crazy enough to keep pushing forward. That’s XYZepe , the masked fighter, the die-hard believer, and the relentless holder of $XYZ . His mission is to bring XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap and carve XYZ into crypto history. In response, the CMC community is totally behind this future champ: 95% are super bullish on $XYZ. But greatness isn’t handed out—it’s earned in the ring. $XYZ has already passed through 9 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a mindblowing take off. Undervalued at $0.002, $XYZ is a bet worth making. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication.

Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the start of something legendary. XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? Dogecoin: From Meme to Mainstream – Is the Doge Still Barking? Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun take on cryptocurrencies. It used the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there is no cap on how many can exist. Initially seen as a joke, Dogecoin’s value soared in 2021. It climbed into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with its total value surpassing $50 billion. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, helped fuel this rise. The coin’s creators, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, meant it as a light-hearted project. But it quickly showed the power of community and social media in financial markets. As for its potential, Dogecoin relies on its strong online community. Its technology is similar to other cryptocurrencies, but it doesn’t offer unique features like smart contracts. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as a risky but exciting asset. Other coins, like Ethereum, have more established uses and technologies. Market trends show that social media can greatly impact Dogecoin’s price. So, whether it’s attractive depends on one’s appetite for risk and belief in the community driving it. PEPE Coin Soars: How a Frog Meme Became a Billion-Dollar Cryptocurrency PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum, inspired by the popular Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Aiming to join the ranks of meme-based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE embraces its meme origins without pretense. With no taxes and no promises of utility, it keeps things simple and appeals to the fun-loving side of the crypto community. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap reaching a staggering $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive returns, and a strong community of enthusiasts rallied behind it. This frenzy sparked what some call a “memecoin season,” with new meme-based tokens popping up and experiencing wild price swings. As the crypto world anticipates the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, many are watching to see if PEPE will reach new heights. Its roadmap includes ambitious goals like listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover,” suggesting that PEPE isn’t just a fleeting fad. In the unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, PEPE stands out as a symbol of the power of internet culture and community-driven success. Trump Coin ($TRUMP) Surges to $15 Billion Market Cap Before Pullback Trump Coin ($TRUMP), a newly launched meme coin backed by President-elect Donald Trump, quickly surged in value, reaching a peak market capitalization of $15 billion early Sunday before settling around $9 billion. The token, built on the Solana blockchain, saw an explosive 300% gain within hours of its release, briefly trading above $75 per coin. Despite its rapid rise and subsequent pullback, $TRUMP remains a significant player in the meme coin space, leveraging Trump’s branding power ahead of his inauguration. With an initial 200 million coin supply, developers plan to gradually expand circulation to 1 billion tokens over three years. However, 80% of the total supply remains locked, controlled by CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, two Trump-affiliated entities set to earn revenue from trading activity. While the coin’s website states that $TRUMP is not an investment or political asset, its association with Trump has fueled speculation and investor interest, positioning it as a unique crossover between crypto, branding, and political influence. Conclusion While DOGE, PEPE, and TRUMP show positive signs, XYZ stands out as an all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and targeting notable growth with its community-driven platform.

On that note, Milei supported the newly launched memecoin LIBRA by posting on X a few days ago. Following Milei’s recommendation, the token rose to nearly $5 before falling below $1 within hours. This sharp decline has led to allegations of a potential “rug pull and scam,” a scheme in which developers increase the value of a token before abandoning it. As the controversy surrounding Milei and LIBRA continues, blockchain analysis platform Bubblemaps has claimed that the team behind the launch of Trump’s wife Melania Trump’s own token, the MELANIA memecoin, is also behind the Libra (LIBRA) token. Bubblemaps analysts have stated that they are very confident in the evidence that the LIBRA memecoin was launched by the same team that launched MELANIA. At this point, it was reported that the addresses associated with the creation of the MELANIA token were also associated with the controversial token LIBRA. Analysts said the detected relationship means that MELANI’s creator or someone close to its team is blocking its own launch. “The same team is behind LIBRA, MELANIA and other short-lived tokens. After analyzing cross-chain transfers and timing patterns, we are fairly confident that this prediction is correct. It all started with our investigation into sniper activity on MELANIA. One address stood out: address P5tb4, which made over $2.4 million in profits, sent all of its profits to 0xcEA, a wallet associated with the creator of MELANIA. There are multiple ways to connect 0xcEA to the creator of MELANIA, including fund transfers and cross-chain transfers, and we’re confident these are no coincidences. This means that Melania's creator or someone close to her team may have been personally involved in the attack on her own project's launch. A few weeks later, we realized that 0xcEA was funding DEfcyK, the creator of LIBRA, who withdrew 87 million LIBRA.” Analysts also recently noted that they detected many tokens associated with the suspicious “0xcEA” address, saying that most of them were clearly pump and dump. Examples of these were “TRUST, KACY, VIBES and HOOD.” 1/ How $LIBRA was created by the same team behind MELANIA and other short-lived coins Featuring new onchain evidence A thread with Coffeezilla ↓ pic.twitter.com/gNwj97KapF — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) February 17, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

If it breaks this level, the next target could be $0.0000254, which is about a 42% increase from current prices. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.00000939. If the price falls below this, it may find support around $0.000004040. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.0000166, slightly above the 100-day average of $0.0000160. This suggests a short-term upward trend. The relative strength index is at 50.70, indicating a neutral market. The stochastic oscillator is low at 8.81, which may mean SHIB is oversold. This could lead to a price increase soon. The MACD level is positive at 0.0000001193, hinting at possible bullish momentum. Conclusion With SHIB’s bullish momentum evident, XYZ emerges as the pioneering sports memecoin aiming for massive growth and community-driven success in the current bull run.

The profits are set to explode , and only those brave enough to seize this moment will see their gains rise like a true anime hero’s power level . Get in now, watch Catzilla wreck the market, and bring chaos to the competition! Injective (INJ) Poised for Growth with Key Resistance in Sight Injective’s current price ranges between $11.57 and $16.13, showing promising signs. The recent 1-week increase of 7.62% suggests upward momentum. With a 10-day simple moving average at $14.97, it sits slightly above the 100-day average of $14.54, indicating potential growth. The Relative Strength Index of 55.28 reflects balanced trade activity, neither overbought nor oversold. Nearest resistance is at $18.52. If INJ can break this level, it might target $23.08, an over 40% potential rise from some current prices. The nearest support is $9.39, providing a fallback cushion. This setup hints at a possible upward journey, aligning well with altcoin enthusiasts’ hopes for a broader crypto upswing. Uniswap (UNI) Set for an Enthralling Price Dance Uniswap’s present price between $7.33 and $10.58 is thrilling to observe. With an impressive 6-month gain of almost 48%, UNI displays growth potential. It’s teetering near its 10-day and 100-day moving averages, hinting at a possible bullish rally. A fall below $9, however, signals caution. If bullish energy persists, UNI may target the $12.03 resistance. If it gains further momentum, a climb near the $15.28 mark could spell gains of up to 44%. Yet its current RSI sitting at 47.23, along with a negative MACD, indicates a chance of sideways movement. Watch closely, as the crypto market’s dynamic nature can flip narratives swiftly. CWIF’s Bounce Back Potential in the Altcoin Surge CWIF hovers between $0.0000001030 and $0.000000137, facing a resistance at $0.0000001579. It’s been a rough ride with a 1-month tumble of 46.46%, but it’s near a crucial support level at $0.0000000900. The RSI of 35.01 suggests it’s oversold, indicating a potential rebound. If it surges past the first resistance, we could see it climb towards $0.0000001920, a possible gain. However, lingering below the 100-day SMA shows there’s work to do. A 20.63 stochastic hints at upward momentum forming. If the altcoin season indeed kicks off, CWIF might just catch a lift. Raydium (RAY) Price Eyes Potential Gains Amidst Market Trends Raydium’s price is moving between $3.72 and $6.17. It shows a dynamic market pattern. In the last month, RAY’s price climbed over 10%. In six months, it jumped more than 200%. Such growth hints RAY might rise more if trends continue. The coin faces a resistance level near $7.62. If it surpasses this, reaching $10 is possible. That’s over a 60% increase from the upper range. Support is strong at $2.71. Technical indicators are mixed, but the general trend looks positive. If the altcoin season hits, Raydium could soar. Investors who see potential in RAY might want to watch its journey closely. Conclusion While INJ, UNI, CWIF, and RAY offer promising features, their short-term potential is limited. In contrast, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a 700% ROI potential in its presale, triple utility features, and a mission to unite crypto enthusiasts, Catzilla invites participation in the battle against crypto villains.

PNUT Poised for Potential Surge Despite Recent Dips Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) shows signs of potential growth, trading between $0.13-$0.21. Despite recent dips, it’s near a key support at $0.09. The RSI suggests it’s not overbought, indicating room for upward movement. If momentum builds, PNUT might target the $0.25 resistance, a potential rise of nearly 43%. Breaking through could see it challenge the $0.33 level, a further increase of about 138% from current low ranges. Although down 18% this week and over 74% for the month, the market conditions hint at an upcoming opportunity for crypto enthusiasts. Altcoin season could play a big role in helping PNUT rebound.

Dogecoin: From Meme to Mainstream – Is the Doge Still Barking? Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun take on cryptocurrencies. It used the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there is no cap on how many can exist. Initially seen as a joke, Dogecoin’s value soared in 2021. It climbed into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with its total value surpassing $50 billion. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, helped fuel this rise. The coin’s creators, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, meant it as a light-hearted project. But it quickly showed the power of community and social media in financial markets. As for its potential, Dogecoin relies on its strong online community. Its technology is similar to other cryptocurrencies, but it doesn’t offer unique features like smart contracts. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as a risky but exciting asset. Other coins, like Ethereum, have more established uses and technologies. Market trends show that social media can greatly impact Dogecoin’s price. So, whether it’s attractive depends on one’s appetite for risk and belief in the community driving it. Conclusion DOGE shows potential for a major breakout, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its sports-themed ecosystem and community-driven approach.

POL: Unlocking New Possibilities in the Polygon Ecosystem The Polygon Ecosystem Token, or POL, is a utility token at the heart of the Polygon network. It empowers users to stake their tokens, locking them up to support the network’s security and operations. In return, stakers earn rewards and gain a voice in the network’s governance. This means they can vote on proposals that shape the future of Polygon, ensuring the community’s interests are at the forefront. POL also grants access to exclusive services within the ecosystem, opening doors to unique features and benefits. As the Polygon network expands, the potential of POL grows with it. The increasing number of applications and services boosts the demand for the token. In the current market cycle, where utility and community involvement are highly valued, POL stands out among other cryptocurrencies. Its combination of staking rewards, governance participation, and exclusive access makes it an attractive option for those interested in the crypto space. With market trends favoring tokens that offer real-world use cases, POL’s future looks promising compared to its peers.

Sui uses a special way of handling data and a safe programming language called Move. These tools help fix problems that other blockchains often face, like slow speeds and inefficiency. In today’s market, Sui looks promising because it focuses on the user experience. It introduces features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions to make blockchain apps more accessible. Unlike some coins that are hard to use or slow, Sui offers simplicity and speed. This makes it attractive to both developers and users. As the demand for user-friendly blockchain solutions grows, Sui could become a strong player in the crypto world. SEI: Speeding Up Trading with a New Kind of Blockchain Imagine a road built just for fast cars. That’s what SEI is for trading. It’s the first blockchain designed specifically for exchanges, giving them a special advantage. SEI can handle a huge number of orders every second. Transactions are finalized in just 380 milliseconds. Big institutions help keep it secure, and security is a top priority for SEI. What does this mean for investors? Some say SEI’s value could soar by over 300% by 2030. Its focus on speed and security sets it apart from other coins. In today’s market, where quick and safe trading is key, SEI stands out. While other coins offer different features, SEI’s trading specialization makes it unique. It could be an attractive option in the current market cycle. Keep an eye on SEI as it might be the next big thing in blockchain trading. Ondo Finance: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Innovation Ondo Finance is changing the way people access high-quality financial products. By bringing together the reliability of traditional finance and the efficiency of blockchain technology, Ondo is making stable, income-generating assets available to everyone. They tokenize real-world assets like U.S. Treasuries, turning them into digital tokens that can be easily traded and managed on the blockchain. This approach opens doors for more people to invest in assets that were once hard to reach. What sets Ondo apart is its focus on trust and security. In the often uncertain world of cryptocurrencies, Ondo collaborates with well-known partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for securing crypto assets. They are committed to transparency and compliance with legal regulations. Their product USDY is a highlight—it offers the stability of a stablecoin with the added benefit of yield from U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits, especially for non-U.S. investors. In the current market, where investors are seeking safe and reliable options, Ondo’s blend of traditional finance and blockchain might be appealing. Compared to other coins, Ondo offers a unique proposition by connecting real-world assets with the digital economy, potentially providing a stable and attractive investment opportunity.

There’s a buzz among investors about its potential for massive gains, possibly echoing the astonishing rise of earlier viral tokens. Could this be the next significant opportunity in the crypto market? The momentum suggests something big might be on the horizon. XYZVerse: The Best New Meme Project You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where crypto enthusiasts can score big off the growing demand for meme coins. But every revolution needs a hero—someone willing to fight against the odds and push the $XYZ token to the top. That hero is XYZepe , the masked fighter, the true believer, the relentless $XYZ holder whose mission is to bring XYZVerse to the #1 spot on CoinMarketCap. It’s about proving that underdogs can rise to greatness. With millions of sports fans ready to hit the field, the XYZVerse ecosystem is set to keep expanding—and your rewards will slam dunk through the roof! And here’s a highlight reel moment: XYZVerse has been officially recognized as the Best NEW Meme Project—a title that underscores its explosive potential in the meme coin arena. XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion! Meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is set to crush the competition. Currently priced at $0.002, $XYZ remains an undervalued crypto gem poised to rise to $0.1 at the final presale stage. But victory doesn’t happen overnight—it takes dedication, strategy, and a fighter willing to go the distance. XYZepe knows the battle ahead, but with the community behind him, he’s taking $XYZ to legendary status. With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, rock-solid defense in the form of audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ is already ahead of the game. The first-mover advantage is key here—get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! XYZepe is fighting for glory—will you stand with him? Shiba Inu Coin: The Meme Token Tapping into Ethereum’s Potential Shiba Inu Coin, known by its ticker SHIB, is a digital currency that started as a fun experiment inspired by Dogecoin. But unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with a wide range of applications and technologies. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator called Ryoshi, SHIB began with a massive supply of tokens—one quadrillion, to be exact. In a surprising move, half of these tokens were sent to Vitalik Buterin, one of Ethereum’s founders. Buterin donated a large portion to help with COVID-19 relief in India and burned the rest, effectively removing them from circulation. This act brought a lot of attention to SHIB. SHIB isn’t just resting on its meme status. Its integration with Ethereum allows it to support projects like ShibaSwap, a place where people can trade SHIB and other tokens without a central authority. There are also plans for a platform involving unique digital art pieces called NFTs, and a system where SHIB owners can have a say in decisions. These developments could make SHIB more useful and interesting to crypto enthusiasts. In the current market, where people are looking for coins with real-world applications, SHIB’s growth on the Ethereum network might make it stand out from other meme tokens. Its potential for new features and uses could be attractive to those keeping an eye on emerging trends in the crypto space. Conclusion SHIB and other coins have shown remarkable growth, but XYZVerse’s unique blend of sports and meme culture positions $XYZ for even greater success in the current 2025 bull run.

Jupiter: Solana’s Leading DEX Aggregator Transforming DeFi Trading Jupiter is one of the most popular decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators in the Solana ecosystem. It simplifies token swaps by pooling resources from various liquidity pools, ensuring users get the best prices available. By addressing the issue of price discrepancies across different DEXs, Jupiter enhances trading efficiency and minimizes the loss of value during transactions. Beyond aggregation, Jupiter has expanded its functionality to include perpetual futures, decentralized stablecoin management, and its LFG launchpad, which supports new Solana projects in getting off the ground. The potential introduction of a native token, JUP, could further boost Jupiter’s ecosystem. A governance token like JUP would allow users to have a say in important decisions such as liquidity plans, token issuance, and other ecosystem-related projects. By staking or locking their tokens, users could participate in governance and possibly receive yields in return. In the current market cycle, a token like JUP could be attractive to investors looking for projects that empower community participation and offer practical solutions to DeFi challenges. Compared to other coins, JUP’s focus on governance and direct utility within a thriving platform could make it a standout in the Solana ecosystem. NEAR Protocol: Sharding the Path to Scalable Decentralized Apps NEAR Protocol is a blockchain platform designed to help developers build decentralized applications with ease. Founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, it has raised over $20 million from major venture firms. NEAR uses a technique called sharding to improve efficiency and scalability. This means the network is divided into smaller parts, allowing it to handle more transactions at once. Operating on a distributed network, NEAR offers the benefits of centralized data storage systems but without central control.
