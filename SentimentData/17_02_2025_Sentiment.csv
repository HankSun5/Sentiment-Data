40423382,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675961,1739741459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40423382.jpeg,Solana records fifth straight week of DEX volume decline,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-fifth-week-dex-volume-decline/,"Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Solana recorded approximately $20.2 billion in the week that ended February 16. The numbers extend a streak of declining weekly trading volume for the fifth straight week, based on DeFiLlama data. The data analysis site also revealed that in the week ending February 10, 2025, Solana’s on-chain transaction volumes fell by 28%, totaling $31.8 billion. The slide in Solana DEX activity has been linked to a broader market trend. Similar volume reductions have been observed across other blockchains like BNB Chain, Ethereum, Sui, and Polygon. Solana’s declining numbers According to DeFiLlama , the weekly trading volume has fallen by 24.35%, totaling $28.893 billion over the past week. Meteora reported the most activity as the top DEX with a volume of $875.8 million, followed by Raydium at $836.37 million and Orca at $322.32 million. The cumulative trading volume for the top DEXs reached $155.172 billion over the entire period. Meteora had a weekly Total Value Locked (TVL) of $8.024 billion with a volume/TVL ratio of 0.84, which indicates strong liquidity. Raydium had a higher weekly TVL but a lower volume/TVL ratio of 0.5. While Solana DEXs have witnessed a volume decline, those on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have picked up, and the chain currently has the highest trading volume among decentralized exchanges. This is a stark difference from March 2024 stats when BSC DEXs trailed in third place by trading volume at $47.81 billion, behind Solana and Ethereum, while the fourth spot went to Arbitrum’s $27.74 billion. The increase in BSC’s trading volume indicates a significant increase in activity and coincides with the return of memes to the ecosystem, which is ironic because many believe one reason Solana DEXs are declining in volume is because of meme fatigue. Solana currently has the moniker of the “home of memes.” However, this cycle has seen many bad actors and selfish players extract millions from the ecosystem thanks to Pump.fun’s effectiveness in proliferating memes, even without any technical knowledge. Factors implicated in the Solana DEX decline The decline in Solana’s DEX volume can be partially attributed to the gradual cooling in the memecoin trading craze that has gripped Solana since the bull run started. Many memes have come and gone, and users seem to have been exhausted by the continuous pump-and-dump schemes, rugpulls, and insider trading. The sentiment of traders could also be because they are just about ready for something different. Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), came forward with a meme that drove trading traffic back to BSC and has seemingly now jump-started meme season on the chain. The Solana chain remains a top competitor in the DEX market. The value of the SOL token has significantly declined by over 50% in the past year, but many analysts still remain optimistic about the network’s long-term potential. A good example of those who still believe in Solana’s supremacy is Mert Mumtaz , the Helius Labs CEO. Following the latest Libra memecoin debacle led by Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, Mert went off on trolls calling the Solana chain a scam chain because of the number of memecoin scams that occur on it. In a series of tweets, Mert talked about the toxic sentiments surrounding the chain, pointing out that the network itself has no control over what it is used for. As far as Mert is concerned, the tech works, which is why memes have been so successful on the chain, and nothing else matters.

In contrast, PEPE and TRUMP tokens are experiencing sharp declines, losing double-digit percentages. Meanwhile, a new contender called XYZ is making waves by surpassing $7 million during its presale phase. What’s driving these contrasting fortunes in the cryptocurrency market? XYZ’s Rise to Glory: The Meme Coin Fighter Punching Through the Crypto Arena XYZVerse is the next heavyweight champion of meme coins. Crowned Best NEW Meme Project , it blends the electric energy of sports with meme culture, drawing in millions of fans who want to be part of something bigger. Every great story needs a hero. Not the biggest, not the strongest—just the one crazy enough to keep pushing forward. That’s XYZepe , the masked fighter, the die-hard believer, and the relentless holder of $XYZ . His mission is to bring XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap and carve XYZ into crypto history. In response, the CMC community is totally behind this future champ: 95% are super bullish on $XYZ. But greatness isn’t handed out—it’s earned in the ring. $XYZ has already passed through 9 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a mindblowing take off. Undervalued at $0.002, $XYZ is a bet worth making. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the start of something legendary. XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? Dogecoin: From Meme to Mainstream – Is the Doge Still Barking? Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun take on cryptocurrencies. It used the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there is no cap on how many can exist. Initially seen as a joke, Dogecoin’s value soared in 2021. It climbed into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with its total value surpassing $50 billion. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, helped fuel this rise. The coin’s creators, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, meant it as a light-hearted project. But it quickly showed the power of community and social media in financial markets. As for its potential, Dogecoin relies on its strong online community. Its technology is similar to other cryptocurrencies, but it doesn’t offer unique features like smart contracts. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as a risky but exciting asset. Other coins, like Ethereum, have more established uses and technologies. Market trends show that social media can greatly impact Dogecoin’s price. So, whether it’s attractive depends on one’s appetite for risk and belief in the community driving it. PEPE Coin Soars: How a Frog Meme Became a Billion-Dollar Cryptocurrency PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum, inspired by the popular Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Aiming to join the ranks of meme-based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE embraces its meme origins without pretense. With no taxes and no promises of utility, it keeps things simple and appeals to the fun-loving side of the crypto community. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap reaching a staggering $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive returns, and a strong community of enthusiasts rallied behind it. This frenzy sparked what some call a “memecoin season,” with new meme-based tokens popping up and experiencing wild price swings. As the crypto world anticipates the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, many are watching to see if PEPE will reach new heights. Its roadmap includes ambitious goals like listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover,” suggesting that PEPE isn’t just a fleeting fad. In the unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, PEPE stands out as a symbol of the power of internet culture and community-driven success. Trump Coin ($TRUMP) Surges to $15 Billion Market Cap Before Pullback Trump Coin ($TRUMP), a newly launched meme coin backed by President-elect Donald Trump, quickly surged in value, reaching a peak market capitalization of $15 billion early Sunday before settling around $9 billion. The token, built on the Solana blockchain, saw an explosive 300% gain within hours of its release, briefly trading above $75 per coin. Despite its rapid rise and subsequent pullback, $TRUMP remains a significant player in the meme coin space, leveraging Trump’s branding power ahead of his inauguration. With an initial 200 million coin supply, developers plan to gradually expand circulation to 1 billion tokens over three years. However, 80% of the total supply remains locked, controlled by CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, two Trump-affiliated entities set to earn revenue from trading activity. While the coin’s website states that $TRUMP is not an investment or political asset, its association with Trump has fueled speculation and investor interest, positioning it as a unique crossover between crypto, branding, and political influence. Conclusion While DOGE, PEPE, and TRUMP show positive signs, XYZ stands out as an all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and targeting notable growth with its community-driven platform.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen some interesting price movements recently. Over the past week, its price rose by 4.50%. However, in the last month, it dropped by 22.19%. Looking back six months, SHIB’s price is up by 24.65%. Currently, SHIB trades between $0.0000125 and $0.0000178. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0000200. If it breaks this level, the next target could be $0.0000254, which is about a 42% increase from current prices. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.00000939. If the price falls below this, it may find support around $0.000004040. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.0000166, slightly above the 100-day average of $0.0000160. This suggests a short-term upward trend. The relative strength index is at 50.70, indicating a neutral market. The stochastic oscillator is low at 8.81, which may mean SHIB is oversold. This could lead to a price increase soon. The MACD level is positive at 0.0000001193, hinting at possible bullish momentum. Conclusion With SHIB’s bullish momentum evident, XYZ emerges as the pioneering sports memecoin aiming for massive growth and community-driven success in the current bull run.

His endorsement caused a brief surge in the token’s value before it crashed, leading to accusations of fraud. Critics claim this was a pump-and-dump scheme , and some are calling for his impeachment. The government has formed a task force to determine if Milei or others committed illegal acts. On February 14, Milei promoted LIBRA on X, suggesting it could boost Argentina’s economy and support small businesses. This caused the token’s market cap to jump beyond $4 billion , with insiders cashing out over $100 million in profits. However, the surge was short-lived. LIBRA lacked a structured financial model, its website was set up only hours before launch, and over $87 million was withdrawn within the first three hours. The token’s value collapsed soon after, showing clear signs of a pump-and-dump. According to The Kobeissi Letter, large holders quickly liquidated their assets, some making $4 million or more as the market cap peaked at $4.6 billion. At 5:40 PM ET, when the price hit its highest point, LIBRA’s value plummeted. In response to public backlash, Milei deleted his promotional post and claimed he had not fully understood the project. Later, he explained that after learning more, he decided to stop promoting it. Argentina’s presidential office tried to downplay the issue, calling it a standard blockchain-related promotion. However, officials admitted that Milei had met with Hayden Mark Davis, a figure connected to LIBRA’s infrastructure through KIP Protocol. The government has now launched an official probe to examine whether any officials, including Milei, acted improperly. Investigators will also scrutinize KIP Protocol for possible legal violations. To contain the damage, Milei ordered the creation of a special Investigation Task Unit (UTI), consisting of financial, crypto, and anti-money laundering specialists. This unit will analyze LIBRA’s launch and those involved. The government stated that all findings will be turned over to the courts to determine if any crimes were committed. Beyond cryptocurrency, the controversy has triggered a political crisis. Critics argue that Milei’s reckless endorsement of a speculative asset led to financial losses for investors. Argentine lawmaker Gabriela Estevez accused him of engaging in a classic pump-and-dump scheme, where token creators buy at a low price, hype it up, and sell at a peak, leaving others with losses. The scandal has even led to impeachment threats. A political faction has officially started proceedings, calling the incident unprecedented in Argentina’s history. Buenos Aires Governor Axel Kicillof called it a large-scale financial fraud, warning that both local and international investors had been misled. He compared the situation to a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme. This case highlights the dangers of political figures endorsing meme coins, a trend that has grown since former U.S. President Donald Trump launched his own token. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin had already warned that such political meme coins could damage the crypto market’s credibility. Since Trump’s involvement, scammers have launched fake tokens based on political figures, with LIBRA being the latest example of these risks.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-16 21:46:29

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. ChowWow is gaining traction, with analysts predicting a massive surge and the potential to be Solana’s next top meme coin. Table of Contents Solana: Strong on-chain metrics ChowWow: Surging presale and secure transactions Conclusion The crypto market shows growing interest in ChowWow (CHOW) as it builds momentum this first quarter. Analysts project a significant increase in the coin’s value that could mirror Solana’s (SOL) fast market growth. As excitement builds, the main question is whether CHOW could become the top Solana meme coin. ChowWow continues to achieve increasing prominence in both the crypto space and social media platforms thanks to its strong presale performance. The platform provides a virtual gaming environment alongside special rewards and distinctive collectibles. With the DeFi coin price at $0.008, alongside massive forecasted growth, CHOW could emerge as the next big crypto following SOL. Solana: Strong on-chain metrics Solana maintained stable values above the crucial threshold in January 2025 while the market showed stability as investors displayed positive attitudes and new technological developments emerged. Investor confidence rose further as the price returned from losses experienced in November 2024. Total Value Locked experienced a 48% increase during the last 30 days. Solana achieved a major accomplishment in the previous month by reaching the benchmark where its decentralized exchange (DEX) processed $3.8 billion in 24-hour trading volume. The DeFi sector continues to recognize the growing dominance of Solana based on its strong on-chain metrics.

With its presale structured in ten stages and currently in the early phase, both top and new investors can join. Notably, the presale requires minimum purchases of $25. The cryptocurrency’s presale is selling out fast, with analysts predicting a price rise to $0.0288 upon launch. The anticipated 260% price increase could deliver massive returns on investments. Due to its implementation of Proof of History and Proof of Stake mechanisms, ChowWow could shine by providing quick and secure transactions at affordable rates. The platform is also undergoing regular third-party audits that build up both its credibility and security. ChowWow’s stake-to-earn model acts as a key growth driver by providing an additional revenue source. Users can receive monthly rewards by staking their CHOW tokens, with APYs between 8% and 15%. The project’s play-to-earn game further attracts investors by providing rewards through gameplay activities. Token holders within the game have exclusive access to in-app purchases even though the game operates as an open and free platform available to all players. Conclusion As analysts predict a massive surge for ChowWow and its potential to become the top Solana meme coin, smart investors are joining its presale. With the DeFi coin price at $0.008 alongside features like stake-to-earn and play-to-earn models, CHOW is emerging as a dominant force in the meme coin space.

40424536,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675958,1739742604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40424536.jpeg,France demands an emergency global meeting over Trump’s economic and geopolitical actions,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/france-demands-an-emergency-global-meeting-over-trumps-economic-and-geopolitical-actions/,"French President Emmanuel Macron has summoned European leaders for an emergency meeting in Paris to discuss the escalating global tensions caused by Donald Trump’s latest economic and geopolitical decisions. The meeting is scheduled for Monday, according to a report from Fox. Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski first hinted at the gathering while speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. He said the leaders would address Trump’s actions “in a very serious fashion” and described the U.S. president’s strategy as a form of military-style testing. “President Trump operates using what the Russians call ‘razvedka boyem’—reconnaissance through battle. He pushes forward, watches what happens, then adjusts. And we need to respond,” Sikorski told attendees. Europe scrambles to react as Trump threatens new tariffs Trump has announced sweeping tariffs, including a 25% duty on U.S. steel and aluminum imports, set to take effect on March 12. He has also instructed his administration to prepare additional automobile tariffs, expected to be revealed in April. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking in an interview with Bloomberg, said the European Union is preparing to counteract any economic harm but remains open to negotiations. “We are strong enough to respond to anything that damages the European economy,” Scholz said on Saturday. “But we should always leave room for an agreement, because it benefits everyone, especially on both sides of the Atlantic.” The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, is already reviewing countermeasures. If Trump moves ahead with the tariffs, Brussels is ready to hit back with retaliatory duties on U.S. goods. Officials have reportedly reactivated lists of American products that were targeted during Trump’s first term. “The EU will respond firmly and immediately against unjustified trade barriers, including tariffs designed to attack legal and non-discriminatory policies,” the European Commission said in a statement on Friday. The tariffs aren’t just about trade. Trump’s economic aggression is unfolding at a time when Germany’s economy is under immense pressure. The country is grappling with high energy costs, a slowdown in exports, and rising support for the far-right AfD party, which advocates for leaving the eurozone and scrapping environmental policies. Trump had said on Truth Social that: “I have decided, for purposes of Fairness, that I will charge a RECIPROCAL Tariff meaning, whatever Countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them – No more, no less! For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff. Sending merchandise, product, or anything by any other name through another Country, for purposes of unfairly harming America, will not be accepted.” He also warned that foreign government subsidies designed to undercut American businesses will be dealt with, along with hidden trade barriers that block U.S. products or shut out American companies. “We know exactly how much these sneaky trade barriers cost us,” Trump said, making it clear that the U.S. will fight back against unfair economic tactics. His message to the world? Either lower your tariffs against the U.S., or deal with the consequences. He reminded everyone that countries have been leeching off America for decades, whether they were allies or adversaries. That’s over. “If you manufacture in the U.S., you don’t have to worry about tariffs. Simple as that.” Trump ended by saying he’s already given the green light to his top officials—State, Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR—to make sure America gets exactly what it deserves. “We’re bringing real fairness back to trade. No more one-sided deals. It’s about time these countries remember everything America has done for them.” Macron walks a tightrope with Trump amid economic tensions Macron has maintained cordial relations with Trump since the November election, despite the looming trade war. After Trump’s victory, Macron posted a message on X (formerly Twitter), writing: “Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump. Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.” The relationship appeared warm in December when Trump visited Paris for the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening. Macron personally welcomed him, saying: “It’s a great honor for French people to welcome you five years later. You were president at that time, and I remember your solidarity and immediate action. So, welcome back. We are happy to have you here.” Behind closed doors, however, European officials are growing uneasy about Trump’s economic unpredictability. The Paris meeting signals that Macron and other EU leaders are preparing for a serious confrontation with Washington. Trump’s strategy is clear—he believes in economic retaliation. On Thursday, he instructed his team to develop new tariffs targeting countries he deems unfair trading partners. The move, described by Politico as his most aggressive trade action yet, has sent shockwaves across Europe’s political and economic circles. EU disses Trump for being reckless The European Union, which prides itself on having some of the world’s lowest tariffs, is furious. In a direct rebuke, the European Commission slammed Trump’s “reciprocal tariff” policy, calling it economically reckless and warning that it will increase business costs, hurt American consumers, and drive inflation higher. Brussels is not backing down, said Sikorski, who added that officials are now reassessing past retaliatory measures, which were previously imposed on Trump’s administration during his first term. Sikorski said if necessary, the EU would act immediately. The tariffs, if implemented, could worsen Germany’s financial woes and further destabilize Scholz’s already fragile political standing ahead of the February 23 election. Brussels’ retaliation strategy will be multi-layered. According to a Bloomberg report, EU officials have also confirmed that past tariff models from Trump’s first term have been updated and prepared for immediate deployment. The scope of countermeasures could range from targeted tariffs on U.S. goods to diplomatic pressure on key American industries. The White House has yet to respond to Macron’s emergency summit, but sources inside Washington indicate that Trump has no intention of backing down. His administration is moving full speed ahead, with officials drafting tariff policies that will be announced in the coming weeks. Sikorski, speaking on behalf of several EU leaders, said Europe’s message to Trump is this: “We act together, and we will stick together. The European economy is strong enough to take action, and that’s exactly what we will do.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",Economy|France|United States,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-16 21:50:04

One of the latest figures to make a surprising prediction is Davinci Jeremie , a long-time Bitcoin proponent who has previously dismissed the token. In a recent social media statement, Jeremie projected that XRP could rise to $20 to $24 during this market cycle. Given the token’s current value of approximately $2.78, this forecast implies a 763% increase. The prediction has generated mixed reactions, with some community members viewing it as an unexpected turnaround and others remaining wary of his new stance. Former XRP Critics Now Reevaluate Jeremie has been vocal about his skepticism toward XRP for years, frequently criticizing its fundamentals and suggesting that the asset could become worthless. However, as the token’s price and adoption gain momentum, many former skeptics, including Jeremie, have started reconsidering their views. Other critics who recently voiced a more positive outlook on XRP include Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, and trader Peter Brandt . Brandt, for instance, has suggested that the token’s market capitalization could reach $500 billion, translating to a price of $8 per token. This shift in sentiment from influential figures has caught the attention of XRP community members, with many questioning the motivations behind these revised perspectives. Community Response: A Shift or an Attempt to Save Face? Jeremie’s updated stance has sparked debate among XRP supporters that critics are now adjusting their narratives to avoid being proven wrong. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Tony Edward, the founder of the Thinking Crypto podcast, responded sarcastically to Jeremie’s remarks, describing the shift as an “XRP hater capitulation.” He pointed out that several high-profile individuals who previously dismissed the token, including billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, are now attempting to reposition themselves. According to Edward, these critics are trying to downplay their earlier comments to avoid losing credibility within the crypto space. Jeremie Maintains Skepticism Despite Price Prediction While Jeremie acknowledges the potential for significant short-term gains, he remains unconvinced about XRP’s long-term viability. He has reiterated his belief that the asset is too closely aligned with the traditional banking system, making it an unsuitable investment for those seeking long-term returns. Jeremie argues that XRP’s association with financial institutions introduces an element of unpredictability, similar to centralized banking entities like the Federal Reserve. This view has led him to caution against holding the token as a long-term asset. His disclaimer has drawn further criticism from the community, with some dismissing it as an attempt to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Despite the backlash, his prediction has added fuel to the ongoing debate about the token’s future trajectory and the changing perspectives of its most vocal critics.

40424406,https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-falls-solana-struggles-while-blockdags-5-usdt-cashback-drives-massive-demand-presale-hits-195-5m/,1739743229,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/40424406.jpeg,"Cardano Falls, Solana Struggles While BlockDAG’s 5% USDT Cashback Drives Massive Demand– Presale Hits $195.5M!",https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-falls-solana-struggles-while-blockdags-5-usdt-cashback-drives-massive-demand-presale-hits-195-5m/,"As market liquidity tightens and key players influence pricing, alternative cryptocurrencies such as Solana and Cardano face challenges in gaining ground, illustrating the wider market’s unpredictability. Solana’s price analysis places SOL between crucial price points, with $190 as support and $199 as potential resistance. A surge past these markers could catalyze gains, yet any pause might cause a decline. The Cardano crash paints a stark contrast, with ADA’s value dropping below $0.71 following a sharp sell-off that triggered $240 million in market liquidations. While SOL and ADA prices fluctuate, BlockDAG (BDAG) progresses in a contrasting trajectory—strengthening with each presale phase. A staggering $195.5 million has been amassed, and its 5% USDT referral scheme is currently the talk of the market. As this initiative broadens BlockDAG’s global base, BDAG ascends the ranks among top crypto picks. Solana Price Analysis: Is $199 the Turning Point? Recent assessments of Solana’s price suggest a pivotal range, with $190 providing substantial support and $199 acting as a critical resistance level. Advancing beyond $199 could shift the momentum towards a positive breakout, but hesitation could lead to a further decrease. Present indicators deliver mixed signals. The RSI is near 43.77, suggesting slight bearish pressure, whereas the OBV at 69.05 million shows consistent interest. Moreover, a rise in network activity, evidenced by daily additions of millions of new addresses, fosters optimism for Solana’s future despite ongoing price instability. However, failure to overcome the $199 mark could drive prices back down toward the support level, placing traders at a crucial juncture. Cardano Crash: A Brief Setback or Extended Decline? The recent plunge in Cardano’s value has alarmed investors, with ADA falling below $0.71 as market liquidations exceeded $240 million. This downturn coincided with a decrease in decentralized exchange (DEX) activity, dropping from $31.3 million in transactions in December to merely $7 million by February, reflecting a decline in investor engagement. Additionally, Cardano’s total value locked (TVL) has halved, plummeting from $701.4 million to $355.7 million, and significant sell-offs by whales have exacerbated the decline. With Bitcoin and Ethereum also experiencing downturns, pressure mounts on ADA. Traders now question whether Cardano will stabilize or continue to suffer. The coming days will be pivotal. BlockDAG’s 5% USDT: Why Traders Find It Appealing Unlike typical crypto offers that require waiting for gains, BlockDAG’s referral program immediately rewards. This limited-time opportunity provides a unique 5% USDT cashback instantly upon a BDAG purchase, making it a standout offer. What sets this program apart? It benefits both the referrer and the purchaser with 5% USDT back, enticing traders globally to buy BDAG at its current rate before another likely price increase while accumulating extra USDT. Furthermore, another factor contributes to BDAG’s prominence among top crypto picks—not just the cashback. BlockDAG has become a viral phenomenon, raising over $195.5 million, selling 18.4 billion BDAG, and delivering a 2380% ROI to early buyers. This presale, nearing $200 million, is not just substantial—it’s record-setting in the crypto realm. Yet, here’s the highlight. BDAG’s current price is only $0.0248. Despite its popularity in a competitive market, BDAG remains affordable—but not for long. Each new batch raises the price, and analysts project BDAG could reach $1 this year, positioning it as a top choice for traders currently. Moreover, the referrals do more than attract new buyers—they propel BDAG’s momentum. As demand for BDAG increases, supply tightens, and with a robust and expanding community of 170,000 supporters behind it, BDAG’s future looks increasingly promising. 2025’s Top Crypto Picks– Final Call! Solana’s price analysis indicates the coin is testing resistance at $199, while the Cardano crash has erased $240 million. As one coin tests crucial levels and another faces significant losses, traders anticipate their next moves. However, some are not just waiting—BlockDAG’s presale is redefining strategies, attracting traders worldwide. With BlockDAG’s crypto presale soaring past $195.5 million, it’s evident that demand continues robustly. Its 5% USDT referral program is driving quick expansion, with the community eagerly accumulating BDAG before the anticipated price rise. Despite shifts in the crypto market and evolving trends, BlockDAG maintains its course. The next increase is imminent. Those hesitating may miss the most significant crypto opportunity yet.

Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is turning heads in the crypto world, and its unique presale model is making waves. Meanwhile, TST and Apu Apustaja are also making headlines with recent developments. Arctic Pablo Coin is already in its 10th presale phase, Aqua Frost, having raised over $1.3 million in under a month. Its deflationary structure and high staking rewards make it one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins—Arctic Pablo Coin, TST, and Apu Apustaja. Scarcity Meets Value: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Token Burn Strategy One of Arctic Pablo Coin’s standout features is its powerful token burn mechanism.

Once the presale ends, any remaining tokens will also be burned, reinforcing a deflationary model designed to benefit early investors.

Here’s How,https://timestabloid.com/cardano-ada-holders-can-now-transfer-ada-to-solana-heres-how/,"A new cross-chain solution has enabled Cardano users to move ADA to the Solana blockchain. Wanchain , a blockchain interoperability company recently launched the bridge that facilitates this transfer. New Cross-Chain Bridge for ADA Transfers On February 13, Wanchain announced the launch of a new interoperability route, allowing ADA holders to transfer their tokens from the Cardano network to Solana. This feature is limited to one-way transfers, meaning ADA can move to Solana, but users cannot yet bridge assets in the opposite direction. The company’s official statement described this as a significant step toward increased connectivity between the two ecosystems, emphasizing the removal of previous barriers that separated them. Bridging Process and Transaction Fees To transfer ADA assets to Solana, ADA holders need to use Wanchain’s bridging platform The process requires connecting a Cardano wallet, selecting Cardano as the source blockchain and ADA as the asset, and then designating Solana as the destination network. At the time of writing, the transaction fee for using the bridge is 2.29 ADA, equivalent to approximately $1.85. Addressing Cardano-Solana Rivalry Before unveiling the feature, Wanchain acknowledged the long-standing rivalry between the Cardano and Solana communities. In a social media post on February 11, the company humorously referenced the differences in perception between the two groups, pointing out that some Solana users dismiss Cardano due to its perceived lack of adoption, while certain Cardano supporters criticize Solana for being heavily focused on meme coins. Despite these differences, Wanchain positioned the bridge as an opportunity to foster greater interoperability, allowing users to benefit from the unique features of both networks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Future Developments: SOL to ADA Transfers Although the current integration only supports ADA-to-Solana transfers, Wanchain has confirmed that a Solana-to-Cardano bridge is in progress. However, no official release date has been provided. Additionally, the company has hinted at the launch of a new product update on February 19, describing it as a significant enhancement to one of its existing solutions. More details on this development are expected in the coming days. The bridge enables seamless interaction between Cardano and Solana, allowing users to leverage Solana’s ecosystem for enhanced cross-chain transactions and DeFi capabilities. The growth of interoperability solutions like Wanchain’s bridge could play a crucial role in connecting different blockchain networks and reducing fragmentation in the industry. As adoption grows, it will be exciting to see how ADA and SOL benefit from increased accessibility and collaboration.

On Sunday, People’s Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng told global leaders at the AlUla Conference for Emerging Market Economies in Saudi Arabia that while other currencies are crumbling against the rising U.S. dollar, the yuan has stayed steady. “Recently, a number of factors have pushed up (the) dollar index, and non-dollar currencies have mostly depreciated. But RMB (yuan) has remained largely stable despite the high market volatility,” Pan said at the event, which was organized by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Saudi Arabia’s Finance Ministry. China pushes domestic spending over investment Pan said China is moving away from relying on massive infrastructure projects to drive growth and instead focusing on domestic consumption. The government is raising household incomes, offering subsidies, and rolling out pro-consumption policies to keep the economy moving. China has made 2025 the year of consumption growth. The goal is simple: get people to spend more money instead of relying on exports and investment-heavy growth. Pan said China’s price growth and consumer demand could be stronger, but he’s confident that the economy is on solid ground, with risks from local government debt and the real estate sector shrinking. Monetary policy is also changing a bit. Pan said that China will use proactive fiscal policies and accommodative monetary measures, with an emphasis on counter-cyclical adjustments to keep financial markets stable. China is facing headwinds, though. “Rising trade protectionism, geopolitical tensions, and the fragmentation of the global economy” are challenges Beijing cannot ignore, Pan said. Still, he stressed that China is committed to keeping its markets open and pushing forward with economic reforms. Asian central banks take on the dollar with currency forwards China isn’t the only country fighting back against the dollar’s strength. Across Asia, central banks are turning to derivatives to defend their currencies, using a strategy that raises concerns about how long they can sustain these interventions. India’s central bank has ramped up its use of currency forwards, pushing its net dollar short forward position to a record $68 billion in December. Indonesia has also piled on risk, with its short forward book hitting $19.6 billion, the highest level since at least 2015. On January 20, when Trump officially returned to office, a White House fact sheet outlined his plan to crack down on currency manipulation. The very next day, U.S. Treasury has labeled countries as currency manipulators before, and Trump previously put China in that category. Malaysia is also in the game, with its forward book reaching $27.5 billion by November, after swelling by $4 billion in 2024. The Philippines, on the other hand, has taken a more cautious approach, cutting its net long forward position down to just $874 million, according to IMF data. Asian central banks are also up against U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade strategies, which are mostly just tariffs and threats of tariffs. Last week, Trump made it clear that he doesn’t like foreign governments intervening in currency markets when he said via a post on Truth Social that: “I have decided, for purposes of Fairness, that I will charge a RECIPROCAL Tariff meaning, whatever Countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them – No more, no less! For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff.” Currency forwards give central banks an edge. Unlike direct interventions, these derivatives don’t drain foreign exchange reserves and don’t attract as much attention from Washington. That makes them an attractive tool for countries trying to stabilize their currencies without landing on Trump’s radar. The dollar has recently taken a hit, giving central banks some breathing room. Trump has delayed or canceled tariffs on Canada, Colombia, and Mexico, raising doubts about whether he will follow through on his biggest trade threats. A broad dollar index has slipped 1.8% this year, showing signs of softening. India’s Reserve Bank (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra is also making changes. The RBI has scaled back its non-deliverable forward market bets, opting instead to conduct onshore interventions to improve domestic liquidity. While this is great, JPMorgan analysts believe currency forwards will remain a go-to tool for central banks for the foreseeable future, according to a note they sent their clients on Friday.

BTFD Coin ($BTFD) , Dogecoin , and Shiba Inu are three of the top meme coins to invest in now, each bringing something unique to the table. BTFD Coin is making waves with its presale success, while Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to defy bearish pressures, proving their staying power in the meme coin space. But why are these coins gaining so much attention, and which one should you invest in? Let’s dive in and find out. The Rise of Meme Coins Meme coins have surged in popularity over the past few years, with coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu becoming household names. These projects are powered by vibrant, engaged communities and viral potential. BTFD Coin has emerged as the latest contender, entering the meme coin market with a bang. Its innovative approach, which includes a Play2Earn game, staking rewards , and a referral program , has captured the attention of investors. What sets BTFD Coin apart is its focus on community engagement and utility, offering more than just the speculative nature typical of meme coins. Despite recent bearish pressures affecting the broader crypto market, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to hold strong, with Dogecoin showing resilience thanks to its strong backing and adoption as a payment method by major companies. Shiba Inu has similarly grown its ecosystem, including the launch of the Shiba Inu metaverse. These coins have proven their ability to stay relevant in a market that often sees wild price swings, and their continued success is a testament to their community-driven power. Now, with BTFD Coin entering its final run of presale, it’s a prime time to consider these top meme coins to invest in now. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin Revolution in the Making When it comes to BTFD Coin , this is not just another meme coin trying to capture the internet’s attention. With a presale that has already raised over $6 million, BTFD Coin has proven its potential. Investors are flocking to the presale as BTFD Coin enters its final stages, and analysts are predicting that this coin will experience massive gains once it lists on major exchanges. A big part of what makes BTFD Coin stand out is its Play2Earn game , which went live on January 1, 2025. This game allows players to earn rewards in BTFD tokens, providing real utility for the coin and ensuring that its value is tied to something tangible. Additionally, BTFD Coin offers staking rewards with an impressive 90% APY , which incentivizes long-term holding and creates a sense of stability for investors. The referral program further strengthens its community-driven approach, encouraging users to bring others into the fold while earning rewards for doing so. The Bulls Squad —a dedicated group of BTFD Coin holders—has proven that strong, engaged communities are essential for the long-term success of meme coins. BTFD Coin ‘s community power has been a driving factor behind its rapid presale growth, and with more than 70 billion coins sold to over 10,700 holders, the momentum is undeniable. The Bulls Squad continues to drive excitement through social media, online forums, and grassroots initiatives, creating a sense of belonging and ownership among its members. In fact, the BTFD Coin presale has been a major success, and with Stage 14 offering a 100% bonus through the LAUNCH100 bonus code, there’s no better time to get involved. For every BTFD Coin purchase in Stage 14, investors will receive double the number of tokens, making this a rare opportunity to maximize returns. See Your Investments Multiply with BTFD Coin The BTFD Coin presale is currently priced at $0.00016 per coin, and analysts predict that once BTFD Coin is listed on major exchanges, its price could skyrocket to $0.006. For example, if you were to invest $40,000 at the current presale price, you’d receive 250 million BTFD tokens. If the coin rises to $0.006 post-listing, your investment could grow to $1.5 million—an incredible return. With the BTFD Coin presale showing no signs of slowing down, it’s clear that this coin is set for a meteoric rise. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin That Defies All Odds Despite facing significant bearish pressures recently, Dogecoin has shown remarkable resilience. Once considered a joke, Dogecoin has risen to prominence thanks to its strong community, major endorsements, and use cases in real-world applications. What started as an internet meme has become one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the world. Dogecoin has found success because of its broad adoption. Companies like Tesla have started accepting DOGE as payment for products, and Dogecoin has been incorporated into various online platforms and payment systems. This real-world use case is what keeps Dogecoin strong, even when the market is facing turbulence. Unlike some other meme coins, Dogecoin benefits from its established position in the market and is supported by a growing number of institutional and retail investors. With the broader crypto market experiencing downturns, Dogecoin continues to hold strong as one of the top meme coins to invest in now. The price fluctuations are expected as always, but Dogecoin ’s long-term value has only increased as it gains more institutional backing and real-world use cases. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin with a Massive Ecosystem While Dogecoin is the most well-known meme coin, Shiba Inu has rapidly emerged as its main competitor. Created as an “experiment in decentralized community building,” Shiba Inu has quickly gained a massive following, and its ecosystem is constantly growing. With the launch of the Shiba Inu metaverse , ShibaSwap , and a decentralized exchange (DEX), Shiba Inu has established itself as more than just a meme coin. What makes Shiba Inu stand out is its ShibaSwap platform , where users can earn rewards by staking and participating in liquidity pools. The growing Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to add value to its SHIB token, ensuring its place as one of the top meme coins to invest in now. Despite the market’s ups and downs, Shiba Inu has continued to grow, with a loyal following that believes in the project’s long-term vision. Like Dogecoin , a dedicated community supports Shiba Inu, and the project’s developers continue innovating with new initiatives to maintain momentum. With so many features in development, Shiba Inu is set to remain a key player in the meme coin market.

This prediction is based on ETH’s current price action in the four-hour time frame. Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ETH appears to be forming an ascending triangle pattern on the four-hour time frame but is currently facing resistance from the descending trendline and seems to be falling toward the pattern’s support level. Based on the recent price action, if ETH fails to hold the $2,680 level and closes a four-hour candle below $2,670, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 4.5% to reach the $2,560 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View Along with the bearish outlook, ETH is currently trading below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame, indicating that the asset is in a downtrend and has the potential to continue this bearish trend further. Ether Liquidation Risk With the bearish outlook, intraday traders’ $74 million worth of long positions are on the verge of liquidation. Data shows that a significant $72 million worth of long positions was opened when traders became over-leveraged at the $2,657 level. This massive amount of ETH will be liquidated if the price falls below this over-leveraged level. Conversely, traders holding long positions are over-leveraged at the $2,730 level, with $275 million worth of long positions at risk of liquidation if the price falls further. Source: Coinglass Current Price Momentum Currently, ETH is trading near the $2,685 level and has experienced a modest price drop of 0.55% in the past 24 hours.

40426888,https://timestabloid.com/?p=57526,1739746453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ripple Rebrands Website, Here are the Key Changes",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-rebrands-website-here-are-the-key-changes/,"Ripple has introduced a major redesign of its website and branding, signaling a shift in its strategic direction. In a recent X post , the company announced the changes and emphasized a renewed focus on financial innovation and the Internet of Value (IoV) development. This rebranding effort reflects a broader vision for the company’s role in the evolving digital asset landscape. Renowned XRP community figure WrathofKahneman analyzed the updates, identifying significant changes that could indicate a shift in Ripple’s priorities. His observations raise questions about the company’s evolving approach to key sectors, including Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Ripple’s Updated Focus The redesigned website highlights Ripple’s core offerings, which include cross-border payments, digital asset custody, and stablecoins. The company’s priorities include seamless, cost-effective international transactions while expanding into new areas. Its acquisition of Standard Custody has strengthened its presence in the digital asset custody space, allowing banks and fintech firms to store digital assets on behalf of their customers. Additionally, its stablecoin initiative, Ripple USD (RLUSD) , is positioned as a tool for instant global transactions and increased liquidity in digital asset markets. CBDC Reference Removed: A Shift in Strategy? The website’s content has significantly changed, with no mention of CBDCs. Ripple previously collaborated with governments and financial institutions on CBDC initiatives , working on pilot projects with countries like Palau and Georgia. The company also launched a dedicated CBDC platform to support central banks in developing digital currencies. The decision to remove references to these efforts has sparked speculation within the XRP community. WrathofKahneman questioned whether Ripple is deliberately stepping back from CBDC-related projects or simply avoiding drawing attention to them. This shift comes amid a changing regulatory environment in the U.S., where former President Donald Trump issued an executive order restricting efforts to develop and promote CBDCs . Given this backdrop, Ripple’s decision to exclude CBDCs from its website could indicate a strategic move to align with current U.S. policies or reduce regulatory scrutiny. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Key Observations Beyond the repeal of CBDC content, Ripple’s rebranded website reflects several other notable changes. Unlike previous versions, it does not introduce new customers, raising questions about the company’s recent business developments. However, there is a stronger emphasis on Web3 investments, with Ripple now highlighting over $600 million invested in the sector and more than 70 direct investments in blockchain-related projects. Additionally, the rebrand focuses more on developer engagement. The website now makes developer documentation more accessible, suggesting an effort to encourage innovation and broader participation within Ripple’s ecosystem. What This Rebrand Signals for Ripple’s Future Ripple’s updated branding and website redesign indicate a strategic effort to refine its public image and messaging. By emphasizing cross-border payments, digital asset custody, and stablecoins, the company appears to be reinforcing its commitment to institutional adoption while navigating regulatory challenges. As Ripple continues to evolve, industry observers and XRP enthusiasts will closely monitor its next moves. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

40426955,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675979,1739746574,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40426955.jpeg,Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E looks to update US gold reserves with Bitcoin after Fort Knox audit,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musks-d-o-g-e-looks-to-update-us-gold-reserves-with-bitcoin-after-fort-knox-audit/,"Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) has its next mission: find out if Fort Knox actually holds the 4,580 tons of gold it claims to have. Elon was pulled into the debate today when an X user asked him to check if the US gold reserves still exist. Elon responded , “Surely it’s reviewed at least every year.” The US Treasury claims that Fort Knox holds $425 billion worth of gold at market rates, but the last time anyone actually saw it was in 2017, when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin visited. Before that? 1974, when journalists and lawmakers were allowed inside after rumors of missing gold started spreading. The vault remains one of the most restricted locations on Earth, and no single person knows all the steps to open it. Rand Paul demands answers, Lummis says Bitcoin is the solution That single reply set off a political chain reaction, with Senator Rand Paul calling for an official audit and Senator Cynthia Lummis reiterating her favorite radical alternative—replace gold with Bitcoin. Rand Paul, who has long supported government transparency, jumped in immediately after Elon’s post. “Nope. Let’s do it,” Paul wrote, making it clear he wants a full-scale audit of the reserves. His father, Ron Paul, pushed for gold audits for years, arguing that Americans have no proof the gold even exists, which is quite interesting, isn’t it? Anyway, Lummis told Elon, “Bitcoin fixes this. A bitcoin reserve could be audited anytime 24/7 with a basic computer. It’s time to upgrade our reserves.” Elon responded to her recommendation with an emoji that symbolizes thinking, likely meaning he’s gonna think about it. Bitcoin is transparent to a fault, unlike Fort Knox, which remains locked away with no public verification. Her proposal? Ditch gold, buy Bitcoin, and create a US strategic BTC reserve. The US Mint claims Fort Knox holds 147.3 million ounces of gold, but here’s the problem—the government values it at $42.22 per ounce, which puts the official total at just $6.2 billion. That valuation is a joke—gold trades at nearly $2,900 per ounce, making the real value around $425 billion, as aforementioned. Meanwhile, Lummis has already introduced the BITCOIN Act in the Senate, which lays out a plan for the US to create its first official Bitcoin reserve. According to the BICTOIN Act, the plan includes 1 million Bitcoin acquisition program, which would make up 5% of all BTC supply. Lummis also wants to secure Bitcoin vaults run by the US Treasury, designed with both physical and digital security measures. Funding will be pulled from existing Federal Reserve and Treasury funds, meaning no new taxpayer spending, according to the BITCOIN Act. Lummis also wrote that there should be legal protections for Bitcoin self-custody, which will make sure Americans can hold their BTC without interference. Via a post on X, Lummis called the plan a “Louisiana Purchase moment”, comparing it to the massive land acquisition that doubled US territory in 1803. The crypto-loving Senator didn’t expect it, but Trump endorsed the Bitcoin reserve idea. His administration is of course officially crypto-friendly, and he’s openly considered creating a sovereign wealth fund backed by Bitcoin. His support could mean the difference between Congress approving the reserve or blocking it entirely. The US government already holds 200,000 BTC, mostly from asset seizures handled by the US Marshals, and so Lummis wants that Bitcoin moved into the Treasury to kickstart the reserve. She’s also looking at converting old US gold certificates into BTC, which would tie Bitcoin directly into the federal financial system. Meanwhile, states aren’t waiting for Washington. Pennsylvania, Texas, Wyoming, Arizona, Wisconsin, and many others are already exploring state-based Bitcoin reserves, with even more states expected to follow.

Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.000016, meaning a surge to $0.00025 would require a 1462% increase. Meanwhile, Dogecoin, now at $0.259, would need a 383% gain to hit $1.25. While these targets are achievable, they rely heavily on market sentiment, retail hype, and potential ETF approvals rather than core technological improvements. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to reach $2 much sooner. Currently priced at $0.01 in its first phase of the presale, MUTM offers real DeFi utility with its dual lending model, allowing stable and variable borrowing. With its structured roadmap and growing investor interest, MUTM is poised for an explosive rally well before mid-2025. A surge to $2 would mark a 19,900% increase, 200x returns for early investors.

Mutuum Finance is committed to continuous innovation, focusing on advanced analytics, projected smart contracts, and strengthened security.

The Web3Bay presale, featuring its 3BAY token alongside other cryptocurrencies, has already achieved remarkable success, surpassing $1.2 million. This accomplishment underscores the substantial investor interest in Web3Bay’s innovative decentralized e-commerce platform. With over 292 million tokens sold at $0.004562625 each, the project demonstrates significant potential within the Web3 commerce sector. The Web3Bay presale numbers speak for themselves, demonstrating a strong belief in the project’s vision. Web3Bay: A Deep Dive into Blockchain-Enhanced E-Commerce What exactly is Web3Bay, and what makes it unique? Web3Bay is a decentralized marketplace built to eliminate intermediaries and facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions. Unlike traditional centralized platforms that impose substantial fees and control user data, Web3Bay empowers buyers and sellers to transact securely using smart contracts. This approach significantly reduces costs while providing transparent and trustless interactions. The platform also offers diverse payment options, encompassing both cryptocurrency and established fiat methods like PayPal, expanding accessibility to a wider audience. Web3Bay’s smart contract escrow system further strengthens security, ensuring that payments are only released when both parties have fulfilled their commitments. This feature safeguards buyers from potential scams and promotes fair trade. Furthermore, Web3Bay token holders can stake their tokens, generating passive income while contributing to the ecosystem’s health. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early presale participants could realize a substantial return on their investment, positioning Web3Bay as a compelling opportunity in 2025. The Web3Bay concept is centered around user empowerment and security. Web3Bay’s Distinctive Approach in the Evolving Blockchain Commerce Arena While Web3Bay is not alone in exploring the integration of blockchain with real-world applications, its approach sets it apart. While other projects might emphasize supply chain transparency, tokenized assets, or DeFi-driven commerce, Web3Bay distinguishes itself with a functional marketplace that delivers a smooth user experience. Rather than solely focusing on backend blockchain integrations, Web3Bay prioritizes user adoption, multi-currency support, and efficient transactions. Its hybrid payment system, accommodating both crypto and traditional payments, facilitates a seamless transition for mainstream users. Another key differentiator for Web3Bay is its commitment to low transaction fees. In contrast to centralized marketplaces that can charge up to 15% per sale, Web3Bay operates with minimal costs, benefiting both buyers and sellers. The platform’s escrow-backed dispute resolution mechanism and community-driven marketplace governance enhance trust within the ecosystem. This user-centric philosophy explains the rapid growth of the Web3Bay community, evident in the increasing activity across its Telegram and other social media channels. The Web3Bay team is focused on building a platform that is both powerful and accessible. Web3Bay’s Presale Success: A Testament to its Potential The impressive performance of the Web3Bay presale, exceeding $1.2 million, reflects investor confidence in the project’s long-term vision. The stage-based pricing model rewards early adopters, allowing them to acquire tokens at lower prices before each subsequent phase increases the token’s value. With the current presale price at $0.004562625, the token is projected to reach $0.1959 after launch, presenting a significant potential upside. With a well-defined roadmap, practical real-world utility, and a thriving presale, Web3Bay is emerging as a promising crypto investment in 2025. The Web3Bay presale numbers indicate a strong belief in the project’s future. The success of the presale is a validation of the Web3Bay team’s hard work.

With its recent price surge, investors are wondering: Will SHIB reach $0.000025, or is there a new player on the block that will take the spotlight? WallitIQ (WLTQ) , the under-the-radar altcoin with massive potential, is currently in its presale stage, priced at $0.0420 , and analysts predict it could soar to $250. That’s a potential return of over 5000%! WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Hidden Gem Set To Outperform Soar With AI-Driven Features While Shiba Inu is still grabbing headlines, a hidden gem in the crypto market could outperform it by leaps and bounds: WallitIQ (WLTQ) . This under-the-radar altcoin is an AI-powered token with cutting-edge technology and strong utility that offers a unique value proposition. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale investors can stake the altcoins and earn up to 180% annual percentage yield (APY). The platform’s staking program gives early investors a massive edge, creating a passive income stream that could yield impressive returns. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has the potential for explosive growth, with its secure AI-powered platform as the foundation for this success. SolidProof has audited the platform’s smart contract, and the built-in anomaly detection feature continuously monitors transactions to safeguard investors’ assets. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) beta version launching soon, investors are rushing to secure their tokens at the presale price. The platform’s MVP build includes live market data, allowing users to track crypto prices through a CoinGecko API integration. In addition, the platform simplifies crypto transactions with its Scan & Pay QR technology, making sending and receiving crypto payments more effortless than ever. But there’s more.

They’re also gaining access to exclusive educational content , market research, and in-depth analytics. As if that wasn’t enough, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers bonus tokens for investors who participate in the presale and refer others. The more people join, the more demand for the token grows, and the higher the value could go. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has its charm, it’s clear that WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a unique opportunity to secure a long-term position in a promising project. The presale is ongoing, and the price is ridiculously low at $0.0420 . Shiba Inu’s Next Breakout: Will It Reach $0.000025? Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00001603, and its recent price action has investors wondering if it can reach and break through its key resistance level at $0.000025. In recent weeks, the meme coin saw a promising 14% surge. However, this path is not without its challenges. Shiba Inu is facing significant hurdles in sustaining momentum. Trading volumes have been relatively low, which raises concerns about whether it can maintain enough buying pressure to push past the $0.000025 level. Even if Shiba Inu manages to break the resistance, it must hold above this level for a sustained period to target higher levels. In addition, the volume of transactions involving the meme coin has dipped below $400 million to $262 million. This reduction in liquidity suggests that the excitement around Shiba Inu may be cooling off, and sustaining upward momentum could prove difficult without more large trades. So, as investors keep an eye on Shiba Inu’s performance and whether it can reach $0.000025, there’s another rewarding opportunity they should not overlook—WallitIQ (WLTQ), the under-the-radar altcoin that’s ready to take the spotlight and outperform the meme coin in a significant way. Conclusion: Buy The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Altcoin Presale Before It’s Too Late Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be on the brink of a breakout, but its potential pales compared to the opportunity that WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers . With its ongoing presale, investors can get in at an unbelievably low price of $0.0420 per token. The under-the-radar altcoin could easily take the spotlight and soar to incredible heights. Buying the WallitIQ (WLTQ) under-the-radar altcoin presale guarantees investment in the future of crypto technology with high staking rewards, cutting-edge security, and exclusive educational content. By investing early, investors will capitalize on WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) utilities and potentially make huge profits. Don’t let this presale opportunity pass you by.

Qubetics Could Be the Answer to Your What-Ifs,https://thecoinrise.com/still-thinking-about-missing-binance-qubetics-could-be-the-answer-to-your-what-ifs/,"The crypto world never sleeps, and lately, it’s been buzzing with some eyebrow-raising developments. Just recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hit the pause button on its lawsuit against Binance, signaling a potential shift towards a more crypto-friendly approach. This move comes on the heels of Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, stepping down after pleading guilty to federal charges and the company agreeing to a hefty fine. With such shake-ups, investors are searching for the next best performing crypto that can offer stability and explosive potential. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a rising star aiming to tackle the very issues that have tripped up its predecessors. Positioning itself as the world’s first Layer 1, Web3 aggregated ecosystem, Qubetics is on a mission to unify leading blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. By enhancing scalability, security, and interoperability, Qubetics promises to create a seamless experience for users and developers alike. Qubetics: Bridging the Gaps Qubetics is making history as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, addressing the very issues that have plagued other platforms. At its core, Qubetics focuses on interoperability, ensuring that various blockchains can communicate seamlessly. This groundbreaking approach is a game-changer for businesses, professionals, and individual users, eliminating fragmentation and enabling a truly decentralized and connected crypto ecosystem. Imagine a freelance graphic designer who prefers payments in Ethereum working with a client who transacts in Bitcoin. With Qubetics’ platform, this exchange becomes effortless, eliminating the need for multiple wallets or third-party exchanges. Developers, too, stand to benefit. Building decentralized applications (dApps) that can operate across multiple blockchains becomes more straightforward, expanding the potential user base and enhancing functionality. The excitement around Qubetics is palpable. The project is in its 21st presale stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.0733. The presale has already raised over $12.9 million, with more than 474 million $TICS tokens sold to over 20,000 holders. Analysts are buzzing with predictions, suggesting that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating into a 209.67% return on investment. Looking further ahead, forecasts indicate potential prices of $1 post-presale and up to $15 after the mainnet launch, offering returns that could turn a modest investment into a substantial gain. Binance: The Giant’s Stumbles Binance has long been a heavyweight in the crypto arena, offering a vast array of services from spot trading to futures. However, its journey hasn’t been without hurdles. The recent legal entanglements, culminating in a $4.3 billion fine and the resignation of its founder, have cast shadows over its operations. These events have led to increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide, causing some users to question the platform’s stability and long-term viability. Despite these challenges, Binance continues to operate globally, processing over $100 trillion in transactions over the past seven years. The appointment of Richard Teng as the new CEO marks a strategic shift towards compliance and transparency. Teng, a former regulator, aims to rebuild trust and steer the platform through these turbulent times. Yet, for many, the question remains: Is Binance still the best performing crypto platform to bet on? While Binance has dominated the market for years, the writing’s on the wall—regulation is coming, and it’s hitting centralized exchanges hard. Users worldwide have faced account restrictions, frozen withdrawals, and regulatory crackdowns that have forced them to look elsewhere. If past cycles have taught anything, it’s that the next big thing is usually brewing just as the old guard starts to crumble. Conclusion While Binance has been a dominant force, its recent challenges highlight the need for innovation and adaptability. Qubetics , with its emphasis on interoperability and practical solutions, offers a compelling alternative for those looking to invest in the next big thing.

33767162,[object Object],1739748613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Sees $1 Billion In Exchange Inflows – Is A Bloodbath Coming?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sees-1-billion-in-exchange-inflows-is-a-bloodbath-coming/,"Bitcoin is currently hovering around $97,000 within the past 24 hours, which is an extension between its range trading between $98,600 and $95,000 throughout last week. Amidst these back and forth motion, data shows a negative trend among Bitcoin traders, which could intensify a price drop. According to data from on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin saw around $1.4 billion net inflows into crypto exchanges in the just-concluded week. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Spike Amid Market Uncertainty IntoTheBlock’s data , shared on social media platform X, highlighted that $1.04 billion were sent into crypto exchanges last week. Unsurprisingly, this run of inflows erased the outflows in the previous three weeks. As noted by IntoTheBlock, this shift in capital movement suggests growing hesitancy among Bitcoin holders, largely driven by prevailing global political and economic uncertainties. Adding to concerns, the Bitcoin network saw a notable drop in transaction fees. On-chain data shows that fees declined by 10.74% compared to the prior week. This decline in fees signals lower network activity, which is often a bearish indicator. A rise in transaction fees typically suggests increasing demand and higher market engagement, while a drop implies reduced interest and weaker momentum for Bitcoin’s price. Image From X: IntoTheBlock Spot Bitcoin ETFs Could Be Driving Exchange Inflows A major factor behind the surge in Bitcoin exchange inflows could be outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs. US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been a major cause of Bitcoin’s bull run this year, with consistent inflows fueling upward momentum. However, last week played out very differently for these Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Particularly, data from SosoValue reveals that US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $651.83 million in net outflows over the past week. Interestingly, this is the largest weekly outflow recorded in these Spot Bitcoin ETFs since the first week of September 2024. This suggests that some institutional investors have been offloading Bitcoin, either to secure profits or in response to lingering uncertainty after the drastic price crash at the beginning of February. Image From SosoValue The Bitcoin inflows into crypto exchanges open up a bearish case for Bitcoin, especially since it creates a selling pressure on exchanges. Technical analysis shows that Bitcoin is currently trapped between key supply and demand levels. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, there is a significant 1.43 million BTC demand wall between $94,660 and $97,540, while a 1.16 million BTC supply wall sits between $97,650 and $99,470. A breakout in either direction will potentially set the trend for the next major move. If Bitcoin breaks above the $99,470 resistance, it could trigger fresh buying momentum and push the price substantially above the $100,000 mark again. However, a more extended correction could unfold if selling pressure intensifies and BTC falls below the $94,660 support.

While meme coins and AI-driven projects are generating excitement, a different kind of opportunity is emerging: Web3Bay (3BAY). This decentralized e-commerce platform is quickly becoming a top contender among the best crypto ICOs for 2025. Alongside projects like Wall Street Pepe and MIND of Pepe, Web3Bay is poised for substantial growth, offering both practical utility and impressive presale traction. Web3Bay has already raised $1.2 million in its presale, selling 300 million tokens. Let’s explore why these three projects are attracting attention and why Web3Bay might just be the most promising of the bunch. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Wall Street Pepe has made a significant splash in the meme coin arena, raking in over $68 million in its presale. This project has resonated with investors by combining the power of viral marketing with actual trading tools, adding value beyond mere speculation. A key differentiator for Wall Street Pepe is its VIP Club. This exclusive, token-gated community provides members with real-time trading insights, sophisticated analytics, and “whale-level” market calls. These resources, traditionally available only to large institutional investors, are now being democratized for retail traders through WEPE. Wall Street Pepe has already secured listings on major exchanges, with both DEX and CEX launches planned after the presale concludes. The project also incentivizes early adopters with passive income opportunities, fostering long-term investment. With its Pepe-inspired branding and an aggressive marketing strategy, the question on everyone’s mind is whether Wall Street Pepe can achieve the same level of success as previous meme coin giants. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) Another frog-themed project with a unique twist, MIND of Pepe integrates AI-driven market analysis into the meme coin world. This self-learning AI agent is designed to analyze market data, identify trends, and generate trading signals, essentially offering an intelligent trading assistant for crypto enthusiasts. The $MIND presale has already attracted nearly $5 million in a short period, demonstrating strong demand for AI-powered trading tools. Unlike simple chatbots that merely present market information, MIND of Pepe is designed to manage crypto wallets, analyze market sentiment, and even autonomously launch tokens. With the growing trend of AI-integrated finance, this project is capitalizing on the increasing interest in AI-driven investment solutions. Early investors can acquire $MIND tokens at a discounted presale price, with staking rewards and passive income opportunities providing additional incentives for long-term holding. 3. Web3Bay (3BAY) Among the best crypto ICOs, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out as a potential game-changer, aiming to transform the multi-trillion dollar e-commerce industry using blockchain technology. Unlike centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay facilitates direct, peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating intermediaries and their associated high fees. With the online shopping sector expanding rapidly, Web3Bay is positioned as one of the best crypto investments for 2025. The project has already raised over $1.2 million, with 300 million tokens sold in its presale, demonstrating significant investor interest. Currently priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, 3BAY is projected to launch at $0.1959, representing an estimated 4,200% ROI for early backers who participate in one of the best crypto ICOs. Why Web3Bay is One of the Best Crypto ICOs: Decentralized Marketplace: Buyers and sellers connect directly, bypassing intermediaries and lowering costs. Smart Contract Renouncement: Ensures no single entity can manipulate the ecosystem after the presale. Staking Rewards: Investors can stake 3BAY tokens to earn passive income and enjoy reduced fees. Community Governance: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) empowers token holders to vote on important platform decisions. Blockchain Security: Transactions are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof, utilizing IPFS storage for data integrity. As blockchain technology continues to reshape various industries, Web3Bay is emerging as a compelling presale opportunity among the best crypto ICOs. With its strong presale performance, Web3Bay isn’t just another crypto project; it represents a significant advancement in online commerce. Summing Up While Wall Street Pepe and MIND of Pepe tap into the hype surrounding meme coins and AI, Web3Bay provides a real-world use case with substantial upside potential. Its disruptive approach to e-commerce, impressive presale demand, and significant projected ROI make it one of the best crypto ICOs available. As the crypto market matures, investors are increasingly focusing on utility-driven projects with long-term viability. While meme coins can offer short-term gains, Web3Bay represents a fundamental shift in online commerce, making it a potentially smart investment for 2025. For investors looking for the best crypto ICOs , Web3Bay offers a compelling opportunity. With its innovative approach and strong community support, Web3Bay stands out among the best crypto ICOs. Don’t miss out on the best crypto ICOs; research and invest wisely.

Bitget (BGB) has recently moved to $6.72, sparking renewed market interest. Its price is approaching crucial resistance points, with expectations it might surpass $7.77 soon. At the same time, Solana’s (SOL) future looks bright, with predictions pointing to a possible rise to $300 by 2025, spurred by ETF speculations and increasing institutional engagement. Currently, BlockDAG (BDAG) is the buzz of the crypto community, offering a substantial 350% boost with its FINALCALL700 promotion. The project has already attracted $195.5 million, with 18.4 billion BDAG distributed and rumors of impending major exchange listings. Traders are eager to buy BDAG at its present price, knowing the value could skyrocket post-listing. Bitget Token Price Gains as It Nears Key Resistance The Bitget (BGB) price recently reached $6.72, showing strong market interest. This rise coincides with a boost in trading activity, with experts monitoring crucial resistance points around $7.77 to see if BGB can advance further. The peak price of $8.49 for Bitget is an important milestone, and if the current positive trend continues, it might approach this high soon. Future projections for Bitget’s price in 2025 vary from $8.78 to $21.16, encouraged by its platform’s growing popularity and broader use. Yet, some cautious estimates warn of a possible fall to $1.73 should market mood decline. Solana (SOL) Price Forecast for 2025: Will It Reach $300? Solana’s price has stirred considerable interest, with a 2025 forecast aiming for a bold $300. Recent policy talks have amplified this outlook, proposing Solana’s inclusion in a crypto initiative backed by reserves, boosting confidence in its potential. Despite a recent dip to $204 from $217, essential technical indicators imply that there might be a buying uptick soon. Solana maintains support at the $180 and $200 levels, emphasizing a positive outlook. Expectations of an ETF by VanEck and continued interest in digital assets from professional circles are propelling Solana’s price upwards. A significant influence on Solana’s future price could be an upcoming press conference with David Sacks, a notable figure in digital asset investment. Positive discussions about Solana’s network growth and wider adoption might further boost its prospects, possibly pushing its price towards $300 by 2025. BlockDAG’s 350% Bonus Sparks Frenzy in the Crypto Community While Bitget and Solana are capturing attention, BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus is currently the main attraction. This limited-time presale offers an extraordinary 350% boost on BDAG, generating an impressive response from those eager to maximize their participation before it ends. BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the standout crypto projects of the year, driven by significant achievements: A presale tallying up to $195.5 million Over 18.4 billion BDAG sold, with increasing demand Plans for listings on 10 leading centralized exchanges An impressive price increase of 2,380% from $0.001 to $0.0248 The figures are telling. Early participants have seen substantial gains, with forecasts suggesting BDAG could reach $1 soon, and possibly $20 by 2027. For those calculating the returns, the numbers are compelling. A $1,000 spending in BDAG now, with the 350% bonus, could grow to $4,500 in BDAG. Should BDAG hit the anticipated $20, this could mean a windfall of $3.6 million. A $10,000 worth of assets might yield $36.2 million. The potential for profit is massive, positioning BDAG as one of the top crypto assets this year. The excitement is further fueled by anticipated exchange listings that could significantly increase BDAG’s price once it hits the market. With these major listings on the horizon, those in the know are securing their BDAG before the presale ends. As the FINALCALL700 bonus nears its conclusion, the window to acquire BDAG at such an attractive rate is closing rapidly. Crypto Market Heats Up: Don’t Miss Out The crypto market is ripe with opportunities as key assets gain momentum. Bitget’s price is advancing towards critical resistance, poised to reach new heights if the trend persists. Meanwhile, predictions suggest Solana could reach $300 by 2025, supported by ETF buzz and strategic discussions. However, the standout narrative is BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus, igniting the market with a substantial 350% BDAG boost. With a whopping $195.5 million raised, 18.4 billion BDAG sold, and a 2380% price leap, BDAG’s potential is unmistakable. The project is gearing up for listings on 10 prominent exchanges, with experts predicting a future price of $20. For those aiming to capitalize on huge returns, BDAG offers an unmatched opportunity. As the crypto presale accelerates, acquiring BDAG at its current price might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity before it debuts on the open market at a much higher valuation.

Turns out, Jerome Powell has been in direct and frequent talks with the White House, despite the president’s very public dislike of him. Kevin Hassett, Trump’s top economic adviser and the director of the National Economic Council, confirmed the regular discussions, saying they were meant to exchange views on the US economy while keeping the Fed’s independence intact. “Jay’s an independent person, the Fed’s independence is respected,” Hassett said on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. “The point is the president’s opinion can also be heard. He’s the president of the United States.” Trump does not like Powell, and he has made sure everyone knows, as he tends to. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump raged against Powell, saying he should be fired and replaced with someone who would do what the Oval wanted. Powell stood his ground in his typical classy fashion, and even said he would sue if Trump ever tried to remove him illegally. The White House meetings may be labeled as friendly economic discussions, but Powell knows that if Trump doesn’t get what he wants, he won’t hesitate to turn on him again. Trump’s White House revives direct Fed talks “I have arranged to begin, once again, regular lunches with Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve,” Hassett said in his interview. “Jay and I have a long and collegial relationship, and I’m going to go over there with him and the other governors. So we’re going to talk about our views about what’s going on, and listen to his.” Inflation has been a major problem for both Trump and Powell. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a 4.6% rise over the last three months, way above the Fed’s 2% target. Prices are still high for food, gas, and everyday essentials. Eggs, in particular, have been a disaster. “I just went to the grocery store,” Hassett said. “I shop for our family, in part because I love to look at prices. And there were no eggs at the store yesterday, just a few.” “We saw the consumer price index come out, and we found out that the stagflation that was created by the policies of President Biden was way worse than we thought,” Hassett said. He pointed out that economists from Biden’s own team, including Jason Furman and Larry Summers, had warned that too much government spending would trigger massive inflation. Now, Trump’s team is working on a multi-layered plan to fix the problem. Hassett said the administration is focused on supply-side tax cuts to increase production, spending reductions through the Department of Government Expenditure (DOGE) and congressional action, more energy production and massive deregulation, as well as industry-specific policies. Moreover, the bird flu outbreak has wiped out millions of chickens, leading to record-high egg prices. Hassett blamed Biden’s response, saying his administration’s solution was simply to kill chickens without a proper containment strategy. “Biden didn’t really have a plan for avian flu,” Hassett said. “They spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken.” The Trump administration is now finalizing a new plan that will focus on biosecurity and medication rather than mass slaughter. Hassett explained that the spread is mostly coming from ducks and geese, not chickens. “So why does it make sense to kill all the chickens when the ducks and geese are spreading the disease?” he said. Trump wants lower interest rates, Fed remains firm Trump publicly called for lower interest rates, arguing that high rates are hurting consumers. “Interest rates need to come down,” he keeps saying via his posts on Truth Social. “We have inflation under control.” But the Federal Reserve does not seem ready to cut rates anytime soon. Powell has said many times before that rates will remain high until inflation fully stabilizes. Hassett, however, defended Trump’s position. He pointed out that market interest rates are already going down. “The 10-year Treasury yield has dropped about 40 basis points in recent weeks,” he said. “That’s saving the American people about $40 billion just from us talking about what we’re about to do.” Trade is also back in focus. Trump wants to reintroduce reciprocal tariffs on countries that have Value-Added Taxes (VATs), including European nations and China. “Right now, US companies are paying $370 billion in taxes to foreign governments,” Hassett said. “Meanwhile, foreign companies are paying the US government only $57 billion.” The White House is now negotiating with foreign leaders, including the UK’s Minister Reynolds, to fix this trade imbalance. The goal is to recover $5 trillion over the next 10 years, which Trump’s team says will fund tax cuts and boost the economy. “We’re talking to leaders of other countries all the time,” Hassett said. “Last night into the wee hours, I was talking to Minister Reynolds from the UK about this very matter.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",News|The Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|FIAT|TRADING|ASIA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-17 00:10:30

While well-established meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to hold their ground, newer projects like BTFD Coin have grabbed the spotlight with impressive presale figures and unique utility offerings. As the BTFD Coin presale enters its final stages, it’s clear that the Top New Meme Coins to Join for Long Term are offering more than just hype. Let’s dive into why Gigachad and Ponke are gaining momentum and why BTFD Coin is becoming the hottest coin to invest in for the long run. The Growing Popularity of Meme Coins Over the past few years, meme coins have surged from internet jokes to serious financial assets. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way for meme coins, with their strong communities and viral potential driving their success. However, new players like Gigachad and Ponke are quickly gaining traction, thanks to their innovative approaches and enthusiastic followings. BTFD Coin is also joining the ranks, differentiating itself with features like a Play2Earn game , staking rewards , and a community-driven referral program . The popularity of meme coins has exploded recently, with new projects consistently entering the market. But what makes this wave different? It’s not just about the meme anymore—these new coins are creating ecosystems, rewarding users, and building strong communities. BTFD Coin stands out with its Play2Earn game and 90% APY staking rewards , while Gigachad and Ponke are carving out their own unique positions in the market. With the presale for BTFD Coin surging past $6 million, it’s clear that this sector is only getting started. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin for the Future If you’re looking to get in on one of the Top New Meme Coins to Join for Long Term , BTFD Coin is hands-down one of the best opportunities in the market right now. With a presale that has raised over $6 million , BTFD Coin is positioning itself to become a major player in the meme coin world. The presale is nearing its end, and once BTFD Coin hits major exchanges, analysts predict a sharp rise in value—possibly shooting up to $0.006 from its current presale price of $0.00016 . What makes BTFD Coin different from other meme coins is its real utility and the incentives it offers for long-term holders. The Play2Earn game , which went live on January 1, 2025, allows players to earn BTFD tokens while playing, turning the meme coin into something more than just a speculative investment. With staking rewards offering an impressive 90% APY , BTFD Coin rewards its holders for staying committed to the project, creating a sustainable ecosystem. But that’s not all. The referral program and the Bulls Squad community are driving the excitement around BTFD Coin . The Bulls Squad —a group of loyal investors and holders—is playing a key role in spreading the word about BTFD Coin and driving its presale success. With over 70 billion coins sold to more than 10,700 holders , BTFD Coin has a growing community that is excited about the project’s long-term potential. The BTFD Coin presale is currently in Stage 14, where investors get an incredible 100% bonus on their purchases through the LAUNCH100 bonus code. If you’re considering jumping in, this is the time to do it before the coin is listed on major exchanges at $0.0006 . For those considering an investment, here’s a scenario: If you were to invest $40,000 at $0.00016 per coin, you’d receive 250 million BTFD tokens. When the coin lists at $0.0006 , your investment would grow to $150,000 . And if the coin hits the $0.006 mark—an expectation after major listings—you’re looking at a $1.5 million investment. This offers a huge potential return for those who believe in the long-term value of BTFD Coin . Gigachad: The Meme Coin with Strong Community Backing Another rising star in the meme coin space is Gigachad . Known for its bold branding and playful approach, Gigachad is quickly becoming one of the Top New Meme Coins to Join for Long Term . Its popularity has soared, especially among younger investors looking for a coin with a strong community focus and a meme-driven marketing strategy. What makes Gigachad stand out is the unique blend of humor and seriousness. The coin is built around the persona of the “Gigachad” meme, but it’s not just about memes. The Gigachad community is highly active, and there’s a growing demand for the coin thanks to its viral appeal. The project is also focusing on creating utility , like exclusive NFTs and staking opportunities, which could drive long-term growth. While it’s still in the early stages, Gigachad has shown solid momentum. Its community-driven approach and strong social media presence make it a Top New Meme Coin to Join for Long Term for anyone looking to invest in something that has both viral potential and growing real-world applications. Ponke: A New Meme Coin with Long-Term Vision If you haven’t heard of Ponke , it’s time to pay attention. Ponke has been gaining a lot of traction lately, largely due to its focus on community involvement and strong rewards programs . While Ponke doesn’t have the same historical weight as Dogecoin or Shiba Inu , its rise is a testament to the meme coin space’s growing influence. Ponke is positioning itself as a long-term investment by focusing on creating real-world use cases, staking opportunities, and community-driven growth. The project has plans to build out a comprehensive ecosystem that includes not just meme coin rewards, but also features like governance tokens, staking pools, and cross-chain compatibility. The goal is to create an engaging ecosystem that rewards users for their participation, ensuring that Ponke isn’t just another flash-in-the-pan meme coin. With its low starting price and community-driven focus , Ponke has the potential to grow into one of the Top New Meme Coins to Join for Long Term . As meme coins continue to dominate the space, Ponke could very well become one of the key players in the next wave of meme coin investments. Conclusion: The Future of Meme Coins Looks Bright Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the Top New Meme Coin to Join for Long Term . With its Play2Earn game , staking rewards , and Bulls Squad community, BTFD Coin is positioned to revolutionize the meme coin market.

Lawyers Jonatan Baldiviezo, Marcos Zelaya, María Eva Koutsovitis, and Claudio Lozano filed the case on Sunday, accusing Javier of playing a central role in a “rug pull” that misled the public and resulted in huge financial losses. Javier promoted $LIBRA on Friday via X (formerly Twitter), and his post drew immediate attention, triggering massive investments. But just hours later, he deleted the post, sending $LIBRA’s price into freefall, and investors watching the market on Dexscreener saw their holdings obliterated. According to the plaintiffs, Javier’s actions amounted to fraud and a violation of Argentina’s Public Ethics Law. Baldiviezo, speaking to The Associated Press, said, “Within this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president’s actions were essential.” The lawsuit accuses Javier of using his position and influence to pump up a financial asset, only to ditch it without warning, leaving unsuspecting investors in the dust. The Presidential Office, in a statement on Saturday, denied any wrongdoing, insisting that Javier was never involved in $LIBRA’s creation, that his post was made in good faith to support entrepreneurial projects but was removed to prevent speculation. Javier himself responded on X, writing, “I was not aware of the details of the project, and after getting informed, I decided not to continue promoting it (which is why I deleted the tweet).” He also accused his political opponents of trying to exploit the controversy to undermine him by the Opposition party. Despite his denial, documents and online records confirm that Javier and members of his administration had met with representatives of KIP Protocol, the team behind $LIBRA, before its launch. The Anti-Corruption Office, which operates under the Executive Branch, has opened an internal investigation. In a statement, the Presidential Office said, “All the information gathered in the investigation will be handed over to the judiciary to determine if any of the companies or individuals linked to the KIP Protocol project committed a crime.” KIP Protocol, Jupiter Exchange, and Hayden Davis react Hayden Davis, the CEO of KIP Protocol, publicly blamed Javier Milei for $LIBRA’s downfall. In a video statement released on Saturday, Hayden said, “Despite prior commitments, Javier and his team unexpectedly changed their position, withdrawing their support and deleting all previous posts on social media.” Meanwhile, crypto exchange Jupiter Exchange acknowledged that some of its team members knew about $LIBRA’s launch before Javier’s tweet. In a statement, Jupiter admitted, “A few members of the Jupiter team knew that there would be, at some point, a token project associated with Argentine President Javier Milei. We learned of this ~2 weeks ago directly from Kelsier Ventures.” Jupiter, however, denied any insider trading and said the coin had already hit a $1.5 billion market cap before receiving the “Verified” tag on their platform. “LIBRA did not get the ‘Verified’ icon in our default token search until roughly one hour after launch,” they said. Despite the denial, the exchange confirmed that dozens of imposter tokens flooded the market immediately after $LIBRA’s launch, making it easy for traders to buy the wrong token by mistake. “We take allegations of insider trading extremely seriously. If you have evidence of Jupiter employees leaking information or otherwise sniping, please reach out directly. If we discover any team members acted on non-public information, we will take quick and decisive action.” $100 million in LIBRA funds still under Hayden’ control Despite the massive price collapse, Hayden Hayden still controls $100 million in LIBRA treasury funds. He announced that he would reinvest and burn all repurchased tokens, insisting that he remains committed to transparency. “Unless a more viable alternative is presented, I intend to begin the process of executing on this plan within the next 48 hours,” Hayden said. He also denied any involvement in fraud, placing the blame squarely on Javier for the coin’s catastrophic crash. Hayden added, “Javier’s associates had secured his public support at launch and had assured me that his continued backing was guaranteed throughout the launch.” He claimed that Javier’s sudden reversal shattered investor confidence and led to the price collapse. While the legal battle intensifies, investors are left with millions in losses, the Argentine government faces mounting scrutiny, and Javier Milei is now at the center of one of the biggest crypto scandals in history.

In a market where investors are transitioning from speculative to practical blockchain applications, Web3Bay is setting itself apart. By utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate a peer-to-peer marketplace, it eliminates intermediaries, slashes fees, and enhances user control over finances. In its fourth presale stage, Web3Bay has successfully raised over $1 million, distributing more than 305 million 3BAY tokens at $0.00456 each. Web3Bay directly targets the multi-billion-dollar e-commerce sector, promising secure and transparent transactions through blockchain. In parallel, DeXe and Render are advancing their own specialties—DeXe in decentralized asset management, and Render in decentralized GPU computing. Analyzing Web3Bay’s presale achievements alongside DeXe and Render’s developments offers insights into potentially lucrative gains for 2025. Web3Bay Presale: Unlocking Exceptional Returns Web3Bay is rapidly becoming a central player in decentralized e-commerce. Its presale strategy involves 28 stages, each progressively increasing in price. Now in Stage 4, the platform has accumulated over $1 million, selling 305 million 3BAY tokens. With an anticipated listing price of $0.1959, early investors are projected to achieve an ROI of 6,430%, making early investment significantly rewarding. Beyond the allure of financial returns, Web3Bay addresses the inherent inefficiencies of traditional online shopping platforms that levy high fees and restrict consumer choices through centralized governance. Web3Bay offers a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers transact directly, thus reducing unnecessary costs. A notable aspect of Web3Bay is its governance model. Unlike centralized platforms, Web3Bay allows token holders to collectively decide on platform fees, policies, and updates, ensuring that it remains governed by its users and adaptable to their needs. Moreover, Web3Bay supports transactions in multiple currencies, including stablecoins, providing transactional stability. This inclusive financial system effectively bridges traditional and crypto payment methodologies, broadening its user base. DeXe: Innovating in Decentralized Asset Management DeXe stands out with its decentralized asset management solutions, allowing users to autonomously manage investments and emulate successful trading strategies. Currently trading at approximately $19.97, DeXe emphasizes transparency and security through blockchain, offering a self-governing investment platform. Investors are keeping a close eye on DeXe’s growth and market adoption, assessing its potential to disrupt traditional finance within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Its innovative asset management model positions it as a potential powerhouse in DeFi, particularly appealing to traditional investors moving towards blockchain solutions. Render: Pioneering Decentralized GPU Rendering Render is redefining GPU rendering by decentralizing the process, linking individuals needing rendering services with GPU owners. With a current trading value of about $4.24 and a daily volume increase of 3.2%, Render offers scalable and cost-efficient rendering solutions, democratizing access to high-performance computing for various industries, including film, gaming, and AI. As the demand for AI and 3D rendering escalates, Render is strategically positioned to benefit from these growing sectors. Its integration with leading creative tools and strategic partnerships could enhance its standing in the tech market. In Summary As the presale of Web3Bay advances with a promising ROI of 6,430%, it emerges as a notable opportunity for investors interested in decentralized e-commerce innovations. Simultaneously, DeXe and Render are expanding their market influence, with DeXe enhancing decentralized asset management and Render advancing in distributed computing resources. Each project offers unique benefits, targeting different market segments and showcasing distinct potential for investment growth.

While the market is flooded with short-lived trends, a select few stand out as the best meme coins to join for long term growth and potential wealth generation. These aren’t just coins; they’re immersive narratives that bring investors on an adventure of excitement, community engagement, and financial rewards. Among the best meme coins to join for long term, three unique projects have emerged as true pioneers: Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT), and Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT). Each of these coins carries a compelling story, innovative tokenomics, and strong community backing, making them potential game-changers in the meme coin landscape. Arctic Pablo Coin leads the charge of all three, offering a groundbreaking narrative that merges myth and reality. This isn’t just about investing in a meme coin—it’s about embarking on an epic journey across undiscovered lands, following Arctic Pablo as he unearths the mystical treasures of the crypto world. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Mystical Journey to Fortune Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a token—it’s an exploration of hidden realms, a journey through uncharted lands, and a ticket to financial success. Investors aren’t merely holders; they become part of the expedition, traveling alongside Arctic Pablo as he unveils ancient mysteries and untapped riches. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on hype, Arctic Pablo Coin blends storytelling with real-world tokenomics. The presale isn’t divided into stages but into locations, each unveiling a new chapter of Pablo’s adventure. The expedition has reached Aqua Frost, having already raised over $1.3. With each new location, the token price increases, rewarding early investors with skyrocketing ROI potential. Arctic Pablo Coin doesn’t just stop at an engaging story—it ensures long-term value through weekly token burns during the presale and the elimination of unsold tokens after launch. This deflationary mechanism enhances scarcity and investor confidence, boosting demand while reducing supply. Arctic Pablo offers a 66% APY staking program for those who want to maximize their holdings. Investors can stake their APC tokens, allowing them to grow their assets while participating in the grand expedition. All staked tokens will be vested for two months post-launch, ensuring stability and continuous growth. With every new location, Arctic Pablo’s journey becomes more exhilarating. Those who join early are in for a ride filled with adventure, wealth-building, and an ever-growing community that believes in the legend of Arctic Pablo. It is one of the best meme coins to join for long term. Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT): From Internet Sensation to Crypto Star Peanut the Squirrel is proof that virality and crypto make an unstoppable duo. What started as a heartbreaking news story became a multi-million-dollar meme coin phenomenon. After Peanut’s tragic euthanasia due to rabies concerns, the internet rallied around the beloved squirrel, catapulting $PNUT into the spotlight. However, Peanut’s owner, Mark Longo, wasn’t thrilled. Feeling exploited, he launched his own cryptocurrency, JUSTICE, to fund his animal sanctuary. This led to a clash between investors and Peanut’s real-life legacy. The controversy brought even more attention to $PNUT, keeping it in the limelight. While its initial rise was driven by virality, the coin now focuses on utility. Developers are integrating NFTs and staking rewards to ensure longevity. For those who love a good underdog story, $PNUT remains one of the best meme coins to join for long term potential. Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT): Mythology Meets Meme Culture While internet trends inspire many meme coins, Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) taps into the power of ancient mythology. This coin reimagines the Greek god Zeus as the ultimate meme overlord, merging historical storytelling with crypto innovation. Goatseus Maximus isn’t just a meme—it’s an entire mythos. The project features an exclusive NFT collection depicting legendary figures and mythical creatures, giving holders access to staking rewards, voting rights, and limited-edition digital assets. Unlike meme coins that fade after their viral moment, $GOAT has built a devoted following. Its community-driven approach fosters long-term engagement, making it a solid option for meme coin investors seeking sustainability. Developers have hinted at a play-to-earn (P2E) game and metaverse integration, adding layers of utility that could sustain the coin’s growth. As a result, $GOAT remains a strong contender among the best meme coins to join for long term potential. Conclusion: Which Meme Coin Holds the Crown? Based on research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) stands out as the most promising long-term investment. Unlike short-lived meme trends, Arctic Pablo’s journey unfolds in real-time, creating an ongoing narrative that keeps investors engaged and rewarded. For those looking for high potential ROI, token burns, and 66% APY staking make it a standout pick. Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) thrives on viral momentum, while Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) offers mythological appeal, but neither can match Arctic Pablo’s innovative approach to long-term wealth generation. Don’t miss out—join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale today and become part of the greatest crypto adventure of the decade!

However, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL is emerging as a potential game-changer, with analysts predicting a breakout of up to 50,000%. What Makes THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Stand Out? 1. Limited Supply for Maximum Value: With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN leverages a deflationary model to ensure scarcity and drive demand. This gives it a major edge over tokens like Solana (SOL) and Kaspa (KAS), which have higher supply and more gradual demand growth. 2. Exclusive Sale Platform: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is only available at MAGACOINOFFICIAL.COM , adding an exclusive appeal that many competitors lack. Unlike Solana or Optimism (OP), which are widely traded, this controlled distribution creates a sense of urgency for early investors. >>> PRESALE LIVE NOW – LIMITED SPOTS! >> DON’T MISS THE NEXT 1000X CRYPTO – CLICK HERE TO JOIN NOW! 3. Early-Stage Momentum: Raising $1.9 million within minutes, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL has already proven its market appeal. With predictions of a 50,000% increase, it’s capturing attention as a high-potential token for investors seeking exponential returns. How It Stacks Up Against the Competition Solana (SOL, $25.01): Known for speed and scalability, but it lacks the exclusive presale advantage and early momentum of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Kaspa (KAS, $0.12): A rising star in blockchain, yet its growth doesn’t match the explosive potential seen in this new token. Optimism (OP, $1.72): A solid project for scalability, but it’s overshadowed by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s unique market positioning.

The third largest cryptocurrency hit a high of $2.80 before reversing back. XRP’s price action in the coming sessions will be shaped by key support and resistance levels. As for Bitcoin, the price is trading below important resistance levels, failing to establish a clear trend. Bitcoin is currently trading at $96,500 and is down by more than 2% in the last 24 hours. Possible Bullish Scenarios If XRP breaks above $2.79 to $2.80, the next upside targets could be $2.96 and $3.30. A strong breakout could push the price further toward $4.19 or even $5. However, until the market sees a clear breakout above the resistance levels, there’s always a possibility for further consolidation. What’s Next for XRP? If the price breaks out decisively above the current resistance, it could head towards new highs. But be aware of potential pullbacks into support areas. Analysts are eyeing levels around $2.80 for a breakout, with the ultimate target being the all-time high of $3.40. Current Trend Overview The price saw a strong rally in November, breaking above the 2021 high of $1.96. After reaching a high of $2.90 in early December, it entered a corrective sideways pattern. The market has been volatile, but the range remains quite large. However, the price found support around $1.95 in early February, and this level could act as a key point for future price movements. Key Support Levels (mid-term) The support range for XRP is between $1.96 and $2.35. A rally from the low around February 3rd is currently in play, but some experts believe the price may still see another dip into the support area before a major breakout.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-17 02:31:16
