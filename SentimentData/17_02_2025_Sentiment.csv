40423382,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675961,1739741459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40423382.jpeg,Solana records fifth straight week of DEX volume decline,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-fifth-week-dex-volume-decline/,"Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Solana recorded approximately $20.2 billion in the week that ended February 16. The numbers extend a streak of declining weekly trading volume for the fifth straight week, based on DeFiLlama data. The data analysis site also revealed that in the week ending February 10, 2025, Solana’s on-chain transaction volumes fell by 28%, totaling $31.8 billion. The slide in Solana DEX activity has been linked to a broader market trend. Similar volume reductions have been observed across other blockchains like BNB Chain, Ethereum, Sui, and Polygon. Solana’s declining numbers According to DeFiLlama , the weekly trading volume has fallen by 24.35%, totaling $28.893 billion over the past week. Meteora reported the most activity as the top DEX with a volume of $875.8 million, followed by Raydium at $836.37 million and Orca at $322.32 million. The cumulative trading volume for the top DEXs reached $155.172 billion over the entire period. Meteora had a weekly Total Value Locked (TVL) of $8.024 billion with a volume/TVL ratio of 0.84, which indicates strong liquidity. Raydium had a higher weekly TVL but a lower volume/TVL ratio of 0.5. While Solana DEXs have witnessed a volume decline, those on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have picked up, and the chain currently has the highest trading volume among decentralized exchanges. This is a stark difference from March 2024 stats when BSC DEXs trailed in third place by trading volume at $47.81 billion, behind Solana and Ethereum, while the fourth spot went to Arbitrum’s $27.74 billion. The increase in BSC’s trading volume indicates a significant increase in activity and coincides with the return of memes to the ecosystem, which is ironic because many believe one reason Solana DEXs are declining in volume is because of meme fatigue. Solana currently has the moniker of the “home of memes.” However, this cycle has seen many bad actors and selfish players extract millions from the ecosystem thanks to Pump.fun’s effectiveness in proliferating memes, even without any technical knowledge. Factors implicated in the Solana DEX decline The decline in Solana’s DEX volume can be partially attributed to the gradual cooling in the memecoin trading craze that has gripped Solana since the bull run started. Many memes have come and gone, and users seem to have been exhausted by the continuous pump-and-dump schemes, rugpulls, and insider trading. The sentiment of traders could also be because they are just about ready for something different. Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), came forward with a meme that drove trading traffic back to BSC and has seemingly now jump-started meme season on the chain. The Solana chain remains a top competitor in the DEX market. The value of the SOL token has significantly declined by over 50% in the past year, but many analysts still remain optimistic about the network’s long-term potential. A good example of those who still believe in Solana’s supremacy is Mert Mumtaz , the Helius Labs CEO. Following the latest Libra memecoin debacle led by Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, Mert went off on trolls calling the Solana chain a scam chain because of the number of memecoin scams that occur on it. In a series of tweets, Mert talked about the toxic sentiments surrounding the chain, pointing out that the network itself has no control over what it is used for. As far as Mert is concerned, the tech works, which is why memes have been so successful on the chain, and nothing else matters.

In contrast, PEPE and TRUMP tokens are experiencing sharp declines, losing double-digit percentages. Meanwhile, a new contender called XYZ is making waves by surpassing $7 million during its presale phase. What’s driving these contrasting fortunes in the cryptocurrency market? XYZ’s Rise to Glory: The Meme Coin Fighter Punching Through the Crypto Arena XYZVerse is the next heavyweight champion of meme coins. Crowned Best NEW Meme Project , it blends the electric energy of sports with meme culture, drawing in millions of fans who want to be part of something bigger. Every great story needs a hero. Not the biggest, not the strongest—just the one crazy enough to keep pushing forward. That’s XYZepe , the masked fighter, the die-hard believer, and the relentless holder of $XYZ . His mission is to bring XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap and carve XYZ into crypto history. In response, the CMC community is totally behind this future champ: 95% are super bullish on $XYZ. But greatness isn’t handed out—it’s earned in the ring. $XYZ has already passed through 9 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a mindblowing take off. Undervalued at $0.002, $XYZ is a bet worth making. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the start of something legendary. XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? Dogecoin: From Meme to Mainstream – Is the Doge Still Barking? Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun take on cryptocurrencies. It used the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there is no cap on how many can exist. Initially seen as a joke, Dogecoin’s value soared in 2021. It climbed into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with its total value surpassing $50 billion. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, helped fuel this rise. The coin’s creators, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, meant it as a light-hearted project. But it quickly showed the power of community and social media in financial markets. As for its potential, Dogecoin relies on its strong online community. Its technology is similar to other cryptocurrencies, but it doesn’t offer unique features like smart contracts. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as a risky but exciting asset. Other coins, like Ethereum, have more established uses and technologies. Market trends show that social media can greatly impact Dogecoin’s price. So, whether it’s attractive depends on one’s appetite for risk and belief in the community driving it. PEPE Coin Soars: How a Frog Meme Became a Billion-Dollar Cryptocurrency PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum, inspired by the popular Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Aiming to join the ranks of meme-based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE embraces its meme origins without pretense. With no taxes and no promises of utility, it keeps things simple and appeals to the fun-loving side of the crypto community. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap reaching a staggering $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive returns, and a strong community of enthusiasts rallied behind it. This frenzy sparked what some call a “memecoin season,” with new meme-based tokens popping up and experiencing wild price swings. As the crypto world anticipates the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, many are watching to see if PEPE will reach new heights. Its roadmap includes ambitious goals like listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover,” suggesting that PEPE isn’t just a fleeting fad. In the unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, PEPE stands out as a symbol of the power of internet culture and community-driven success. Trump Coin ($TRUMP) Surges to $15 Billion Market Cap Before Pullback Trump Coin ($TRUMP), a newly launched meme coin backed by President-elect Donald Trump, quickly surged in value, reaching a peak market capitalization of $15 billion early Sunday before settling around $9 billion. The token, built on the Solana blockchain, saw an explosive 300% gain within hours of its release, briefly trading above $75 per coin. Despite its rapid rise and subsequent pullback, $TRUMP remains a significant player in the meme coin space, leveraging Trump’s branding power ahead of his inauguration. With an initial 200 million coin supply, developers plan to gradually expand circulation to 1 billion tokens over three years. However, 80% of the total supply remains locked, controlled by CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, two Trump-affiliated entities set to earn revenue from trading activity. While the coin’s website states that $TRUMP is not an investment or political asset, its association with Trump has fueled speculation and investor interest, positioning it as a unique crossover between crypto, branding, and political influence. Conclusion While DOGE, PEPE, and TRUMP show positive signs, XYZ stands out as an all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and targeting notable growth with its community-driven platform.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen some interesting price movements recently. Over the past week, its price rose by 4.50%. However, in the last month, it dropped by 22.19%. Looking back six months, SHIB’s price is up by 24.65%. Currently, SHIB trades between $0.0000125 and $0.0000178. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0000200. If it breaks this level, the next target could be $0.0000254, which is about a 42% increase from current prices. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.00000939. If the price falls below this, it may find support around $0.000004040. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.0000166, slightly above the 100-day average of $0.0000160. This suggests a short-term upward trend. The relative strength index is at 50.70, indicating a neutral market. The stochastic oscillator is low at 8.81, which may mean SHIB is oversold. This could lead to a price increase soon. The MACD level is positive at 0.0000001193, hinting at possible bullish momentum. Conclusion With SHIB’s bullish momentum evident, XYZ emerges as the pioneering sports memecoin aiming for massive growth and community-driven success in the current bull run.

His endorsement caused a brief surge in the token’s value before it crashed, leading to accusations of fraud. Critics claim this was a pump-and-dump scheme , and some are calling for his impeachment. The government has formed a task force to determine if Milei or others committed illegal acts. On February 14, Milei promoted LIBRA on X, suggesting it could boost Argentina’s economy and support small businesses. This caused the token’s market cap to jump beyond $4 billion , with insiders cashing out over $100 million in profits. However, the surge was short-lived. LIBRA lacked a structured financial model, its website was set up only hours before launch, and over $87 million was withdrawn within the first three hours. The token’s value collapsed soon after, showing clear signs of a pump-and-dump. According to The Kobeissi Letter, large holders quickly liquidated their assets, some making $4 million or more as the market cap peaked at $4.6 billion. At 5:40 PM ET, when the price hit its highest point, LIBRA’s value plummeted. In response to public backlash, Milei deleted his promotional post and claimed he had not fully understood the project. Later, he explained that after learning more, he decided to stop promoting it. Argentina’s presidential office tried to downplay the issue, calling it a standard blockchain-related promotion. However, officials admitted that Milei had met with Hayden Mark Davis, a figure connected to LIBRA’s infrastructure through KIP Protocol. The government has now launched an official probe to examine whether any officials, including Milei, acted improperly. Investigators will also scrutinize KIP Protocol for possible legal violations. To contain the damage, Milei ordered the creation of a special Investigation Task Unit (UTI), consisting of financial, crypto, and anti-money laundering specialists. This unit will analyze LIBRA’s launch and those involved. The government stated that all findings will be turned over to the courts to determine if any crimes were committed. Beyond cryptocurrency, the controversy has triggered a political crisis. Critics argue that Milei’s reckless endorsement of a speculative asset led to financial losses for investors. Argentine lawmaker Gabriela Estevez accused him of engaging in a classic pump-and-dump scheme, where token creators buy at a low price, hype it up, and sell at a peak, leaving others with losses. The scandal has even led to impeachment threats. A political faction has officially started proceedings, calling the incident unprecedented in Argentina’s history. Buenos Aires Governor Axel Kicillof called it a large-scale financial fraud, warning that both local and international investors had been misled. He compared the situation to a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme. This case highlights the dangers of political figures endorsing meme coins, a trend that has grown since former U.S. President Donald Trump launched his own token. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin had already warned that such political meme coins could damage the crypto market’s credibility. Since Trump’s involvement, scammers have launched fake tokens based on political figures, with LIBRA being the latest example of these risks.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-16 21:46:29

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. ChowWow is gaining traction, with analysts predicting a massive surge and the potential to be Solana’s next top meme coin. Table of Contents Solana: Strong on-chain metrics ChowWow: Surging presale and secure transactions Conclusion The crypto market shows growing interest in ChowWow (CHOW) as it builds momentum this first quarter. Analysts project a significant increase in the coin’s value that could mirror Solana’s (SOL) fast market growth. As excitement builds, the main question is whether CHOW could become the top Solana meme coin. ChowWow continues to achieve increasing prominence in both the crypto space and social media platforms thanks to its strong presale performance. The platform provides a virtual gaming environment alongside special rewards and distinctive collectibles. With the DeFi coin price at $0.008, alongside massive forecasted growth, CHOW could emerge as the next big crypto following SOL. Solana: Strong on-chain metrics Solana maintained stable values above the crucial threshold in January 2025 while the market showed stability as investors displayed positive attitudes and new technological developments emerged. Investor confidence rose further as the price returned from losses experienced in November 2024. Total Value Locked experienced a 48% increase during the last 30 days. Solana achieved a major accomplishment in the previous month by reaching the benchmark where its decentralized exchange (DEX) processed $3.8 billion in 24-hour trading volume. The DeFi sector continues to recognize the growing dominance of Solana based on its strong on-chain metrics.

With its presale structured in ten stages and currently in the early phase, both top and new investors can join. Notably, the presale requires minimum purchases of $25. The cryptocurrency’s presale is selling out fast, with analysts predicting a price rise to $0.0288 upon launch. The anticipated 260% price increase could deliver massive returns on investments. Due to its implementation of Proof of History and Proof of Stake mechanisms, ChowWow could shine by providing quick and secure transactions at affordable rates. The platform is also undergoing regular third-party audits that build up both its credibility and security. ChowWow’s stake-to-earn model acts as a key growth driver by providing an additional revenue source. Users can receive monthly rewards by staking their CHOW tokens, with APYs between 8% and 15%. The project’s play-to-earn game further attracts investors by providing rewards through gameplay activities. Token holders within the game have exclusive access to in-app purchases even though the game operates as an open and free platform available to all players. Conclusion As analysts predict a massive surge for ChowWow and its potential to become the top Solana meme coin, smart investors are joining its presale. With the DeFi coin price at $0.008 alongside features like stake-to-earn and play-to-earn models, CHOW is emerging as a dominant force in the meme coin space.

40424536,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675958,1739742604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40424536.jpeg,France demands an emergency global meeting over Trump’s economic and geopolitical actions,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/france-demands-an-emergency-global-meeting-over-trumps-economic-and-geopolitical-actions/,"French President Emmanuel Macron has summoned European leaders for an emergency meeting in Paris to discuss the escalating global tensions caused by Donald Trump’s latest economic and geopolitical decisions. The meeting is scheduled for Monday, according to a report from Fox. Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski first hinted at the gathering while speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. He said the leaders would address Trump’s actions “in a very serious fashion” and described the U.S. president’s strategy as a form of military-style testing. “President Trump operates using what the Russians call ‘razvedka boyem’—reconnaissance through battle. He pushes forward, watches what happens, then adjusts. And we need to respond,” Sikorski told attendees. Europe scrambles to react as Trump threatens new tariffs Trump has announced sweeping tariffs, including a 25% duty on U.S. steel and aluminum imports, set to take effect on March 12. He has also instructed his administration to prepare additional automobile tariffs, expected to be revealed in April. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking in an interview with Bloomberg, said the European Union is preparing to counteract any economic harm but remains open to negotiations. “We are strong enough to respond to anything that damages the European economy,” Scholz said on Saturday. “But we should always leave room for an agreement, because it benefits everyone, especially on both sides of the Atlantic.” The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, is already reviewing countermeasures. If Trump moves ahead with the tariffs, Brussels is ready to hit back with retaliatory duties on U.S. goods. Officials have reportedly reactivated lists of American products that were targeted during Trump’s first term. “The EU will respond firmly and immediately against unjustified trade barriers, including tariffs designed to attack legal and non-discriminatory policies,” the European Commission said in a statement on Friday. The tariffs aren’t just about trade. Trump’s economic aggression is unfolding at a time when Germany’s economy is under immense pressure. The country is grappling with high energy costs, a slowdown in exports, and rising support for the far-right AfD party, which advocates for leaving the eurozone and scrapping environmental policies. Trump had said on Truth Social that: “I have decided, for purposes of Fairness, that I will charge a RECIPROCAL Tariff meaning, whatever Countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them – No more, no less! For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff. Sending merchandise, product, or anything by any other name through another Country, for purposes of unfairly harming America, will not be accepted.” He also warned that foreign government subsidies designed to undercut American businesses will be dealt with, along with hidden trade barriers that block U.S. products or shut out American companies. “We know exactly how much these sneaky trade barriers cost us,” Trump said, making it clear that the U.S. will fight back against unfair economic tactics. His message to the world? Either lower your tariffs against the U.S., or deal with the consequences. He reminded everyone that countries have been leeching off America for decades, whether they were allies or adversaries. That’s over. “If you manufacture in the U.S., you don’t have to worry about tariffs. Simple as that.” Trump ended by saying he’s already given the green light to his top officials—State, Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR—to make sure America gets exactly what it deserves. “We’re bringing real fairness back to trade. No more one-sided deals. It’s about time these countries remember everything America has done for them.” Macron walks a tightrope with Trump amid economic tensions Macron has maintained cordial relations with Trump since the November election, despite the looming trade war. After Trump’s victory, Macron posted a message on X (formerly Twitter), writing: “Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump. Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.” The relationship appeared warm in December when Trump visited Paris for the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening. Macron personally welcomed him, saying: “It’s a great honor for French people to welcome you five years later. You were president at that time, and I remember your solidarity and immediate action. So, welcome back. We are happy to have you here.” Behind closed doors, however, European officials are growing uneasy about Trump’s economic unpredictability. The Paris meeting signals that Macron and other EU leaders are preparing for a serious confrontation with Washington. Trump’s strategy is clear—he believes in economic retaliation. On Thursday, he instructed his team to develop new tariffs targeting countries he deems unfair trading partners. The move, described by Politico as his most aggressive trade action yet, has sent shockwaves across Europe’s political and economic circles. EU disses Trump for being reckless The European Union, which prides itself on having some of the world’s lowest tariffs, is furious. In a direct rebuke, the European Commission slammed Trump’s “reciprocal tariff” policy, calling it economically reckless and warning that it will increase business costs, hurt American consumers, and drive inflation higher. Brussels is not backing down, said Sikorski, who added that officials are now reassessing past retaliatory measures, which were previously imposed on Trump’s administration during his first term. Sikorski said if necessary, the EU would act immediately. The tariffs, if implemented, could worsen Germany’s financial woes and further destabilize Scholz’s already fragile political standing ahead of the February 23 election. Brussels’ retaliation strategy will be multi-layered. According to a Bloomberg report, EU officials have also confirmed that past tariff models from Trump’s first term have been updated and prepared for immediate deployment. The scope of countermeasures could range from targeted tariffs on U.S. goods to diplomatic pressure on key American industries. The White House has yet to respond to Macron’s emergency summit, but sources inside Washington indicate that Trump has no intention of backing down. His administration is moving full speed ahead, with officials drafting tariff policies that will be announced in the coming weeks. Sikorski, speaking on behalf of several EU leaders, said Europe’s message to Trump is this: “We act together, and we will stick together. The European economy is strong enough to take action, and that’s exactly what we will do.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",Economy|France|United States,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-16 21:50:04

One of the latest figures to make a surprising prediction is Davinci Jeremie , a long-time Bitcoin proponent who has previously dismissed the token. In a recent social media statement, Jeremie projected that XRP could rise to $20 to $24 during this market cycle. Given the token’s current value of approximately $2.78, this forecast implies a 763% increase. The prediction has generated mixed reactions, with some community members viewing it as an unexpected turnaround and others remaining wary of his new stance. Former XRP Critics Now Reevaluate Jeremie has been vocal about his skepticism toward XRP for years, frequently criticizing its fundamentals and suggesting that the asset could become worthless. However, as the token’s price and adoption gain momentum, many former skeptics, including Jeremie, have started reconsidering their views. Other critics who recently voiced a more positive outlook on XRP include Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, and trader Peter Brandt . Brandt, for instance, has suggested that the token’s market capitalization could reach $500 billion, translating to a price of $8 per token. This shift in sentiment from influential figures has caught the attention of XRP community members, with many questioning the motivations behind these revised perspectives. Community Response: A Shift or an Attempt to Save Face? Jeremie’s updated stance has sparked debate among XRP supporters that critics are now adjusting their narratives to avoid being proven wrong. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Tony Edward, the founder of the Thinking Crypto podcast, responded sarcastically to Jeremie’s remarks, describing the shift as an “XRP hater capitulation.” He pointed out that several high-profile individuals who previously dismissed the token, including billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, are now attempting to reposition themselves. According to Edward, these critics are trying to downplay their earlier comments to avoid losing credibility within the crypto space. Jeremie Maintains Skepticism Despite Price Prediction While Jeremie acknowledges the potential for significant short-term gains, he remains unconvinced about XRP’s long-term viability. He has reiterated his belief that the asset is too closely aligned with the traditional banking system, making it an unsuitable investment for those seeking long-term returns. Jeremie argues that XRP’s association with financial institutions introduces an element of unpredictability, similar to centralized banking entities like the Federal Reserve. This view has led him to caution against holding the token as a long-term asset. His disclaimer has drawn further criticism from the community, with some dismissing it as an attempt to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Despite the backlash, his prediction has added fuel to the ongoing debate about the token’s future trajectory and the changing perspectives of its most vocal critics.

40424406,https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-falls-solana-struggles-while-blockdags-5-usdt-cashback-drives-massive-demand-presale-hits-195-5m/,1739743229,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/40424406.jpeg,"Cardano Falls, Solana Struggles While BlockDAG’s 5% USDT Cashback Drives Massive Demand– Presale Hits $195.5M!",https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-falls-solana-struggles-while-blockdags-5-usdt-cashback-drives-massive-demand-presale-hits-195-5m/,"As market liquidity tightens and key players influence pricing, alternative cryptocurrencies such as Solana and Cardano face challenges in gaining ground, illustrating the wider market’s unpredictability. Solana’s price analysis places SOL between crucial price points, with $190 as support and $199 as potential resistance. A surge past these markers could catalyze gains, yet any pause might cause a decline. The Cardano crash paints a stark contrast, with ADA’s value dropping below $0.71 following a sharp sell-off that triggered $240 million in market liquidations. While SOL and ADA prices fluctuate, BlockDAG (BDAG) progresses in a contrasting trajectory—strengthening with each presale phase. A staggering $195.5 million has been amassed, and its 5% USDT referral scheme is currently the talk of the market. As this initiative broadens BlockDAG’s global base, BDAG ascends the ranks among top crypto picks. Solana Price Analysis: Is $199 the Turning Point? Recent assessments of Solana’s price suggest a pivotal range, with $190 providing substantial support and $199 acting as a critical resistance level. Advancing beyond $199 could shift the momentum towards a positive breakout, but hesitation could lead to a further decrease. Present indicators deliver mixed signals. The RSI is near 43.77, suggesting slight bearish pressure, whereas the OBV at 69.05 million shows consistent interest. Moreover, a rise in network activity, evidenced by daily additions of millions of new addresses, fosters optimism for Solana’s future despite ongoing price instability. However, failure to overcome the $199 mark could drive prices back down toward the support level, placing traders at a crucial juncture. Cardano Crash: A Brief Setback or Extended Decline? The recent plunge in Cardano’s value has alarmed investors, with ADA falling below $0.71 as market liquidations exceeded $240 million. This downturn coincided with a decrease in decentralized exchange (DEX) activity, dropping from $31.3 million in transactions in December to merely $7 million by February, reflecting a decline in investor engagement. Additionally, Cardano’s total value locked (TVL) has halved, plummeting from $701.4 million to $355.7 million, and significant sell-offs by whales have exacerbated the decline. With Bitcoin and Ethereum also experiencing downturns, pressure mounts on ADA. Traders now question whether Cardano will stabilize or continue to suffer. The coming days will be pivotal. BlockDAG’s 5% USDT: Why Traders Find It Appealing Unlike typical crypto offers that require waiting for gains, BlockDAG’s referral program immediately rewards. This limited-time opportunity provides a unique 5% USDT cashback instantly upon a BDAG purchase, making it a standout offer. What sets this program apart? It benefits both the referrer and the purchaser with 5% USDT back, enticing traders globally to buy BDAG at its current rate before another likely price increase while accumulating extra USDT. Furthermore, another factor contributes to BDAG’s prominence among top crypto picks—not just the cashback. BlockDAG has become a viral phenomenon, raising over $195.5 million, selling 18.4 billion BDAG, and delivering a 2380% ROI to early buyers. This presale, nearing $200 million, is not just substantial—it’s record-setting in the crypto realm. Yet, here’s the highlight. BDAG’s current price is only $0.0248. Despite its popularity in a competitive market, BDAG remains affordable—but not for long. Each new batch raises the price, and analysts project BDAG could reach $1 this year, positioning it as a top choice for traders currently. Moreover, the referrals do more than attract new buyers—they propel BDAG’s momentum. As demand for BDAG increases, supply tightens, and with a robust and expanding community of 170,000 supporters behind it, BDAG’s future looks increasingly promising. 2025’s Top Crypto Picks– Final Call! Solana’s price analysis indicates the coin is testing resistance at $199, while the Cardano crash has erased $240 million. As one coin tests crucial levels and another faces significant losses, traders anticipate their next moves. However, some are not just waiting—BlockDAG’s presale is redefining strategies, attracting traders worldwide. With BlockDAG’s crypto presale soaring past $195.5 million, it’s evident that demand continues robustly. Its 5% USDT referral program is driving quick expansion, with the community eagerly accumulating BDAG before the anticipated price rise. Despite shifts in the crypto market and evolving trends, BlockDAG maintains its course. The next increase is imminent. Those hesitating may miss the most significant crypto opportunity yet.

Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is turning heads in the crypto world, and its unique presale model is making waves. Meanwhile, TST and Apu Apustaja are also making headlines with recent developments. Arctic Pablo Coin is already in its 10th presale phase, Aqua Frost, having raised over $1.3 million in under a month. Its deflationary structure and high staking rewards make it one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins—Arctic Pablo Coin, TST, and Apu Apustaja. Scarcity Meets Value: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Token Burn Strategy One of Arctic Pablo Coin’s standout features is its powerful token burn mechanism.

Once the presale ends, any remaining tokens will also be burned, reinforcing a deflationary model designed to benefit early investors.

Here’s How,https://timestabloid.com/cardano-ada-holders-can-now-transfer-ada-to-solana-heres-how/,"A new cross-chain solution has enabled Cardano users to move ADA to the Solana blockchain. Wanchain , a blockchain interoperability company recently launched the bridge that facilitates this transfer. New Cross-Chain Bridge for ADA Transfers On February 13, Wanchain announced the launch of a new interoperability route, allowing ADA holders to transfer their tokens from the Cardano network to Solana. This feature is limited to one-way transfers, meaning ADA can move to Solana, but users cannot yet bridge assets in the opposite direction. The company’s official statement described this as a significant step toward increased connectivity between the two ecosystems, emphasizing the removal of previous barriers that separated them. Bridging Process and Transaction Fees To transfer ADA assets to Solana, ADA holders need to use Wanchain’s bridging platform The process requires connecting a Cardano wallet, selecting Cardano as the source blockchain and ADA as the asset, and then designating Solana as the destination network. At the time of writing, the transaction fee for using the bridge is 2.29 ADA, equivalent to approximately $1.85. Addressing Cardano-Solana Rivalry Before unveiling the feature, Wanchain acknowledged the long-standing rivalry between the Cardano and Solana communities. In a social media post on February 11, the company humorously referenced the differences in perception between the two groups, pointing out that some Solana users dismiss Cardano due to its perceived lack of adoption, while certain Cardano supporters criticize Solana for being heavily focused on meme coins. Despite these differences, Wanchain positioned the bridge as an opportunity to foster greater interoperability, allowing users to benefit from the unique features of both networks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Future Developments: SOL to ADA Transfers Although the current integration only supports ADA-to-Solana transfers, Wanchain has confirmed that a Solana-to-Cardano bridge is in progress. However, no official release date has been provided. Additionally, the company has hinted at the launch of a new product update on February 19, describing it as a significant enhancement to one of its existing solutions. More details on this development are expected in the coming days. The bridge enables seamless interaction between Cardano and Solana, allowing users to leverage Solana’s ecosystem for enhanced cross-chain transactions and DeFi capabilities. The growth of interoperability solutions like Wanchain’s bridge could play a crucial role in connecting different blockchain networks and reducing fragmentation in the industry. As adoption grows, it will be exciting to see how ADA and SOL benefit from increased accessibility and collaboration.

On Sunday, People’s Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng told global leaders at the AlUla Conference for Emerging Market Economies in Saudi Arabia that while other currencies are crumbling against the rising U.S. dollar, the yuan has stayed steady. “Recently, a number of factors have pushed up (the) dollar index, and non-dollar currencies have mostly depreciated. But RMB (yuan) has remained largely stable despite the high market volatility,” Pan said at the event, which was organized by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Saudi Arabia’s Finance Ministry. China pushes domestic spending over investment Pan said China is moving away from relying on massive infrastructure projects to drive growth and instead focusing on domestic consumption. The government is raising household incomes, offering subsidies, and rolling out pro-consumption policies to keep the economy moving. China has made 2025 the year of consumption growth. The goal is simple: get people to spend more money instead of relying on exports and investment-heavy growth. Pan said China’s price growth and consumer demand could be stronger, but he’s confident that the economy is on solid ground, with risks from local government debt and the real estate sector shrinking. Monetary policy is also changing a bit. Pan said that China will use proactive fiscal policies and accommodative monetary measures, with an emphasis on counter-cyclical adjustments to keep financial markets stable. China is facing headwinds, though. “Rising trade protectionism, geopolitical tensions, and the fragmentation of the global economy” are challenges Beijing cannot ignore, Pan said. Still, he stressed that China is committed to keeping its markets open and pushing forward with economic reforms. Asian central banks take on the dollar with currency forwards China isn’t the only country fighting back against the dollar’s strength. Across Asia, central banks are turning to derivatives to defend their currencies, using a strategy that raises concerns about how long they can sustain these interventions. India’s central bank has ramped up its use of currency forwards, pushing its net dollar short forward position to a record $68 billion in December. Indonesia has also piled on risk, with its short forward book hitting $19.6 billion, the highest level since at least 2015. On January 20, when Trump officially returned to office, a White House fact sheet outlined his plan to crack down on currency manipulation. The very next day, U.S. Treasury has labeled countries as currency manipulators before, and Trump previously put China in that category. Malaysia is also in the game, with its forward book reaching $27.5 billion by November, after swelling by $4 billion in 2024. The Philippines, on the other hand, has taken a more cautious approach, cutting its net long forward position down to just $874 million, according to IMF data. Asian central banks are also up against U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade strategies, which are mostly just tariffs and threats of tariffs. Last week, Trump made it clear that he doesn’t like foreign governments intervening in currency markets when he said via a post on Truth Social that: “I have decided, for purposes of Fairness, that I will charge a RECIPROCAL Tariff meaning, whatever Countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them – No more, no less! For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff.” Currency forwards give central banks an edge. Unlike direct interventions, these derivatives don’t drain foreign exchange reserves and don’t attract as much attention from Washington. That makes them an attractive tool for countries trying to stabilize their currencies without landing on Trump’s radar. The dollar has recently taken a hit, giving central banks some breathing room. Trump has delayed or canceled tariffs on Canada, Colombia, and Mexico, raising doubts about whether he will follow through on his biggest trade threats. A broad dollar index has slipped 1.8% this year, showing signs of softening. India’s Reserve Bank (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra is also making changes. The RBI has scaled back its non-deliverable forward market bets, opting instead to conduct onshore interventions to improve domestic liquidity. While this is great, JPMorgan analysts believe currency forwards will remain a go-to tool for central banks for the foreseeable future, according to a note they sent their clients on Friday.

BTFD Coin ($BTFD) , Dogecoin , and Shiba Inu are three of the top meme coins to invest in now, each bringing something unique to the table. BTFD Coin is making waves with its presale success, while Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to defy bearish pressures, proving their staying power in the meme coin space. But why are these coins gaining so much attention, and which one should you invest in? Let’s dive in and find out. The Rise of Meme Coins Meme coins have surged in popularity over the past few years, with coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu becoming household names. These projects are powered by vibrant, engaged communities and viral potential. BTFD Coin has emerged as the latest contender, entering the meme coin market with a bang. Its innovative approach, which includes a Play2Earn game, staking rewards , and a referral program , has captured the attention of investors. What sets BTFD Coin apart is its focus on community engagement and utility, offering more than just the speculative nature typical of meme coins. Despite recent bearish pressures affecting the broader crypto market, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to hold strong, with Dogecoin showing resilience thanks to its strong backing and adoption as a payment method by major companies. Shiba Inu has similarly grown its ecosystem, including the launch of the Shiba Inu metaverse. These coins have proven their ability to stay relevant in a market that often sees wild price swings, and their continued success is a testament to their community-driven power. Now, with BTFD Coin entering its final run of presale, it’s a prime time to consider these top meme coins to invest in now. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin Revolution in the Making When it comes to BTFD Coin , this is not just another meme coin trying to capture the internet’s attention. With a presale that has already raised over $6 million, BTFD Coin has proven its potential. Investors are flocking to the presale as BTFD Coin enters its final stages, and analysts are predicting that this coin will experience massive gains once it lists on major exchanges. A big part of what makes BTFD Coin stand out is its Play2Earn game , which went live on January 1, 2025. This game allows players to earn rewards in BTFD tokens, providing real utility for the coin and ensuring that its value is tied to something tangible. Additionally, BTFD Coin offers staking rewards with an impressive 90% APY , which incentivizes long-term holding and creates a sense of stability for investors. The referral program further strengthens its community-driven approach, encouraging users to bring others into the fold while earning rewards for doing so. The Bulls Squad —a dedicated group of BTFD Coin holders—has proven that strong, engaged communities are essential for the long-term success of meme coins. BTFD Coin ‘s community power has been a driving factor behind its rapid presale growth, and with more than 70 billion coins sold to over 10,700 holders, the momentum is undeniable. The Bulls Squad continues to drive excitement through social media, online forums, and grassroots initiatives, creating a sense of belonging and ownership among its members. In fact, the BTFD Coin presale has been a major success, and with Stage 14 offering a 100% bonus through the LAUNCH100 bonus code, there’s no better time to get involved. For every BTFD Coin purchase in Stage 14, investors will receive double the number of tokens, making this a rare opportunity to maximize returns. See Your Investments Multiply with BTFD Coin The BTFD Coin presale is currently priced at $0.00016 per coin, and analysts predict that once BTFD Coin is listed on major exchanges, its price could skyrocket to $0.006. For example, if you were to invest $40,000 at the current presale price, you’d receive 250 million BTFD tokens. If the coin rises to $0.006 post-listing, your investment could grow to $1.5 million—an incredible return. With the BTFD Coin presale showing no signs of slowing down, it’s clear that this coin is set for a meteoric rise. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin That Defies All Odds Despite facing significant bearish pressures recently, Dogecoin has shown remarkable resilience. Once considered a joke, Dogecoin has risen to prominence thanks to its strong community, major endorsements, and use cases in real-world applications. What started as an internet meme has become one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the world. Dogecoin has found success because of its broad adoption. Companies like Tesla have started accepting DOGE as payment for products, and Dogecoin has been incorporated into various online platforms and payment systems. This real-world use case is what keeps Dogecoin strong, even when the market is facing turbulence. Unlike some other meme coins, Dogecoin benefits from its established position in the market and is supported by a growing number of institutional and retail investors. With the broader crypto market experiencing downturns, Dogecoin continues to hold strong as one of the top meme coins to invest in now. The price fluctuations are expected as always, but Dogecoin ’s long-term value has only increased as it gains more institutional backing and real-world use cases. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin with a Massive Ecosystem While Dogecoin is the most well-known meme coin, Shiba Inu has rapidly emerged as its main competitor. Created as an “experiment in decentralized community building,” Shiba Inu has quickly gained a massive following, and its ecosystem is constantly growing. With the launch of the Shiba Inu metaverse , ShibaSwap , and a decentralized exchange (DEX), Shiba Inu has established itself as more than just a meme coin. What makes Shiba Inu stand out is its ShibaSwap platform , where users can earn rewards by staking and participating in liquidity pools. The growing Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to add value to its SHIB token, ensuring its place as one of the top meme coins to invest in now. Despite the market’s ups and downs, Shiba Inu has continued to grow, with a loyal following that believes in the project’s long-term vision. Like Dogecoin , a dedicated community supports Shiba Inu, and the project’s developers continue innovating with new initiatives to maintain momentum. With so many features in development, Shiba Inu is set to remain a key player in the meme coin market.

This prediction is based on ETH’s current price action in the four-hour time frame. Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ETH appears to be forming an ascending triangle pattern on the four-hour time frame but is currently facing resistance from the descending trendline and seems to be falling toward the pattern’s support level. Based on the recent price action, if ETH fails to hold the $2,680 level and closes a four-hour candle below $2,670, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 4.5% to reach the $2,560 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View Along with the bearish outlook, ETH is currently trading below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame, indicating that the asset is in a downtrend and has the potential to continue this bearish trend further. Ether Liquidation Risk With the bearish outlook, intraday traders’ $74 million worth of long positions are on the verge of liquidation. Data shows that a significant $72 million worth of long positions was opened when traders became over-leveraged at the $2,657 level. This massive amount of ETH will be liquidated if the price falls below this over-leveraged level. Conversely, traders holding long positions are over-leveraged at the $2,730 level, with $275 million worth of long positions at risk of liquidation if the price falls further. Source: Coinglass Current Price Momentum Currently, ETH is trading near the $2,685 level and has experienced a modest price drop of 0.55% in the past 24 hours.

40426888,https://timestabloid.com/?p=57526,1739746453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ripple Rebrands Website, Here are the Key Changes",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-rebrands-website-here-are-the-key-changes/,"Ripple has introduced a major redesign of its website and branding, signaling a shift in its strategic direction. In a recent X post , the company announced the changes and emphasized a renewed focus on financial innovation and the Internet of Value (IoV) development. This rebranding effort reflects a broader vision for the company’s role in the evolving digital asset landscape. Renowned XRP community figure WrathofKahneman analyzed the updates, identifying significant changes that could indicate a shift in Ripple’s priorities. His observations raise questions about the company’s evolving approach to key sectors, including Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Ripple’s Updated Focus The redesigned website highlights Ripple’s core offerings, which include cross-border payments, digital asset custody, and stablecoins. The company’s priorities include seamless, cost-effective international transactions while expanding into new areas. Its acquisition of Standard Custody has strengthened its presence in the digital asset custody space, allowing banks and fintech firms to store digital assets on behalf of their customers. Additionally, its stablecoin initiative, Ripple USD (RLUSD) , is positioned as a tool for instant global transactions and increased liquidity in digital asset markets. CBDC Reference Removed: A Shift in Strategy? The website’s content has significantly changed, with no mention of CBDCs. Ripple previously collaborated with governments and financial institutions on CBDC initiatives , working on pilot projects with countries like Palau and Georgia. The company also launched a dedicated CBDC platform to support central banks in developing digital currencies. The decision to remove references to these efforts has sparked speculation within the XRP community. WrathofKahneman questioned whether Ripple is deliberately stepping back from CBDC-related projects or simply avoiding drawing attention to them. This shift comes amid a changing regulatory environment in the U.S., where former President Donald Trump issued an executive order restricting efforts to develop and promote CBDCs . Given this backdrop, Ripple’s decision to exclude CBDCs from its website could indicate a strategic move to align with current U.S. policies or reduce regulatory scrutiny. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Key Observations Beyond the repeal of CBDC content, Ripple’s rebranded website reflects several other notable changes. Unlike previous versions, it does not introduce new customers, raising questions about the company’s recent business developments. However, there is a stronger emphasis on Web3 investments, with Ripple now highlighting over $600 million invested in the sector and more than 70 direct investments in blockchain-related projects. Additionally, the rebrand focuses more on developer engagement. The website now makes developer documentation more accessible, suggesting an effort to encourage innovation and broader participation within Ripple’s ecosystem. What This Rebrand Signals for Ripple’s Future Ripple’s updated branding and website redesign indicate a strategic effort to refine its public image and messaging. By emphasizing cross-border payments, digital asset custody, and stablecoins, the company appears to be reinforcing its commitment to institutional adoption while navigating regulatory challenges. As Ripple continues to evolve, industry observers and XRP enthusiasts will closely monitor its next moves. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

40426955,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675979,1739746574,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40426955.jpeg,Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E looks to update US gold reserves with Bitcoin after Fort Knox audit,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musks-d-o-g-e-looks-to-update-us-gold-reserves-with-bitcoin-after-fort-knox-audit/,"Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) has its next mission: find out if Fort Knox actually holds the 4,580 tons of gold it claims to have. Elon was pulled into the debate today when an X user asked him to check if the US gold reserves still exist. Elon responded , “Surely it’s reviewed at least every year.” The US Treasury claims that Fort Knox holds $425 billion worth of gold at market rates, but the last time anyone actually saw it was in 2017, when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin visited. Before that? 1974, when journalists and lawmakers were allowed inside after rumors of missing gold started spreading. The vault remains one of the most restricted locations on Earth, and no single person knows all the steps to open it. Rand Paul demands answers, Lummis says Bitcoin is the solution That single reply set off a political chain reaction, with Senator Rand Paul calling for an official audit and Senator Cynthia Lummis reiterating her favorite radical alternative—replace gold with Bitcoin. Rand Paul, who has long supported government transparency, jumped in immediately after Elon’s post. “Nope. Let’s do it,” Paul wrote, making it clear he wants a full-scale audit of the reserves. His father, Ron Paul, pushed for gold audits for years, arguing that Americans have no proof the gold even exists, which is quite interesting, isn’t it? Anyway, Lummis told Elon, “Bitcoin fixes this. A bitcoin reserve could be audited anytime 24/7 with a basic computer. It’s time to upgrade our reserves.” Elon responded to her recommendation with an emoji that symbolizes thinking, likely meaning he’s gonna think about it. Bitcoin is transparent to a fault, unlike Fort Knox, which remains locked away with no public verification. Her proposal? Ditch gold, buy Bitcoin, and create a US strategic BTC reserve. The US Mint claims Fort Knox holds 147.3 million ounces of gold, but here’s the problem—the government values it at $42.22 per ounce, which puts the official total at just $6.2 billion. That valuation is a joke—gold trades at nearly $2,900 per ounce, making the real value around $425 billion, as aforementioned. Meanwhile, Lummis has already introduced the BITCOIN Act in the Senate, which lays out a plan for the US to create its first official Bitcoin reserve. According to the BICTOIN Act, the plan includes 1 million Bitcoin acquisition program, which would make up 5% of all BTC supply. Lummis also wants to secure Bitcoin vaults run by the US Treasury, designed with both physical and digital security measures. Funding will be pulled from existing Federal Reserve and Treasury funds, meaning no new taxpayer spending, according to the BITCOIN Act. Lummis also wrote that there should be legal protections for Bitcoin self-custody, which will make sure Americans can hold their BTC without interference. Via a post on X, Lummis called the plan a “Louisiana Purchase moment”, comparing it to the massive land acquisition that doubled US territory in 1803. The crypto-loving Senator didn’t expect it, but Trump endorsed the Bitcoin reserve idea. His administration is of course officially crypto-friendly, and he’s openly considered creating a sovereign wealth fund backed by Bitcoin. His support could mean the difference between Congress approving the reserve or blocking it entirely. The US government already holds 200,000 BTC, mostly from asset seizures handled by the US Marshals, and so Lummis wants that Bitcoin moved into the Treasury to kickstart the reserve. She’s also looking at converting old US gold certificates into BTC, which would tie Bitcoin directly into the federal financial system. Meanwhile, states aren’t waiting for Washington. Pennsylvania, Texas, Wyoming, Arizona, Wisconsin, and many others are already exploring state-based Bitcoin reserves, with even more states expected to follow.

Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.000016, meaning a surge to $0.00025 would require a 1462% increase. Meanwhile, Dogecoin, now at $0.259, would need a 383% gain to hit $1.25. While these targets are achievable, they rely heavily on market sentiment, retail hype, and potential ETF approvals rather than core technological improvements. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to reach $2 much sooner. Currently priced at $0.01 in its first phase of the presale, MUTM offers real DeFi utility with its dual lending model, allowing stable and variable borrowing. With its structured roadmap and growing investor interest, MUTM is poised for an explosive rally well before mid-2025. A surge to $2 would mark a 19,900% increase, 200x returns for early investors.

Mutuum Finance is committed to continuous innovation, focusing on advanced analytics, projected smart contracts, and strengthened security.

The Web3Bay presale, featuring its 3BAY token alongside other cryptocurrencies, has already achieved remarkable success, surpassing $1.2 million. This accomplishment underscores the substantial investor interest in Web3Bay’s innovative decentralized e-commerce platform. With over 292 million tokens sold at $0.004562625 each, the project demonstrates significant potential within the Web3 commerce sector. The Web3Bay presale numbers speak for themselves, demonstrating a strong belief in the project’s vision. Web3Bay: A Deep Dive into Blockchain-Enhanced E-Commerce What exactly is Web3Bay, and what makes it unique? Web3Bay is a decentralized marketplace built to eliminate intermediaries and facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions. Unlike traditional centralized platforms that impose substantial fees and control user data, Web3Bay empowers buyers and sellers to transact securely using smart contracts. This approach significantly reduces costs while providing transparent and trustless interactions. The platform also offers diverse payment options, encompassing both cryptocurrency and established fiat methods like PayPal, expanding accessibility to a wider audience. Web3Bay’s smart contract escrow system further strengthens security, ensuring that payments are only released when both parties have fulfilled their commitments. This feature safeguards buyers from potential scams and promotes fair trade. Furthermore, Web3Bay token holders can stake their tokens, generating passive income while contributing to the ecosystem’s health. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early presale participants could realize a substantial return on their investment, positioning Web3Bay as a compelling opportunity in 2025. The Web3Bay concept is centered around user empowerment and security. Web3Bay’s Distinctive Approach in the Evolving Blockchain Commerce Arena While Web3Bay is not alone in exploring the integration of blockchain with real-world applications, its approach sets it apart. While other projects might emphasize supply chain transparency, tokenized assets, or DeFi-driven commerce, Web3Bay distinguishes itself with a functional marketplace that delivers a smooth user experience. Rather than solely focusing on backend blockchain integrations, Web3Bay prioritizes user adoption, multi-currency support, and efficient transactions. Its hybrid payment system, accommodating both crypto and traditional payments, facilitates a seamless transition for mainstream users. Another key differentiator for Web3Bay is its commitment to low transaction fees. In contrast to centralized marketplaces that can charge up to 15% per sale, Web3Bay operates with minimal costs, benefiting both buyers and sellers. The platform’s escrow-backed dispute resolution mechanism and community-driven marketplace governance enhance trust within the ecosystem. This user-centric philosophy explains the rapid growth of the Web3Bay community, evident in the increasing activity across its Telegram and other social media channels. The Web3Bay team is focused on building a platform that is both powerful and accessible. Web3Bay’s Presale Success: A Testament to its Potential The impressive performance of the Web3Bay presale, exceeding $1.2 million, reflects investor confidence in the project’s long-term vision. The stage-based pricing model rewards early adopters, allowing them to acquire tokens at lower prices before each subsequent phase increases the token’s value. With the current presale price at $0.004562625, the token is projected to reach $0.1959 after launch, presenting a significant potential upside. With a well-defined roadmap, practical real-world utility, and a thriving presale, Web3Bay is emerging as a promising crypto investment in 2025. The Web3Bay presale numbers indicate a strong belief in the project’s future. The success of the presale is a validation of the Web3Bay team’s hard work.

With its recent price surge, investors are wondering: Will SHIB reach $0.000025, or is there a new player on the block that will take the spotlight? WallitIQ (WLTQ) , the under-the-radar altcoin with massive potential, is currently in its presale stage, priced at $0.0420 , and analysts predict it could soar to $250. That’s a potential return of over 5000%! WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Hidden Gem Set To Outperform Soar With AI-Driven Features While Shiba Inu is still grabbing headlines, a hidden gem in the crypto market could outperform it by leaps and bounds: WallitIQ (WLTQ) . This under-the-radar altcoin is an AI-powered token with cutting-edge technology and strong utility that offers a unique value proposition. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale investors can stake the altcoins and earn up to 180% annual percentage yield (APY). The platform’s staking program gives early investors a massive edge, creating a passive income stream that could yield impressive returns. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has the potential for explosive growth, with its secure AI-powered platform as the foundation for this success. SolidProof has audited the platform’s smart contract, and the built-in anomaly detection feature continuously monitors transactions to safeguard investors’ assets. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) beta version launching soon, investors are rushing to secure their tokens at the presale price. The platform’s MVP build includes live market data, allowing users to track crypto prices through a CoinGecko API integration. In addition, the platform simplifies crypto transactions with its Scan & Pay QR technology, making sending and receiving crypto payments more effortless than ever. But there’s more.

They’re also gaining access to exclusive educational content , market research, and in-depth analytics. As if that wasn’t enough, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers bonus tokens for investors who participate in the presale and refer others. The more people join, the more demand for the token grows, and the higher the value could go. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has its charm, it’s clear that WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a unique opportunity to secure a long-term position in a promising project. The presale is ongoing, and the price is ridiculously low at $0.0420 . Shiba Inu’s Next Breakout: Will It Reach $0.000025? Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00001603, and its recent price action has investors wondering if it can reach and break through its key resistance level at $0.000025. In recent weeks, the meme coin saw a promising 14% surge. However, this path is not without its challenges. Shiba Inu is facing significant hurdles in sustaining momentum. Trading volumes have been relatively low, which raises concerns about whether it can maintain enough buying pressure to push past the $0.000025 level. Even if Shiba Inu manages to break the resistance, it must hold above this level for a sustained period to target higher levels. In addition, the volume of transactions involving the meme coin has dipped below $400 million to $262 million. This reduction in liquidity suggests that the excitement around Shiba Inu may be cooling off, and sustaining upward momentum could prove difficult without more large trades. So, as investors keep an eye on Shiba Inu’s performance and whether it can reach $0.000025, there’s another rewarding opportunity they should not overlook—WallitIQ (WLTQ), the under-the-radar altcoin that’s ready to take the spotlight and outperform the meme coin in a significant way. Conclusion: Buy The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Altcoin Presale Before It’s Too Late Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be on the brink of a breakout, but its potential pales compared to the opportunity that WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers . With its ongoing presale, investors can get in at an unbelievably low price of $0.0420 per token. The under-the-radar altcoin could easily take the spotlight and soar to incredible heights. Buying the WallitIQ (WLTQ) under-the-radar altcoin presale guarantees investment in the future of crypto technology with high staking rewards, cutting-edge security, and exclusive educational content. By investing early, investors will capitalize on WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) utilities and potentially make huge profits. Don’t let this presale opportunity pass you by.

Qubetics Could Be the Answer to Your What-Ifs,https://thecoinrise.com/still-thinking-about-missing-binance-qubetics-could-be-the-answer-to-your-what-ifs/,"The crypto world never sleeps, and lately, it’s been buzzing with some eyebrow-raising developments. Just recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hit the pause button on its lawsuit against Binance, signaling a potential shift towards a more crypto-friendly approach. This move comes on the heels of Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, stepping down after pleading guilty to federal charges and the company agreeing to a hefty fine. With such shake-ups, investors are searching for the next best performing crypto that can offer stability and explosive potential. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a rising star aiming to tackle the very issues that have tripped up its predecessors. Positioning itself as the world’s first Layer 1, Web3 aggregated ecosystem, Qubetics is on a mission to unify leading blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. By enhancing scalability, security, and interoperability, Qubetics promises to create a seamless experience for users and developers alike. Qubetics: Bridging the Gaps Qubetics is making history as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, addressing the very issues that have plagued other platforms. At its core, Qubetics focuses on interoperability, ensuring that various blockchains can communicate seamlessly. This groundbreaking approach is a game-changer for businesses, professionals, and individual users, eliminating fragmentation and enabling a truly decentralized and connected crypto ecosystem. Imagine a freelance graphic designer who prefers payments in Ethereum working with a client who transacts in Bitcoin. With Qubetics’ platform, this exchange becomes effortless, eliminating the need for multiple wallets or third-party exchanges. Developers, too, stand to benefit. Building decentralized applications (dApps) that can operate across multiple blockchains becomes more straightforward, expanding the potential user base and enhancing functionality. The excitement around Qubetics is palpable. The project is in its 21st presale stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.0733. The presale has already raised over $12.9 million, with more than 474 million $TICS tokens sold to over 20,000 holders. Analysts are buzzing with predictions, suggesting that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating into a 209.67% return on investment. Looking further ahead, forecasts indicate potential prices of $1 post-presale and up to $15 after the mainnet launch, offering returns that could turn a modest investment into a substantial gain. Binance: The Giant’s Stumbles Binance has long been a heavyweight in the crypto arena, offering a vast array of services from spot trading to futures. However, its journey hasn’t been without hurdles. The recent legal entanglements, culminating in a $4.3 billion fine and the resignation of its founder, have cast shadows over its operations. These events have led to increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide, causing some users to question the platform’s stability and long-term viability. Despite these challenges, Binance continues to operate globally, processing over $100 trillion in transactions over the past seven years. The appointment of Richard Teng as the new CEO marks a strategic shift towards compliance and transparency. Teng, a former regulator, aims to rebuild trust and steer the platform through these turbulent times. Yet, for many, the question remains: Is Binance still the best performing crypto platform to bet on? While Binance has dominated the market for years, the writing’s on the wall—regulation is coming, and it’s hitting centralized exchanges hard. Users worldwide have faced account restrictions, frozen withdrawals, and regulatory crackdowns that have forced them to look elsewhere. If past cycles have taught anything, it’s that the next big thing is usually brewing just as the old guard starts to crumble. Conclusion While Binance has been a dominant force, its recent challenges highlight the need for innovation and adaptability. Qubetics , with its emphasis on interoperability and practical solutions, offers a compelling alternative for those looking to invest in the next big thing.

While meme coins and AI-driven projects are generating excitement, a different kind of opportunity is emerging: Web3Bay (3BAY). This decentralized e-commerce platform is quickly becoming a top contender among the best crypto ICOs for 2025. Alongside projects like Wall Street Pepe and MIND of Pepe, Web3Bay is poised for substantial growth, offering both practical utility and impressive presale traction. Web3Bay has already raised $1.2 million in its presale, selling 300 million tokens. Let’s explore why these three projects are attracting attention and why Web3Bay might just be the most promising of the bunch. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Wall Street Pepe has made a significant splash in the meme coin arena, raking in over $68 million in its presale. This project has resonated with investors by combining the power of viral marketing with actual trading tools, adding value beyond mere speculation. A key differentiator for Wall Street Pepe is its VIP Club. This exclusive, token-gated community provides members with real-time trading insights, sophisticated analytics, and “whale-level” market calls. These resources, traditionally available only to large institutional investors, are now being democratized for retail traders through WEPE. Wall Street Pepe has already secured listings on major exchanges, with both DEX and CEX launches planned after the presale concludes. The project also incentivizes early adopters with passive income opportunities, fostering long-term investment. With its Pepe-inspired branding and an aggressive marketing strategy, the question on everyone’s mind is whether Wall Street Pepe can achieve the same level of success as previous meme coin giants. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) Another frog-themed project with a unique twist, MIND of Pepe integrates AI-driven market analysis into the meme coin world. This self-learning AI agent is designed to analyze market data, identify trends, and generate trading signals, essentially offering an intelligent trading assistant for crypto enthusiasts. The $MIND presale has already attracted nearly $5 million in a short period, demonstrating strong demand for AI-powered trading tools. Unlike simple chatbots that merely present market information, MIND of Pepe is designed to manage crypto wallets, analyze market sentiment, and even autonomously launch tokens. With the growing trend of AI-integrated finance, this project is capitalizing on the increasing interest in AI-driven investment solutions. Early investors can acquire $MIND tokens at a discounted presale price, with staking rewards and passive income opportunities providing additional incentives for long-term holding. 3. Web3Bay (3BAY) Among the best crypto ICOs, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out as a potential game-changer, aiming to transform the multi-trillion dollar e-commerce industry using blockchain technology. Unlike centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay facilitates direct, peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating intermediaries and their associated high fees. With the online shopping sector expanding rapidly, Web3Bay is positioned as one of the best crypto investments for 2025. The project has already raised over $1.2 million, with 300 million tokens sold in its presale, demonstrating significant investor interest. Currently priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, 3BAY is projected to launch at $0.1959, representing an estimated 4,200% ROI for early backers who participate in one of the best crypto ICOs. Why Web3Bay is One of the Best Crypto ICOs: Decentralized Marketplace: Buyers and sellers connect directly, bypassing intermediaries and lowering costs. Smart Contract Renouncement: Ensures no single entity can manipulate the ecosystem after the presale. Staking Rewards: Investors can stake 3BAY tokens to earn passive income and enjoy reduced fees. Community Governance: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) empowers token holders to vote on important platform decisions. Blockchain Security: Transactions are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof, utilizing IPFS storage for data integrity. As blockchain technology continues to reshape various industries, Web3Bay is emerging as a compelling presale opportunity among the best crypto ICOs. With its strong presale performance, Web3Bay isn’t just another crypto project; it represents a significant advancement in online commerce. Summing Up While Wall Street Pepe and MIND of Pepe tap into the hype surrounding meme coins and AI, Web3Bay provides a real-world use case with substantial upside potential. Its disruptive approach to e-commerce, impressive presale demand, and significant projected ROI make it one of the best crypto ICOs available. As the crypto market matures, investors are increasingly focusing on utility-driven projects with long-term viability. While meme coins can offer short-term gains, Web3Bay represents a fundamental shift in online commerce, making it a potentially smart investment for 2025. For investors looking for the best crypto ICOs , Web3Bay offers a compelling opportunity. With its innovative approach and strong community support, Web3Bay stands out among the best crypto ICOs. Don’t miss out on the best crypto ICOs; research and invest wisely.

Bitget (BGB) has recently moved to $6.72, sparking renewed market interest. Its price is approaching crucial resistance points, with expectations it might surpass $7.77 soon. At the same time, Solana’s (SOL) future looks bright, with predictions pointing to a possible rise to $300 by 2025, spurred by ETF speculations and increasing institutional engagement. Currently, BlockDAG (BDAG) is the buzz of the crypto community, offering a substantial 350% boost with its FINALCALL700 promotion. The project has already attracted $195.5 million, with 18.4 billion BDAG distributed and rumors of impending major exchange listings. Traders are eager to buy BDAG at its present price, knowing the value could skyrocket post-listing. Bitget Token Price Gains as It Nears Key Resistance The Bitget (BGB) price recently reached $6.72, showing strong market interest. This rise coincides with a boost in trading activity, with experts monitoring crucial resistance points around $7.77 to see if BGB can advance further. The peak price of $8.49 for Bitget is an important milestone, and if the current positive trend continues, it might approach this high soon. Future projections for Bitget’s price in 2025 vary from $8.78 to $21.16, encouraged by its platform’s growing popularity and broader use. Yet, some cautious estimates warn of a possible fall to $1.73 should market mood decline. Solana (SOL) Price Forecast for 2025: Will It Reach $300? Solana’s price has stirred considerable interest, with a 2025 forecast aiming for a bold $300. Recent policy talks have amplified this outlook, proposing Solana’s inclusion in a crypto initiative backed by reserves, boosting confidence in its potential. Despite a recent dip to $204 from $217, essential technical indicators imply that there might be a buying uptick soon. Solana maintains support at the $180 and $200 levels, emphasizing a positive outlook. Expectations of an ETF by VanEck and continued interest in digital assets from professional circles are propelling Solana’s price upwards. A significant influence on Solana’s future price could be an upcoming press conference with David Sacks, a notable figure in digital asset investment. Positive discussions about Solana’s network growth and wider adoption might further boost its prospects, possibly pushing its price towards $300 by 2025. BlockDAG’s 350% Bonus Sparks Frenzy in the Crypto Community While Bitget and Solana are capturing attention, BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus is currently the main attraction. This limited-time presale offers an extraordinary 350% boost on BDAG, generating an impressive response from those eager to maximize their participation before it ends. BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the standout crypto projects of the year, driven by significant achievements: A presale tallying up to $195.5 million Over 18.4 billion BDAG sold, with increasing demand Plans for listings on 10 leading centralized exchanges An impressive price increase of 2,380% from $0.001 to $0.0248 The figures are telling. Early participants have seen substantial gains, with forecasts suggesting BDAG could reach $1 soon, and possibly $20 by 2027. For those calculating the returns, the numbers are compelling. A $1,000 spending in BDAG now, with the 350% bonus, could grow to $4,500 in BDAG. Should BDAG hit the anticipated $20, this could mean a windfall of $3.6 million. A $10,000 worth of assets might yield $36.2 million. The potential for profit is massive, positioning BDAG as one of the top crypto assets this year. The excitement is further fueled by anticipated exchange listings that could significantly increase BDAG’s price once it hits the market. With these major listings on the horizon, those in the know are securing their BDAG before the presale ends. As the FINALCALL700 bonus nears its conclusion, the window to acquire BDAG at such an attractive rate is closing rapidly. Crypto Market Heats Up: Don’t Miss Out The crypto market is ripe with opportunities as key assets gain momentum. Bitget’s price is advancing towards critical resistance, poised to reach new heights if the trend persists. Meanwhile, predictions suggest Solana could reach $300 by 2025, supported by ETF buzz and strategic discussions. However, the standout narrative is BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus, igniting the market with a substantial 350% BDAG boost. With a whopping $195.5 million raised, 18.4 billion BDAG sold, and a 2380% price leap, BDAG’s potential is unmistakable. The project is gearing up for listings on 10 prominent exchanges, with experts predicting a future price of $20. For those aiming to capitalize on huge returns, BDAG offers an unmatched opportunity. As the crypto presale accelerates, acquiring BDAG at its current price might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity before it debuts on the open market at a much higher valuation.

Turns out, Jerome Powell has been in direct and frequent talks with the White House, despite the president’s very public dislike of him. Kevin Hassett, Trump’s top economic adviser and the director of the National Economic Council, confirmed the regular discussions, saying they were meant to exchange views on the US economy while keeping the Fed’s independence intact. “Jay’s an independent person, the Fed’s independence is respected,” Hassett said on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. “The point is the president’s opinion can also be heard. He’s the president of the United States.” Trump does not like Powell, and he has made sure everyone knows, as he tends to. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump raged against Powell, saying he should be fired and replaced with someone who would do what the Oval wanted. Powell stood his ground in his typical classy fashion, and even said he would sue if Trump ever tried to remove him illegally. The White House meetings may be labeled as friendly economic discussions, but Powell knows that if Trump doesn’t get what he wants, he won’t hesitate to turn on him again. Trump’s White House revives direct Fed talks “I have arranged to begin, once again, regular lunches with Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve,” Hassett said in his interview. “Jay and I have a long and collegial relationship, and I’m going to go over there with him and the other governors. So we’re going to talk about our views about what’s going on, and listen to his.” Inflation has been a major problem for both Trump and Powell. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a 4.6% rise over the last three months, way above the Fed’s 2% target. Prices are still high for food, gas, and everyday essentials. Eggs, in particular, have been a disaster. “I just went to the grocery store,” Hassett said. “I shop for our family, in part because I love to look at prices. And there were no eggs at the store yesterday, just a few.” “We saw the consumer price index come out, and we found out that the stagflation that was created by the policies of President Biden was way worse than we thought,” Hassett said. He pointed out that economists from Biden’s own team, including Jason Furman and Larry Summers, had warned that too much government spending would trigger massive inflation. Now, Trump’s team is working on a multi-layered plan to fix the problem. Hassett said the administration is focused on supply-side tax cuts to increase production, spending reductions through the Department of Government Expenditure (DOGE) and congressional action, more energy production and massive deregulation, as well as industry-specific policies. Moreover, the bird flu outbreak has wiped out millions of chickens, leading to record-high egg prices. Hassett blamed Biden’s response, saying his administration’s solution was simply to kill chickens without a proper containment strategy. “Biden didn’t really have a plan for avian flu,” Hassett said. “They spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken.” The Trump administration is now finalizing a new plan that will focus on biosecurity and medication rather than mass slaughter. Hassett explained that the spread is mostly coming from ducks and geese, not chickens. “So why does it make sense to kill all the chickens when the ducks and geese are spreading the disease?” he said. Trump wants lower interest rates, Fed remains firm Trump publicly called for lower interest rates, arguing that high rates are hurting consumers. “Interest rates need to come down,” he keeps saying via his posts on Truth Social. “We have inflation under control.” But the Federal Reserve does not seem ready to cut rates anytime soon. Powell has said many times before that rates will remain high until inflation fully stabilizes. Hassett, however, defended Trump’s position. He pointed out that market interest rates are already going down. “The 10-year Treasury yield has dropped about 40 basis points in recent weeks,” he said. “That’s saving the American people about $40 billion just from us talking about what we’re about to do.” Trade is also back in focus. Trump wants to reintroduce reciprocal tariffs on countries that have Value-Added Taxes (VATs), including European nations and China. “Right now, US companies are paying $370 billion in taxes to foreign governments,” Hassett said. “Meanwhile, foreign companies are paying the US government only $57 billion.” The White House is now negotiating with foreign leaders, including the UK’s Minister Reynolds, to fix this trade imbalance. The goal is to recover $5 trillion over the next 10 years, which Trump’s team says will fund tax cuts and boost the economy. “We’re talking to leaders of other countries all the time,” Hassett said. “Last night into the wee hours, I was talking to Minister Reynolds from the UK about this very matter.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",News|The Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|FIAT|TRADING|ASIA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-17 00:10:30

It’s not just about the meme anymore—these new coins are creating ecosystems, rewarding users, and building strong communities. BTFD Coin stands out with its Play2Earn game and 90% APY staking rewards , while Gigachad and Ponke are carving out their own unique positions in the market.

The presale is nearing its end, and once BTFD Coin hits major exchanges, analysts predict a sharp rise in value—possibly shooting up to $0.006 from its current presale price of $0.00016 . What makes BTFD Coin different from other meme coins is its real utility and the incentives it offers for long-term holders. The Play2Earn game , which went live on January 1, 2025, allows players to earn BTFD tokens while playing, turning the meme coin into something more than just a speculative investment. With staking rewards offering an impressive 90% APY , BTFD Coin rewards its holders for staying committed to the project, creating a sustainable ecosystem. But that’s not all. The referral program and the Bulls Squad community are driving the excitement around BTFD Coin . The Bulls Squad —a group of loyal investors and holders—is playing a key role in spreading the word about BTFD Coin and driving its presale success. With over 70 billion coins sold to more than 10,700 holders , BTFD Coin has a growing community that is excited about the project’s long-term potential. The BTFD Coin presale is currently in Stage 14, where investors get an incredible 100% bonus on their purchases through the LAUNCH100 bonus code. If you’re considering jumping in, this is the time to do it before the coin is listed on major exchanges at $0.0006 . For those considering an investment, here’s a scenario: If you were to invest $40,000 at $0.00016 per coin, you’d receive 250 million BTFD tokens. When the coin lists at $0.0006 , your investment would grow to $150,000 . And if the coin hits the $0.006 mark—an expectation after major listings—you’re looking at a $1.5 million investment. This offers a huge potential return for those who believe in the long-term value of BTFD Coin . Gigachad: The Meme Coin with Strong Community Backing Another rising star in the meme coin space is Gigachad .

Lawyers Jonatan Baldiviezo, Marcos Zelaya, María Eva Koutsovitis, and Claudio Lozano filed the case on Sunday, accusing Javier of playing a central role in a “rug pull” that misled the public and resulted in huge financial losses. Javier promoted $LIBRA on Friday via X (formerly Twitter), and his post drew immediate attention, triggering massive investments. But just hours later, he deleted the post, sending $LIBRA’s price into freefall, and investors watching the market on Dexscreener saw their holdings obliterated. According to the plaintiffs, Javier’s actions amounted to fraud and a violation of Argentina’s Public Ethics Law. Baldiviezo, speaking to The Associated Press, said, “Within this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president’s actions were essential.” The lawsuit accuses Javier of using his position and influence to pump up a financial asset, only to ditch it without warning, leaving unsuspecting investors in the dust. The Presidential Office, in a statement on Saturday, denied any wrongdoing, insisting that Javier was never involved in $LIBRA’s creation, that his post was made in good faith to support entrepreneurial projects but was removed to prevent speculation. Javier himself responded on X, writing, “I was not aware of the details of the project, and after getting informed, I decided not to continue promoting it (which is why I deleted the tweet).” He also accused his political opponents of trying to exploit the controversy to undermine him by the Opposition party. Despite his denial, documents and online records confirm that Javier and members of his administration had met with representatives of KIP Protocol, the team behind $LIBRA, before its launch. The Anti-Corruption Office, which operates under the Executive Branch, has opened an internal investigation. In a statement, the Presidential Office said, “All the information gathered in the investigation will be handed over to the judiciary to determine if any of the companies or individuals linked to the KIP Protocol project committed a crime.” KIP Protocol, Jupiter Exchange, and Hayden Davis react Hayden Davis, the CEO of KIP Protocol, publicly blamed Javier Milei for $LIBRA’s downfall. In a video statement released on Saturday, Hayden said, “Despite prior commitments, Javier and his team unexpectedly changed their position, withdrawing their support and deleting all previous posts on social media.” Meanwhile, crypto exchange Jupiter Exchange acknowledged that some of its team members knew about $LIBRA’s launch before Javier’s tweet. In a statement, Jupiter admitted, “A few members of the Jupiter team knew that there would be, at some point, a token project associated with Argentine President Javier Milei. We learned of this ~2 weeks ago directly from Kelsier Ventures.” Jupiter, however, denied any insider trading and said the coin had already hit a $1.5 billion market cap before receiving the “Verified” tag on their platform. “LIBRA did not get the ‘Verified’ icon in our default token search until roughly one hour after launch,” they said. Despite the denial, the exchange confirmed that dozens of imposter tokens flooded the market immediately after $LIBRA’s launch, making it easy for traders to buy the wrong token by mistake. “We take allegations of insider trading extremely seriously. If you have evidence of Jupiter employees leaking information or otherwise sniping, please reach out directly. If we discover any team members acted on non-public information, we will take quick and decisive action.” $100 million in LIBRA funds still under Hayden’ control Despite the massive price collapse, Hayden Hayden still controls $100 million in LIBRA treasury funds. He announced that he would reinvest and burn all repurchased tokens, insisting that he remains committed to transparency. “Unless a more viable alternative is presented, I intend to begin the process of executing on this plan within the next 48 hours,” Hayden said. He also denied any involvement in fraud, placing the blame squarely on Javier for the coin’s catastrophic crash. Hayden added, “Javier’s associates had secured his public support at launch and had assured me that his continued backing was guaranteed throughout the launch.” He claimed that Javier’s sudden reversal shattered investor confidence and led to the price collapse. While the legal battle intensifies, investors are left with millions in losses, the Argentine government faces mounting scrutiny, and Javier Milei is now at the center of one of the biggest crypto scandals in history.

In a market where investors are transitioning from speculative to practical blockchain applications, Web3Bay is setting itself apart. By utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate a peer-to-peer marketplace, it eliminates intermediaries, slashes fees, and enhances user control over finances. In its fourth presale stage, Web3Bay has successfully raised over $1 million, distributing more than 305 million 3BAY tokens at $0.00456 each. Web3Bay directly targets the multi-billion-dollar e-commerce sector, promising secure and transparent transactions through blockchain. In parallel, DeXe and Render are advancing their own specialties—DeXe in decentralized asset management, and Render in decentralized GPU computing. Analyzing Web3Bay’s presale achievements alongside DeXe and Render’s developments offers insights into potentially lucrative gains for 2025. Web3Bay Presale: Unlocking Exceptional Returns Web3Bay is rapidly becoming a central player in decentralized e-commerce. Its presale strategy involves 28 stages, each progressively increasing in price. Now in Stage 4, the platform has accumulated over $1 million, selling 305 million 3BAY tokens. With an anticipated listing price of $0.1959, early investors are projected to achieve an ROI of 6,430%, making early investment significantly rewarding. Beyond the allure of financial returns, Web3Bay addresses the inherent inefficiencies of traditional online shopping platforms that levy high fees and restrict consumer choices through centralized governance. Web3Bay offers a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers transact directly, thus reducing unnecessary costs. A notable aspect of Web3Bay is its governance model. Unlike centralized platforms, Web3Bay allows token holders to collectively decide on platform fees, policies, and updates, ensuring that it remains governed by its users and adaptable to their needs. Moreover, Web3Bay supports transactions in multiple currencies, including stablecoins, providing transactional stability. This inclusive financial system effectively bridges traditional and crypto payment methodologies, broadening its user base. DeXe: Innovating in Decentralized Asset Management DeXe stands out with its decentralized asset management solutions, allowing users to autonomously manage investments and emulate successful trading strategies. Currently trading at approximately $19.97, DeXe emphasizes transparency and security through blockchain, offering a self-governing investment platform. Investors are keeping a close eye on DeXe’s growth and market adoption, assessing its potential to disrupt traditional finance within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Its innovative asset management model positions it as a potential powerhouse in DeFi, particularly appealing to traditional investors moving towards blockchain solutions. Render: Pioneering Decentralized GPU Rendering Render is redefining GPU rendering by decentralizing the process, linking individuals needing rendering services with GPU owners. With a current trading value of about $4.24 and a daily volume increase of 3.2%, Render offers scalable and cost-efficient rendering solutions, democratizing access to high-performance computing for various industries, including film, gaming, and AI. As the demand for AI and 3D rendering escalates, Render is strategically positioned to benefit from these growing sectors. Its integration with leading creative tools and strategic partnerships could enhance its standing in the tech market. In Summary As the presale of Web3Bay advances with a promising ROI of 6,430%, it emerges as a notable opportunity for investors interested in decentralized e-commerce innovations. Simultaneously, DeXe and Render are expanding their market influence, with DeXe enhancing decentralized asset management and Render advancing in distributed computing resources. Each project offers unique benefits, targeting different market segments and showcasing distinct potential for investment growth.

While the market is flooded with short-lived trends, a select few stand out as the best meme coins to join for long term growth and potential wealth generation. These aren’t just coins; they’re immersive narratives that bring investors on an adventure of excitement, community engagement, and financial rewards. Among the best meme coins to join for long term, three unique projects have emerged as true pioneers: Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT), and Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT). Each of these coins carries a compelling story, innovative tokenomics, and strong community backing, making them potential game-changers in the meme coin landscape. Arctic Pablo Coin leads the charge of all three, offering a groundbreaking narrative that merges myth and reality. This isn’t just about investing in a meme coin—it’s about embarking on an epic journey across undiscovered lands, following Arctic Pablo as he unearths the mystical treasures of the crypto world. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Mystical Journey to Fortune Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a token—it’s an exploration of hidden realms, a journey through uncharted lands, and a ticket to financial success. Investors aren’t merely holders; they become part of the expedition, traveling alongside Arctic Pablo as he unveils ancient mysteries and untapped riches. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on hype, Arctic Pablo Coin blends storytelling with real-world tokenomics. The presale isn’t divided into stages but into locations, each unveiling a new chapter of Pablo’s adventure. The expedition has reached Aqua Frost, having already raised over $1.3. With each new location, the token price increases, rewarding early investors with skyrocketing ROI potential. Arctic Pablo Coin doesn’t just stop at an engaging story—it ensures long-term value through weekly token burns during the presale and the elimination of unsold tokens after launch. This deflationary mechanism enhances scarcity and investor confidence, boosting demand while reducing supply. Arctic Pablo offers a 66% APY staking program for those who want to maximize their holdings. Investors can stake their APC tokens, allowing them to grow their assets while participating in the grand expedition. All staked tokens will be vested for two months post-launch, ensuring stability and continuous growth. With every new location, Arctic Pablo’s journey becomes more exhilarating. Those who join early are in for a ride filled with adventure, wealth-building, and an ever-growing community that believes in the legend of Arctic Pablo. It is one of the best meme coins to join for long term. Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT): From Internet Sensation to Crypto Star Peanut the Squirrel is proof that virality and crypto make an unstoppable duo. What started as a heartbreaking news story became a multi-million-dollar meme coin phenomenon. After Peanut’s tragic euthanasia due to rabies concerns, the internet rallied around the beloved squirrel, catapulting $PNUT into the spotlight. However, Peanut’s owner, Mark Longo, wasn’t thrilled. Feeling exploited, he launched his own cryptocurrency, JUSTICE, to fund his animal sanctuary. This led to a clash between investors and Peanut’s real-life legacy. The controversy brought even more attention to $PNUT, keeping it in the limelight. While its initial rise was driven by virality, the coin now focuses on utility. Developers are integrating NFTs and staking rewards to ensure longevity. For those who love a good underdog story, $PNUT remains one of the best meme coins to join for long term potential. Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT): Mythology Meets Meme Culture While internet trends inspire many meme coins, Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) taps into the power of ancient mythology. This coin reimagines the Greek god Zeus as the ultimate meme overlord, merging historical storytelling with crypto innovation. Goatseus Maximus isn’t just a meme—it’s an entire mythos. The project features an exclusive NFT collection depicting legendary figures and mythical creatures, giving holders access to staking rewards, voting rights, and limited-edition digital assets. Unlike meme coins that fade after their viral moment, $GOAT has built a devoted following.

Notably, the Shiba Inu has been abuzz with activity, particularly following significant whale movements and an unprecedented spike in the token’s burn rate. These events suggest that SHIB might be setting the stage for a notable price breakout. Whale withdrawals 144.29B SHIB tokens In a recent development that caught the eye of many in the crypto community, a mysterious transfer activity was noted involving Shiba Inu. A wallet with the address “0xB768” withdrew a colossal 144.294 billion SHIB tokens, valued at about $2.39583 million, from the leading US digital assets exchange, Coinbase. Source: Arkham This transfer was significant in volume and because the wallet was newly created, never used before, which often hints at strategic moves by large investors or ‘whales’. The immediate climb of this wallet to the top spot for SHIB inflows within the last 24 hours further fueled speculation and interest. While some view such large withdrawals as accumulation by big players, others consider them routine exchange operations. However, the market reacted positively, with SHIB’s price rising, although not directly attributable to this single event, it’s currently trading at $0.00001676, up by 10% over the last week. Shiba Inu burn rate skyrockets by 2000% Adding to the optimistic outlook, the Shiba Inu burn rate has seen a dramatic increase of 2000% on February 14, with 410,744,432,366,375 tokens removed from circulation since the token burn started, according to data from Shibburn . This surge isn’t just a one-off; over the past week, 58.28 million tokens have been burned, and this month alone, the figure stands at 98.85 million. Such aggressive burning reduces the supply, which, under the basic economic principle of supply and demand, can elevate the price if demand stays constant or grows. The community’s active participation in burning tokens is a testament to the strong engagement and dedication towards enhancing the token’s value, bringing the total supply down to 589.25 trillion tokens, with a staggering 410.7 trillion tokens permanently removed. Shiba Inu (SHIB) technical analysis From a technical standpoint, SHIB has broken out of a descending trend line, suggesting that buyers are stepping in at crucial support levels. SHIB’s price has already crossed above the 9-day Moving Average (MA), demonstrating short-term bullish momentum. It is now testing the 21-day MA, a critical threshold. If SHIB manages to close above the 21-day MA, we could be in for a major bullish trend, signaling a stronger conviction among investors and potentially attracting more capital into the token. Shiba Inu price chart by TradingView Furthermore, the upcoming intersection of the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) might validate an upward trend, directing prices toward essential resistance levels. With the MACD showing a bullish crossover, indicating weaker bearish momentum, the technical indicators collectively suggest that Shiba Inu is demonstrating potential signs of recovery. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also moved into bullish territory, currently sitting slightly above 44 after recovering from an oversold region. This shift in RSI indicates that the selling pressure has eased, and buying interest is rising. Shiba Inu team working to enhance its utility During these developments, Shiba Inu’s leadership has proactively steering the project towards long-term sustainability. Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer, recently teased significant updates for the SHIB Metaverse during a discussion at “Bill It Up” with Cypher Capital co-founder Bill Qian. Kusama highlighted that Shiba Inu is not merely riding the wave of meme coin trends but is instead building a robust ecosystem with tangible applications. Among the notable developments for the ecosystem include the introduction of the TREAT token and further SHIB Metaverse developments aimed at providing real utility, moving beyond the speculative nature of meme coins. The confluence of large whale withdrawals, a skyrocketing burn rate, positive technical indicators, and strategic community and developer efforts paints a promising picture for Shiba Inu. While the crypto market is inherently volatile, these factors combined suggest that SHIB might be on the cusp of a significant price movement.

The decentralized lending platform, currently in the opening phase of its presale, has already raised $465,878.05 from 710 holders, with its token priced at $0.01. Early investors stand to secure a guaranteed 600% return when MUTM launches at $0.06, while experts forecast a 100x surge to $1. As Solana’s 2021 breakout demonstrated, early recognition of utility-driven projects can unlock generational gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now mirrors that trajectory, combining DeFi innovation with aggressive tokenomics designed to fuel demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Bridges Gaps in Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates as a decentralized protocol enabling users to lend and borrow digital assets through two markets: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). The P2C model allows suppliers to deposit tokens like USDT into liquidity pools, earning variable interest rates tied to borrowing demand. A $10,000 deposit, for instance, could generate $800 annually at an 8% yield. Borrowers, meanwhile, collateralize assets such as ETH to access liquidity without selling holdings, preserving exposure to potential price gains. The P2P market facilitates direct agreements between users, bypassing liquidity pools entirely. Both markets prioritize security, with smart contracts audited by third-party firms to minimize risks. Unlike platforms requiring locked assets or rigid terms, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emphasizes flexibility, letting users set borrowing durations and rates independently. Presale Momentum Builds as Investors Chase 600% Returns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has ignited fervor in its opening presale phase, selling tokens at $0.01 before a scheduled rise to $0.06 upon launch. This structure guarantees a 6x profit for early participants. Over $465,000 has been committed in just days, reflecting confidence in the project’s roadmap. Phase 1 offers the lowest entry price, but slots are dwindling rapidly. Subsequent phases will incrementally hike the token cost, rewarding early adopters with the steepest gains. Investors allocating $1000 today could see their holdings balloon to $7000 at launch, while the projected 12500% growth could deliver $126,000. Tokenomics Fuel Scarcity and Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) employs a buy-and-distribute mechanism to sustain price growth post-launch. A portion of platform fees will automatically purchase MUTM tokens from open markets, redistributing them to stakers. This creates recurring buy pressure, systematically reducing supply as adoption climbs. Additionally, the platform plans to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin, further integrating utility into its ecosystem. Backed by on-chain reserves, this stablecoin will offer borrowing stability while incentivizing users to engage with MUTM for governance and rewards. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will debut a beta version of its lending platform alongside its exchange listing, ensuring immediate utility for token holders. Real-time functionality is critical. Solana’s 2021 ascent coincided with its capacity to onboard developers and users swiftly, a strategy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is replicating. To accelerate momentum, the team has announced a $100,000 giveaway split among 10 participants. Eligibility requires simple social media engagement, a tactic already swelling community channels. Act Now or Regret Later Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well engineered to merge DeFi utility with investor incentives. The presale’s guaranteed returns, paired with a $1 price target, offer a dual-layered opportunity: short-term profits at launch and long-term wealth generation. Time is slipping away for investors to secure MUTM at $0.01. Phase 1 is advancing swiftly, and each passed hour narrows the window for maximum gains. With Phase 1 nearing its cap, delaying action could mean paying 20% more in Phase 2. The same market forces that propelled Solana to triple-digit growth are aligning for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Missing this entry point risks forfeiting one of 2025’s most explosive opportunities.

Analysts suggest SOL may hit $520 by 2025, driven by increasing liquidity and developer activity. Simultaneously, LINK’s price movements are gaining attention, as whale transactions hit their highest level in over a year, sparking renewed interest. The BlockDAG (BDAG) presale is also making headlines, with funding surging past $195 million and over 18.4 billion coins already sold. The network’s 5% USDT cashback incentive is fueling excitement, pushing it closer to a remarkable $600 million milestone. Many experts now recognize BDAG as one of the top bullish cryptos, thanks to its explosive presale growth. Will Solana’s Price Surge to $520? Analysts Weigh In Crypto analyst VanEck has forecasted a major Solana price surge, projecting a potential price of $520 by 2025. Factors influencing this prediction include an expected increase in M2 money supply from $21.5 trillion to $22.3 trillion, which could benefit risk assets like SOL. Additional liquidity often leads to increased investments in smart contract platforms. Experts also highlight the rising volume of decentralized exchanges, higher revenues, and a surge in active users as key contributors to Solana’s potential climb. Market chatter surrounding a possible Solana ETF approval is further fueling speculation about its upward movement. Chainlink’s Price Trends See Major Whale Activity Recent data indicates a major shift in Chainlink’s price trends, with whale activity reaching peak levels. On-chain reports show 1,659 daily transactions surpassing $100,000, the highest figure recorded since late 2023. This trend suggests significant accumulation, especially within the consolidation range of $15.88 to $22.76. With active wallet addresses rising, analysts predict LINK could rebound, setting price targets around $32. Despite a 20% dip in value, heavy whale transactions typically signal preparation for a potential bullish reversal. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, anticipating the next breakout. BlockDAG’s 5% USDT Cashback—Why Everyone’s Jumping In BlockDAG’s presale has become the hottest crypto opportunity, drawing massive interest due to its 5% USDT cashback offer. Early investors are already seeing a staggering 2,380% gain, while new buyers scramble to secure their share before the next price jump. Currently, BDAG is priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, with total funding soaring past $195 million. A major driving force behind this surge is BlockDAG’s viral Affiliate Program, which rewards both referrers and buyers with 5% USDT cashback on every purchase made via a referral link. The process is seamless—generate a link, share it, and receive instant rewards once a transaction is completed. This aggressive incentive has pushed presale demand through the roof, accelerating BlockDAG’s race toward its $600 million milestone. Previous discount tiers sold out rapidly, and with Batch 27 following the same pattern, FOMO is kicking in for those who missed earlier buying opportunities. The affiliate-driven excitement is spreading across social media, drawing in both crypto veterans and newcomers. As BDAG’s price increases with each batch, those looking for early-stage gains are locking in purchases now rather than waiting. Many traders now rank BDAG among the top bullish cryptos, recognizing its strong momentum and rewarding cashback model. Don’t Miss Out—BlockDAG’s Next Phase is Just Around the Corner! Crypto enthusiasts are keeping close tabs on Solana’s price surge potential, Chainlink’s shifting price trends, and BlockDAG’s fast-selling presale. With SOL projected to climb to $520 and LINK showing strong whale activity, both assets remain in the spotlight. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s presale continues to gain traction, racing toward its $600 million target. The 5% USDT cashback incentive is fueling rapid referrals, with both new and existing investors capitalizing on the opportunity. As BDAG’s price climbs with each new batch, those looking to maximize profits aren’t hesitating. For anyone seeking early-stage crypto gains, BlockDAG’s presale presents a golden opportunity. With every purchase earning cashback and the token’s price steadily increasing, now is the time to secure a position before the next surge.

40434974,https://invezz.com/?p=2569218,1739757720,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Dogecoin price prediction: here’s why DOGE will surge to $1 in 2025,https://invezz.com/news/2025/02/17/dogecoin-price-prediction-why-doge-will-surge-to-1-in-2025/,"Dogecoin price has crashed into a strong bear market this year as it crashed from the December high of $0.4845 to $0.265. It has erased some of the gains made in 2024 as the crypto fear and greed index has moved to the fear zone. This article provides an unbiased DOGE forecast and assesses whether it can stage a strong comeback and hit $1 soon. Why Dogecoin price crashed The Dogecoin price has collapsed this year for three main reasons. First, the price action is mostly due to Bitcoin remaining in a tight range in the past few months. It has remained inside the support and resistance levels of $90,000 and $109,000. Bitcoin usually sets the tone in the crypto industry, and when it falls or stagnates, investors dump other tokens. Second, Dogecoin price has dropped as investors sell the news. The coin jumped ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. In most cases, assets rise ahead of a major news event and then fall when the news event happens. Trump’s inauguration was important for the Dogecoin price because he appointed Elon Musk to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk has already become the most powerful individual in the government today. Third, DOGE price has retreated because of the falling greed in the crypto market. The closely watched fear and greed index has dropped to the fear zone of 39. A move from the extreme greed zone of 88 in 2024 to 39 is a sign that investors will remain in the sideline. DOGE price chart | Source: TradingView Elliot Wave points to a DOGE price rebound The weekly chart shows that the DOGE price has remained under pressure in the past few weeks. It has dropped from a high of $0.4832 in December to a low of $0.20. This decline was notable because the coin retested the key support level at $0.22278, the highest swing in March last year. This situation is known as a break and retest pattern and is a popular sign of continuation. Further, the decline is part of the second phase of the Elliot Wave performance. For starters, Elliot Wave has five phases, with the first one being bullish and the second one being a retracement. The first phase started in September last year, while the second one is underway. The third phase is usually the longest, and in Dogecoin’s case, it will likely end at an all-time high of $0.7600. It will then retreat and retest the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. Finally, the coin will jump to the resistance at $1, up by 276% from the current level. The main caveat is that this analysis uses the weekly chart, where patterns take time to form. For example, the second wave has taken over two months to form. Therefore, the Dogecoin price eventual surge to $1 will likely take more time to form. The bullish outlook will become invalid if the Dogecoin price crashes below the key support at $0.0835, its lowest level in July last year. Other catalysts for Dogecoin There are other catalysts that may push the Dogecoin price higher in the long term. First, the ongoing retracement is part of the coin’s recovery. While the DOGE price’s 53% crash is a steep one, it is smaller than the 63% crash that happened last year when it dropped from $0.278 to $0.0834. Second, there are rising odds that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot DOGE ETF this year. While DOGE is a meme coin, it is similar to Bitcoin since it is a proof-of-work token that the SEC sees as a digital commodity. Further, Dogecoin price will be boosted by the eventual Bitcoin price rebound. Bitcoin has formed the bullish flag chart pattern, a popular continuation sign.

In every cycle, a select few early investors secure massive gains, while many others are left wishing they had acted sooner. Right now, the market is gaining momentum, with Bitcoin hitting new highs and altcoins surging. Investors who missed out on past success stories like Chainlink are now on the hunt for the next breakout opportunity.

It is a comprehensive Web3 aggregator, seamlessly connecting major blockchains while delivering real-world utility through its non-custodial multi-chain wallet. With analysts forecasting explosive growth, overlooking Qubetics now could lead to the same kind of regret as missing Chainlink in its early days. Qubetics: The Next Big Thing Qubetics , the best crypto presale to join and the world’s first Layer 1 Web3 aggregated ecosystem, seamlessly connecting major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Beyond interoperability, Qubetics revolutionizes asset management with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, enabling users to transact effortlessly across multiple blockchains.

The project has already raised over $12.9 million, distributing 471 million tokens among a growing community of 20,000+ investors. Analysts foresee a price increase to $0.25 by the end of the presale, yielding a 240.64% return. Following the mainnet launch in Q2 2025, $TICS could soar to $1 (1262.56% ROI), $5 (6712.83% ROI), or even $10–$15, potentially reaching a 20,338.49% return.

Chainlink: The One That Got Away Chainlink, often dubbed the “silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold,” has been a stalwart in the cryptocurrency arena since its inception in 2011. Created by Charlie Lee, a former Google engineer, Chainlink was designed to improve upon Bitcoin’s framework, offering faster transaction times and a different hashing algorithm. As of now, Chainlink is trading at $127.66, reflecting a bullish sentiment in the market. Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network enables smart contracts on various blockchain platforms to securely interact with real-world data. This innovation has positioned Chainlink as a leader in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. However, despite its groundbreaking technology, many potential investors missed the boat during its early days, watching from the sidelines as LINK’s value soared. Missed Chainlink?

The third largest cryptocurrency hit a high of $2.80 before reversing back. XRP’s price action in the coming sessions will be shaped by key support and resistance levels. As for Bitcoin, the price is trading below important resistance levels, failing to establish a clear trend. Bitcoin is currently trading at $96,500 and is down by more than 2% in the last 24 hours. Possible Bullish Scenarios If XRP breaks above $2.79 to $2.80, the next upside targets could be $2.96 and $3.30. A strong breakout could push the price further toward $4.19 or even $5. However, until the market sees a clear breakout above the resistance levels, there’s always a possibility for further consolidation. What’s Next for XRP? If the price breaks out decisively above the current resistance, it could head towards new highs. But be aware of potential pullbacks into support areas. Analysts are eyeing levels around $2.80 for a breakout, with the ultimate target being the all-time high of $3.40. Current Trend Overview The price saw a strong rally in November, breaking above the 2021 high of $1.96. After reaching a high of $2.90 in early December, it entered a corrective sideways pattern. The market has been volatile, but the range remains quite large. However, the price found support around $1.95 in early February, and this level could act as a key point for future price movements. Key Support Levels (mid-term) The support range for XRP is between $1.96 and $2.35. A rally from the low around February 3rd is currently in play, but some experts believe the price may still see another dip into the support area before a major breakout.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-17 02:31:16

Its recent 100% price surge after getting listed on OKX has sparked talks about a possible Binance listing. But there is no official confirmation from Binance or the Pi Core Team raising a big question—will Binance list Pi, or is it just another overhyped rumor? The Hype vs. Reality of Pi Coin Pi Network is different from traditional cryptocurrencies because it allows mining through smartphones, making it more accessible. While the project has attracted over 100 million users, its path to becoming a fully tradable asset remains unclear. Some argue that Pi Coin was never meant for speculation but rather for real-world utility through a barter system. If it sticks to this model without exchange listings, its adoption could grow slowly but steadily. But if major exchanges list it, the price could surge rapidly, attracting more investors. However, without a strong use case, it could face the same fate as previous overhyped projects Berachain, Hamster, etc that collapsed once the initial hype faded . Meanwhile, Pi Network’s growing popularity on X has overtaken Ethereum and XRP, making it one of the top 5 most followed cryptocurrencies worldwide. But despite this, no major exchange has fully backed it yet.

So far, Bybit has ruled it out, HTX removed its Pi/USDT pair, and Bitget deleted multiple Pi-related posts. This shows that big exchanges are hesitant to list Pi due to concerns about its legitimacy. Another issue is China’s scrutiny of Pi Network, where has been called a pyramid scheme by some . Binance is careful about its listings, and unless Pi proves to be fully launched and legitimate, Binance may not take the risk. Is Pi’s Price Rally Sustainable? Speculation places Pi Coin’s 2025 price between $93 and $220, with an average estimate of $141. But as of now, Pi is trading around $72 after a 10% drop, raising doubts about whether its rally is sustainable.

Technology entrepreneur Jason Calacanis weighed in, taking to X (formerly Twitter) to assert that XRP is a “centrally controlled security.” In his post, Calacanis questioned the legitimacy of XRP as a decentralized asset, stating, “If the SEC allows it to trade like Bitcoin, then securities law will be worthless.” He warned that allowing XRP to operate like Bitcoin could create chaos in the markets, with potential for startups and funds to offload large amounts of coins on retail investors, causing instability. Calacanis also argued that such chaos would not benefit the U.S., as the country is known for its stable and controlled markets, which attract global investments. He suggested that if XRP could only be traded by individuals who pass an “sophisticated investor test,” it would ensure that people are educated about the risks before investing too much into projects like XRP. However, Calacanis’ comments have sparked criticism from various corners of the crypto world. John Deaton, the founder of Crypto Law, responded with a rebuttal, sharing a document that argued XRP, as a digital token, does not meet the legal requirements to be classified as an investment contract under the Howey Test. Deaton said that XRP is not a “contract transaction or scheme,” countering Calacanis’ view that XRP is a centrally controlled security. https://twitter.com/CryptoLawUS/status/1891280912626659526 Another user pointed out and wrote, “Trump doesn’t care about investor protections – look at his approach to CFPB and other depts that lookout for these issues.

By leveraging the strengths of both technologies, Lightchain AI is creating a decentralized ecosystem that can handle massive amounts of data and deliver real-time results. Why Lightchain AI Could Be the Smartest Bet of the Decade AI is transforming industries, but most AI models are still centralized, opaque, and controlled by just a few big corporations. That’s where Lightchain AI comes in—it’s changing the game with a decentralized AI ecosystem that puts data privacy, security, and fairness first. Traditional AI companies control user data, which can lead to bias, ethical concerns, and security risks. Lightchain AI takes a different approach, ensuring AI models and decision-making processes are transparent and community-governed. This decentralized approach makes it a standout innovation in the AI and blockchain space. What really sets Lightchain AI apart is its focus on privacy-preserving AI computations. Using advanced cryptographic techniques, it keeps AI operations secure and tamper-proof. As industries like finance, healthcare, and enterprise automation embrace AI-driven blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI is perfectly positioned to lead the charge. Early Investors Are Betting Big—Should You? With Lightchain AI’s presale nearing completion, investors are taking early positions before the token launches on exchanges. Given the growing demand for AI-integrated blockchain projects, Lightchain AI could see a massive price surge as adoption increases. Early adopters of top-tier AI and blockchain projects have historically seen huge gains, and Lightchain AI’s trajectory suggests that it could follow a similar path. For those looking to get ahead of the AI revolution, Lightchain AI may be the smartest bet of the decade—offering a rare opportunity for massive long-term returns in one of the fastest-growing sectors in tech. With its unique blend of AI and blockchain, Lightchain AI is a project to watch closely. It could be the key to unlocking the full potential of decentralized intelligence and revolutionizing industries across the board.

While Dogecoin and Cardano endure uncertain market conditions, Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce approach is gaining traction. Distinct from meme-dependent assets or networks with scaling issues, Web3Bay provides practical value through a well-planned presale aimed at sustainable growth. The cryptocurrency market is rapidly changing, driving investors toward projects backed by solid fundamentals and practical uses. Web3Bay’s model, which cuts out middlemen and boosts user autonomy, introduces a fresh approach to blockchain commerce. As major investors search for the next big thing and confidence in Web3Bay’s novel model rises, could this be the project with the highest investment promise in 2025? Web3Bay Presale: Huge ROI For Early Investors! Web3Bay is quickly becoming a hot topic in the cryptocurrency presale arena. Now in Stage 4, the platform has garnered over $1.20 million, with sales of more than 295 million 3BAY tokens at $0.004562625 each. Investors are gravitating towards Web3Bay as the structured 28-stage presale methodically raises token value, securing a low entry price for early supporters. Beyond the presale, Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce platform cuts out middlemen, reducing transaction costs and providing a more economical option for buyers and sellers. Token owners will also play a vital role in governance, shaping platform policies and updates. This distinctive approach not only strengthens investor trust but also solidifies Web3Bay’s position as a high-potential project this year. Furthermore, Web3Bay plans to support multiple currencies, allowing transactions in various cryptocurrencies and conventional payment methods. This dual approach broadens accessibility for both cryptocurrency aficionados and regular e-commerce shoppers, enhancing Web3Bay’s prospects for widespread adoption. As blockchain marketplaces become more prevalent, Web3Bay is poised to lead this shift, positioning it as a top project to watch in 2025. Dogecoin: Gaining Institutional Eyes Amid High Volatility Dogecoin has always been popular among individual investors, often boosted by social media and celebrity support. Recently, its price dropped by 25%, now at about $0.256. The new Grayscale Dogecoin Trust could bring in institutional investors, potentially stabilizing its future. Yet, Dogecoin is still mostly a speculative investment with limited use beyond basic transactions. Although some businesses accept DOGE, its dependence on popularity and hype marks it as risky. In contrast, Web3Bay offers a systematic strategy and practical applications, making Dogecoin’s appeal for stable, long-term investment uncertain. Additionally, Dogecoin’s inflationary model, which adds millions of new coins daily, raises doubts about its long-term value preservation. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin’s continual issuance could hinder its price growth. Cardano: Will Development Gains Reflect in Its Price? Cardano continues to advance its blockchain technology, introducing Hydra to speed up transactions. However, ADA’s price has been flat, struggling to overcome significant resistance. Investor patience is thinning over Cardano’s slow price movement, with many looking to faster-growing options like Web3Bay, which has a direct profitability plan through its presale stages. Web3Bay’s current traction suggests it may offer better investment returns than ADA’s unpredictable price movements. Cardano also faces slow smart contract integration. Despite launching contracts with the Alonzo update, adoption lags behind competitors like Ethereum and Solana, prompting some developers to switch to more robust platforms. Cardano must quicken its adoption and practical uses to stay competitive. The Bottom Line As Dogecoin deals with fluctuations and Cardano’s growth stumbles, Web3Bay’s crypto presale pulls investors with a projected 6,430% ROI. Its decentralized commerce system, governance focus, and organized presale stage present a strong alternative in the crypto field. Web3Bay’s mix of crypto payments, lower fees, and user-driven governance highlights its market distinction. Facing Dogecoin’s inflation issues and Cardano’s slow uptake, Web3Bay offers innovative solutions with tangible benefits, positioning it as a promising option for those seeking sustainable growth and practicality in their investments.

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike UNI and DOT, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL is sold exclusively at magacoinofficial.com .

While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has.

Technical indicators suggest bulls could trigger an early recovery phase. Litecoin (LTC) Tumbles 5% as Traders Book Profits on Altcoin ETF Hype Litecoin (LTC) was among last week’s top-performing assets, but a sell-the-news event has triggered a notable pullback. While inflation concerns capped gains in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum (ETH), which hovered around $97,000 and $2,700 respectively, Litecoin rode bullish sentiment as the U.S. SEC acknowledged fresh ETF filings for DOGE and XRP by Grayscale and 21Shares. Litecoin Price Action (LTCUSDT) LTC price soared to a 30-day peak of $137 on February 13 before retreating sharply to $126.4 at press time, marking a 5.7% decline within 24 hours. This decline aligns with a classic profit-booking scenario, where traders cash in on gains following a major announcement. However, with no deterioration in network fundamentals or major negative press, bullish investors could take advantage of this correction. If LTC stabilizes above $120, new entrants may seize the dip, mitigating further downside risks and setting the stage for a rebound. Litecoin Whale Demand Surges After SEC Acknowledged DOGE and XRP Filings Beyond short-term volatility, Litecoin’s whale accumulation patterns suggest a potential price recovery. A key metric reinforcing this view is IntoTheBlock ‘s Average Transaction Size, which tracks the average dollar value of transactions on the Litecoin network, providing insight into whale activity. Litecoin Average Transaction Size | LTCUSDT Data from IntoTheBlock shows that on February 8, LTC’s average transaction size fell to a monthly low of $45,190. However, following the SEC’s acknowledgment of DOGE and XRP ETF applications, this figure rebounded to $54,000 as of February 15. This increase suggests that deep-pocketed investors are accumulating LTC despite recent price declines. Whale accumulation typically signals confidence in long-term price appreciation. As more institutional players enter the altcoin space due to ETF speculation, LTC could benefit from heightened liquidity and a renewed uptrend. Litecoin (LTC) Price Forecast: Bullish Momentum Alive if $120 Support Holds Litecoin price forecast indicates that the $120 support level will be critical in determining the next move. If LTC maintains this level, bullish momentum could resume, potentially retesting $130 in the coming days. A successful breakout above this resistance may pave the way for another attempt at $137, the recent high. Litecoin Price Forecast Technical indicators paint a mixed picture. The MACD histogram has flipped into negative territory, suggesting slowing momentum, but the declining selling pressure could allow for a swift recovery. Additionally, Keltner Channel analysis shows LTC consolidating within a tightening range, a potential precursor to volatility expansion. If bears breach $120, LTC could drop to the next key support at $117, where buyers may step in again. However, if whales continue accumulating, the path of least resistance remains upward, reinforcing the bullish outlook.

ETH might gain bearish momentum if it dips below the $2,650 support zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $2,720 level. The price is trading below $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,700 and $2,720. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price attempted a fresh increase above the $2,650 level, like Bitcoin . ETH broke the $2,720 resistance but it failed to clear the $2,800 resistance zone. A high was formed at $2,791 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $2,750 and $2,720 support levels. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,614 swing low to the $2,791 high. There was also a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, it is now finding bids near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,614 swing low to the $2,791 high. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,680 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,720 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,780 or $2,800. A clear move above the $2,800 resistance might send the price toward the $2,880 resistance. An upside break above the $2,880 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,720 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,655 level. The first major support sits near the $2,615 zone. A clear move below the $2,615 support might push the price toward the $2,550 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,500 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,440. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

Lummis, who represents Wyoming in the U.S. Senate, believes that a Bitcoin reserve could be audited 24/7 with just a basic computer, offering transparency and stability for the U.S. financial system. According to Bitcoin Magazine, she said, “A bitcoin reserve could be audited any time 24/7 with a basic computer. It’s time to upgrade our reserves.” As the new chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Senator Lummis is pushing for legislative changes to integrate Bitcoin into U.S. economic policy. She has consistently advocated for regulatory clarity and Bitcoin-friendly policies. In a recent discussion, Lummis also opened up about the growing interest in Bitcoin reserves, not just within the U.S., but also from other countries like the United Arab Emirates. Lummis shared that states like Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin are already considering creating their own strategic Bitcoin reserves, signaling a trend that could eventually influence federal policy. She said that states often act as incubators for innovation, and that a state-level Bitcoin reserve could serve as a model for broader adoption. Lummis Leads Charge for Bitcoin Integration As part of her advocacy, Lummis will be discussing the role of Bitcoin in U.S. reserves and its potential to stabilize the nation’s finances at Bitcoin 2025, a key event for the cryptocurrency community. She encouraged Bitcoin supporters to engage with lawmakers and work towards making a state the first to adopt a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Senator Lummis remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, seeing it as an asset that could help reduce the U.S. national debt and provide a hedge against inflation. She envisions Bitcoin playing a crucial role in protecting the U.S. dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-17 03:33:27

Some investors are now turning to Propichain, a new real estate investing ecosystem that has raised over $2 million from its ongoing presale. Read on to see why experts are confident that Propichain will offer better returns than XRP. Can XRP and Dogecoin Recover in Q1 2025? The altcoin sector has been heavily impacted by the recent market decline, causing sharp losses for XRP and Dogecoin . Both XRP and Dogecoin surged to 2-year highs in late 2024. Their rise was fueled by excitement over Donald Trump’s electoral victory and the broader market optimism that followed. Investors expected both tokens to maintain their bullish performance. However, February came with unpleasant surprises. For XRP, it has fallen by over 20% from its current value of $2.43. Dogecoin has also dropped by 24.2%, now selling at $0.259. With uncertainty gripping XRP and Dogecoin, many investors are looking for alternative assets with stronger stability and profit potential. One project that has gained attention is Propichain, a real estate investing powerhouse that leverages artificial intelligence to uncover high-return opportunities for traders. Propichain (PCHAIN): Real Estate Investing, Reinvented The game of real estate investing has always been exclusive to investors with huge capital and years of experience. However, Propichain (PCHAIN) is flipping the script by using artificial intelligence to offer a faster, smarter, and more inclusive way to build wealth in the housing sector. With blockchain-powered tokenization and AI-driven insights, PCHAIN is turning real estate into a dynamic, accessible asset class for everyone, regardless of their experience levels. Propichain’s transformation of the housing sector starts with lower investing costs, which is based on its fractional ownership model. This platform tokenizes housing properties, breaking them into smaller, more affordable shares, enabling investors with lower budgets to participate in the housing market. Picture a $5 million residential complex becoming 5,000 tokens at $1,000 each. Investors can buy shares in this complex according to the size of the budget, a feature that is largely unavailable in the traditional real estate sector. With these fractional tokens, investors can earn passive income from rental and leasing without the headaches of property management. By tokenizing real estate assets, Propichain is democratizing access to the profits within the housing sector. Not only does Propichain lower the barriers to entry, but it also empowers investors with cutting-edge AI tools to optimize their real estate strategies. Propichain’s AI tools crunch data on rental yields, economic trends, and demographic shifts, highlighting opportunities for amplifying returns. For example, it might detect a surge in demand for co-living spaces in urban areas, notifying you so you can capitalize on the opportunity ahead of other investors. Propichain’s AI tools are great for navigating the housing sector as they offer a personalized experience for both beginners and expert investors. These tools come with customizable search filters that give you more autonomy over your investing experience. Rather than going through a list of random options, you can use factors like rental income growth or capital appreciation to tailor your searches. This way, you find opportunities in line with your investing goals. Traders can also enjoy higher efficiency thanks to the automated trading function that comes with Propichain’s AI tools. This can help reduce the time you spend trading while closing deals on your behalf, using instructions set by you. Propichain complements its AI-backed trading features with metaverse tours that connect traders to global investing opportunities. It uses immersive VR tours to bridge worldwide housing markets, allowing traders in Canada to inspect beachfront villas in Bali, collaborate with local agents, and finalize deals—all from the comfort of their living room. In addition to property tours, these immersive experiences allow investors to connect with global stakeholders in real-time. As Propichain expands access to real estate investing, security remains a top priority. By leveraging BlockAudit-certified smart contracts, the platform ensures seamless and fraud-proof transactions, automating key processes like lease agreements and rent payments. Top Altcoins for 2025: Why Investors Pick Propichain Over XRP Market analysts recognize Propichain’s innovative AI integration as a game-changer in real estate investing, positioning it as a strong competitor to traditional crypto assets like XRP. Furthermore, Propichain’s recent CoinMarketCap listing has also increased excitement around its ongoing presale, which has now sold over $2 million worth of tokens. PCHAIN is now in stage 2 of its presale, selling at $0.011. By the next stage, its value will grow to $0.023. It will keep rising until it reaches its official launch price of $0.032 listing. Additionally, investors have projected a 10,000x increase that could take $1,000 worth of PCHAIN today to over $120,000 by the start of 2026. With early investors already securing their positions, now is the time to act. Don’t miss out—join Propichain’s presale today!

40436911,https://invezz.com/?p=2569257,1739764920,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,I’d avoid Blackrock’s IBIT ETF and buy this Bitcoin fund instead,https://invezz.com/news/2025/02/17/id-avoid-blackrocks-ibit-etf-and-buy-this-bitcoin-fund-instead/,"The iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has done well and broken records in the financial services industry as its assets surged to over $54 billion. This is a great performance since the popular SPDR Gold ETF (GLD), which was started in 2004 has accumulated $80 billion in assets. That is a sign that IBIT will eventually pass GLD in the coming years. This article explains why the IBIT ETF may surge, and why there is a better alternative to buy. The bullish case for the IBIT ETF The IBIT ETF has done well, and there are chances that it will soon have a strong bullish breakout. First, Bitcoin will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the long term. While history is not the best predictor of an asset, we can use historical data to predict what it will do in the future. Bitcoin was started in 2009 and was trading below $1 at the time. It then surged to a record high of $109,200 earlier this year. Bitcoin’s surge to $109,000 was not linear. Instead, it faced major crashes in the last 16 years. For example, Bitcoin’s price peaked at $68,500 in 2021 and crashed by 76% by December 2021, as FTX, Celsius, and Terra crashed. It also crashed by 85% between December 2017 and December 2018. Most recently, it soared to a high of $73,756 in March 2024 and then retreated to $49,325 in July. In all this time, Bitcoin has managed to beat odds and stage a strong comeback. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the coin will emerge from the current consolidation and rebound. Bitcoin supply and demand dynamics Second, Bitcoin has one of the best demand and supply dynamics in the financial industry. It has a supply limit of 21 million of which 19.8 million coins have been mined. This means that there are just 1.2 million coins that will ever be mined, a situation that will take time to happen since mining difficulty is rising. Remember, Bitcoin goes through a halving period every four years that reduces the block rewards by half. As such, there is a likelihood that the 21 million coins will never be mined as the difficulty will keep rising. Bitcoin demand is also soaring. For example, the IBIT ETF has already accumulated $54 billion worth of coins, while all ETFs have over $140 billion in assets. As such, a combination of falling supply and rising demand means that Bitcoin price will keep surging. Bitcoin price has strong technicals The other bullish case for the IBIT ETF is that Bitcoin price has formed a bullish flag and a cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart. A bullish flag has a long vertical line and a rectangle pattern, and in most cases, it leads to more gains. A C&H pattern, on the other hand, has a rounded bottom and a handle section. In this case, a strong bullish breakout will see Bitcoin price surge to $123,000 in the near term. Bitcoin price technical chart | Source: TradingView IBIT ETF is good, but there’s a good alternative While the IBIT ETF is a good fund to buy, it is not the best. Instead, we believe that the Grayscale Mini Bitcoin ETF (BTC) is the best one to buy. It is a highly liquid fund with over $4.1 billion in assets under management, making it the fifth-biggest fund to invest in. It beats the IBIT ETF because of its lower fees. It has an expense ratio of 0.15%, lower than IBIT’s 0.25%, giving it a 10 basis point spread. Therefore, since these are similar funds, why would one pay a higher fee? For example, a $100,000 investment in IBIT will cost you $250 a year, while BTC will cost you $150. Besides, IBIT and BTC share a similar custodian: Coinbase.

The price is showing positive signs and might gain bullish momentum above $2.750. XRP price started a decent upward move above the $2.60 zone. The price is now trading above $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.680 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.750 resistance zone. XRP Price Rally Loses Steam XRP price managed to stay above the $2.50 support and remained in a positive zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . A base was formed, and the price started a decent upward move above the $2.55 and $2.65 levels. The price surpassed the first key barrier at $2.750. It tested the next hurdle at $2.840. A high was formed at $2.8322 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor move below $2.75. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.330 swing low to the $2.8322 high. The current price action is positive. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.680 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.750 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.80 level. The next resistance is $2.840. A clear move above the $2.840 resistance might send the price toward the $2.920 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.0 resistance or even $3.050 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.120. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.750 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.680 level or the trend line. The next major support is near the $2.60 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.330 swing low to the $2.8322 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.60 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.550 support. The next major support sits near the $2.50 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

Ripple now stands out as major news in crypto, and many believe Ripple may soon find use in new markets. Ripple remains a hot topic as experts discuss its future use by the Bank of Japan. At the same time, a new token is showing strong returns and practical solutions. Many call it one of the best cryptos to buy, with a low current DeFi coin price that attracts new investors. Recent updates bring fresh hope to those who want a token that solves real payment problems. Ripple: Surging After SEC ETF Acknowledgement Recent reports show that Ripple has racked up gains after the SEC acknowledged an ETF proposal. Ripple has caught the attention of many financial institutions and traders. News from Nasdaq states that several banks in Japan may soon start using Ripple. This new interest could push Ripple to even higher value. Analysts predict that if more banks join the network, the use of Ripple will grow fast. This shift may help Ripple overcome past hurdles. The idea is that a global financial giant like the Bank of Japan could soon rely on Ripple to cut transaction times and lower fees. Such news makes Ripple one of the best cryptos to buy for those who believe in strong payment systems. The current Ripple price movement shows strong potential for future growth, drawing interest from both retail and large investors. The proposal from regulators and the attention from banks signal a change. Ripple’s role in facilitating fast international transfers remains its key strength. Many banks aim to cut costs and speed up payments. Ripple fits this need by allowing quick transfers at a low cost. Conversely, other analysts believe that XRP will dip within the next few weeks before it recovers. Conversely says that the price of XRP is likely to drop by -3.68% and reach $ 2.67 by March 18. After that, a rally is said to be on the horizon. Remittix: A New DeFi Project Solving Real Payment Problems Remittix is a new token that shows how crypto can fix real-world issues.

Such potential makes Remittix one of the best cryptos to buy for long-term growth. The system Remittix offers does more than just lower fees. It lets users keep the true nature of cryptography. People maintain anonymity and full control over their funds. Yet, the token ties this privacy to modern finance. It brings the benefits of digital money to everyday transactions.

As a result, the stock price surged more than 8% today moving back to 6,500 JPY levels once again. Since the beginning of 2025, the stock has already appreciated more than 78% as of today. Metaplanet Clocks a BTC Yield of 15.3% in 2025 Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich stated that the latest Bitcoin purchase comes at an average price of $97,481 per BTC. Additionally, the company also reported a year-to-date BTC yield of 15.3% in 2025. As of February 17, 2025, the firm holds a total of 2,031.41 BTC, acquired for a cumulative investment of roughly $163.3 million at an average cost of $80,394 per Bitcoin , as per the company disclosure. The company’s BTC Yield, which measures Bitcoin holdings relative to fully diluted shares, reached 309.8% in Q4 2024 and 15.3% in early 2025. Metaplanet funded this Bitcoin purchase through a JPY 4 billion zero-coupon bond issuance to EVO FUND, maturing in August 2025. Additionally, to fund its BTC purchases going further, the company has also approved the issuance of the 13th to 17th Series of Stock Acquisition Rights, which totals 21 million shares in five tranches of 4.2 million shares each. Stock Price Eyeing Fresh All-Time Highs? With year-to-date gains of more than 78%, the stock has been on an unprecedented rally. Moreover, with today’s 8% gains, the stock price has once again moved past 6,520 JPY levels eyeing for fresh all-time highs. Furthermore, with the company initiating the Bitcoin Treasury Operations, the stock has witnessed very high trading activity in the Japanese market over the past year. Metaplanet has announced its inclusion in the MSCI Japan Index, effective after the market close on February 28, 2025. The index serves as a key reference for institutional investors globally, guiding decisions on Japanese equities. This inclusion in the MSCI Index coupled with the company’s plan of acquiring 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026 could further fuel the stock price moving ahead. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Picks Up The recent acquisition from Japan’s MicroStrategy comes as the Bitcoin price has been flirting around $97,000 levels, while facing some selling pressure today. However, the whale accumulation for the largest crypto asset class continues further. SpotOnChain has reported significant Bitcoin accumulation from a newly created wallet. In just four days, the wallet has withdrawn 568.74 BTC from Binance at an estimated average price of $96,769 per Bitcoin, amounting to a total cost value of approximately $55.04 million.

Berachain is an EVM-identical Layer 1 blockchain that leverages the novel Proof of Liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism, setting it apart from traditional proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. By embedding liquidity provisioning into its core security model, PoL aligns incentives across validators, applications, and users—ensuring liquidity and security at the network level. Moby’s pioneering efforts have been recognized through its selection for Berachain’s prestigious Request for Application (RFA) program—an endorsement reflecting the protocol’s robust infrastructure and potential to enhance liquidity across the Berachain ecosystem. Moreover, Moby has secured partnerships with key industry players such as Kodiak, Infrared, PumpBTC and GMX, further solidifying its position within the ecosystem. Moby offers two key advantages for Berachain traders and institutions: deeper liquidity and exceptionally tight spreads, both designed to ensure an optimal trading environment. Meanwhile, liquidity providers benefit from high passive income, underpinned by stable risk management achieved through real-time automatic hedging. Additionally, Moby’s Structured Product Vault (SPV) seamlessly integrates with Berachain’s PoL mechanism, providing an efficient yield-enhancing solution. The SPV aggregates PoL rewards and optimizes their yield through algorithmic options trading. It will integrate LST/LRT and Real World Assets (RWA) to expand the on-chain options market. “The expansion to Berachain is a pivotal step for Moby,” stated Ben, CEO of Moby. “By leveraging Berachain’s PoL model, we are setting the stage for a more liquid and scalable on-chain options market—ushering in a new era of institutional-grade trading and structured products” Coinciding with its official launch on the Berachain mainnet, Moby introduced an incentive program for early access users. This initiative allows users to earn rewards based on their engagement. Moby Contacts Team Moby team@moby.trade About Moby Moby is an on-chain options protocol to lead the next narrative for DeFi. Moby offers an optimized trading environment based on its pioneering SLE (Synchronized Liquidity Engine) and Dynamic Risk Premium model, which enables real-time accurate pricing, narrowest spread in the market, abundant liquidity, and Robinhood-class UI/UX.

As the AI chatbot developed by Musk’s xAI prepares to debut, traders rushed to capitalize on the hype, driving the token’s market cap to approximately $33.51 million. At last check, the token was trading at around $0.0053, reflecting heightened investor enthusiasm, despite xAI itself having no direct ties to the Grok token. Source: CoinMarketCap The surge underscores how Musk’s influence continues to drive market activity, even as xAI remains an underdog in the AI space, facing stiff competition from OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. With Grok 3 set to be unveiled on Monday at 8:00 PM Pacific Time, speculation is running high. However, questions remain about the sustainability of this rally, given the lack of fundamental backing behind the token. Grok 3’s launch today The crypto market has a history of reacting sharply to Musk’s ventures, particularly when tied to AI or blockchain. Grok 3’s announcement triggered an immediate response from speculative traders, reminiscent of previous meme coin frenzies. Back in November 2023, several GROK-inspired tokens surfaced in response to Musk’s initial xAI announcement, some witnessing gains exceeding 30,000% before retracing sharply. Similar trends have played out with Dogecoin, where Musk’s endorsements fuelled rallies, only for prices to decline once the hype faded. While xAI has secured $6 billion in funding from investors including Nvidia, AMD, and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, it remains in the early stages of challenging industry leaders like OpenAI. The firm is reportedly valued at $75 billion and is attempting to raise an additional $10 billion, but it still lacks the entrenched user base of its biggest competitors. The question now is whether Grok 3’s launch will provide xAI with meaningful traction in the AI space or if the excitement surrounding its debut will follow the typical boom-and-bust cycle seen in crypto markets. Grok’s token has no clear use case tied to xAI’s development Despite the token’s price surge, its long-term outlook remains uncertain. Unlike other AI-linked tokens backed by blockchain projects integrating AI capabilities, Grok’s token has no clear use case tied to xAI’s development. Speculators may see short-term gains, but sustainability hinges on whether Grok 3’s release delivers tangible advancements that differentiate it from existing AI models. Musk has claimed that the chatbot is the “smartest AI on Earth,” but it remains to be seen whether that claim translates into adoption. Elon Musk @elonmusk · Follow Grok 3 release with live demo on Monday night at 8pm PT. Smartest AI on Earth. 8:28 AM · Feb 16, 2025 51.3K Reply Copy link Read 7.1K replies Broader trends also suggest caution. Musk’s controversies in recent years have impacted his companies, with Tesla facing declining sales and X (formerly Twitter) struggling with user retention. His leadership continues to attract polarised reactions, which could influence investor sentiment toward projects linked to his name. At a time when AI investment is at an all-time high, but scrutiny is growing over the financial viability of new entrants, Grok 3’s success—or failure—could have wider implications for both AI and speculative crypto markets. Grok token rally: AI-driven speculation? The Grok token rally reflects a broader trend of AI and blockchain convergence, where speculative assets linked to artificial intelligence are gaining traction. Investors are increasingly drawn to AI-related crypto projects, even when fundamentals remain unclear. This trend has also been evident in China, where AI-related stocks and tokens saw sharp fluctuations after the rise of DeepSeek, a Hangzhou-based startup challenging US-based AI models. While AI adoption is expanding globally, speculative trading continues to dominate markets, leading to unpredictable price swings. With Grok 3 set to go live, the coming weeks will reveal whether this is another short-lived Musk-driven pump or if xAI can establish itself as a serious contender in the AI landscape.

ADA is now consolidating gains and might aim for a fresh move above the $0.80 level. ADA price started a fresh rally above the $0.720 and $0.750 levels. The price is trading above $0.750 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.770 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.80 resistance zone. Cardano Price Climbs Above $0.750 After forming a base above the $0.720 level, Cardano started a fresh rally beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA was able to clear the $0.750 and $0.80 resistance levels. It even surged above the $0.820 level. A high was formed at $0.8286 before there was a downside correction. The price tested the $0.7620 zone and recently started a fresh increase. It cleared the $0.780 resistance. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $0.8286 swing high to the $0.7621 low. There was also a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.770 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. Cardano price is now trading above $0.780 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.80 zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $0.8286 swing high to the $0.7621 low. The first resistance is near $0.820. The next key resistance might be $0.850. If there is a close above the $0.850 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.90 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.00 in the near term. Another Decline in ADA?

Legal Experts Investigate LIBRA Token’s Sudden Collapse,https://coinpedia.org/news/javier-milei-crypto-rug-pull-legal-experts-investigate-libra-tokens-sudden-collapse/,"The post Javier Milei Crypto Rug Pull? Legal Experts Investigate LIBRA Token’s Sudden Collapse appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Argentina is caught in a huge crypto controversy, with President Javier Milei at the center of a legal mess. It all began when Milei posted about LIBRA, a new cryptocurrency, on X. His support sent the token from $0.006 to almost $5 in just a few hours. Many investors assumed the project had government backing and rushed to buy in. But the excitement didn’t last—six hours later, LIBRA’s price crashed to $0.84, wiping out billions and causing panic. Argentine lawyers charge President Milei with fraud over crypto coin pump-and-dump. Follow: @AFpost pic.twitter.com/cDeP0lDwOo — AF Post (@AFpost) February 17, 2025 Lawyers File Fraud Charges The sudden crash led to immediate legal action. Argentine lawyers Jonatan Baldiviezo and Marcos Zelaya filed fraud charges against Milei, arguing that his promotion of LIBRA misled investors. They claim his post tricked investors and compare the situation to a “rug pull,” a common crypto scam where developers promote a token before abandoning it, leaving investors with huge losses. The law firm Burwick Law also insisted the investors reach out to them in case they want assistance in crypto loss. If you lost money on $LIBRA , contact Burwick Law to learn about your legal rights. Our firm represents thousands of clients that want to get their money back on crypto losses. This is attorney advertising. Your results may vary. — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) February 15, 2025 Assuming the complications, Milei quickly deleted his post and denied knowing anything about LIBRA’s creation. His team released a statement saying they removed the post to stop speculation. But legal experts argue that the damage was already done. Now, Argentina’s judiciary will decide if Milei and his team misled investors. Questions of Insider Trading The situation became even more suspicious when Jupiter Exchange admitted that some of its team members had known about LIBRA’s launch weeks before Milei’s post. According to them, private groups were already discussing an “Argentina Coin.” While Jupiter denied any insider trading, the revelation raised concerns that certain people may have made secret profits before the crash. Meanwhile, Kelsier Ventures CEO Hayden Davis, one of LIBRA’s biggest supporters, blamed Milei for the token’s collapse. He claimed the president’s team had promised to support the project but later backed out, shaking investor confidence. Davis denied any fraudulent activity and said he still controlled $100 million in LIBRA funds, which he plans to reinvest and use to buy back and burn tokens to restore value. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Trader’s $17.6M LIBRA Meme Coin Win Raises Questions on Insider Trading , What Happens Next? Argentina’s Anti-Corruption Office is now investigating whether any crimes were committed. Whether Milei manages to clear his name or faces serious legal trouble remains uncertain. Raising doubts, Argentina’s government officials confirmed that President Javier Milei met with KIP Protocol executives Mauricio Novelli and Julian Peh in October 2024 to discuss a blockchain initiative. Later, in January 2025, Milei also met with Hayden Davis, a key figure behind LIBRA, though the government insists he had no official ties to the state. Milei’s team denied fraud charges, claiming it was a routine social media post to support entrepreneurs, not an official government project. However, the Anti-Corruption Office remains unconvinced and has assembled a special task force of crypto, finance, and anti-money laundering experts to investigate potential fraud or misconduct. The government has pledged to hand over all findings to the courts, but with lawsuits piling up and investors outraged, Milei’s presidency hangs in the balance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Senator Lummis says BTC can be audited at any time,https://invezz.com/news/2025/02/17/bitcoin-backed-national-reserves-senator-lummis-says-btc-can-be-audited-at-any-time/,"Senator Cynthia Lummis is urging the United States to consider Bitcoin as part of its national reserves. With concerns over inflation, government spending, and the long-term stability of the US dollar, Lummis argues that Bitcoin could offer a new level of financial transparency. As chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Lummis is focused on integrating Bitcoin into US economic policy. She highlights that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature allows for real-time auditing, a feature that could significantly enhance trust in the financial system. Unlike gold or fiat reserves, Bitcoin holdings can be verified instantly with a basic computer, eliminating the need for complex audits. The senator’s remarks come as multiple US states explore Bitcoin reserves. Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin are among those considering digital asset reserves as part of their financial strategy. This state-level momentum could pave the way for broader national adoption, with Lummis pushing for discussions at the federal level. US states test Bitcoin reserves Bitcoin-backed reserves are no longer a fringe concept. In the US, individual states have begun exploring Bitcoin as an alternative asset to hedge against inflation and financial instability. Lummis believes that state-level adoption could create a precedent, eventually influencing federal policy. Texas has already embraced Bitcoin in multiple ways, including through mining incentives and legislative support for crypto-friendly policies. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have signaled interest in exploring how Bitcoin reserves could fit into their broader financial strategies. Internationally, the trend is also gaining traction. Lummis recently noted that the United Arab Emirates has shown interest in Bitcoin reserves, reflecting a global shift toward recognizing the asset’s potential role in national financial strategies. Bitcoin and US debt Lummis has positioned Bitcoin as more than just a speculative asset—she sees it as a tool to address national debt concerns and strengthen the US dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency. With US national debt surpassing $34 trillion, policymakers are increasingly seeking alternative strategies to manage long-term fiscal challenges. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, is viewed by some as a hedge against inflation and excessive government spending. If integrated into the US reserves, Lummis suggests that Bitcoin could serve as a safeguard against monetary debasement. The broader adoption of Bitcoin as a national reserve asset faces significant regulatory and political hurdles. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department have yet to signal any shift in policy toward incorporating Bitcoin into national reserves, despite growing support from crypto-friendly legislators. Lummis encourages Bitcoin supporters to engage with lawmakers Senator Lummis is set to discuss Bitcoin’s potential role in national reserves at Bitcoin 2025, a high-profile event focused on cryptocurrency and financial innovation. She has encouraged Bitcoin supporters to engage with lawmakers to push for policy changes at both the state and federal levels. As discussions around Bitcoin reserves gain traction, the financial landscape could witness a major shift in how digital assets are perceived by governments. While resistance remains strong among traditional policymakers, growing interest from states and international players suggests that Bitcoin’s role in sovereign financial strategies is far from settled.

With the BTFD Coin (BTFD) presale blowing past $6 million, Just a Chill Guy and Moo Deng also making waves, and an exclusive LAUNCH100 bonus giving investors twice the tokens, it’s no wonder meme coin enthusiasts are paying close attention. Meme coins have had an insane rise over the years. From joke projects turning into billion-dollar assets to retail investors riding the hype train, these tokens have proven they’re not just for fun—they’re serious business. While some fade into oblivion, others create strong communities, real utility, and long-term staying power. BTFD Coin is at the forefront of this next wave. Its Play2Earn (P2E) game went live on January 1, 2025, staking offers a whopping 90% APY, and its referral program rewards investors for spreading the word. With over 70 billion tokens sold and more than 10,700 holders (or Bulls, as they call themselves), the BTFD coin is setting the stage for explosive growth. And thanks to the LAUNCH100 bonus code, anyone buying now gets double the tokens, making this presale even more lucrative. BTFD Coin: The Ultimate Meme Coin with Utility, Community, and Massive Gains BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin riding the hype—it’s got real reasons to back the excitement. Its Play2Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, referral program, and Bulls Squad make it a complete ecosystem rather than just a speculative asset. The P2E game is already live, allowing players to earn BTFD tokens while having fun. This model ensures continued engagement and demand for the token, making it more than just a trading asset. Investors looking for the best new meme coins to join now should take note—this is where gaming meets passive income. Staking is another big reason people are jumping into BTFD. With a staggering 90% APY, investors can lock in massive returns just by holding their tokens. To put this into perspective, if you stake $40,000 worth of BTFD now, by this time next year, you could be sitting on $76,000 worth of tokens. The Bulls Squad community also plays a huge role in BTFD’s growth. The team is consistently adding value, keeping investors engaged, and ensuring long-term sustainability. With the presale nearing its final stages, the buzz is growing, and analysts predict a post-listing price surge that could multiply early investments significantly. Just a Chill Guy: The Relaxed Meme Coin With a Dedicated Following Not every meme coin needs to be high-energy and aggressive in its marketing. Just a Chill Guy takes a more laid-back approach, building a strong, organic community without the usual over-the-top hype. This project taps into the idea of slow, steady growth rather than meteoric rises and crashes. It’s gaining traction because investors are looking for meme coins that don’t just rely on short-term speculation but have staying power. The project has seen a surge in community engagement, with active discussions on social media, meme competitions, and interactive events that keep holders engaged. While it may not have the same aggressive staking model as BTFD, Just a Chill Guy is proving that a dedicated community is sometimes all you need for long-term success.

In Texas, the state Senate is set to hold a public hearing on Feb. 18 to discuss the potential establishment of a Bitcoin reserve, a move that could signal further institutional acceptance of digital assets. Meanwhile, a newly released report reveals that the Bitcoin mining industry has already created over 31,000 jobs in the US, contributing more than $4.1 billion in annual GDP. While these initiatives reflect broader economic and political shifts, analysts remain cautious about their immediate market impact, citing macroeconomic factors and regulatory considerations as primary drivers of Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bitcoin Mining in the US Surges: Over 31,000 Jobs Created, Economic Impact Hits $4.1 Billion The Bitcoin mining industry has rapidly grown into a significant economic force in the United States, creating over 31,000 jobs across the country and generating more than $4.1 billion in annual gross domestic product (GDP), according to a new report. Despite being a relatively nascent sector, the study—conducted by the Perryman Group and published by blockchain advocacy organizations Texas Blockchain Council and The Digital Chamber—highlights the industry's profound impact on employment, energy infrastructure, and national priorities. The report found that Bitcoin mining activity is concentrated in 12 U.S. states, with Texas leading the way. The Lone Star State accounts for more than 12,200 jobs, both directly from mining operations and indirectly through industries supporting the sector. The massive expansion of mining operations in Texas has also contributed to strengthening local energy utility infrastructure. Bitcoin miners act as a load-balancing resource for the electrical grid, helping stabilize energy supply by shutting down during peak demand and utilizing excess power during off-peak hours. As a result, mining operations have become a key player in grid resilience strategies, making the industry increasingly indispensable to state and local governments. The industry's growing economic footprint coincides with a shifting political landscape. US President Donald Trump, who campaigned on making the United States the ”crypto capital of the planet,” has emphasized the importance of Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure as matters of national security. Trump has consistently advocated for expanding energy production to maintain dominance in both sectors, stating that the US would need at least double its current energy output to support these high-performance computing industries. ”We will have power plants built at the sites. We will be releasing people from certain ridiculous requirements, and we will be using fossil fuels to make electricity because we are going to have to. We will also be using nuclear,” Trump said. His stance signals a policy shift that could remove regulatory barriers for Bitcoin miners and AI-focused companies, ensuring greater access to energy resources and infrastructure development. Bitcoin mining and AI computing share a common challenge: intensive energy consumption. As mining companies and tech firms seek long-term solutions to sustain operations, the exploration of alternative energy sources has become a priority. One of the most promising developments in this space is small-scale nuclear reactors. These compact nuclear power units, small enough to be transported in an 18-wheel truck, are emerging as a viable solution to provide on-site power generation for data centers and mining farms. In October 2024, Google took a significant step in this direction by signing a deal with Kairos Power , a nuclear power engineering firm, to develop a small-scale nuclear reactor dedicated to powering AI operations. The project is set to be operational by 2030. This technology could have far-reaching implications for the Bitcoin mining industry, providing an alternative to traditional fossil fuels while enhancing energy security and sustainability. Regulatory Landscape and Future Growth While the Bitcoin mining sector is expanding, it still faces regulatory uncertainty. Environmental concerns related to carbon emissions and energy consumption have led to increased scrutiny from federal and state regulators. However, the industry's role in stabilizing energy grids and advancing technological innovation may shift political attitudes in favor of supportive policies. Moreover, with rising geopolitical tensions and increased competition in the global digital asset space, the US is positioning itself as a leader in blockchain technology, AI, and high-performance computing. Bitcoin mining is no longer a niche industry—it has become an integral part of America's energy, technology, and economic strategy. With 31,000 jobs created, $4.1 billion in annual GDP contributions, and ongoing investments in nuclear and renewable energy, the sector is poised for sustained growth. As political and industry leaders continue to prioritize blockchain and AI dominance, Bitcoin mining could play a critical role in shaping the US economy in the coming years. Whether through policy support, infrastructure expansion, or energy innovation, the industry is set to become a pillar of national technological leadership. Texas Senate to Hold Public Hearing on Bitcoin Reserve Proposal: Symbolic Move or Genuine Policy Shift? The Texas Senate is preparing to hold a public hearing on Feb. 18 to discuss the establishment of a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve, a move that could mark a significant milestone for state-level cryptocurrency adoption. However, market analysts remain cautious, suggesting that unless the state unveils a concrete investment plan, the initiative may remain largely symbolic rather than a transformative shift in Bitcoin adoption. The upcoming hearing comes just days after Senate Bill 21 (SB21) was received by the Secretary of the Senate, signaling the state’s increasing interest in integrating Bitcoin into its financial reserves. The bill aligns with Texas’ well-known pro-crypto stance, given the state’s strong mining industry, regulatory support, and business-friendly policies that have attracted some of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining firms. Despite the significance of the hearing, some analysts argue that the market may not react strongly unless Texas makes an immediate commitment to acquiring Bitcoin. “Texas considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset is another chess move in BTC’s march toward institutional legitimacy, but state-level initiatives often make ripples, not waves, compared to ETF inflows or corporate treasury allocations,” said Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at Nexo. Kalchev believes that unless the hearing unveils a near-term purchase plan or a major policy shift, its impact on Bitcoin’s price action may be muted. The announcement comes at a time when Bitcoin is facing macro-driven headwinds, particularly from geopolitical tensions and monetary policy uncertainties. Bitcoin has been trading below the $100,000 psychological level for over nine days since Feb. 7. The cryptocurrency has shown resilience despite ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, which could affect investor sentiment in the near term. “While this headwind remains in the market, with President Trump eyeing more tariff hikes in the coming weeks, Bitcoin has traded with resilience,” said Vugar Usi Zade, COO of Bitget. “With the US retaining its stance as the largest capital market, geopolitical tensions may continue to weigh on Bitcoin’s trajectory.” Additionally, Federal Reserve policy remains a dominant factor in shaping Bitcoin’s price trends. Analysts note that while Texas’ push for a Bitcoin reserve is a positive step toward mainstream adoption, the broader market still reacts primarily to Fed interest rate decisions, regulatory updates, and global economic conditions. “Crypto markets tend to price in expected developments, and while this hearing may add to Bitcoin’s long-term adoption story, macro forces like Fed policy and regulatory shifts remain the real power players in shaping BTC’s trajectory,” Kalchev added. Texas is not the only state exploring Bitcoin reserves. On Feb. 6, Kentucky became the 16th US state to introduce legislation aimed at establishing a Bitcoin reserve fund, which would allow up to 10% of excess state reserves to be allocated into digital assets. Texas’ move, therefore, reflects a broader economic and political shift in the US, where states are beginning to recognize Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes it an attractive alternative to traditional financial instruments, especially in states with strong energy production and mining operations. The Potential Impact of a Texas Bitcoin Reserve If Texas moves forward with acquiring Bitcoin for its state reserves, it could set a precedent for other states and even influence federal policies. Texas already plays a leading role in the US Bitcoin mining industry, with over 12,200 mining-related jobs, and a strategic Bitcoin reserve could further solidify its position as a crypto hub. A state-backed Bitcoin investment could also serve as a model for institutional investors looking for long-term exposure to digital assets. While the upcoming hearing is an encouraging sign, the absence of a clear purchase plan means its immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price may be limited. However, if Texas officially commits to buying Bitcoin, it could lead to a significant wave of institutional and governmental adoption, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as digital gold.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-17 05:30:00

He warns that this could be the biggest economic fallout in history, with massive job losses, plunging stock prices, and a struggling housing market. According to him the warning signs of an economic collapse are crystal clear now. He is sure that the 2025 crisis will be bigger than the Great Depression of the 1930s. Kiyosaki’s Playbook and His Three Rules To confirm this trend change, he is referring to his book published in 1997 to remind his followers of the financial lessons that got his book rejected by major publishers during that era. Despite skepticism from editors, his three money rules have stood the test of time and seem more relevant than ever in 2025. Kiyosaki’s first rule, “The rich do not work for money,” highlights how wealthy individuals build businesses and create assets instead of relying on a paycheck. With job losses mounting in 2025, this concept is proving true as entrepreneurs continue to thrive while employees struggle. His second rule, “Your house is not an asset,” challenges the common belief that homeownership is a guaranteed path to wealth. He defines assets as things that generate money without working, while liabilities drain finances. With home prices crashing and affordability at an all-time low, many are realizing that their homes are not the financial security they once believed. The final rule, “Savers are losers,” addresses the impact of inflation and the dangers of relying on fiat currency. As per him, the US Dollar is “fake money” and you will lose everything if you hold this toilet paper. Kiyosaki suggests investing in gold, silver, and Bitcoin to keep money safe from inflation and losing value. He warns that saving too much cash can be risky because its worth goes down over time, especially during tough economic times. He refers to gold and silver as “God’s money” and Bitcoin as “people’s money,” urging individuals to rethink how they protect their financial future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin, ETH, & XRP Price Prediction: A Bullish Week Ahead? , Crypto Dad Counters Kiyosaki Crypto expert, Crypto Dad responded to Robert Kiyosaki’s financial advice, offering a different perspective on wealth-building. While Kiyosaki emphasizes entrepreneurship as the key to financial success, Crypto Dad argues that not everyone is meant to be an entrepreneur—and that’s perfectly fine. He acknowledges that many people feel pressured to start their businesses, only to struggle or fail because building something from scratch is incredibly challenging. According to him, “The hardest job in the world is to create your job.” Instead, he believes individuals can still achieve financial success and wealth by working for others, as long as they make smart financial choices. His response highlights that entrepreneurship isn’t the only path to wealth, and people should not feel forced into it. Whether through investing, career growth, or strategic money management, there are multiple ways to build financial security without starting a business. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/every-investor-should-hold-at-least-1000-xrp-heres-why/,"XRP has been on a roll since late 2024 and is trading higher than it has for most of its history. The recent price surge showed investors that they should have gotten in early, but with the asset still below its all-time high, there’s still room for accumulation. The digital asset began trading in November at $0.5092, with 1,000 XRP going for $509.2. The digital asset is now trading at $2.7, putting a 1,000 XRP investment at $2,700—almost 3x its price last year. Limited Large-Scale Adoption Edoardo Farina, a prominent crypto CEO and expert, recently called on everyone to hold at least 1,000 XRP , and the asset’s recent performance and potential for growth reinforces this sentiment. However, recent data from the XRP Rich List shows there is still room for larger-scale adoption. Among the 6.1 million existing XRP wallets, approximately 938,123 contain holdings of 1,000 XRP or greater. 84% or 5.18 million accounts, maintain balances below this threshold. These statistics are particularly noteworthy compared to Bitcoin’s broader market penetration, encompassing more than 460 million addresses. Accumulating at least 1,000 tokens now would put investors in an exclusive class, and many other reasons support fast accumulation. Institutional Development and Regulatory Progress The cryptocurrency landscape has witnessed increased institutional engagement with XRP. Several prominent asset management firms have submitted applications for spot XRP ETFs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally acknowledged submissions from Grayscale and 21Shares, while Cboe BZX has facilitated 19b-4 filings for multiple organizations, including WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Canary Capital. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Recent changes in SEC leadership have generated optimism regarding potential ETF approvals, and acknowledgment of these filings is the first step toward that goal. Government Interest in XRP Recent developments also suggest that the U.S. Government is interested in digital assets. A recently signed executive order established a working group dedicated to examining digital asset regulation and the possibility of a U.S. crypto reserve. Industry observers note that XRP’s status as a prominent American-developed digital asset could position it favorably for inclusion in any future government reserve. An Upcoming XRP Bull Run Additionally, crypto analysts have made multiple bullish predictions for the digital asset. EGRAG CRYPTO, a prominent analyst, has predicted a rise to $15 by March 10, a potential subsequent climb that could send XRP as high as $27 . This target is 10x the asset’s current price and would turn a modest investment into significant profit.

Recently, the CBOE filed the 19b for Bitwise’s XRP ETF , along with other companies looking to get approval. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, discussed the potential for these ETFs in a recent discussion, shedding light on the current state of XRP ETFs. XRP ETF Approval: Challenges & Progress In an interview with Thinking Crypto , Hougan explained that there had been several starts and stops with ETF applications in the past, with some applications being filed and later withdrawn. However, the fact that multiple issuers are now refiling their applications suggests that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is open to investigating these products, although approval is not guaranteed. While the conversation around digital assets like XRP and Solana is heating up, Hougan is optimistic that the SEC is increasingly willing to consider these ETFs. He said that the outlook for XRP ETFs has improved over the past few months, and with more progress being made, it’s likely that the SEC will take a more accommodative approach to approving these assets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Attorney John Deaton Defends XRP Against Claims of Being a ‘Centrally Controlled Security’ , “I would say you want to be realistic about the speed. I think even a pro-crypto SEC is likely to take their time, analyze, get public comment. My view is that this is a long game. Our view is that the SEC wants to take an accommodative view and help investors access these assets through ETPs. We’ll find out over the next six months,” He Said. Matt Hougan’s Outlook on XRP ETFs Hougan pointed out that, historically, commodity ETFs have been launched only when there is a regulated futures market for that commodity, such as with gold, and even Bitcoin. While a futures market is not required for XRP ETFs, it would be an important factor in the approval process. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Meanwhile, Pantera Capital’s Dan Morehead is under federal tax investigation over $850 million in investment profits after relocating to Puerto Rico. In India, authorities seized almost $190 million in crypto linked to the Bitconnect Ponzi scheme. Geosyn Mining Faces Criminal Charges The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided to pause its fraud lawsuit against Geosyn Mining and its executives after similar charges were filed by federal prosecutors against the company’s leadership. The agency’s decision was shared in a Feb. 14 filing to a Texas federal court, and happened after Geosyn CEO Caleb Joseph Ward and former operating chief Jeremy George McNutt surrendered to authorities and made their first court appearance. The SEC originally filed its case in April of 2024, accusing the executives of fraudulent activities tied to their cryptocurrency mining business. Original announcement of SEC lawsuit (Source: SEC ) Court documents were unsealed on Feb. 10 and revealed details about the accusations against Ward, McNutt, and Geosyn’s former sales manager, Jared McNutt, who was not named in the SEC’s case but is implicated in the broader scheme. The complaint alleges that the trio deceived their clients by promising to buy and host Bitcoin mining equipment on their behalf in exchange for a monthly fee, with the promise of sharing the mining profits. However, prosecutors claim that in many cases, the equipment was never purchased, and customer funds were instead used to fund a lavish lifestyle. This included the purchase of firearms, luxury watches, and personal trips to Disney World and Miami. According to the affidavit, the executives sent falsified reports to customers, which made them believe their mining rigs were operational and generating revenue. Additionally, they allegedly engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme by using funds from new clients to buy Bitcoin and transfer it to earlier clients, giving the illusion that the mining rigs were actually producing income. Prosecutors also claim that the executives deliberately misrepresented the cost of mining rigs to extract even more profits and maintained a spreadsheet documenting the real and inflated prices, which far exceeded the advertised procurement fees. The SEC’s lawsuit alleges that Ward and Jeremy McNutt defrauded approximately 64 investors out of $5.6 million between November of 2021 and December of 2022. The agency believes that the service agreements offered by Geosyn constituted unregistered securities, which is a claim that Ward has disputed. The SEC also alleges that Geosyn did not procure 400 of the 1,400 mining rigs it had agreements for and neglected to bring most of the acquired rigs online. In an apparent internal dispute, Ward reportedly reported McNutt for embezzlement without mentioning his own misappropriation of funds. Recent political developments have also intersected with the case. Last week, Ward and McNutt responded to a query from Judge Mark Pittman about how the potential regulatory shift under Donald Trump’s administration could influence the lawsuit. The two requested a hold on the SEC’s case due to the parallel criminal proceedings and the need to evaluate Trump’s crypto-friendly policies, which they argued could impact the SEC’s enforcement authority and approach to the case. Despite this argument, the SEC maintained in its filing that the administration’s stance on crypto and the newly established task force should not affect the case. Pantera Capital’s Dan Morehead Faces Tax Investigation Dan Morehead, the founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital, is also reportedly under investigation for possible federal tax law violations after relocating to Puerto Rico. The US Senate Finance Committee (SFC) requested information about over $850 million in investment profits Morehead earned after moving to the island in 2020. A letter from Senator Ron Wyden from Jan. 9 suggested that Morehead “may have treated” these profits as exempt from US taxes. The letter pointed out that in most cases, a large portion of gains earned by people relocating to Puerto Rico still qualifies as US-sourced income, requiring them to report it on US tax returns and pay applicable taxes. In response to this, Morehead shared that he believes he acted appropriately regarding his taxes and clarified that he moved to Puerto Rico in 2021. Morehead founded Pantera Capital , which was the first cryptocurrency investment firm in the US. It even saw some of its early investments grow by more than 130,000%, according to a blog post he published in November of 2024. He also launched the Pantera Bitcoin Fund in 2013, with its initial Bitcoin purchase at $74 generating over 1,000 times its return. Pantera Capital now manages over $5 billion in assets, with more than 100 venture investments and 47% of its capital allocated outside the United States, according to the company’s website. (Source: Pantera Capital ) The investigation into Morehead happened at a time of increased regulatory scrutiny on crypto taxation. In June of 2024, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) introduced new rules requiring US crypto transactions to be subject to third-party tax reporting for the first time. Starting in 2025, centralized crypto exchanges and other brokers will have to report sales and exchanges of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. This move raised a lot of concerns in the industry. Some experts warned that it could push investors toward decentralized platforms, making tax revenue even harder to track. India Cracks Down on Bitconnect Fraud Indian authorities seized almost $190 million in crypto linked to the Bitconnect Ponzi scheme as part of an ongoing investigation into the global fraud that collapsed in 2018. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Ahmedabad conducted the seizure as part of its probe into the scheme, which allegedly deceived numerous investors under the guise of securities investments. Alongside the cryptocurrency, authorities also confiscated cash amounting to approximately $15,582, a sport utility vehicle, and several electronic devices in raids that were conducted on Feb. 11 and 15 in Gujarat. The seized assets reportedly belonged to associates of Bitconnect, which is accused of defrauding around 4,000 investors across 95 countries, leading to an estimated $2.4 billion in losses. Bitconnect was founded in 2016, and lured investors with promises of high returns but collapsed just two years later. Bitconnect’s founder, Satish Kumbhani, was charged by the US Department of Justice in February of 2022 for orchestrating the scheme. Authorities claim he built a worldwide network of promoters who were paid commissions to attract more investors into the fraudulent operation. Between November 2016 and January 2018, the scheme collected funds from investors around the world, including a large number in India. (Source: US Department of Justice ) The fallout from Bitconnect’s collapse led to desperate attempts by some victims to recover their lost investments. In August of 2024, the Enforcement Directorate reported that an investor, Shailesh Babulal Bhatt, who suffered losses in Bitconnect Coin (BCC), took extreme measures by kidnapping two of Kumbhani’s employees. Bhatt and his accomplices allegedly extorted 2,091 Bitcoin, 11,000 Litecoin, and around $1.7 million in cash to recoup his losses.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|MINING|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-17 05:51:17

Technical charts for DOGE flash warning signals amid the formation of a death cross pattern for DOGE MVRV. Confirming the bearish trend, a renowned analyst predicted a likely 44% crash in the top-meme coin’s value ahead. Dogecoin Price Can Correct 44%, Says Analyst Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that DOGE could be heading for a challenging period amid a bearish technical chart pattern. Martinez highlighted a “death cross” between Dogecoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and its 200-day moving average (MA). The analyst stated that historically, such chart patterns have led to significant declines, with Dogecoin price dropping 26% and 44% during the last two instances of this pattern. If this happens, DOGE could collapse all the way to $0.15 from the current levels. Source: Ali Martinez Meme Coins Take A Massive Hit Over the past weekend, the Dogecoin price has corrected 7% as the broader meme coin sector takes a major hit following the launch of Argentina’s LIBRA meme coin , which faced a massive pump and dump. Apart from top players like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu (SHIB), celebrity meme coins have taken the most hit. Furthermore, as per the Coinglass data , the DOGE futures open interest has tanked 5.27% to $2.41 billion while the 24-hour liquidations have shot up to $3.57 million of which, $3.1 million is in long liquidations. Source: Coinglass DOGE Traders Remain Optimistic Despite the technical charts suggesting bearishness for Dogecoin price, traders continue to be optimistic about gains moving ahead. Furthermore, with developments around the SEC’s potential approval of a spot Dogecoin ETF , the optimism remains intact. Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged the DOGE ETF filing by asset manager Grayscale raising further hopes within the crypto community. Crypto analyst Bluntz has expressed optimism about Dogecoin (DOGE), highlighting its stability after two weeks of consolidation following a recent capitulation event. “$DOGE is looking pretty solid here, in my opinion,” Bluntz noted, adding, “If there’s one saying that’s always stuck with me, it’s never short a dull market.” Source: Bluntz The analyst’s remarks suggest that Dogecoin’s current quiet phase could indicate potential strength, with traders keeping a close watch for future price movements.

However, this hasn't deterred traders from continuing to bet bullishly on the leading cryptocurrency. This month's most preferred options play has been buying the $110,000 call expiring on March 28, with buyers paying a cumulative net premium of over $6 million for the bullish exposure, according to the Deribit options flow tracked by Amberdata. A call option gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish, looking to hedge downside risks. ""Looking at the month-to-date flows for on-screen traders… the buying of March $110K calls has been the most active trade,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a note shared with CoinDesk. Bitcoin has mostly traded within a narrow range of $95,000 to $100,000 this month. The bulls have had some positive developments to chew on, like the continued accumulation by MicroStrategy and Abu Dhabi's recent reveal of a $436 million investment in the bitcoin ETFs. However, renewed macroeconomic headwinds, highlighted by last week's hotter U.S. inflation data and frequent liquidity drains caused by the boom-bust cycles of memecoins and other small-cap tokens, appear to be capping the upside potential. Over the weekend, a token called LIBRA zoomed to a market cap of over $4 billion, only to erase 90% of that within minutes. Argentina's President, Xavier Milei, initially promoted the coin late Friday but backtracked in a few hours, causing a controversy that has him facing legal issues in his home country. ""Some bullish headlines hit for BTC last week, but that didn't materialize into any real spike higher for spot prices,"" Magadini said, referring to Abu Dhabi's investment. ""Combine this news with bearish memecoin market drag (a source of bearish headlines) such as the $Libra drop, pump-fun mania and growing supply of alts [altcoins] and I see this market in stand-still. Together, this reinforces my 'sideways' market, lower volatility market thesis,"" Magadini added.",Markets|Bitcoin|Options|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-17 07:10:11

Analyst Reveals Timeline",https://coingape.com/when-xrp-price-can-hit-8-13-27-analyst-reveals-timeline/,"XRP price slips more than 4% slipping below the key support of $2.7 sparking concerns over further dip ahead. Although Ripple’s native crypto has soared past the $2.8 mark recently, fueling market sentiment towards a potential rally to $3 next, recent movements have left many questioning the future of the crypto. However, citing technical indicators and other key metrics, a top market expert reveals when the crypto can hit a new ATH of $8, gaining immense market attention. Besides, he also provided an outlook for the crypto’s further rally to $13 and $27. Analyst Highlights Bullish Technical Indicators For XRP Price Crypto expert EGRAG CRYPTO has highlighted crucial technical patterns indicating the next major move for the XRP price. According to his analysis, the 21-week exponential moving average (EMA) has been a key support level for the crypto. Even during the latest flash crash, this indicator held firm, signaling a strong foundation for price stability. EGRAG CRYPTO noted that XRP is currently consolidating between Fibonacci (Fib) levels 0.888 and 1.0, within the $2.25 and $3.30 range. This setup, according to technical analysis, sets the stage for a potential breakout. He outlined a key Fib intersection expected on March 10, 2025, which could push the crypto’s price to $8, representing a 3x surge from current levels. Besides, he projected further rally looking ahead for the asset. According to his analysis, XRP price could climb to $13 by September 22, 2025, and potentially $27 by June 30, 2025, based on further Fibonacci extensions. Besides, a recent report also revealed the timeline for XRP to hit $17 . Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X Short-term Outlook For The Crypto Another analyst, Dark Defender, remains optimistic about the short-term prospects for XRP price. He predicts that reclaiming the $2.7740 level could pave the way for a rally to $3 soon. In his recent analysis, he emphasized that breaking the current resistance zone could signal a much larger breakout toward double-digit price levels. Source: Dark Defender, X Notably, this also resonates with the latest predictions by other experts. For context, in a recent X post, renowned expert Ali Martinez said that Ripple’s native asset is following a “cup and handle pattern”, which indicates a potential breakout to $3.35 ahead. Source: Ali Martinez, X Is XRP Poised To Flip Ethereum? Despite the recent volatile price movements, experts remain optimistic about the XRP price trajectory. Analysts have also predicted that crypto will flip Ethereum soon, which has further sparked market discussions. Meanwhile, Dark Defender compared XRP’s performance to Ethereum, asserting that the former has begun to flip ETH in market performance. He pointed out that, over a period from September 2023 to January 2025, XRP’s price surged by 564%, while Ethereum only gained 80%. This significant difference, according to him, proves Ripple’s native crypto’s growing dominance in the market. Moreover, he criticized skeptics who dismiss technical analysis, stating that mathematical patterns in price movements provide valuable insights into XRP’s future potential. Source: Dark Defender, X What’s Next For XRP Price? As of writing, XRP price was down 4.13% and exchanged hands at $2.67. However, the crypto has added nearly 12% over the last seven days, due to a flurry of positive market developments surrounding Ripple and the crypto. Meanwhile, XRP Futures Open Interest fell 6% to $4.07 billion after recently hitting $4.2 billion. Source: Coinglass However, looking at the current market trends, it appears that XRP is likely to witness a robust rally ahead. For context, market speculations are soaring over a potential dismissal or settlement in the Ripple Vs SEC case under the upcoming US SEC Chair. This expectation, if comes true, can boost the crypto’s price to a new high. On the other hand, soaring anticipation over a potential XRP ETF approval in the US has further bolstered market sentiment. The investment instrument can significantly raise the crypto’s appeal to institutional investors, paving the way toward a robust rally ahead. The post When XRP Price Can Hit $8, $13, & $27?

However, despite its popularity and strong community backing, DOGE has struggled to maintain momentum, leaving many wondering if and when it will ever hit this milestone. Meanwhile, innovative blockchain projects with strong fundamentals and real-world utility are emerging as more promising contenders. One such project is PCHAIN , the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-based real estate ecosystem designed to power the future of the $600 trillion global real estate. Market experts strongly believe PCHAIN will hit the $1 mark before the Dogecoin price. The PropiChain token stands out in the crowded crypto space due to its unique value proposition to redefine global real estate transactions. Unlike the Dogecoin price, which primarily relies on social media hype and celebrity endorsements, PCHAIN is backed by the multi-trillion-dollar global real estate market and the $16 trillion RWA tokenization market. The Dogecoin Price Slow Pace to $1 Over the past 30 days, the Dogecoin price has fallen by more than 24% due to escalating market pressure. Technical indicators suggest the price could face further crashes, with support levels near $0.24 at risk if bearish trends continue. Additionally, market data shows DOGE trading volumes have crashed by 15% this week, reducing holders’ confidence. DOGE has faced consistent selling activity, with its price down over 20% in the last 2 weeks and social media engagement declining sharply. Market experts strongly doubt that DOGE’s price will soon hit the $1 mark. This weakening sentiment contrasts with rising interest in PCHAIN, which has witnessed the influx of retail and institutional investors in its ongoing presale. With the Dogecoin price trading near multi-month lows, many traders view PCHAIN’s presale as a safer opportunity than volatile memecoins. PCHAIN’s Accelerated Rise Amid Dogecoin Price Slow Momentum In contrast to the slow pace of the Dogecoin price movement to $1, PCHAIN is garnering attention for its ambitious growth projections. Analysts have highlighted the PropiChain token’s potential for substantial returns, with some forecasts predicting a surge of up to 43,408%. This optimism is driven by the PropiChain token’s innovative approach to blockchain technology, particularly its application in global real estate, which positions it uniquely in the market. Furthermore, the ongoing presale offers early investors significant opportunities. Priced at $0.01, market experts strongly believe the token will rally to $1 faster than DOGE’s price. Given the token’s current growth momentum and strategic market positioning, this trajectory offers early investors an impressive 8,990% ROI. Comparative Analysis: PCHAIN vs. the Dogecoin Price Movement While the Dogecoin price movement and the PropiChain token present intriguing investment opportunities, their paths to the $1 mark differ significantly. Community support and market sentiment heavily influence DOGE’s growth, leading to a wide range of price predictions. PCHAIN, on the other hand, is backed by tangible real-world assets in the real estate sector and a structured presale strategy, contributing to its robust growth forecasts. As an RWA altcoin, the PropiChain token gives investors early access to the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. The token’s real-world utility and solid fundamentals give it an edge over DOGE in the race to the coveted $1 mark. With PropiChain poised to capture at least 1% of the $600 trillion global real estate market, analysts strongly believe this will drive the token’s value beyond the $1 projection. PropiChain: Using New-Generation Technological Innovation to Power Global Real Estate PropiChain is transforming the multi-trillion-dollar global real estate industry by deploying cutting-edge technology to redefine property transactions. Its advanced platform enhances efficiency, offering a seamless alternative to traditional real estate processes. At the heart of PropiChain’s innovation is its integration of blockchain-powered smart contracts, which help automate key real estate operations, including property transfers, lease agreements, and rental payments. With these smart contracts, real estate investors eliminate the need for intermediaries such as brokers and agents. By streamlining these processes, PropiChain reduces transaction costs, fast-tracks transactions, and minimizes fraud risks. Beyond automation, PropiChain is reshaping property exploration through an immersive Metaverse experience. By utilizing 3D virtual technology, buyers and investors can conduct detailed property tours remotely, breaking geographical barriers. Whether an investor in Dubai wants to explore a beachfront villa in California or a high-rise apartment in Greece, PropiChain’s interactive Metaverse walkthroughs provide a highly realistic and engaging experience, fostering greater transparency and real-time collaboration between buyers and sellers. Another revolutionary feature of PropiChain’s ecosystem is its Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization model. The platform enables fractional ownership by converting physical real estate into digital tokens, allowing more investors to participate in high-value property markets without requiring significant upfront capital. This approach democratizes access to lucrative real estate opportunities, making wealth-building more inclusive. Additionally, PropiChain integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize investment strategies. AI-powered analytics evaluate market trends, property valuations, and risk factors, equipping investors with data-driven insights for smarter decision-making. Also, AI-driven virtual assistants and chatbots provide investors with all-round support and personalized guidance throughout their real estate investment journey. By combining blockchain, AI, and Metaverse technology, PropiChain is setting a new benchmark for the real estate industry that is more transparent, efficient, and accessible to a global audience. PropiChain Presale: Massive ROI Opportunity for Early Investors While the Dogecoin price struggles with massive selling pressure, the PCHAIN presale offers investors an opportunity to earn massive returns. The presale already raised over $1.3 million in its first round and has crossed the $1.2 million mark in the ongoing second presale round. After this round, the token price will rise by over 109% for the next presale stage. Market experts have likened the PropiChain presale to the early days of DOGE, highlighting massive growth potential for early investors. According to leading analysts, a modest $1000 investment in the presale could yield a staggering $430,800 ROI. Join the presale now to position yourself for these potential life-changing returns. BlockAudit , a top blockchain security company, thoroughly edited the project’s smart contract. After the rigorous audit, the company certified that the PropiChain platform is fully safe and secure for all investors. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , highlighting the project’s readiness and mission to do bigger things in the crypto space.

This makes the report of a trader earning over $1.1 million from Solana memecoins spotlight-worthy. However, the trader’s current fortune pales in comparison to their next target and what it signals for crypto investors. Leading Solana memecoins like $TRUMP, $BONK, and $PENGU have enjoyed relative success with investors, leveraging online traction and a communal ethos. At $16.50 , $0.00001761 , and $0.009797 , respectively, users have the opportunity to scale safely with minimal risk. The rising importance of enhanced DeFi trading platforms like RCO Finance have nonetheless drawn attention to their robust offerings for investors. The Ripple Effect of Solana Memecoin Investor’s Success A trader gained widespread attention on the 11th of February after receiving over $1 million in returns after trading in Solana (SOL) and a Solana memecoin, $HARRYBOLZ. This comes against the run of play, given the coin’s status as a background player on the Solana platform. The development also hints at a further goldmine as the AI-powered trading platform RCO Finance braces for an impactful run. Currently trading at $0.00000000000048 with a trading volume of $4,380, down by 98.11%, $HAIRYBOLZ is the textbook underdog coin. Its valuation rose briefly following Elon Musk’s X name change , indicative of the enduring impact of influencers in the crypto space. With the name change triggering a 120% spike in the value of the Solana memecoin, the whale’s prior purchase of 128.8 million worth of $HAIRYBOLZ was a timely one. With more peak periods on the way for Solana memecoins, it is only natural for investors to spread out their portfolios with more reliable altcoins. RCO Finance is poised to be the next big bet in the crypto market, offering users a vast trove of assets to invest in. Discover New Trading Capabilities with RCO Finance RCO Finance is the undeniable frontrunner in the era of automated trading and AI-fueled scalability. With an AI tool known as the Robo Advisor, RCO Finance balances investors’ prompt capitalization on market trends with organic, sustainable portfolio growth. It also offers trading privacy without the excessive KYC requirements synonymous with other DeFi platforms. With the Robo Advisor, users can take advantage of short-lived goldmines. While many users focused on trending Solana memecoins like $TRUMP and $BONK in January 2025. The Robo Advisor would have referred users to the $HAIRYBOLZ coin following Elon Musk’s X name change. Developments of this nature periodically arise, but it is possible to leverage all with RCO Finance’s Robo Advisor. Additionally, RCO Finance makes the investment process seamless for users by offering access to diverse assets. With over 120,000 asset types on the platform, divided into 12,500 classes. Beginner traders can rely on the Robo Advisor to recommend and include viable real-world, digital, and tokenized assets in their portfolios. RCO Finance recently launched its Beta platform , with over 10,000 users currently signed up to the platform. This gives a glimpse of the platform’s long list of capabilities for new and prospective users. These help position users for more opportunities to profit from leading altcoins, trending Solana memecoins, and viable assets in general. RCO Finance is set to add more tools to its beta platform. Monitoring facilities are also on the way for the Robo Advisor to help users take advantage of rapid crypto developments akin to the $HAIRYBOLZ spike and other Solana memecoins. RCOF Tokens – The New Face of Seamless DeFi Transactions Beyond keeping users ahead of sharp developments, the RCOF token adds an endearing dimension to rapid asset trades. RCOF tokens facilitate trades and add liquidity to the platform. These tokens also enable users to unlock more tools for market automation and sustainable portfolio growth. RCOF users can also lock up their tokens in exchange for dividends and stake them for platform rewards. These tokens also enable users to contribute to the platform’s growth with the voting rights attached to them. This way, RCO Finance doubles down on decentralized governance to yield a platform inclined to users’ preferences and reservations. With over $13 million worth of RCOF tokens sold, RCO Finance is on course to becoming the crypto trading platform of choice for many users. Take a Chance on RCO Finance Today RCOF has undergone four presale stages and is currently priced at $0.1 in its fifth presale stage.

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL has proven to be the standout investment. With $1.9 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Is the Next Big Opportunity 1.

How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL. Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL to dominate the market. With limited supply, overwhelming demand, and exclusive availability, it’s the ultimate choice for investors seeking the next big win.

BTFD Coin ($BTFD) , Moo Deng , and Turbo are three of the most talked-about new meme coins to buy today. BTFD Coin has been making waves with its presale success, having already sold over 70 billion tokens and raised more than $6 million . Meanwhile, Moo Deng and Turbo are navigating the bullish market trends and have become popular for their community-driven ecosystems. So, what sets these coins apart, and which is worth your investment? Over the past few years, meme coins have evolved from quirky, speculative investments into legitimate assets with strong followings and utility. The rise of meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu opened the floodgates, and now new projects are entering the scene with greater ambition. BTFD Coin is leading the charge with its innovative approach, offering more than just hype— BTFD Coin has integrated features like a Play2Earn game , staking rewards , and a referral program . On the other hand, Moo Deng and Turbo are riding the wave of bullish market trends, with strong community engagement and well-planned tokenomics. As the Top New Meme Coins to Buy Today , these coins offer more than just excitement—they are backed by solid strategies that could result in long-term growth. As BTFD Coin continues to dominate the presale stage with impressive results, it’s clear that its innovative ecosystem is capturing investor attention. But Moo Deng and Turbo are proving that the meme coin market is full of opportunity for those who are willing to explore a range of potential investments. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolutionizing the Space If you’re looking for Top New Meme Coins to Buy Today , BTFD Coin is a strong contender. The coin’s presale success has been remarkable, having raised over $6 million and sold over 70 billion tokens to more than 10,700 holders . What makes BTFD Coin stand out in the crowded meme coin space is its real-world utility and the incentives it offers to long-term holders. The Play2Earn game , which launched its full version on January 1, 2025, is one of the key features that sets BTFD Coin apart from other meme coins. Players can earn BTFD Coin tokens by participating in the game, providing a clear use case for the coin that drives both demand and engagement. The 90% APY staking rewards , which went live on December 2, 2024, further encourage long-term investment by offering substantial returns for those who choose to stake their tokens. Additionally, BTFD Coin has a referral program that rewards users for bringing others into the community. This creates a viral effect, helping to expand the BTFD Coin ecosystem at an exponential rate. The coin also has a strong, passionate community known as the Bulls Squad , which has played a pivotal role in driving the coin’s success. With Stage 14 of the presale currently offering a 100% bonus through the LAUNCH100 bonus code , there has never been a better time to invest. This limited-time offer means that every BTFD Coin token you purchase during this stage will be doubled , making this presale even more enticing. For those considering an investment, here’s an example of how BTFD Coin ‘s price could evolve. If you were to invest $75,000 at the current presale price of $0.00016 , you would receive 468.75 million tokens . When BTFD Coin hits $0.0006 after its presale, your investment would be worth $281,250 . If BTFD Coin skyrockets to its predicted moon price of $0.006 , your $75,000 investment could turn into a staggering $4.687 million —a nearly 62x return. Moo Deng: The Meme Coin with Strong Community Backing Another strong contender for the Top New Meme Coins to Buy Today is Moo Deng . This meme coin has grown in popularity thanks to its strong community support and engagement . Moo Deng has steadily built a dedicated following, and it’s quickly becoming one of the go-to meme coins for investors looking for something new in the market. Moo Deng ‘s strategy revolves around community-driven initiatives , with a focus on creating a loyal user base that can help push the coin’s value higher over time. The coin has gained attention for its tokenomics , offering exclusive rewards to holders and active community members . As a meme coin, Moo Deng ‘s success is driven largely by its ability to keep users engaged and create a sense of belonging. The Moo Deng team has made it clear that they want to create more than just a speculative investment; they aim to build a coin that fosters long-term value. However, the coin does face competition in a crowded meme coin market. While its community is strong, Moo Deng has yet to see the explosive growth that some other meme coins have enjoyed in the past. Still, with the current bullish market trends, Moo Deng could be poised for a big jump if it continues to deliver on its promises of rewards and engagement. Turbo: The Meme Coin with Speed and Innovation Turbo is another up-and-coming coin in the meme coin market that has gained attention due to its innovative approach and strong development team. The project focuses on speed and efficiency , which has made it a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts who are looking for a fast-paced, exciting investment. Turbo is quickly establishing itself as one of the Top New Meme Coins to Buy Today , particularly for those who value technological innovation in their investments. What makes Turbo unique is its focus on blockchain scalability and transaction speed , which makes it ideal for use cases in industries like gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi). The Turbo team is committed to making the coin a key player in these spaces, which gives it significant potential for long-term growth. However, like Moo Deng , Turbo faces the challenge of standing out in a market filled with meme coins. While Turbo is still in its early stages, it’s drawing attention from both investors and the crypto community for its innovative features and engaged development team . The future of Turbo looks promising, especially if it can continue to grow its user base and deliver on its goals.

40441581,https://nulltx.com/?p=145025,1739776585,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Cardano’s Market Struggles While RCO Finance Gains Traction for a 50,000% Upside",https://nulltx.com/cardanos-market-struggles-while-rco-finance-gains-traction-for-a-50000-upside/,"Cardano (ADA), once hailed as a top blockchain project, is facing increasing market struggles as investor sentiment weakens. Despite its strong fundamentals and ongoing development efforts, ADA has been unable to regain its previous highs, with concerns over network adoption and competition weighing on its price. Meanwhile, broader market volatility and a lack of strong bullish catalysts have further slowed enthusiasm for the asset. As a result, many investors are exploring alternative opportunities that offer higher upside potential. One such opportunity is RCO Finance (RCOF), a rising player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector that is gaining significant traction. With its innovative approach to yield farming, staking, liquidity provision, and DeFi trading, RCOF has captured the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Market analysts predict that its rapid adoption and strong utility could lead to an astronomical 50,000% upside, making it an attractive option for those seeking exponential gains. As Cardano (ADA) struggles to find momentum, RCOF’s impressive growth trajectory highlights the shifting dynamics within the crypto landscape. Cardano’s Market Challenges Cardano (ADA) has been facing a downward trend, with its price declining by over 15% in the past two weeks and more than 25% over the past month, according to CoinGecko data. This decline is partly attributed to large investors, or “whales,” offloading substantial ADA holdings in search of better high-yield alternative assets. Technical indicators also point to bearish momentum. The Average Directional Index (ADX), a tool used to gauge trend strength, has risen from 11.2 to 41.6 within five days, signaling a strong downward trend for Cardano (ADA). Additionally, a significant amount of ADA, valued at over $4.66 million, is at risk of liquidation if the price rebounds toward the $0.77 resistance level, indicating aggressive bearish bets in the market. These concerns further reinforce investors’ resolve to diversify to projects like RCO finance (RCOF), which has 50,000% upside potential. RCO Finance’s Rise Amid Cardano Market Struggles Amid Cardano’s struggles, RCO Finance (RCOF) is capturing investor attention with its innovative approach to DeFi trading. Backed by the $450 billion DeFi market, the RCOF token is poised to see a massive surge in the coming months. Unlike traditional systems, which rely on centralized third parties, RCOF provides a secure, low-cost, and highly efficient platform designed for digital asset trading. The ecosystem also provides an AI-powered DeFi trading tool that gives traders an edge in the highly sophisticated decentralized finance market. Some groundbreaking features of the RCOF ecosystem include high-yield staking programs, secure, low-fee transactions, and a governance system for token holders. These features have positioned RCO Finance as a high-potential player in the DeFi space, attracting both retail and institutional investors looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto market. Investment Potential and Market Sentiment The contrasting trajectories of Cardano (ADA) and RCO Finance (RCOF) highlight a shift in investor sentiment. While Cardano (ADA) faces challenges in maintaining its market position, RCO Finance’s innovative features and robust security measures are positioning it as a promising alternative in the DeFi space. Investors are particularly drawn to RCO Finance’s staking opportunities, which offer significantly higher yields than the industry average. Additionally, the platform provides trading fee discounts for investors who hold RCOF tokens, further incentivizing participation. The ongoing presale of RCOF tokens has been met with enthusiasm, raising over $12 million. Currently, in its fifth stage, RCOF tokens are priced at $0.10 each, with expectations of listing at $0.60. Experts anticipate that RCOF could experience an extraordinary rise of 50,000%, significantly outpacing Cardano’s projected growth. RCOF Has Launched Its Beta Platform The RCOF beta platform is live and open so users can have a firsthand feel of all the innovative features and tools before the mainnet launch. Users can test all the features and send their feedback to the RCOF team. The feedback will help the team improve the ecosystem features before the full launch. Over 10,000 users are currently testing the beta platform, an indication of the growing enthusiasm for the project. RCO Finance: A New Dawn For the Future of DeFi Trading RCO Finance (RCOF) is redefining the decentralized finance market by incorporating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to provide traders with a trading edge to thrive in the DeFi space. The groundbreaking tool within the RCOF ecosystem is the Robo Advisor, a sophisticated AI-powered DeFi trading tool. This cutting-edge AI system monitors market movements in real-time, analyzing trends and identifying potential high-growth assets before they take off. By deploying its deep-learning algorithms, the Robo Advisor provides traders with early insights, enabling them to stay ahead of the market and capitalize on emerging opportunities. A prime example of its effectiveness is the explosive rise of the $FULLSEND token , which surged over 600% in the last 24 hours. While most investors only recognized the trend after the rally was well underway, RCOF’s AI is designed to detect such patterns early, allowing users to position themselves and take advantage of such opportunities. Beyond simply identifying trends, the Robo Advisor offers precise, data-driven recommendations for optimal entry and exit points that ensure maximum returns. This ensures traders can maximize profits while reducing risk exposure. Real-time alerts notify users when breakout assets are on the verge of significant price movement. Another standout feature of the Robo Advisor is its ability to mitigate risk. If an asset shows signs of an impending crash, the AI instantly alerts traders, helping them avoid losses before a decline occurs. For instance, the $AIAT token suffered a sharp 35% drop in just 24 hours. RCOF’s predictive technology aims to anticipate such declines and warn traders and investors, helping them safeguard their portfolios against sudden market volatility. Unlike conventional signal-based trading systems, this advanced AI customizes investment strategies based on each user’s financial goals and risk tolerance. Whether an investor prioritizes rapid, short-term gains or long-term wealth accumulation, the Robo Advisor tailors its recommendations to enhance portfolio performance. RCOF is also pioneering real-world asset tokenization, breaking down traditional financial barriers and expanding investment opportunities. Through fractional ownership of high-value assets, the platform democratizes access to assets that were previously available only to institutional investors. By leveraging blockchain technology, RCOF enables users to invest in tokenized real estate, commodities, and other high-yield assets, promoting greater financial inclusivity. Additionally, privacy and financial autonomy remain key pillars of RCOF’s ecosystem. Operating within a decentralized, KYC-free framework, the platform ensures user anonymity while maintaining highly effective security protocols. Investors can explore a vast selection of over 120,000 assets across 12,500 categories, ranging from stocks and bonds to tokenized commodities and digital assets. To enhance user confidence and decision-making, RCOF integrates live market data from top-tier financial sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters. By providing real-time analytics and insights, the platform equips investors with the tools they need to stay ahead of the market trend. RCOF Presale: A Life-Changing 50,000% ROI While the Cardano market struggles, RCOF’s combination of AI-powered trading tools, real-world asset tokenization, and a privacy-centric DeFi framework positions the platform to redefine the future of decentralized investing. The presale is already in its fifth stage, raising over $12 million so far. The token is currently priced at $0.1 and will rise to $0.13 for the next presale phase. According to market experts, a modest $1000 investment in the presale could yield a staggering $545, 600 by Q2 2025. Join the presale now to capitalize on the potential life-changing returns. There are reports that the team is planning a $100,000 giveaway for early investors when the project hits the $250,000 milestone. RCOF’s smart contract has been thoroughly audited by SolidProof, a globally renowned blockchain security company, and they found no vulnerability.

However, analyst Kim Wong has defended the project, highlighting its widespread adoption, decentralized blockchain, and compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations as proof of credibility. Despite his arguments, concerns remain about its referral-based mining system, past data breaches, and potential legal risks. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Wong responded to criticism, emphasizing Pi Network’s unique benefits, including seamless cross-border transactions, free mobile mining, and a vast user base. He claimed that the project has provided financial access to millions worldwide. According to him, Pi coin is distributed in over 200 countries, with over 100 million registered users , including 65 million active participants and nearly 19 million KYC-verified users. Additionally, around 10.5 million people already hold Pi in their wallets. Wong pointed to Pi Network’s in-house KYC system, which ensures compliance with government regulations, adding credibility to the project. He also described its Layer 1 blockchain as decentralized, fast, and scalable, supporting a growing Web3 ecosystem. Wong challenged skeptics, asking them to name another crypto network with the same level of global adoption and real-world use. “If you still don’t understand Pi Network or think it’s a scam, you’re falling behind and need to catch up,” Wong said. Despite these statements, many critics remain doubtful. Some argue that the project is only moving forward now because of recent shifts in regulations. Others believe Pi’s referral-based mining makes it resemble a pyramid scheme. The project has also faced accusations of a data breach , with reports in 2021 claiming that Pi Network was responsible for leaking personal information of 10,000 Vietnamese citizens. The team denied these allegations. Meanwhile, Pi Network continues to gain mainstream traction. The project’s official account recently surpassed Ethereum ( ETH ) in followers on X. Pi coin has also been listed on multiple exchanges, including OKX, Bitget, and MEXC , with Gate.io announcing Pi trading support. Bitget has launched a 150,000 Pi airdrop to celebrate deposits, while Gate.io introduced a Launchpool event where users can stake Pi tokens for GT rewards. However, none of these exchanges currently allow US customers to participate. Speculation is also growing about a possible Binance listing. If confirmed, this could significantly increase market liquidity and attract both institutional investors and retail traders. Given Binance’s influence, such a move would add legitimacy to Pi Network and potentially drive up its value.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MINING|BLOCKCHAIN|BNB|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-17 07:20:18

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Ahmedabad conducted the operation, tracking the assets through detailed analysis of wallet transactions and dark web activity. Alongside the digital assets, officials also confiscated a luxury vehicle, cash, and electronic devices. The crackdown is part of an ongoing effort to dismantle the fraudulent scheme that operated from 2016 to 2018. BitConnect lured investors with promises of high returns, claiming to use an automated trading bot to generate profits. However, authorities confirmed it was nothing more than a Ponzi scheme, where funds from new investors were used to pay earlier participants. Victims were encouraged to deposit Bitcoin or cash into the platform, believing they would earn massive gains. Instead, the money was funneled into wallets controlled by the scheme’s operators. Investigators traced the movement of these funds across multiple wallets, many of which were intentionally hidden using the dark web. Despite the complex laundering attempts, detailed tracking of IP addresses, wallet flows, and blockchain activity led authorities to the assets. This latest seizure follows legal action against BitConnect’s founder, Satish Kumbhani , and its chief US promoter, Glenn Arcaro. Arcaro was sentenced to 38 months in prison in 2022 and ordered to repay $17.6 million to victims across 40 countries. Meanwhile, Kumbhani faces multiple charges, including wire fraud, commodity price manipulation, and international money laundering. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 70 years in prison. However, he remains a fugitive and has yet to be captured. The BitConnect scheme defrauded investors of an estimated $2.4 billion before collapsing when authorities uncovered its deceptive practices. The ED’s latest action highlights the continued pursuit of justice for victims and reinforces global efforts to combat financial fraud in the crypto sector.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-17 07:22:44

Terrett’s comments addressed speculation about whether the SEC’s acknowledgment of XRP ETFs implies that the agency now considers it a commodity. SEC’s Acknowledgment vs. XRP Classification According to Terrett, the SEC has acknowledged that issuers are applying for an ETF product that treats XRP as a commodity asset within a securities wrapper. This framework is consistent with how Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have been categorized in ETF applications. However, she clarifies that this acknowledgment does not necessarily equate to the SEC explicitly classifying XRP as a commodity. Instead, it signals that issuers are proposing XRP-based ETF products under the same regulatory structure as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Terrett also notes that the SEC has recently acknowledged ETFs tied to other digital assets, including Solana (SOL) , Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA). This suggests that the Commission is willing to consider ETFs for cryptocurrencies that the previous SEC administration may have viewed as securities. For those asking — here are my thoughts on the questions about whether the @SECGov has classified $XRP a commodity by way of the ETF acknowledgements. https://t.co/iSbvYskpi9 — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) February 15, 2025 SEC Litigation and Regulatory Uncertainty Another key point in Terrett’s analysis is the SEC’s approach to ongoing litigation related to digital assets. She highlights that the agency has paused certain legal proceedings while its crypto task force assesses the regulatory landscape. This move indicates that the SEC may be reconsidering its stance on the classification of various digital assets, including XRP. This regulatory pause aligns with broader trends in the crypto industry, where multiple legal battles have shaped the classification of digital assets. Notably, in July 2023, a U.S. federal court ruled that XRP was not a security when sold on secondary markets. However, the SEC has continued to scrutinize the asset, leaving its definitive classification unresolved. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Avoiding the Appearance of Favoritism Terrett also suggests that the SEC’s acknowledgment of these ETF applications may stem from a desire to avoid the perception of favoritism. By recognizing applications for multiple cryptocurrency-based ETFs, including assets that were previously considered securities, the SEC may be attempting to present a more neutral regulatory approach. This could be an effort to ensure consistency and avoid accusations of picking winners and losers within the digital asset industry. What This Means for XRP and the Crypto Market The SEC’s acknowledgment of XRP-related ETF applications is significant, as it indicates a willingness to consider XRP under a regulatory framework similar to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, Terrett cautions against interpreting this as a definitive classification. Until the SEC engages more substantively with these applications, it remains uncertain how the agency ultimately views XRP. The broader implication of these developments is that the SEC’s stance on cryptocurrency regulation is evolving. With the crypto task force actively reviewing various assets and legal challenges shaping regulatory interpretations, the classification of XRP and other cryptocurrencies remains subject to change.

In just two weeks, it has outpaced all similar offerings in both price performance and liquidity. Initially soaring to $100 before settling at $48, STRK continues to trade at volumes seven times higher than the average for comparable securities. On February 15, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor highlighted STRK’s rapid rise, emphasizing its strong demand. He noted that, out of 115 preferred securities listed in the US since 2022, STRK ranked first in price gains and volume. According to data, it rose 1.3% on its first day, gained 8% in its first week, and ended its second week 17.6% higher , outperforming competitors by nearly 19%. The surge in interest reflects investor confidence, despite price fluctuations. STRK peaked at $100 on launch day before dropping to $52 within a week and later stabilizing at $48. Strategy introduced STRK on January 27 to raise capital for Bitcoin purchases, surpassing expectations by securing $563.4 million—nearly three times the initial target. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s biggest advocates, Michael Saylor and Nayib Bukele , recently met at El Salvador’s presidential palace to discuss Bitcoin’s global expansion. Saylor revealed that their conversation focused on increasing adoption, positioning El Salvador as a key player in the crypto industry. Following the meeting, speculation arose about Strategy potentially moving its headquarters to El Salvador, a move similar to Tether’s recent shift. However, this remains unlikely as the company maintains a strong US presence, where regulatory conditions are improving. Under Bukele’s leadership, El Salvador has established itself as a major Bitcoin holder, while Strategy remains the largest corporate investor in BTC. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Strategy holds 478,740 BTC , while El Salvador’s national reserve currently holds 6,079 BTC.",,EN,0,0,STRK|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-17 07:26:08

In an interview with crypto investigator Coffeezilla today, Hayden claimed that the entire thing spiraled out of his control after President Javier Milei publicly endorsed the token, only for the market to crash almost immediately. Hayden, who described himself as a “launch strategist” rather than the mastermind behind the project, said he has been under intense scrutiny, receiving threats, accusations, and pressure from all sides. He claimed that he never had any intention of running off with the money and is waiting to hear from the Milei administration, but with government officials staying silent, the fate of the funds remains uncertain. Hayden also believes that the way Javier handled the situation is why the token failed, accusing the president of lying when he said he didn’t know much about the project and was just trying to support them like he tends to with small businesses. Both Hayden and Jupiter exchange have said that Javier was in on the creation of $LIBRA right from the beginning, which is around 3 weeks ago. Javier’s endorsement, the market crash, and the vanishing act Javier tweeted his support for $LIBRA on Friday night, triggering a massive speculative rush as investors scrambled to buy into what many assumed was a government-backed meme coin. But within hours, $LIBRA’s value plummeted, wiping out $4.6 billion in what is now the largest crypto rug pull in history. Javier then quickly deleted his tweet and distanced himself from the project, providing a very vague explanation for the sudden turnaround, and he has mostly been silent ever since. The backlash has been intense. Argentinian lawmakers have called for Javier’s impeachment, investors are demanding refunds, and over a dozen law firms have sued him. Not to mention the damage this has done to his reputation. You see, Javier is something of an economic genius, and a libertarian. He has managed to do with Argentina what no president has ever done, which is to actually fix its economy and make the peso “great again,” or maybe just “great,” since realistically, it’s never been great before. Now Javier’s a meme, a joke, and even his closest allies are publicly slamming him. Inside the launch: Snipers, insiders, and allegations of market manipulation Moving on, Hayden admitted that $LIBRA’s launch was plagued by insider trading and sniping, with algorithmic traders and select individuals securing massive allocations before retail investors could react. He described the process as a predatory system where sophisticated traders use bots to buy up large amounts of tokens within milliseconds, artificially inflating prices before dumping their holdings onto unsuspecting buyers. “Every single meme coin launch gets sniped. It’s unavoidable,” Hayden said. “A handful of elite traders figure out how to extract liquidity before the public even has a chance.” But he didn’t deny that insiders had access before the public. Hayden acknowledged that some individuals were aware of the launch in advance and had positioned themselves accordingly. “I can’t say nobody knew,” he admitted. “There were people who were in on it before the public. That’s how every meme coin works.” The sniping issue wasn’t unique to $LIBRA. Other high-profile political meme coins—including the Melania Trump token (which Hayden was also a part of creating)—were also structured in ways that benefited insiders first, according to Hayden. “The biggest guys always win,” he said. $100 million in limbo with no plan to return it The biggest unanswered question is what happens to the $100 million that Hayden is holding. Investors who bought into $LIBRA at its peak want their money back, but Hayden said there is no clear process for refunds. Hayden outlined four possible options for dealing with the funds: No refunds, and instead donate the money to an Argentinian nonprofit. A refund process, though tracking individual losses would be complex and time-consuming. Re-injecting the $100 million into the market, essentially artificially pumping $LIBRA’s price back to its all-time high. A hybrid solution, distributing funds while also supporting the token’s market stability. But Hayden also acknowledged that re-injecting money into the market could create another insider opportunity. If traders knew that a massive buy order was coming, they could purchase the token in advance, ride the price increase, and dump at the peak—repeating the cycle of market manipulation. “If I announce the money is going back in, every trader with a brain is going to buy the dip and profit off it,” Hayden said. “It just creates another insider trading situation.” He also claimed that he can’t hand over the money yet because it’s the only “leverage” he has left in negotiating with government officials. “If I give up control of the money, I lose any power I have in this situation,” he said . “I need answers from Javier’s team before I make a move.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",News|ARS|JUP|LIBRA|SOL,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|JUP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-17 07:28:45

The company is refining its product offerings, updating its website, and adapting to the evolving financial landscape. The move signals a new phase in its development as it seeks to transform how value moves globally. On February 14, Ripple shared its rebranding announcement on X, emphasizing its commitment to innovation in financial transactions. The company highlighted that its vision remains the same—creating seamless value transfer worldwide. A major part of this shift includes the introduction of revised product offerings. Ripple is now streamlining its services to focus on cross-border payments, digital asset custody, and stablecoins to meet rising market demands . Ripple’s payment network, built on the XRP Ledger, enables instant global transactions using both fiat and cryptocurrencies. The company recently strengthened its payment infrastructure through a partnership with Unicâmbio, a Portuguese currency exchange provider. This collaboration enhances money transfers between Portugal and Brazil using blockchain-powered solutions. Following its acquisition of Standard Custody last year, Ripple expanded into digital asset custody, offering secure storage services for banks and fintech firms. The firm sees great potential in this market, estimated to grow to $20 trillion , driven by increasing institutional demand for digital assets. Ripple is also advancing into stablecoins with the launch of Ripple USD (RLUSD). Since its introduction in December, RLUSD has reached a market capitalization of approximately $108.6 million. Reports indicate that the asset has already generated over $3 trillion in trading volume within a month, highlighting significant market interest. As part of its rebrand, Ripple has made notable updates to its website. XRP advocate WrathofKahneman pointed out that all references to Central Bank Digital Currencies ( CBDCs ) have been removed. Ripple had previously engaged in CBDC pilot programs, including one in Palau and the launch of a dedicated CBDC platform in 2023. This change suggests a potential strategic shift, with the company now prioritizing stablecoin adoption over government-backed digital currencies.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|FIAT|XRP|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-17 07:28:54

This acquisition, disclosed in a February 14 SEC filing, highlights the fund’s growing interest in digital assets and positions it as the seventh-largest known holder of IBIT. Mubadala’s investment secured over 8.2 million IBIT shares in the fourth quarter of 2024, marking its first reported position in the ETF . The fund now joins a list of major institutional investors, including Goldman Sachs, Millennium Management, and Symmetry Investments. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that this move reinforces Bitcoin’s increasing adoption among large financial entities. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pointed out that Mubadala is just one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth funds, hinting that other state-backed investment firms might also be exposed to Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts suggest this aligns with the UAE’s broader strategy to establish itself as a global blockchain hub . Abu Dhabi has positioned itself as a prime destination for crypto businesses, introducing progressive regulations that attract industry leaders looking for a supportive investment environment. Mubadala’s decision reflects a wider trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption worldwide. Some policymakers have even proposed that Bitcoin be considered as part of strategic financial reserves. US Senator Cynthia Lummis reacted to Mubadala’s investment by stating that a global Bitcoin race is underway. “I told you the race was on. It’s time for America to win,” she posted on X. Lummis has introduced the Bitcoin Act of 2024, which proposes selling a portion of the US government's gold reserves to acquire Bitcoin. The bill aims to secure 1 million BTC , representing approximately 5% of the total supply. Although the federal government’s stance remains uncertain, multiple US states have taken independent steps toward integrating Bitcoin into their financial systems. Over 20 states have introduced or passed legislation to support cryptocurrency investments. Industry leaders see these efforts as a sign that the US is on track to becoming a leading pro-Bitcoin nation, driven by state-level initiatives and growing institutional interest.",,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BNB|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-17 07:31:40

Can Bulls Save SOL from a Major Breakdown? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market has recorded a bearish pullback this weekend. This resulted in top tokens breaking down their important support trend levels. Following this, the SOL price has recorded a strong downtrend and is on the verge of retesting its crucial support. By evaluating the present market statistics, is this a good time to invest in Solana tokens? In this article, we at CoinPedia have uncovered the possible short-term Solana Price Analysis just for you! SOL Price On The Verge Of A Major Break Down? The price of Solana has dropped 5.71% over the past 24 hours with a trading volume of $2.791 billion, a change of +70.96%. Furthermore, it has lost 9.96% in seven days and 22.35% in the last 30 days. With a market cap of $89.55 billion, it has a market dominance of 2.8008%. TradingView: SOL/USDT The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) records a constant red histogram in the daily time frame. Moreover, the averages record a similar price trend, suggesting an increase in the selling-over-buying pressure for the altcoin in the market. Moreover, the EMA 50-day witnesses a bearish curve with its 200-day average recording a negative crossover in the Solana price chart. This highlights that the SOL token may continue losing momentum. Will SOL Coin Rise Back Up? Maintaining the price above its crucial support level of $181 could result in the Solana price retesting its immediate resistance level of $200. Furthermore, if the bullish sentiment intensifies, this could push the price toward its upper resistance level of $210 this month. On the contrary, if the bears outrun the bulls, the SOL price could retest its support of $181. Moreover, if the bearish sentiment intensifies, this could result in the 06th largest crypto token plunging toward its lower support level of $155 in the coming time.

FAQs How much will 1 Solana be worth in 2025? If the market favors the bulls, the Solana price may reach a maximum trading value of $400 this year. Can Solana hit $1000?

After multiple failed attempts to break key resistance levels despite the previous bullish momentum, the SOL price is now feared to plunge below the multi-month support level, raising concerns over the upcoming price action. One of the major reasons for the downfall is controversy surrounding the ecosystem with scams linked to memecoins like LIBRA, Pumpfun, and Meteora, leading to community concerns. The immense hate towards the memecoins has badly affected the Solana ecosystem, including the SOL price. The total value locked (TVL) has slashed from the highs above $12 billion to $8.9 billion; volume plunged from $35 billion to as low as $2.5 billion, while the number of transactions continues to grow. The above data from Defilama suggests that traders are uncertain about the next price action. The drop in volume suggests there is less demand for the token, while the rise in the transaction suggests a rise in the individual transactions. Besides, the open interest (OI) has also dropped from $6.5B to $4.1B ever since the price faced rejection from its ATH at $296, validating the uncertainty among the market participants. What’s next? Can the Bulls manage to defend the support at $180? Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana Price has been one of the strongest cryptos that has maintained a substantial trend for a long time. Meanwhile, the rise of the memecoins on the platform has circulated bearish waves over the token. The SOL price has broken down from pivotal support, which does not appear to be a part of a healthy ascending trend. The above chart flashes massive bearish signals for the SOL price rally. The price is about to validate a breakdown below the crucial 200-day MA at $183.47 and the OBV is maintaining a descending trend, forming lower highs and lows. The price drop accumulated with a bearish OBV confirms the bearish divergence. Hence, the token that just slipped out of the top 5 is expected to enter the pivotal resistance zone between $181.99 and $178.50. If the bulls fail to hold within the range, a drop below $170 could be imminent for the Solana (SOL) price rally ahead this week.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-17 07:38:15

Finding The Crypto Bluechips Analysts emphasize the importance of identifying projects with real-world utility, strong tokenomics, active development teams, and last, but not least, strong and loyal communities that consistently spread the good word. Unlike vaporware projects and meme coins which rely solely on hype, it’s cryptocurrencies that have a clear use case, a solid roadmap, and partnerships that indicate long-term viability. Researching the team behind the project is crucial—transparent, experienced developers with a history of delivering on promises inspire confidence and reduce the risk of rug pulls. Market timing is also key. Many early-stage projects fly under the radar before gaining mainstream attention. By tracking social sentiment, on-chain data, and presale allocations, investors can get in before these outliers hit the radar of mainstream awareness. Platforms like Solana and Avalanche saw massive runs once their ecosystems matured, rewarding early adopters with generational gains. In addition to this, another key component for surefire success is keeping track of narratives. When DeFi and crypto gaming were hot between 2020 and 2021, most projects in either niche rallied to unprecedented heights, with the likes of Chainlink and Aave leading the charge on the DeFi front. This year’s major narratives are shaping up to be RWA tokenization and AI, with analysts expecting a resurgence of gaming-focused projects as well. This is why, many savvy investors are frontrunning the masses and bidding heavily on Web3 casino Rollblock, which is currently making waves on socials, with them to deliver life-changing returns. With its innovative approach that merges DeFi and online gambling in a unified, first-of-its-kind GambleFi platform, Rollblock promises to change the game forever. Rollblock Is Making Dreams Come True Rollblock is poised to disrupt the $450 billion online gambling industry thanks to its cutting-edge blockchain-native framework. The casino will offer a high-end gambling experience fortified by superior transparency and state-of-the-art security protocols that will make the tampering of bets virtually impossible. Aside from its native token RBLK, Rollblock supports 20 major cryptocurrencies, allowing for greater versatility in payment options. The casino boasts more than 7,000 games, from favorites such as blackjack and roulette to live games, and new, AI-powered titles. More than 50,000 players have already joined the Rollblock ranks and hundreds more are signing up every day. One of the casino’s star features is the novel revenue-sharing mechanism which will allow the community to earn passive income while playing their favorite games. Here’s how it works: Rollblock will reinvest a portion of its weekly profits to buy back RBLK on the open market. 60% of this amount will then be burned creating deflationary pressure which will prime the RBLK token for scarcity-driven growth. The remaining 40% will be redistributed to users as recurring staking rewards, granting some of the highest APY in the space. Stage 10 of the presale is selling out fast and demand is skyrocketing. RBLK tokens are priced at just $0.055, which is the perfect entry point for investors who want to be on the winning side of the GambleFi revolution. By the end of the presale alone, analysts expect an 800% rally and once RBLK hits the markets, the path to 100x will kick off.

He posed the question on X of why BTC isn’t going to be widely adopted and hit seven figures before providing a list of things he expects to see this year. Investor Fred Krueger said the best argument is that Bitcoin doesn’t scale. However, wrapped versions of it on other chains do, he added. “It can be wrapped to interoperate with all sorts of systems. In a way, the ETFs are a wrapper that abstracts custody/trading, and port into traditional financial accounts,” agreed Horsley. What’s the current best argument for why Bitcoin isn’t going to be widely adopted and go to $1M? I see more and more evidence of why it will, and less and less of why it won’t. — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) February 17, 2025 Bitcoin in 2025 The Bitwise boss provided a list of things he expects to see in 2025 that will accelerate the adoption of BTC. There will be more flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, he said. The eleven products in the United States have already seen a cumulative $40 billion in inflows since they launched just over a year ago. Horsley predicted that more corporations and more nation-states would also start buying BTC in 2025. There are already 22 US states that have filed legislation to enable their treasuries to invest in Bitcoin and crypto. US wealth management firms will be buying the asset for their clients while banks and financial institutions will launch services to help clients access Bitcoin, he predicted. Regulators will create “productive clarity” while global geopolitics and monetary policy will “increase in circumstances that drive the need for Bitcoin,” he said. “You’re going to see more reputable people revealing their conviction in Bitcoin,” he said before concluding, “It’s going to be a watershed year.” Bitcoin educator and investor Mark Moss concurred, stating that “this cycle is much different than the last ones,” before adding that there is ETF demand, sovereign buyers, and corporate treasuries. “New money is absorbing supply at scale.” Everyone’s worried about when to sell Bitcoin when they should be worried about never owning enough. This cycle is much different than the last ones. ETF demand. Sovereign buyers. Corporate treasuries. New money is absorbing supply at scale. Since the last “halving” supply… — Mark Moss (@1MarkMoss) February 17, 2025 BTC Price Outlook At the moment, Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim six figures, let alone get anywhere near a seven-digit valuation. The asset has shed 1.5% from its weekend highs to dip below $96,000 during the Monday trading session in Asia. Volatility has dwindled and the asset has entered a tight trading range over the past fortnight, however, it continues to test support as observed by analysts. #BTC Bitcoin continues to find stability at the blue diagonal trendline support The light blue level of $97700 continues to act as resistance but BTC is one Daily Close and successful retest of it into new support away from a rally to $101k (black) $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/ZfOTFwR9zy pic.twitter.com/s0M1O1RqX5 — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) February 15, 2025 The post Massive Bitcoin Price Prediction from Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitwise,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|ASIA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-02-17 07:55:12

According to the Bitcoin analyst Julian Fahrer by the end of 2024, 12 states have reported owning a total of $330 million in Strategy stock. This includes major pension funds in California, Florida, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. These investments are helping states indirectly gain exposure to Bitcoin, as Strategy’s massive Bitcoin holdings make it a proxy for investing in the cryptocurrency . International public funds also holding $MSTR : Canada: Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan ($15m) South Korea: National Pension Service ($63m) — Julian Fahrer (@Julian__Fahrer) February 16, 2025 California Leads with Largest Bitcoin-Backed Holdings California is the largest state investor in Strategy, with its State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) holding 285,785 shares worth around $83 million. Other California state funds, such as the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), also have significant investments in Strategy. CalPERS holds 264,713 shares, valued at $76 million. These funds have become heavily involved with Strategy as the company’s business model focuses on Bitcoin acquisition , making its stock a popular choice for states looking to capitalize on the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. Julian Fahrer also noted that international public funds are also holding significant amounts of Strategy’s stock. These include the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan in Canada, with $15 million in MSTR, and South Korea’s National Pension Service, holding $63 million. Strategy’s Bitcoin Playbook and Recent Gains Strategy is not just an ordinary tech company—it has a massive Bitcoin treasury. As of February 2025, it holds 478,740 Bitcoins , worth an estimated $46 billion. Recently, the company acquired 7,633 additional Bitcoins, which cost around $742 million. This strategy of accumulating Bitcoin has proven profitable for the company, with its stock gaining 16.5% in early 2025 and a massive 383% over the past year, far outperforming the broader crypto market. A Risky but Rewarding Bet on Bitcoin Despite its success, Strategy has also faced challenges. In its Q4 2024 earnings report, the company revealed a $670.8 million loss due to a $1 billion impairment charge on its Bitcoin holdings. These losses highlight the risks associated with such a large investment in a volatile asset like Bitcoin. However, Strategy remains confident in its long-term Bitcoin strategy, which is central to its corporate vision. The company is also pushing forward with its “ 21/21 plan ,” aiming to raise $42 billion over the next three years to further expand its Bitcoin investments. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Metaplanet Boosts Bitcoin Holdings to $159M Amid Japan’s Economic Struggles , Why States Are Investing in Strategy For many states, investing in Strategy allows states to gain Bitcoin exposure indirectly, offering a potential way to benefit from Bitcoin’s rise without directly buying the cryptocurrency. Looking at the increasing Bitcoin potential, West Virginia Senator Chris Rose recently introduced the Inflation Protection Act of 2025, which would allow the state treasury to invest in digital assets like crypto and precious metals. This move follows a trend sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President who set up a group to explore a federal digital asset reserve. States like Utah and Kentucky are also making strides in this direction. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

But while Cardano holders celebrate, smart investors are marching towards Panshibi for obvious reasons. The stats don’t stutter! This new viral panda token is making waves with its high-energy presale, which has amassed close to $1M within 4 weeks of its presale. The meteoric rise of Panshibi – a project built on ERC20 coins – has captured the imagination of investors looking for high-growth prospects compared to what Cardano has to offer. The burning question is: Which will deliver in the bull market? Let’s dig in! Panshibi: The viral panda-themed new crypto with explosive potential While Panshibi is a meme coin, its new crypto movement isn’t just about hype but real utility, smart innovation, and explosive growth potential. Over the years, several meme tokens have popped, but this one? It’s different! This new altcoin is different because it’s got both strong tokenomics and actual use cases that make it more than just an internet joke. Panshibi is Inspired by the iconic panda and infused with Asian cultural elements, making it one of the most talked-about projects for 2025. With a Social-Fi and AI ecosystem, the Panshibi project extends beyond just being a token. Token holders get a chance to belong to an inclusive AI-driven social-fi ecosystem that offers limitless possibilities. The crypto team behind Panshibi isn’t just hoping for a pump; they’re investing in a project designed to last. They believe the main problem with meme token adoption is its unsustainable operation over time. Often, meme coins crash because they offer nothing beyond speculative trading. Again, Panshibi is different in these aspects! With a ten-year liquidity lock and two-team token lock, Panshibi provides security and stability that many competitors lack. This long-term vision prevents early adopters from facing the same pump-and-dump schemes that have plagued the meme coin space. Cardano price prediction: Grayscale’s ETF bet sends price soaring to $1.3 Many altcoins, like Cardano (ADA), have posted impressive price recoveries recently despite Bitcoin struggling to maintain the psychological $100,000. Recently, ADA’s positive momentum was boosted by developments involving exchange-traded funds impacting the altcoins. Crypto investment company Grayscale reportedly filed for a Cardano-focused ETF, boosting the altcoins’ performance with a whopping 11% gain. With the application for a Cardano ETF, Grayscale is positioning itself to expand ADA’s offerings, attract institutional interest and buck up use cases for the altcoin. With the latest Cardano price prediction, ADA is expected to ride this positive wave to the $1.3 psychological level. While ADA is still down from its peak of $1 in mid-February, its recent price action has left the market speculating that a continued bullish trend could be on the horizon, especially if the ETF gains approval from the SEC. Early Panshibi investors get the whole package: Act now! Cardano’s recent ecosystem wins have been astonishing! However, it’s nowhere near the potential of Panshibi . Investors and holders earn a whopping 1200% APY on its stake-to-earn program, in-platform rewards and exclusive VIP perks. After raising close to $1M, the Panshibi presale is nearing its next crypto milestone, signaling strong investor confidence. The presale consists of 15 stages, each increasing the price and handing significant gains to investors. Currently, at presale stage 4, Panshibi tokens are available on their official website at a discount of $0.005. During the presale, the price will increase by 1,200%, allowing early investors to benefit from a structured and predictable rise in value. Crypto gurus’ predictions suggest a 145,000% jump post-launch, making Panshibi the breakout star of 2025.

Reddit Investor Gives Insight",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/dogecoin-price-struggles-to-recover-from-recent-35-downturn/,"The post Stick With DOGE or Make 8,200% With Viral Alternative? Reddit Investor Gives Insight appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Dogecoin price’s 35% monthly decline has sparked fresh debates about the long-term viability of meme-driven assets. As DOGE struggles to hold above $0.27, traders are shifting focus toward platforms blending innovation with real-world utility. Meme coins, while culturally resonant, face growing skepticism due to their reliance on hype over technical progress. This has led many to explore emerging projects with audited frameworks and hybrid trading models. Among them, a new DeFi platform has captured attention after raising $14.6 million in its presale. Its unique approach could redefine how retail and institutional traders interact, positioning it as a potential game-changer ahead of its Q2 debut. Dogecoin Price Struggles to Recover From Recent 35% Downturn The Dogecoin price has faced challenges regaining momentum after a steep 35% drop over the past month. Despite a modest 5.5% rise in weekly charts, DOGE remains stuck below the $0.30 resistance level, trading near $0.27 as selling pressure builds. This downturn reflects broader caution in the meme coin sector, where volumes have dipped alongside fading retail enthusiasm. While DOGE’s long-term community support remains strong, its reliance on social sentiment exposes it during turbulent periods. Experts think the project’s limited technical upgrades could further exacerbate the situation, making it harder for DOGE to compete with tokens offering clearer utility. Source: Dogecoin Price, CoinMarketCap In contrast, newer platforms are attracting attention by blending memetic appeal with real-world use cases. For instance, projects emphasizing decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure or hybrid trading models are gaining favor as investors seek stability. Pepe and Shiba Inu Momentum Falters as Meme Coin Sector Slows Pepe and Shiba Inu have mirrored the Dogecoin price struggles, with both tokens failing to revive the explosive momentum that once defined the meme coin market. Shiba Inu’s 22% monthly decline aligns with a sector-wide correction, signaling that traders are rotating capital into assets with clearer roadmaps. Even Pepe, which briefly rallied in June, has seen trading volumes slump as its novelty wears thin. This slowdown highlights the risks of overexposure to projects driven primarily by social hype rather than technical milestones. Industry watchers note that meme coins often face sharper drops during unstable markets due to their reliance on speculative trading. Source: PEPE and Shiba Inu Price, CoinMarketCap While Shiba Inu’s developers continue expanding its ecosystem, progress has yet to translate into sustained price action. Similarly, Pepe’s lack of major partnerships or protocol upgrades limits its appeal beyond short-term speculation. Meanwhile, platforms combining decentralized governance with institutional-grade tools are becoming increasingly attractive. Analysts say projects emphasizing transparency, security, and multi-asset support could outperform meme coins in the coming months. DTX Exchange Gains Traction With Hybrid Model and $14.6M Presale Surge As the Dogecoin price and other meme coins navigate a rough period, DTX Exchange is emerging as a standout contender in the altcoin space. The project’s hybrid trading platform, which unites decentralized and traditional finance, has driven its presale to a staggering $14.6 million. Priced at $0.18 during its bonus stage, DTX tokens offer early access to a platform set to launch in Q2 with support for over 120,000 assets. Unlike meme coins, DTX Exchange prioritizes a research-driven approach, focusing on low fees, high-speed transactions, and regulatory compliance. Third-party audits by firms like SolidProof add credibility to its security promises, addressing concerns common in smaller projects. Market observers highlight DTX’s democratized presale structure as a key differentiator. By reserving tokens for retail investors—not just institutions—the project has cultivated a grassroots following. Experts think this strategy could fuel rapid adoption post-launch, especially as traders seek alternatives to underperforming assets like Dogecoin. While past performance never guarantees future results, DTX’s unique value proposition positions it among the top crypto coins to watch. Conclusion As Dogecoin price faces uncertainty and meme coins struggle to regain momentum, alternative projects are drawing fresh capital from cautious investors. With DOGE consolidating below key resistance levels, analysts believe platforms offering tangible utility could lead the next market cycle. The DTX Exchange ’s hybrid trading model and audited infrastructure position it as a compelling option amid shifting trends. Industry voices suggest early participation in its presale might offer unique advantages ahead of the Q2 launch.

In a strategy session, pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 65,700 YouTube subscribers that BTC bears had many chances to drive prices lower in the past weeks after President Donald Trump restarted trade war talks and considered acquiring other countries. According to the crypto strategist, any of those headlines could have catalyzed a deeper Bitcoin correction. But DonAlt says the fact that BTC is still trading above $90,000 despite an onslaught of bearish news makes him believe that Bitcoin is gearing up for much higher prices. “I’m not bearish. My gut feeling is that this resolves to the upside, but I also acknowledge that as long as we’re trading below $101,000 or below the weekly mid-range [around $98,000], TA (technical analysis)-wise slightly leaning bearish. I just don’t necessarily think it’s very conclusive, especially given how strong the uptrend has been and how weak the sell-off has been considering that Trump has basically been throwing around tariffs, been talking about annexing Canada [and] Greenland… You can make a list and if you threw any of these items on that list at me two or three years ago, and you asked me, ‘Hey, how are markets looking?’ I’d be like ‘Everything is dead, you know.’ [But] then nothing has happened. It’s barely led to any sell-off, so it’s hard for me to be too bearish. I think just generally, it makes sense to be either neutral and wait for the momentum or be bullish even though the TA is not necessarily too bullish right now.” Source: DonAlt/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $96,310, down 1.43% in the past day.

In contrast, PEPE and TRUMP tokens are experiencing sharp declines, losing double-digit percentages. Meanwhile, a new contender called XYZ is making waves by surpassing $7 million during its presale phase. What’s driving these contrasting fortunes in the cryptocurrency market? XYZ’s Rise to Glory: The Meme Coin Fighter Punching Through the Crypto Arena XYZVerse is the next heavyweight champion of meme coins. Crowned Best NEW Meme Project , it blends the electric energy of sports with meme culture, drawing in millions of fans who want to be part of something bigger. Every great story needs a hero. Not the biggest, not the strongest—just the one crazy enough to keep pushing forward. That’s XYZepe , the masked fighter, the die-hard believer, and the relentless holder of $XYZ . His mission is to bring XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap and carve XYZ into crypto history. In response, the CMC community is totally behind this future champ: 95% are super bullish on $XYZ. But greatness isn’t handed out—it’s earned in the ring. $XYZ has already passed through 9 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a mindblowing take off. Undervalued at $0.002, $XYZ is a bet worth making. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the start of something legendary. XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? Dogecoin: From Meme to Mainstream – Is the Doge Still Barking? Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun take on cryptocurrencies. It used the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there is no cap on how many can exist. Initially seen as a joke, Dogecoin’s value soared in 2021. It climbed into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with its total value surpassing $50 billion. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, helped fuel this rise. The coin’s creators, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, meant it as a light-hearted project. But it quickly showed the power of community and social media in financial markets. As for its potential, Dogecoin relies on its strong online community. Its technology is similar to other cryptocurrencies, but it doesn’t offer unique features like smart contracts. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as a risky but exciting asset. Other coins, like Ethereum, have more established uses and technologies. Market trends show that social media can greatly impact Dogecoin’s price. So, whether it’s attractive depends on one’s appetite for risk and belief in the community driving it. PEPE Coin Soars: How a Frog Meme Became a Billion-Dollar Cryptocurrency PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum, inspired by the popular Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Aiming to join the ranks of meme-based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE embraces its meme origins without pretense. With no taxes and no promises of utility, it keeps things simple and appeals to the fun-loving side of the crypto community. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap reaching a staggering $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive returns, and a strong community of enthusiasts rallied behind it. This frenzy sparked what some call a “memecoin season,” with new meme-based tokens popping up and experiencing wild price swings. As the crypto world anticipates the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, many are watching to see if PEPE will reach new heights. Its roadmap includes ambitious goals like listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover,” suggesting that PEPE isn’t just a fleeting fad. In the unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, PEPE stands out as a symbol of the power of internet culture and community-driven success. Trump Coin ($TRUMP) Surges to $15 Billion Market Cap Before Pullback Trump Coin ($TRUMP), a newly launched meme coin backed by President-elect Donald Trump, quickly surged in value, reaching a peak market capitalization of $15 billion early Sunday before settling around $9 billion. The token, built on the Solana blockchain, saw an explosive 300% gain within hours of its release, briefly trading above $75 per coin. Despite its rapid rise and subsequent pullback, $TRUMP remains a significant player in the meme coin space, leveraging Trump’s branding power ahead of his inauguration. With an initial 200 million coin supply, developers plan to gradually expand circulation to 1 billion tokens over three years. However, 80% of the total supply remains locked, controlled by CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, two Trump-affiliated entities set to earn revenue from trading activity. While the coin’s website states that $TRUMP is not an investment or political asset, its association with Trump has fueled speculation and investor interest, positioning it as a unique crossover between crypto, branding, and political influence. Conclusion While DOGE, PEPE, and TRUMP show positive signs, XYZ stands out as an all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and targeting notable growth with its community-driven platform.

On that note, Milei supported the newly launched memecoin LIBRA by posting on X a few days ago. Following Milei’s recommendation, the token rose to nearly $5 before falling below $1 within hours. This sharp decline has led to allegations of a potential “rug pull and scam,” a scheme in which developers increase the value of a token before abandoning it. As the controversy surrounding Milei and LIBRA continues, blockchain analysis platform Bubblemaps has claimed that the team behind the launch of Trump’s wife Melania Trump’s own token, the MELANIA memecoin, is also behind the Libra (LIBRA) token. Bubblemaps analysts have stated that they are very confident in the evidence that the LIBRA memecoin was launched by the same team that launched MELANIA. At this point, it was reported that the addresses associated with the creation of the MELANIA token were also associated with the controversial token LIBRA. Analysts said the detected relationship means that MELANI’s creator or someone close to its team is blocking its own launch. “The same team is behind LIBRA, MELANIA and other short-lived tokens. After analyzing cross-chain transfers and timing patterns, we are fairly confident that this prediction is correct. It all started with our investigation into sniper activity on MELANIA. One address stood out: address P5tb4, which made over $2.4 million in profits, sent all of its profits to 0xcEA, a wallet associated with the creator of MELANIA. There are multiple ways to connect 0xcEA to the creator of MELANIA, including fund transfers and cross-chain transfers, and we’re confident these are no coincidences. This means that Melania's creator or someone close to her team may have been personally involved in the attack on her own project's launch. A few weeks later, we realized that 0xcEA was funding DEfcyK, the creator of LIBRA, who withdrew 87 million LIBRA.” Analysts also recently noted that they detected many tokens associated with the suspicious “0xcEA” address, saying that most of them were clearly pump and dump. Examples of these were “TRUST, KACY, VIBES and HOOD.” 1/ How $LIBRA was created by the same team behind MELANIA and other short-lived coins Featuring new onchain evidence A thread with Coffeezilla ↓ pic.twitter.com/gNwj97KapF — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) February 17, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen some interesting price movements recently. Over the past week, its price rose by 4.50%. However, in the last month, it dropped by 22.19%. Looking back six months, SHIB’s price is up by 24.65%. Currently, SHIB trades between $0.0000125 and $0.0000178. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0000200. If it breaks this level, the next target could be $0.0000254, which is about a 42% increase from current prices. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.00000939. If the price falls below this, it may find support around $0.000004040. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.0000166, slightly above the 100-day average of $0.0000160. This suggests a short-term upward trend. The relative strength index is at 50.70, indicating a neutral market. The stochastic oscillator is low at 8.81, which may mean SHIB is oversold. This could lead to a price increase soon. The MACD level is positive at 0.0000001193, hinting at possible bullish momentum.

Injective (INJ) Poised for Growth with Key Resistance in Sight Injective’s current price ranges between $11.57 and $16.13, showing promising signs. The recent 1-week increase of 7.62% suggests upward momentum. With a 10-day simple moving average at $14.97, it sits slightly above the 100-day average of $14.54, indicating potential growth. The Relative Strength Index of 55.28 reflects balanced trade activity, neither overbought nor oversold. Nearest resistance is at $18.52. If INJ can break this level, it might target $23.08, an over 40% potential rise from some current prices. The nearest support is $9.39, providing a fallback cushion. This setup hints at a possible upward journey, aligning well with altcoin enthusiasts’ hopes for a broader crypto upswing. Uniswap (UNI) Set for an Enthralling Price Dance Uniswap’s present price between $7.33 and $10.58 is thrilling to observe. With an impressive 6-month gain of almost 48%, UNI displays growth potential. It’s teetering near its 10-day and 100-day moving averages, hinting at a possible bullish rally. A fall below $9, however, signals caution. If bullish energy persists, UNI may target the $12.03 resistance. If it gains further momentum, a climb near the $15.28 mark could spell gains of up to 44%. Yet its current RSI sitting at 47.23, along with a negative MACD, indicates a chance of sideways movement. Watch closely, as the crypto market’s dynamic nature can flip narratives swiftly. CWIF’s Bounce Back Potential in the Altcoin Surge CWIF hovers between $0.0000001030 and $0.000000137, facing a resistance at $0.0000001579. It’s been a rough ride with a 1-month tumble of 46.46%, but it’s near a crucial support level at $0.0000000900. The RSI of 35.01 suggests it’s oversold, indicating a potential rebound. If it surges past the first resistance, we could see it climb towards $0.0000001920, a possible gain. However, lingering below the 100-day SMA shows there’s work to do. A 20.63 stochastic hints at upward momentum forming. If the altcoin season indeed kicks off, CWIF might just catch a lift. Raydium (RAY) Price Eyes Potential Gains Amidst Market Trends Raydium’s price is moving between $3.72 and $6.17. It shows a dynamic market pattern. In the last month, RAY’s price climbed over 10%. In six months, it jumped more than 200%. Such growth hints RAY might rise more if trends continue. The coin faces a resistance level near $7.62. If it surpasses this, reaching $10 is possible. That’s over a 60% increase from the upper range. Support is strong at $2.71. Technical indicators are mixed, but the general trend looks positive. If the altcoin season hits, Raydium could soar. Investors who see potential in RAY might want to watch its journey closely. Conclusion While INJ, UNI, CWIF, and RAY offer promising features, their short-term potential is limited. In contrast, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a 700% ROI potential in its presale, triple utility features, and a mission to unite crypto enthusiasts, Catzilla invites participation in the battle against crypto villains.

PNUT Poised for Potential Surge Despite Recent Dips Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) shows signs of potential growth, trading between $0.13-$0.21. Despite recent dips, it’s near a key support at $0.09. The RSI suggests it’s not overbought, indicating room for upward movement. If momentum builds, PNUT might target the $0.25 resistance, a potential rise of nearly 43%. Breaking through could see it challenge the $0.33 level, a further increase of about 138% from current low ranges. Although down 18% this week and over 74% for the month, the market conditions hint at an upcoming opportunity for crypto enthusiasts. Altcoin season could play a big role in helping PNUT rebound. Keep a close eye on this promising coin. Conclusion While coins like PNUT may have less short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as a meme coin aiming to bring financial freedom to all. Offering a potential 700% ROI during its presale—from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages—it provides governance features, loyalty rewards, and staking options, uniting enthusiasts to challenge restrictive systems.

At the same time, the XYZ token’s presale is rapidly gaining traction, exceeding $7 million in investments. These simultaneous events are capturing attention, hinting at potential big moves in the cryptocurrency market that could interest keen observers and investors alike. XYZ: The Next Meme Coin Champion Ready to Dominate 2025 The game is on, and XYZ is here to generate record profits with unstoppable momentum! This sensational all-sports meme token is poised to become the next big thing in 2025, capturing the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and sports fans worldwide. As it charges ahead, XYZ is set to deliver jaw-dropping gains, leaving the likes of BOME and WIF far behind. With eyes on a staggering 7,400% growth , XYZ is ready to claim the meme coin crown in the 2025 crypto bull marathon! Rule the game, cash in as the bets roll in XYZ is the star player in XYZVerse – an award-winning meme coin project that blends the sports thrill and meme culture. This community-centered ecosystem is the perfect playground for crypto enthusiasts and sports fans alike.

XYZ is currently undervalued , and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Be Part of the 2025 Breakout Story—XYZ Is Waiting for You! Dogecoin: From Meme to Mainstream – Is the Doge Still Barking? Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun take on cryptocurrencies. It used the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there is no cap on how many can exist. Initially seen as a joke, Dogecoin’s value soared in 2021. It climbed into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with its total value surpassing $50 billion. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, helped fuel this rise. The coin’s creators, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, meant it as a light-hearted project. But it quickly showed the power of community and social media in financial markets. As for its potential, Dogecoin relies on its strong online community. Its technology is similar to other cryptocurrencies, but it doesn’t offer unique features like smart contracts. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as a risky but exciting asset. Other coins, like Ethereum, have more established uses and technologies. Market trends show that social media can greatly impact Dogecoin’s price. So, whether it’s attractive depends on one’s appetite for risk and belief in the community driving it. Conclusion DOGE shows potential for a major breakout, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its sports-themed ecosystem and community-driven approach.

Five particular coins are approaching crucial price thresholds that could signal a significant upward movement. Monitoring these levels could provide insight into an impending surge. An exploration of these cryptos may reveal whether a recovery is on the horizon. $XYZ Targets 99,900% Growth, Unlocking G.O.A.T. Status XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality , the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors and rocket to the moon on Elon Musk’s mission. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price : $0.0001 Price Now : $0.002 In just a couple of months, $XYZ already soared over 2000%!

POL: Unlocking New Possibilities in the Polygon Ecosystem The Polygon Ecosystem Token, or POL, is a utility token at the heart of the Polygon network. It empowers users to stake their tokens, locking them up to support the network’s security and operations. In return, stakers earn rewards and gain a voice in the network’s governance. This means they can vote on proposals that shape the future of Polygon, ensuring the community’s interests are at the forefront. POL also grants access to exclusive services within the ecosystem, opening doors to unique features and benefits. As the Polygon network expands, the potential of POL grows with it. The increasing number of applications and services boosts the demand for the token. In the current market cycle, where utility and community involvement are highly valued, POL stands out among other cryptocurrencies. Its combination of staking rewards, governance participation, and exclusive access makes it an attractive option for those interested in the crypto space. With market trends favoring tokens that offer real-world use cases, POL’s future looks promising compared to its peers. Sui: A New Era of User-Friendly Blockchain Sui is a new blockchain platform designed to make digital interactions easy and secure. It aims to support global use by being fast and reliable. Sui uses a special way of handling data and a safe programming language called Move. These tools help fix problems that other blockchains often face, like slow speeds and inefficiency. In today’s market, Sui looks promising because it focuses on the user experience. It introduces features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions to make blockchain apps more accessible. Unlike some coins that are hard to use or slow, Sui offers simplicity and speed. This makes it attractive to both developers and users. As the demand for user-friendly blockchain solutions grows, Sui could become a strong player in the crypto world. SEI: Speeding Up Trading with a New Kind of Blockchain Imagine a road built just for fast cars. That’s what SEI is for trading. It’s the first blockchain designed specifically for exchanges, giving them a special advantage. SEI can handle a huge number of orders every second. Transactions are finalized in just 380 milliseconds. Big institutions help keep it secure, and security is a top priority for SEI. What does this mean for investors? Some say SEI’s value could soar by over 300% by 2030. Its focus on speed and security sets it apart from other coins. In today’s market, where quick and safe trading is key, SEI stands out. While other coins offer different features, SEI’s trading specialization makes it unique. It could be an attractive option in the current market cycle. Keep an eye on SEI as it might be the next big thing in blockchain trading. Ondo Finance: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Innovation Ondo Finance is changing the way people access high-quality financial products. By bringing together the reliability of traditional finance and the efficiency of blockchain technology, Ondo is making stable, income-generating assets available to everyone. They tokenize real-world assets like U.S. Treasuries, turning them into digital tokens that can be easily traded and managed on the blockchain. This approach opens doors for more people to invest in assets that were once hard to reach. What sets Ondo apart is its focus on trust and security. In the often uncertain world of cryptocurrencies, Ondo collaborates with well-known partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for securing crypto assets. They are committed to transparency and compliance with legal regulations. Their product USDY is a highlight—it offers the stability of a stablecoin with the added benefit of yield from U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits, especially for non-U.S. investors. In the current market, where investors are seeking safe and reliable options, Ondo’s blend of traditional finance and blockchain might be appealing. Compared to other coins, Ondo offers a unique proposition by connecting real-world assets with the digital economy, potentially providing a stable and attractive investment opportunity. Conclusion POL, SUI, SEI, and ONDO must hold key levels, but XYZVerse (XYZ) pioneers an all-sport memecoin aiming for significant growth with its unique sports-meme ecosystem.

There’s a buzz among investors about its potential for massive gains, possibly echoing the astonishing rise of earlier viral tokens. Could this be the next significant opportunity in the crypto market? The momentum suggests something big might be on the horizon. XYZVerse: The Best New Meme Project You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where crypto enthusiasts can score big off the growing demand for meme coins. But every revolution needs a hero—someone willing to fight against the odds and push the $XYZ token to the top. That hero is XYZepe , the masked fighter, the true believer, the relentless $XYZ holder whose mission is to bring XYZVerse to the #1 spot on CoinMarketCap. It’s about proving that underdogs can rise to greatness. With millions of sports fans ready to hit the field, the XYZVerse ecosystem is set to keep expanding—and your rewards will slam dunk through the roof! And here’s a highlight reel moment: XYZVerse has been officially recognized as the Best NEW Meme Project—a title that underscores its explosive potential in the meme coin arena. XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion! Meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is set to crush the competition. Currently priced at $0.002, $XYZ remains an undervalued crypto gem poised to rise to $0.1 at the final presale stage. But victory doesn’t happen overnight—it takes dedication, strategy, and a fighter willing to go the distance. XYZepe knows the battle ahead, but with the community behind him, he’s taking $XYZ to legendary status. With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, rock-solid defense in the form of audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ is already ahead of the game. The first-mover advantage is key here—get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! XYZepe is fighting for glory—will you stand with him? Shiba Inu Coin: The Meme Token Tapping into Ethereum’s Potential Shiba Inu Coin, known by its ticker SHIB, is a digital currency that started as a fun experiment inspired by Dogecoin. But unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with a wide range of applications and technologies. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator called Ryoshi, SHIB began with a massive supply of tokens—one quadrillion, to be exact. In a surprising move, half of these tokens were sent to Vitalik Buterin, one of Ethereum’s founders. Buterin donated a large portion to help with COVID-19 relief in India and burned the rest, effectively removing them from circulation. This act brought a lot of attention to SHIB. SHIB isn’t just resting on its meme status. Its integration with Ethereum allows it to support projects like ShibaSwap, a place where people can trade SHIB and other tokens without a central authority. There are also plans for a platform involving unique digital art pieces called NFTs, and a system where SHIB owners can have a say in decisions. These developments could make SHIB more useful and interesting to crypto enthusiasts. In the current market, where people are looking for coins with real-world applications, SHIB’s growth on the Ethereum network might make it stand out from other meme tokens. Its potential for new features and uses could be attractive to those keeping an eye on emerging trends in the crypto space. Conclusion SHIB and other coins have shown remarkable growth, but XYZVerse’s unique blend of sports and meme culture positions $XYZ for even greater success in the current 2025 bull run.

XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? Jupiter: Solana’s Leading DEX Aggregator Transforming DeFi Trading Jupiter is one of the most popular decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators in the Solana ecosystem. It simplifies token swaps by pooling resources from various liquidity pools, ensuring users get the best prices available. By addressing the issue of price discrepancies across different DEXs, Jupiter enhances trading efficiency and minimizes the loss of value during transactions. Beyond aggregation, Jupiter has expanded its functionality to include perpetual futures, decentralized stablecoin management, and its LFG launchpad, which supports new Solana projects in getting off the ground. The potential introduction of a native token, JUP, could further boost Jupiter’s ecosystem. A governance token like JUP would allow users to have a say in important decisions such as liquidity plans, token issuance, and other ecosystem-related projects. By staking or locking their tokens, users could participate in governance and possibly receive yields in return. In the current market cycle, a token like JUP could be attractive to investors looking for projects that empower community participation and offer practical solutions to DeFi challenges. Compared to other coins, JUP’s focus on governance and direct utility within a thriving platform could make it a standout in the Solana ecosystem. NEAR Protocol: Sharding the Path to Scalable Decentralized Apps NEAR Protocol is a blockchain platform designed to help developers build decentralized applications with ease. Founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, it has raised over $20 million from major venture firms. NEAR uses a technique called sharding to improve efficiency and scalability. This means the network is divided into smaller parts, allowing it to handle more transactions at once. Operating on a distributed network, NEAR offers the benefits of centralized data storage systems but without central control. What sets NEAR apart are its innovative features like Nightshade sharding, the Rainbow Bridge, and Aurora. Nightshade allows the network to scale seamlessly as more users join. The Rainbow Bridge enables easy transfer of tokens from Ethereum, making NEAR compatible with existing assets. Aurora, a Layer 2 solution, uses Ethereum’s technology for better performance and lower fees. In a market where many coins face issues like high fees and slow transactions, NEAR’s focus on scalability makes it stand out. With the growing demand for decentralized applications, NEAR’s technology positions it as a promising player in the blockchain space. MANTRA: Bridging Security and Compliance in the Blockchain World Meet MANTRA, a groundbreaking Layer 1 blockchain with security at its core. Built using the Cosmos SDK and compatible with IBC and CosmWasm, MANTRA offers a permissionless blockchain for permissioned applications, adhering to real-world regulatory requirements. Secured by a sovereign Proof-of-Stake validator set and scalable up to 10,000 transactions per second, it’s designed for institutions and developers alike. MANTRA provides built-in modules, SDKs, and APIs to create, trade, and manage regulatory-compliant real-world assets, all while improving user experience to onboard non-native users and institutions into the Web3 ecosystem. In today’s market, where compliance and scalability are essential, MANTRA’s focus on regulatory adherence and high throughput makes it stand out. Its unique approach of combining permissionless blockchain with permissioned applications sets it apart from other platforms. As institutions seek secure and compliant blockchain solutions, MANTRA’s innovative technology could make its native coin, OM, appealing. While the crypto space is competitive, MANTRA’s emphasis on real-world asset management and user-friendly onboarding aligns with current trends, potentially positioning OM favorably in this market cycle. Conclusion While JUP, NEAR, and OM are promising, XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin uniting fans and aiming for 20,000% growth.

Grayscale’s potential approval for a spot ADA ETF in the US could be a major catalyst, offering regulated exposure and boosting demand for the asset. Is ADA Gearing up for a Massive Rally? The cryptocurrency market has experienced a setback in the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many more leading assets charting losses. One of the few that has remained in green territory is Cardano’s ADA. The token is up around 3% for the day and currently trades at roughly $0.80 (per CoinGecko’s data). ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko According to many industry participants, the resurgence has yet to reach new dimensions. The X user Sssebi thinks ADA needs to climb to a higher high to sustain the bullish momentum. “Otherwise, we could be forming a head and shoulders,” they assumed CryptoBull_360 also weighed in, claiming that ADA could retest the broadening wedge breakout zone in the 4-hour time frame. The analyst argued that trading volume has been increasing, setting a target of over $1 for the following weeks. One of the most optimistic predictions came from SlumDOGE Millionaire. The X user told their nearly 400,000 followers on the social media platform that ADA could hit at least $10 in 2025. It is important to note that such a price explosion would require the asset’s market capitalization to soar to over $350 billion. As of the moment, this seems quite implausible, considering that the current figure stands below $30 billion. Grayscale’s Potential Effect A major factor that could positively impact the token’s price in the long term is Grayscale’s possible approval of its application to launch a spot ADA exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. The investment vehicle (if it receives the necessary green light) will provide people with a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to Cardano’s native token without needing to hold the asset directly. The US SEC, under its new management team, has already started taking a different approach toward the cryptocurrency sector, and an approval wouldn’t be considered a surprise. According to Polymarket, the odds of such a development seeing the light of day before the end of the year are 58%.

CZ X also stated that he will donate 150 BNB ($100,000) to support users affected by the price drop of the LIBRA token. This token was allegedly a rug pull. The token was once introduced on X by Argentine president Javier Milei, but he later deleted his post, stating that he did not fully understand the details of the project. CZ’s move came in response to an announcement by university student EnHeng, who accepted donations through her BSC address and decided to donate $50,000 to support LIBRA victims. “Today, the Argentine President's circulation of Rug money hurt many people.

40445725,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129401,1739784511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Visionary CZ’s Clarity: No Hype for AI Agent Tokens, Just Blockchain’s Real Potential",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cz-clarifies-ai-agent-tokens/,"In a surprising turn amidst the burgeoning hype around AI in crypto, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, has stepped forward to set the record straight. Are you caught up in the whirlwind of new AI agent tokens and wondering where the industry’s leaders stand? CZ, a prominent voice in the crypto space, recently addressed speculation regarding his stance on these trending digital assets. Let’s dive into what CZ had to say and unpack the implications for the future of AI Agent Tokens and blockchain technology. CZ Sets the Record Straight on AI Agent Tokens: No Endorsement, Just Keen Interest CZ took to X (formerly Twitter) to directly address rumors suggesting he was actively promoting or endorsing specific AI Agent Tokens . His message was clear and concise: he is not currently backing any particular token in this niche. This statement comes as a crucial clarification, especially given CZ’s influential position in the cryptocurrency world. Any hint of endorsement from him could significantly impact market trends and investor behavior. Here’s a breakdown of CZ’s key points: No Promotion: CZ explicitly stated he is “not promoting any specific AI agent tokens.” Interest in Development: Despite not promoting tokens, he expressed genuine interest in seeing “more AI agent development on blockchain.” Real-World Applications Focus: CZ emphasized the importance of development with “real-world applications,” suggesting a practical, utility-driven approach. Patience Over Hype: He highlighted that “meaningful progress in development usually takes place after the initial hype fades,” advocating for long-term vision over short-term excitement. This measured response from Changpeng Zhao offers a dose of realism to the often-frenetic crypto market, particularly around new and trending sectors like AI. Why Blockchain AI and Real-World Applications Matter to CZ While CZ distanced himself from endorsing specific AI Agent Tokens , his statement reveals a deeper interest in the convergence of AI and blockchain technology. But why is this intersection so significant, and why does CZ emphasize “real-world applications”? Blockchain technology offers unique advantages that can enhance AI development and deployment, and vice versa. Here are some key benefits of integrating AI with blockchain, which likely resonate with CZ’s vision: Transparency and Auditability: Blockchain’s inherent transparency can make AI systems more auditable and trustworthy. Every transaction and data interaction can be recorded and verified on the blockchain, enhancing accountability. Data Security and Privacy: Blockchain can provide secure and decentralized data storage solutions for AI applications. This is crucial for sensitive data used in AI training and operations, offering better privacy controls. Decentralization and Accessibility: Blockchain can democratize access to AI technologies. Decentralized AI platforms can reduce reliance on centralized entities and make AI resources more accessible to a wider audience. Smart Contracts for AI Agents: Smart contracts on blockchain can automate and govern the actions of AI agents. This enables the creation of autonomous and self-executing AI systems with predefined rules and conditions. Tokenization and Incentivization: AI Agent Tokens and blockchain-based reward systems can incentivize the development, deployment, and improvement of AI models and services. This can foster a vibrant ecosystem of AI innovation. CZ’s focus on “real-world applications” suggests he is looking beyond speculative hype towards projects that can deliver tangible value and solve real-world problems using the synergy of Blockchain AI . Beyond the Hype: The Path to Meaningful Blockchain AI Development CZ’s statement about “meaningful progress” happening after the hype fades is a crucial insight for anyone involved in or observing the Crypto AI space. New technological frontiers often experience cycles of intense excitement followed by periods of consolidation and focused development. Here’s why this perspective is important: Hype Cycles Distort Focus: Initial hype can attract speculative investment and attention to projects that may lack solid foundations. This can distract from genuine innovation and sustainable development. Real Development Takes Time: Building robust and impactful AI applications on blockchain is a complex undertaking. It requires time for research, experimentation, overcoming technical challenges, and iterating based on real-world feedback. Filtering Out Noise: After the initial excitement subsides, the market tends to filter out less viable projects, leaving room for serious developers and teams to build and refine meaningful solutions. Focus on Fundamentals: The post-hype phase allows for a greater focus on fundamental technologies, infrastructure, and practical use cases. This is when real innovation and adoption can take root. CZ’s perspective encourages a more patient and strategic approach to Crypto AI investment and development, emphasizing long-term value creation over short-term gains driven by hype. Navigating the AI Agent Token Landscape: Actionable Insights So, what should you take away from CZ’s statement, especially if you are interested in AI Agent Tokens or the broader Blockchain AI sector? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): CZ’s statement underscores the importance of independent research. Don’t rely solely on hype or endorsements. Thoroughly investigate any AI Agent Tokens you consider investing in. Focus on Utility and Real-World Applications: Prioritize projects that demonstrate clear use cases and aim to solve real-world problems. Look beyond the hype and assess the practical value proposition. Assess the Team and Technology: Evaluate the team behind the project, their expertise in both AI and blockchain, and the underlying technology. Is it innovative, scalable, and secure? Long-Term Vision: Adopt a long-term perspective. Meaningful development in Blockchain AI will take time. Be wary of projects promising instant riches or solely relying on hype. Manage Expectations: Understand that the Crypto AI space is still nascent. There will be challenges, setbacks, and failures along the way. Manage your investment expectations accordingly. Changpeng Zhao ‘s Vision: A Realistic Outlook on Blockchain AI’s Future CZ’s recent statement offers a valuable reality check for the burgeoning AI Agent Tokens sector. While he is not currently promoting specific tokens, his expressed interest in the development of Blockchain AI with real-world applications is undeniably positive. He champions a balanced perspective, urging the community to look beyond the initial hype and focus on building sustainable, impactful solutions. This visionary stance from a leader like CZ reinforces the idea that the true potential of AI and blockchain lies in diligent development and real-world utility, not just fleeting market excitement. As the hype around AI Agent Tokens potentially cools down, the stage is set for serious innovators to build the future of Blockchain AI , aligning with CZ’s insightful outlook.

Argentine President Javier Milei, known for his libertarian views and vocal support for market deregulation, finds himself in hot water. Reports from The Associated Press have surfaced, alleging that President Milei is now facing fraud charges directly linked to his enthusiastic promotion of the now-troubled LIBRA token. This development has sent shockwaves through both the crypto community and international political circles. Let’s dive deep into this unfolding saga and understand the implications of this explosive situation. The LIBRA Token Fiasco and Allegations Against Javier Milei Just weeks ago, the LIBRA token was touted as the next big thing in the crypto space, promising to empower small businesses and fuel economic growth. President Milei himself took to X (formerly Twitter), using his influential platform to champion the token. In a now-deleted post, he boldly claimed that LIBRA would be a game-changer for Argentina’s economy, particularly for startups and small enterprises struggling in the current financial climate. However, the rosy picture painted by promoters quickly crumbled. The LIBRA token’s price plummeted dramatically, leaving investors reeling and raising serious questions about the project’s legitimacy and the motives behind its aggressive promotion. The core of the fraud charges against the Argentine President stems from allegations that his promotion of the LIBRA token was misleading and potentially manipulative. Critics argue that Milei’s endorsement lent undue credibility to a project that was, at best, highly speculative and, at worst, a deliberate scam. The speed at which the token’s value collapsed, coupled with reports of insider profits, has fueled suspicions of a ‘pump and dump’ scheme, a classic form of crypto fraud where insiders artificially inflate the price of an asset before selling off their holdings at a profit, leaving ordinary investors with substantial losses. Unmasking the Insider Profits: The Lookonchain Report Adding fuel to the fire, on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain dropped a bombshell report just before the fraud charges were announced. Their analysis revealed that a staggering $43.8 million profit was pocketed by a mere 11 insider wallets through the strategic selling of their LIBRA holdings. This revelation paints a disturbing picture of potentially coordinated market manipulation. Let’s break down the key takeaways from the Lookonchain report: Massive Insider Gains: Eleven wallets, identified as ‘insiders’ by Lookonchain, collectively made $43.8 million by selling their LIBRA tokens. Strategic Timing: The timing of these sales is crucial. Insiders appear to have sold their tokens at peak prices, just before the dramatic price crash, suggesting they had prior knowledge of the impending collapse or were actively contributing to it. Questions of Transparency: The identities of these insider wallets remain largely unknown, raising serious concerns about transparency and accountability within the LIBRA project. This report has intensified scrutiny on the entire LIBRA token project and further implicated Javier Milei , given his public endorsement of the cryptocurrency. The question on everyone’s mind is: Did President Milei know about these insider activities, or was he himself misled by the promoters of LIBRA? The Fallout: Implications for Argentina and the Crypto World The charges against the Argentine President have far-reaching implications, not only for Argentina but also for the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Here’s a look at some of the key areas impacted: Political Ramifications in Argentina Erosion of Public Trust: For a newly elected president, facing fraud charges so early in his term is a significant blow. It can severely erode public trust in his leadership and raise questions about his judgment and integrity. Political Instability: The scandal could trigger political instability in Argentina, potentially leading to protests, calls for impeachment, and a further weakening of the already fragile Argentine economy. Impact on Economic Policy: Milei’s economic policies, often characterized by deregulation and a free-market approach, may come under increased scrutiny. Critics may argue that this incident highlights the dangers of unchecked deregulation, particularly in the volatile crypto market. Wider Crypto Market Concerns Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: This case is likely to intensify calls for stricter regulation of the cryptocurrency market globally. Governments and regulatory bodies may feel compelled to take a more proactive stance to protect investors from similar scams and fraudulent schemes. Damage to Crypto Reputation: Incidents like the LIBRA token collapse and the allegations against President Milei can further damage the reputation of the cryptocurrency industry. It reinforces the negative narratives of crypto as being rife with scams and lacking in investor protection. Investor Caution: The LIBRA saga serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, especially lesser-known tokens promoted with excessive hype. Investors may become more cautious and discerning, favoring established cryptocurrencies over newer, untested projects. Actionable Insights: Protecting Yourself from Crypto Scams The LIBRA token incident, while concerning, also offers valuable lessons for crypto investors. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate the often-turbulent waters of the cryptocurrency market and protect yourself from potential scams and cryptocurrency promotion pitfalls: Insight Description Do Your Own Research (DYOR) Never rely solely on celebrity or political endorsements. Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency project before investing. Understand the technology, the team, the tokenomics, and the project’s roadmap. Be Wary of Hype Excessive hype and unrealistic promises are red flags. Legitimate crypto projects focus on building sustainable value, not just generating short-term excitement. Look for Transparency Invest in projects that are transparent about their operations, team, and token distribution. Be wary of projects with anonymous teams or unclear tokenomics. Diversify Your Portfolio Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio across different types of cryptocurrencies to mitigate risk. Use Reputable Exchanges Trade cryptocurrencies only on reputable and regulated exchanges. Avoid using obscure or unregulated platforms. Start Small If you’re new to crypto investing, start with small amounts that you can afford to lose. Gradually increase your investment as you gain more experience and knowledge. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Investors and Regulators The crypto fraud allegations against Argentine President Javier Milei serve as a stark wake-up call for both crypto investors and regulators alike. It highlights the inherent risks in the unregulated cryptocurrency market and underscores the urgent need for greater investor protection and regulatory oversight. While cryptocurrencies hold immense potential, the LIBRA token saga reminds us that the space is still vulnerable to scams and manipulation. For investors, due diligence, skepticism, and a focus on long-term value are paramount. For regulators, this incident should be a catalyst for developing effective frameworks that foster innovation while safeguarding investors from fraudulent schemes. The future of cryptocurrency depends on building trust and ensuring a fair and transparent market for all participants.

Also, the LIBRA team withdrew millions of dollars from the crypto pool, leaving nearly 100% of the holders on losses. Shockingly, the recent founding and allegation of the MELANIA coin’s team behind this token and its crash has brought additional tremors. Let’s discuss. LIBRA Token $100M Scam and What Led To This? The LIBRA token was launched on January 14 and became an instant hit in the crypto market due to the Argentina President, Javier Milei’s endorsement . The LIBRA price surged 3000% during this period, creating an ATH at $4.5. More importantly, within hours of launch, its valuation hit $4.5 billion. However, things escalated, and it became $4.5 billion in insider trading soon after the Bubblemaps found that just a few investors owned 82% of the tokens. The LIBRA team withdrew $87M of LIBRA from the liquidity pool, leaving the investors stranded on a losing streak. More importantly, the sniper cashed out $107M, crashing the token by nearly 94%. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg, as much more happened behind this crash. This includes Dave Portnoy, the person behind JAILSTOOL’s 119,000% rally , and other KoLs who knew about this potential scam. A recent Lookonchain post highlighted Portnoy’s possible involvement in this rug pull. More importantly, he admitted to receiving coins from the LIBRA team but revealed that he had returned them. However, new findings brought new concerns, especially as the Bubblemaps report claims the MELANIA coin team is behind the LIBRA launch. The MELANIA and LIBRA Meme Coin Controversy The alleged findings from the popular on-cain analytics platform Bubblemaps claim that the MELANIA team is behind the LIBRA token launch and the crash. According to a detailed Bubblemaps X post, a specific address, P5tb4, directly connects the FOTUS’s MELANIA memecoin and the LIBRA. This is because this address made over $2.4M in profits with this LIBRA coin and later transferred all the profits to 0xcEA, a wallet linked to MELANIA’s creator. Bubblemaps alleges a profound connection between the 0xcEA and MELANIA’s creator. It included the funding transaction and coss-chain transfers. More importantly, the MELANIA meme coin , which rose to the hype before the crash, has also faced similar insider trading, as the analytics page revealed profit manipulation and snipping activities. “I was a part of this. I think the team did want to snipe it because how big the snipe was on TRUMP btut we weren’t definitely the biggest siniper,” revealed Davis before claiming that the team did not make any money on it or took from liquidity. Bubblemap’s allegation of the LIBRA token launch and scam involving the MELAINA team came true with a Coffeezilla interview. Now, the question is, who could be the culprit for this between KIP Protocols, Kelsier Ventures, or Hayden Davis? Further Analysis & Insights The Bubblemaps team claims to have been tracking the 0xcEA for weeks before finding funding transfers between this wallet and the DEfcyK, the wallet of the LIBRA creators. Notably, this DEfcyK wallet cashed out $87M from the liquidity pool, leaving holders in the dark. This rug pull has left hundreds of people in massive losses, but Hayden Davis, one of the leading people behind this LIBRA token, claims this is not a rug pull; it’s a plan gone miserable wrong in the recent Coffeezilla interview. People are saying this is a rug pull, but that is not objectively true. There’s still $60M on the bonding curve of liquidity that’s locked, that is, a $300M market cap. It’s not a rug; it’s a plan gone miserably wrong with $100M sitting in an account that I’m the custodian of, and I would love to know what to do next with these. However, there’s more. The reports claim that the 0xcEA also snipped the LIBRA token, earning $6M in profits through multiple site addresses. More importantly, this primary address is also linked to various other token launches. This includes TRUST, KACY, VIBES, and $HOOD, ending with the same pump-and-dump scams. Given this, it is understandable that these people coordinated their efforts in launching the tokens, pumping their value, and dumping them with profits. Final Thoughts: Coordinated Manipulation? The Bubbluemaps team has made some key findings about the LIBRA token scam, including its connection with the trending meme coin MELANIA. LIBRA witnessed a liquidity crisis, $4.5b insider trading, and price manipulations with the support of the Argentina President and KoL. The team netted over $100M in profit, leaving retail investors with catastrophic losses. Now, the key question remains: who’s truly behind these scams? In the recent Hayden Davis interview, he claims it’s no one’s fault but insiders. More importantly, he claims the LIBRA token scam is a plan gone wrong. Victims await what will come next, as Davis asked what he should do with the $100M from the liquidity pool. Although there’s quite certainty on this topic, investors must await further updates.

Over the past 24 hours, traders in the perpetual futures market have faced a harsh reminder of this volatility. Let’s dive into the alarming figures of crypto liquidations and break down where the biggest losses occurred. If you’re trading with leverage, understanding these dynamics is absolutely critical. What are Crypto Perpetual Futures and Why Do Liquidations Happen? Before we delve into the specifics, let’s quickly clarify what perpetual futures are and why liquidations are a crucial aspect of this market. Perpetual futures are derivative contracts that, unlike traditional futures, don’t have an expiry date. They allow traders to speculate on the price of cryptocurrencies with leverage, meaning you can control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. This amplifies both potential profits and potential losses. Liquidations occur when a trader’s position moves against them, and their margin balance falls below the maintenance margin level. In simpler terms, if the price goes the wrong way and you don’t have enough funds to cover your losses, the exchange will automatically close your position to prevent further losses. This is a key risk in leveraged trading and understanding crypto liquidations is paramount for risk management. 24-Hour Crypto Liquidation Breakdown: A Detailed Look Now, let’s get to the heart of the matter: the 24-hour crypto liquidation data. The numbers paint a clear picture of market movements and trader positioning. Here’s a breakdown of the major cryptocurrencies affected: Total Crypto Liquidations (24 Hours): Over $35 million Dominant Position: Long positions were overwhelmingly liquidated, indicating a significant market downturn. Bitcoin (BTC) Liquidations: The King Takes a Hit Bitcoin (BTC) 24-Hour Liquidation Data Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, unsurprisingly saw the largest share of liquidations: BTC Liquidations: $15.37 million Long Liquidations: $13.94 million (a staggering 90.69% of total BTC liquidations) Short Liquidations: $1.43 million The data reveals a strong bias towards long positions being liquidated in Bitcoin. This suggests that a significant number of traders were betting on Bitcoin’s price going up and were caught off guard by a downward price movement. The sheer volume of Bitcoin liquidation highlights the inherent risks even in trading the most established cryptocurrency. Ethereum (ETH) Liquidations: Following Bitcoin’s Lead Ethereum (ETH) 24-Hour Liquidation Data Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, also experienced substantial liquidations, mirroring the trend seen in Bitcoin: ETH Liquidations: $13.22 million Long Liquidations: $9.97 million (75.39% of total ETH liquidations) Short Liquidations: $3.25 million While the percentage of long liquidations is slightly lower than Bitcoin, it’s still overwhelmingly dominant. The significant Ethereum liquidation figure reinforces the overall market trend of long positions being heavily impacted. Traders need to be particularly cautious when leverage trading ETH, especially during periods of market uncertainty. Solana (SOL) Liquidations: Altcoin Volatility in Action Solana (SOL) 24-Hour Liquidation Data Solana, a popular altcoin known for its volatility, also saw considerable liquidations, although the distribution is even more skewed towards long positions: SOL Liquidations: $7.28 million Long Liquidations: $6.88 million (a massive 94.52% of total SOL liquidations) Short Liquidations: $398,790 The incredibly high percentage of long liquidations in Solana underscores the amplified risk associated with trading altcoins with leverage. Solana liquidation data serves as a stark reminder that while altcoins can offer higher potential returns, they also come with significantly higher volatility and risk of liquidation. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders What can we learn from this 24-hour crypto liquidation event? Here are some critical takeaways for crypto traders, especially those involved in perpetual futures trading: Market Sentiment Shift: The dominance of long liquidations across BTC, ETH, and SOL suggests a clear shift in market sentiment, at least in the short term. Traders need to be nimble and adapt to changing market conditions. Risk Management is Paramount: Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. This liquidation event is a stark reminder of the importance of robust risk management strategies. Always use stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging your positions. Altcoins are Higher Risk: The Solana data highlights the increased volatility and liquidation risk associated with altcoins. Exercise extra caution when trading altcoins with leverage. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market data, news, and liquidation statistics. Understanding market trends and potential triggers for volatility can help you make more informed trading decisions. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Futures Market The crypto perpetual futures market offers exciting opportunities for traders, but it’s also fraught with risks. Understanding crypto liquidations , managing risk effectively, and staying informed are crucial for navigating this dynamic market successfully. This 24-hour breakdown serves as a valuable lesson in the importance of caution and preparedness in the world of crypto trading.

If the Fed, that would require legislative approval, the report noted. How would the Fed fund cryptocurrency purchases? Bernstein said it could issue debt or sell some of its gold reserves. The U.S. government could add the $20 billion in bitcoin it has seized from criminal enterprises to any national reserve, the report added.

The Solana wallet “0xcEA” was linked to both tokens, and secured millions in profits through rapid liquidity extraction and cross-chain transfers. This led to multiple lawsuits against Milei for fraud and market manipulation. KIP Protocol confirmed its involvement in the project but denied launching LIBRA, while Barstool Sports’ Dave Portnoy returned 6 million LIBRA tokens after a dispute over what he was allowed to disclose to his followers. LIBRA and Melania Launches Expose Insider Sniping Bubblemaps analysts uncovered new on-chain evidence suggesting that the same team behind the controversial launch of the Libra (LIBRA) meme coin was also responsible for launching the Melania (MELANIA) token. In a post on Feb. 17, the analytics firm stated that their findings indicate the team behind LIBRA, or someone closely associated with them, orchestrated both launches and engaged in strategic sniping to manipulate the price movements. The investigation centers around a Solana wallet address known as “ 0xcEA ,” which was linked to the sniping of Melania Trump’s meme coin launch on Jan. 19. The wallet reportedly netted $2.4 million in profits and quickly moved the funds to another wallet on Avalanche. Bubblemaps analysts tracked a series of unique transactions, including multiple cross-chain transfers and funding transactions through different Solana wallets, all seemingly intended to obscure the transaction history. Based on this activity, they concluded that the creator of Melania, or someone close to the team, sniped their own launch. A few weeks later, Bubblemaps noticed that the same 0xcEA wallet funded the address that created the LIBRA token. When LIBRA launched on Feb. 15, the wallet repeated its previous behavior by sniping the token and securing $6 million in profits. This activity was again conducted through multiple side addresses funded via cross-chain transfers from wallets on Arbitrum and Avalanche. The nearly identical patterns of sniping activity, coupled with the CCTP funding trails, led Bubblemaps to determine that both tokens were likely launched by the same people . Further analysis revealed that the 0xcEA wallet was behind multiple high-profile “pump and dump” schemes, including a fraudulent Robinhood (HOOD) token that temporarily surged to a market capitalization of $120 million before collapsing. The evidence suggests that the same strategy of rapid liquidity extraction and price manipulation has been used across multiple token launches. The fallout from the LIBRA launch has been very severe, thanks to the token’s endorsement by Argentine President Javier Milei. Insiders reportedly liquidated more than $107 million worth of assets, which caused the token to plummet by over 90% in just four hours. Blockchain intelligence firm Lookonchain identified at least eight wallets linked to the LIBRA team that siphoned $57.6 million in USD Coin (USDC) and 249,671 Solana, worth approximately $49.7 million at the time. The Melania token suffered a similar fate. After launching on Jan. 19, it initially soared to a peak market cap of over $13 billion in just four hours before collapsing by 99%. MELANIA price action since launch (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Argentine Lawyers Sue Milei for Promoting Libra Argentine President Javier Milei is facing legal action after reportedly promoting the LIBRA cryptocurrency. The Libertad project’s native Solana-based token reached a market capitalization of $4.56 billion on Feb. 14 after Milei’s endorsement on X. However, the token plummeted by over 90% after Milei deleted the post, which led to accusations of market manipulation and a pump-and-dump scheme. A criminal complaint was filed against Milei by lawyers Marcos Zelaya and Jonatan Baldiviezo, alongside engineer María Eva Koutsovitis and economist Claudio Lozano. The complaint alleges that Milei was complicit in fraud by promoting Libra and accuses him of violating Argentina’s Public Ethics Law. This law mandates that public officials disclose their assets and any potential conflicts of interest. Baldiviezo stated that Milei’s role in the incident was crucial, and argued that his actions were essential to enable fraud through the promotion of the token. A judge is expected to be assigned to the case or refer it to a prosecutor for further investigation, according to a report by the Associated Press. Additionally, Argentine lawyer Agustín Rombolá, the founder of the Rombola Mangione law firm and a member of the political party Unión Cívica Radical, filed a separate legal complaint against Milei. In a statement on X on Feb. 16, Rombolá accused Milei of fraud, price manipulation, financial crimes, and engaging in negotiations incompatible with his public office. Rombolá’s firm is also preparing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of investors who suffered losses because of the token’s collapse. After the controversy, Milei called on the Anti-Corruption Office to investigate all members of the government, including himself, for any potential misconduct. The findings will be shared with the courts. In response to the allegations, the presidential office claimed that Milei was unaware of the details of the project when he endorsed it and had no direct ties to the company behind the token’s launch. KIP Protocol Confirms Involvement in Libra Project KIP Protocol, a Web3 company specializing in AI payment infrastructure, confirmed its involvement in the Libertad project. During a Feb. 15 X Spaces event, KIP Protocol CEO and co-founder Julian Peh stated that the company was hired as a tech consultancy to assist in distributing project funds to local businesses in Argentina. According to Peh, KIP Protocol did not create the token, act as a market maker, or profit from selling it. However, he did not share additional details about other entities involved in LIBRA’s launch. In a separate social media post, Peh also shared that KIP Protocol is still committed to running Project Libertad and supporting businesses in Argentina as originally planned. Dave Portnoy Rejected LIBRA Tokens After Disclosure Dispute Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy also recently revealed that he returned 6 million LIBRA tokens to the project’s founder, Hayden Davis, after learning that he was not allowed to share that he had been compensated for promoting the token. Portnoy said he was initially given between 6 million and 6.5 million LIBRA tokens as payment for endorsing the project on social media but ultimately decided to return them after Davis instructed him to keep the compensation confidential. During a Feb. 16 X Spaces event , Portnoy explained that he refused to accept the tokens under those conditions as he needed to be transparent about his involvement. He placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that his decision to return the tokens happened before the controversy surrounding LIBRA erupted, and insisted that he had no prior knowledge of the project’s eventual collapse. While he sent back the tokens he was given, Portnoy kept the ones he purchased himself, which later lost almost all their value after the token crashed. As LIBRA’s value plummeted, Portnoy stayed in contact with Davis and saw the project’s unraveling in real time. Despite the widespread accusations of fraud and a potential pump-and-dump scheme, Portnoy is doubtful that Davis intentionally orchestrated a rug pull. Instead, he speculated that Argentine President Javier Milei may have unexpectedly withdrawn his support at a critical moment, which caused complications that contributed to the token’s collapse.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ZRX|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-17 09:36:54

Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, retreated to roughly $96,000. The situation with most of the well-known altcoins, including Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and others, is no better. The meme coin sector is also deep in the red, with some tokens recording double-digit declines. BTC Takes a Step Back Last week was rather turbulent for the primary cryptocurrency, whose price reached a local top of almost $99,000 on February 14 and a local bottom of less than $95,000 on February 12. The lower mark was observed shortly after the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Consumer Price Index data for January . The actual inflation rate was higher than expectations which caused the entire crypto market to bleed heavily. Contrary to the volatile business week, the weekend was quiet with BTC’s valuation consolidating at around $97,000-$97,500. However, the bears took control at the start of the new business week, suppressing the price to as low as $95,800. In the following hours, BTC slightly rebounded to the current $96,100 (per CoinGecko’s data). BTC Price, Source: CoinMarketCap The asset’s market capitalization has retraced to approximately $1.906 trillion, whereas its dominance against the alternative coins remains almost unchanged at around 59.7%. The Alts are More Affected As mentioned above, several large-cap altcoins have tumbled in the last 24 hours. Ripple’s XRP is down 3%, Solana (SOL) tanked by 4%, whereas Litecoin (LTC) slipped by 5%. On the other hand, Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), and TRON (TRX) are among the few charting some gains. The meme coin niche is also predominantly covered in red. Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Official Trump (TRUMP), and many more have headed south, while lesser-known tokens like MEOW (MEOW), ai16z (AI16Z), and Ket (KET) have collapsed by double digits. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization currently stands at roughly $3.19 trillion, representing a 0.88% decrease for the day.

With big names like DOGE and PEPE struggling, Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces challenges from a new entrant named Cutoshi. But can a player as big as SHIB be compared to a project that is in its presale phase? Traders believe, in terms of return on investment, Cutoshi is right up there with SHIB and many other top names. Let us check out more about both the coin: SHIB’s Milestone SHIB’s market cap milestone throws light on its evolution from being a just meme coin into developing a multifaceted ecosystem. With important initiatives like Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling solution, SHIB has managed to add utility, attracting institutional interest and driving liquidity. However, SHIB’s infinite supply remains a liability. Despite burn mechanisms, its circulating supply remains a whopping 589.5T SHIB. This inflationary pressure does not match with the broader crypto trend toward scarcity, exemplified by Bitcoin’s capped supply. Cutoshi’s Model Cutoshi, inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto , leverages deflationary tokenomics to create scarcity and long-term value. With a hard-capped supply and a burn mechanism, $CUTO’s circulating tokens decrease over time, mirroring Bitcoin’s scarcity model. This strategy addresses SHIB’s inflationary flaw, positioning CUTO as a deflationary memecoin set for appreciation. Credits: Cutoshi (X) Cutoshi’s MemeFi Ecosystem While SHIB relies on community hype and Shibarium’s utility, Cutoshi integrates real-world perks into its ecosystem through its Cross-Chain DEX, Educational DeFi Platform, Merchandise, and more. It is also planning to launch a real-time gaming experience powered by AI. Moreover, Cutoshi attracts an active community through its Quests & Farming program, where participants earn tokens by engaging in social media tasks and content creation. On the other hand, SHIB’s community, though large, is more passive, relying on viral trends rather than structured engagement. When it comes to cultural relevance, SHIB’s Shiba Inu branding is iconic but overused. Cutoshi’s Lucky Cat taps into Asian cultural symbolism of prosperity, resonating deeply in Japan and China. These are markets that are critical for crypto adoption in general. This niche positioning could attract investors seeking fresh, culturally relevant projects. Security & Transparency: Cutoshi’s smart contract has undergone a third-party audit , addressing security concerns common in meme coins. SHIB’s lack of similar transparency raises red flags for risk-averse investors. Market Potential: SHIB vs Cutoshi SHIB’s massive market cap milestone signals maturity but also saturation. With a current price of $0.00001679, further growth may be constrained by its massive supply. Whereas, Cutoshi’s presale price of $0.031 offers early investors a lower entry point, with a 106% price surge already recorded. Analysts project significant upside potential as CUTO’s deflationary model takes effect. Conclusion SHIB’s market cap milestone definitely highlights its legacy, but its inflationary model and reliance on hype may limit long-term growth. Cutoshi, with its deflationary supply, utility-driven ecosystem, and active community, is poised to challenge SHIB’s dominance. As meme coins evolve from speculative assets to utility-based projects, Cutoshi’s multifaceted approach positions it as the superior choice for investors seeking sustainable returns. With its presale live, the time to join the movement is now. As a limited-period Valentine’s Day offer, investors are currently getting a 35% bonus on their deposits.

Source: CoinMarketCap This downturn has sparked concerns about further declines, especially after the cryptocurrency recently surged past $2.80, raising hopes of a potential rally toward $3. Despite this short-term weakness, analysts remain divided on whether the digital asset will recover or face prolonged consolidation. Technical indicators and market metrics provide conflicting signals about XRP’s trajectory. While some analysts foresee a near-term rally, others warn that breaching key support levels could lead to further downside. Amid this uncertainty, long-term projections for XRP remain ambitious, with market experts suggesting a potential surge to $8 and even $27 in the coming years. XRP key technical signals Several technical indicators are pointing towards a possible rebound in XRP’s price. One key metric is the 21-week exponential moving average (EMA), which has historically acted as a strong support level. Even during the latest market downturn, XRP has managed to hold above this level, suggesting resilience in the current price range. Crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has highlighted the importance of Fibonacci retracement levels, noting that XRP is currently consolidating between the 0.888 and 1.0 Fib levels, ranging from $2.25 to $3.30. This consolidation pattern is often seen before a breakout, making the next few weeks critical for determining XRP’s direction. A significant price intersection is expected on March 10, 2025, based on Fibonacci projections. If market conditions align, XRP could see a major upswing to $8, which would represent a threefold increase from current levels. Projections suggest further gains, with potential price targets of $13 by September 2025 and $27 by June 2026. Short-term resistance In the short term, XRP must reclaim key resistance levels to confirm bullish momentum. Analyst Dark Defender suggests that XRP’s ability to break past $2.77 could pave the way for a move toward $3. Dark Defender @DefendDark · Follow Hello all. #XRP is trying to claim the $2.7740 level.

Market sentiment remains mixed, with some traders positioning for a breakout while others remain cautious due to lingering macroeconomic uncertainties. XRP’s futures open interest has also declined by 6% to $4.07 billion, down from a recent high of $4.2 billion, indicating that leveraged traders are reducing exposure amid volatile conditions. XRP vs Ethereum Despite XRP’s recent price decline, some analysts believe it has the potential to surpass Ethereum in performance. Over the last 18 months, XRP has recorded a price increase of 564%, compared to Ethereum’s 80% gains in the same period. This outperformance has fueled speculation that XRP could narrow the gap with Ethereum in market dominance.

Market speculation around a potential resolution in the Ripple vs. SEC case has contributed to increased volatility. A favorable outcome, particularly under the next US SEC chair, could trigger significant price appreciation. Anticipation over a possible XRP ETF in the US has further strengthened investor interest. Institutional adoption through an ETF could provide the cryptocurrency with a fresh influx of capital, driving price momentum in the long term.

Ethereum's Promising Future: Why ETH is Dominating the Crypto Space Ethereum is a pioneering blockchain that has had a profound impact on the crypto landscape. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, it introduced smart contracts and a broad array of decentralized applications. This includes financial platforms and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which enhance transaction speed and reduce costs. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, improving efficiency and reducing its environmental impact. The next phase is sharding, a feature that will further increase transaction capacity and lower expenses. Ether (ETH) powers this ecosystem. It's essential for transactions, rewards those who stake their coins, and can be traded or used as collateral. Forecasts suggest that ETH's price might soar to $6,580.53 in the coming year. With its robust technology and ongoing advancements, Ethereum stands out in today's market. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, its dedication to scalability and efficiency positions it advantageously. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Ethereum's focus on innovation makes it a compelling choice for many investors. ADA: Charting Cardano's Path to a Sustainable Crypto Future Cardano is making waves in the crypto industry with its innovative approach. It’s a versatile and scalable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, enabling the creation of decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. At its heart is ADA, Cardano's native cryptocurrency, which rivals Ethereum's ETH by allowing users to store value, make payments, and participate in staking on the Cardano network. Cardano distinguishes itself through its commitment to sustainability and efficiency. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies that rely on energy-intensive methods, it utilizes the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more environmentally friendly. Cardano's blockchain is split into two layers: one for transactions and another for smart contracts. This smart architecture enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially handling up to a million per second. With the introduction of Cardano native tokens in March 2021, users can interact with smart contracts securely while benefiting from low fees. In a market increasingly focused on eco-friendly and efficient cryptocurrencies, ADA's cutting-edge technology makes it a noteworthy contender. Conclusion While Ethereum and Cardano are strong options, XYZVerse (XYZ) offers unmatched growth potential by combining meme culture with sports within a community-driven ecosystem.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Unique Memecoin on the Ethereum Network Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that draws inspiration from Dogecoin but is built on the Ethereum blockchain. This gives it the ability to integrate with Ethereum's network, enabling applications like decentralized exchanges and potential future NFT platforms. Introduced in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, SHIB started with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to charity and burned 40%, boosting SHIB's visibility. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's link to Ethereum opens doors for additional application development, offering potential utility beyond being just a meme. Its ongoing plans and Ethereum integration position it as a coin of interest. The Rise of PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Marvel PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum blockchain that pays homage to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, created by Matt Furie.

Early in 2023, PEPE saw an incredible market surge, with its market cap reaching $1.6 billion, turning some early investors into millionaires. This spurred a ""memecoin season,"" increasing interest in similar tokens. PEPE's roadmap focuses on gaining broader recognition and exchange listings. Although the future of PEPE and other memecoins is uncertain, many anticipate continued growth, especially with potential upcoming changes in the Bitcoin market. Conclusion While SHIB and PEPE have minted millionaires, their short-term potential now appears limited. Enter Catzilla, the ultimate meme coin hero promising an impressive 700% ROI during its presale.

A groundbreaking initiative is taking shape, promising to reshape how Filipinos interact with the digital and financial world. World Network Philippines has officially begun operations, marking a significant step towards establishing a decentralized identity and financial ecosystem in the country. This launch signals a potential game-changer for financial inclusion and digital empowerment across the archipelago. Let’s dive into what this means for the Philippines and the broader crypto landscape. What is World Network and Why the Philippines? World Network is not just another crypto project; it’s an ambitious endeavor focused on creating a global identity and financial network. Imagine a world where everyone has a universally recognized digital identity and access to a decentralized financial system. That’s the core vision driving World Network. But why launch in the Philippines? Several factors make the Philippines an ideal starting point: Tech-Savvy Population: The Philippines boasts a young and digitally engaged population, eager to adopt new technologies. This creates a fertile ground for crypto adoption and the success of innovative projects like World Network. Financial Inclusion Needs: A significant portion of the Filipino population remains unbanked or underbanked. World Network ‘s mission to provide financial access resonates deeply in a country where traditional financial systems haven’t fully reached everyone. Growing Crypto Interest: The Philippines has witnessed a surge in cryptocurrency adoption in recent years. Filipinos are increasingly exploring crypto for remittances, investments, and everyday transactions. By choosing the Philippines as its launchpad, World Network is tapping into a dynamic market with a real need for its solutions and a strong appetite for crypto innovation. World ID Orb Verification: Your Gateway to the Network At the heart of World Network ‘s identity system is the World ID Orb. This innovative device plays a crucial role in verifying user identities in a privacy-preserving manner. Here’s how it works: Orb Verification: Users can visit designated locations in select cities within Bulacan province, just outside Manila, to undergo World ID Orb verification. Privacy-Focused: The Orb uses advanced biometric technology to verify personhood without collecting or storing personal data. This ensures user privacy and security. Unique Digital Identity: Successful Orb verification grants users a unique World ID, their gateway to accessing the World Network ecosystem. The initial rollout in Bulacan province is a strategic move, allowing World Network to test and refine its operations before expanding nationwide. Think of it as a pilot program to ensure a smooth and efficient nationwide launch. Benefits of World Network in the Philippines What advantages does World Network bring to Filipinos? The potential benefits are substantial and span across various aspects of life: Benefit Description Impact on Filipinos Enhanced Digital Identity Provides a secure and universally recognized digital identity. Simplifies online transactions, access to services, and reduces identity fraud. Financial Inclusion Opens up access to decentralized financial services for the unbanked and underbanked. Empowers individuals with greater financial control and opportunities for economic participation. Remittance Efficiency Facilitates faster and cheaper international remittances through crypto. Reduces reliance on expensive traditional remittance services, benefiting overseas Filipino workers and their families. Decentralized Applications (dApps) Creates a platform for building and accessing a wide range of decentralized applications. Fosters innovation and provides access to new and user-centric digital services. Imagine a Filipino farmer in a remote province gaining access to micro-loans through a World Network -powered dApp, or an overseas worker sending remittances home instantly and affordably. These are just glimpses of the transformative potential of this project. Navigating Challenges and Looking Ahead While the launch of World Network in the Philippines is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Regulatory Landscape: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the Philippines will be essential for long-term success. Clear and supportive regulations can foster innovation while protecting consumers. Adoption and Education: Widespread adoption requires educating the public about the benefits and functionalities of World Network and crypto in general. User-friendly interfaces and educational initiatives are crucial. Infrastructure Development: Ensuring robust internet access and infrastructure across the Philippines is vital for seamless access to the World Network . Security and Trust: Maintaining the security and trustworthiness of the network and the World ID system is paramount to building user confidence. Despite these challenges, the launch of World Network in the Philippines represents a bold step towards a more inclusive and decentralized future. The project’s commitment to privacy, financial access, and digital empowerment aligns with the needs and aspirations of many Filipinos. As the project expands nationwide, it will be fascinating to witness its impact on the Philippine digital and financial landscape. Empowering Filipinos with Digital Identity and Financial Access World Network ‘s arrival in the Philippines is more than just a crypto project launch; it’s a potential catalyst for digital and financial empowerment. By providing a secure digital identity and access to a decentralized financial network, World Network has the potential to unlock opportunities for millions of Filipinos. The nationwide rollout will be a critical phase, and its success hinges on addressing the challenges proactively and engaging with the Filipino community effectively.

The crypto market is notorious for making overnight millionaires—and leaving latecomers in the dust. With 2025 shaping up to be a breakout year for blockchain innovation, now's the time to spot 100x crypto for 2025 projects with real-world impact, strong fundamentals, and massive growth potential. One project already turning heads is Qubetics ($TICS) . Unlike past blockchains that struggled with interoperability, Qubetics is stepping in as a Web3 aggregator, unifying major networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This game-changer will eliminate blockchain silos, making seamless cross-chain transactions possible. With its presale gaining serious traction, Qubetics is proving it’s more than hype—it’s a movement. 1. Qubetics ($TICS) – The Ultimate Blockchain Unifier The crypto world has a problem: blockchains don’t talk to each other. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana all exist in their own bubbles, making asset transfers slow, expensive, and inefficient. That’s where Qubetics comes in. As the first-ever Web3 aggregator, it unites multiple networks into a single framework, allowing seamless cross-chain interactions . Think about it—right now, if a business wants to integrate blockchain payments, they must choose one network. But what if they need to work with multiple blockchains? They’re stuck dealing with complex bridges, high fees, and security risks. Qubetics solves this by enabling direct transactions between different blockchains, making crypto adoption easier for businesses, developers, and investors alike. Imagine a global e-commerce company wanting to accept crypto payments. With today’s system, they must support multiple wallets, each tied to a specific blockchain. With Qubetics, that hassle disappears. Their platform will allow customers to pay in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other major crypto, while the business receives funds in their preferred digital asset. No more fragmentation—just smooth transactions. As Qubetics’ 21st presale stage unfolds, investors are flocking in, pushing the presale tally to over $12.9 million. The current price of $TICS is $0.0733, with 474 million+ tokens already sold and a growing community of 20,000+ holders. Analysts forecast massive potential: $TICS at $0.25 post-presale would mean a 240.64% ROI, while a post-launch rally to $10 or $15 could see gains of 13,525.66% and 20,338.49%, respectively. If you invest $1,000 today, you’d hold 13,640 $TICS tokens. At $0.25, that turns into $3,406, at $1 it’s $13,660, and at $15, you’d be looking at a whopping $204,600. With the Q2 2025 mainnet launch approaching, now is the time to get in early. Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain—it’s a missing piece of the crypto puzzle. Its interoperability-first approach, real-world use cases, and explosive presale momentum make it a 100x crypto for 2025. As the mainnet launch in Q2 2025 approaches, early investors stand to gain massively. 2. Avalanche (AVAX) – The Speed Demon of DeFi Avalanche is redefining blockchain scalability with its subnet technology, enabling fast, low-cost transactions. Unlike Ethereum, which struggles with congestion, Avalanche processes 4,500 transactions per second. It’s designed for developers looking to build high-performance decentralized applications without running into network slowdowns. This makes it a strong competitor in the DeFi and enterprise blockchain space. Avalanche recently integrated with institutional finance, securing partnerships that could bring traditional financial assets on-chain. Its ecosystem is expanding, with DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications fueling demand. Institutions and major DeFi projects are starting to use Avalanche as a scalability solution, giving it massive potential for widespread adoption. With its ultra-fast network, growing adoption, and DeFi dominance, Avalanche is positioned for a massive breakout in 2025. The speed advantage alone makes it a go-to blockchain for developers and enterprises alike. As more institutions look to integrate blockchain technology, Avalanche’s ability to handle high throughput and low fees makes it one of the most promising 100x cryptos. 3. Render Network (RNDR) – Powering the Metaverse Render Network is tackling one of tech’s biggest challenges—affordable GPU computing power. It allows creators, developers, and studios to rent decentralized GPU resources, cutting costs for AI, 3D rendering, and metaverse applications. As AI and metaverse adoption grow, the demand for computing power will only increase, and Render is perfectly positioned to fill that gap. With the AI boom in full swing, Render is securing high-profile partnerships in Hollywood, gaming, and AI-driven projects, making it an essential infrastructure for digital creation. The traditional GPU market is expensive and centralized, but Render’s decentralized model is giving independent creators access to the same level of computing power as major studios. The demand for decentralized GPU rendering is soaring, making Render one of the most underrated 100x cryptos for 2025. As AI and 3D content creation continue growing, projects that provide essential backend services will explode in value. Render is leading that charge. 4. Polkadot (DOT) – The Internet of Blockchains Polkadot isn’t just another smart contract platform—it’s an entire ecosystem of interconnected blockchains. With its parachain technology, it allows multiple blockchains to operate independently while still communicating seamlessly. The more the blockchain industry grows, the more crucial interoperability becomes, and Polkadot is at the center of this movement. Polkadot’s ecosystem is thriving with new parachains, DeFi projects, and institutional adoption. As Web3 expands, Polkadot’s role in blockchain interoperability will only grow stronger. Developers are increasingly choosing Polkadot over other platforms because of its flexibility and ability to scale without bottlenecks. Polkadot’s scalability, cross-chain functionality, and developer-friendly infrastructure make it a prime candidate for a 100x explosion. It’s solving a core issue in crypto—how to connect different blockchains in a way that’s both scalable and secure. 5. Hedera (HBAR) – The Corporate Blockchain Powerhouse Hedera stands out with its Hashgraph technology, offering 10,000+ transactions per second, low fees, and carbon-negative operations. It’s already being used by Google, IBM, and Boeing for enterprise-level blockchain solutions. The sheer speed and efficiency of Hedera make it ideal for large-scale corporate blockchain adoption. Hedera is securing more corporate partnerships, expanding tokenized real-world assets (RWA), DeFi, and green blockchain initiatives. Its partnerships with tech giants suggest long-term stability and real-world use cases beyond speculation. With big-name backers, cutting-edge technology, and growing institutional adoption, Hedera has 100x potential in 2025. Its ability to integrate with major corporations sets it apart from traditional crypto projects. Final Thoughts: These 100x Cryptos Are Too Big to Ignore Opportunities like these don’t come often. These 100x crypto for 2025 picks—Qubetics, Avalanche, Render, Polkadot, and Hedera—are more than just promising; they’re solving real problems and setting the stage for mass adoption. As we inch closer to 2025, the smart money is moving in, and those who wait could be left chasing pumps. Qubetics stands out with its Web3 aggregation, explosive presale, and unmatched ROI potential. Don't be the one watching from the sidelines— join the Qubetics presale before the next price hike hits.

Consider this: currently, if a business wants to implement blockchain payments, they must select one network. But what if they need to interact with various blockchains? They are forced to deal with complicated bridges, hefty fees, and security vulnerabilities. Qubetics addresses this by enabling direct transactions between different blockchains, simplifying crypto adoption for businesses, developers, and investors. Picture a global e-commerce company wanting to accept cryptocurrency payments. In the current system, they need to support multiple wallets, each linked to a specific blockchain. With Qubetics, that complexity vanishes. Their platform allows customers to pay using Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any major crypto, while the business receives funds in their chosen digital asset. No more fragmentation—just seamless transactions. As Qubetics’ 21st presale stage unfolds, investors are eagerly joining, raising the presale total to over $12.9 million. Currently priced at $0.0733, over 474 million $TICS tokens have been sold, with a thriving community of more than 20,000 holders. Analysts predict significant potential: $TICS at $0.25 post-presale could yield a 240.64% ROI, while a post-launch surge to $10 or $15 might deliver gains of 13,525.66% and 20,338.49%, respectively. An investment of $1,000 today would secure 13,640 $TICS tokens. At $0.25, that amounts to $3,406, at $1, it’s $13,660, and at $15, a staggering $204,600. With the mainnet launch slated for Q2 2025, now is the time to get in early. Qubetics isn't just another blockchain—it's a crucial missing piece of the crypto puzzle. Its focus on interoperability, practical use cases, and explosive presale momentum make it a 100x crypto to watch for 2025. As the mainnet launch in Q2 2025 approaches, early investors stand to benefit significantly. 2. Avalanche (AVAX) – The Speed Leader in DeFi Avalanche is reshaping blockchain scalability with its subnet technology, enabling swift, cost-effective transactions. Unlike Ethereum, which faces congestion issues, Avalanche handles 4,500 transactions per second. It’s tailored for developers aiming to create high-performance decentralized applications without facing network slowdowns. This positions it as a formidable competitor in the DeFi and enterprise blockchain arena. Avalanche has recently made strides in institutional finance, forming partnerships that could bring traditional financial assets onto the blockchain. Its ecosystem is growing, with DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications driving demand. Institutions and major DeFi projects are beginning to adopt Avalanche as a scalability solution, offering it significant potential for widespread use. With its blazing-fast network, increasing adoption, and DeFi dominance, Avalanche is set for a major breakout in 2025. Its speed advantage alone makes it an attractive choice for developers and businesses. As more institutions seek to integrate blockchain technology, Avalanche’s capacity to handle high throughput and low fees positions it as one of the most promising 100x cryptos. 3. Render Network (RNDR) – Fueling the Metaverse Render Network is addressing a major tech challenge—affordable GPU computing power. It enables creators, developers, and studios to rent decentralized GPU resources, reducing costs for AI, 3D rendering, and metaverse applications. As AI and metaverse adoption rise, the demand for computing power will only grow, and Render is ideally placed to meet this need. With the AI boom in full swing, Render is securing high-profile partnerships in Hollywood, gaming, and AI-driven projects, making it a vital infrastructure for digital creation. The conventional GPU market is costly and centralized, but Render’s decentralized model offers independent creators the same level of computing power as major studios. The demand for decentralized GPU rendering is skyrocketing, making Render one of the most overlooked 100x cryptos for 2025. As AI and 3D content creation continue to expand, projects offering essential backend services will see explosive growth. Render is at the forefront of this movement. 4. Polkadot (DOT) – The Blockchain Internet Polkadot is more than just a smart contract platform—it’s an ecosystem of interconnected blockchains. With its parachain technology, it allows multiple blockchains to operate autonomously while maintaining seamless communication. As the blockchain industry expands, interoperability becomes increasingly essential, and Polkadot is leading this charge. Polkadot’s ecosystem is thriving with new parachains, DeFi projects, and institutional adoption. As Web3 grows, Polkadot’s role in blockchain interoperability will only strengthen. Developers are increasingly choosing Polkadot over other platforms due to its flexibility and ability to scale without bottlenecks. Polkadot’s scalability, cross-chain functionality, and developer-friendly infrastructure make it a prime candidate for a 100x surge. It’s addressing a core issue in crypto—how to connect disparate blockchains in a way that’s both scalable and secure. 5. Hedera (HBAR) – The Corporate Blockchain Giant Hedera distinguishes itself with its Hashgraph technology, offering over 10,000 transactions per second, low fees, and carbon-negative operations. It’s already in use by Google, IBM, and Boeing for enterprise-level blockchain solutions. Hedera’s speed and efficiency make it perfect for large-scale corporate blockchain adoption. Hedera is forging more corporate partnerships, expanding tokenized real-world assets (RWA), DeFi, and green blockchain initiatives. Its collaborations with tech giants suggest long-term stability and real-world applications beyond mere speculation. With prominent backers, cutting-edge technology, and growing institutional adoption, Hedera has 100x potential in 2025. Its ability to integrate with major corporations differentiates it from traditional crypto projects. Conclusion: These 100x Cryptos Are Unmissable Opportunities like this are rare. These 100x crypto picks for 2025—Qubetics, Avalanche, Render, Polkadot, and Hedera—are not just promising; they’re addressing real issues and paving the way for mass adoption. As we approach 2025, savvy investors are moving in, and those who hesitate might find themselves chasing trends. Qubetics stands out with its Web3 aggregation, explosive presale, and unmatched ROI potential. Don't sit on the sidelines— join the Qubetics presale before the next price increase.

The publicly listed company, already known for its proactive approach to cryptocurrency investment, announced its latest acquisition of 269.43 BTC. This bold step underscores Metaplanet’s unwavering belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and further solidifies its position as a pioneering corporate adopter of digital assets. Metaplanet’s Continues Accumulating Bitcoin: What’s Driving This Strategy? Metaplanet’s recent announcement on X confirmed the purchase, bringing their total Bitcoin stash to an impressive 2,031.41 BTC as of February 17. This isn’t just a minor portfolio diversification; it’s a clear statement of intent. But what exactly is fueling this aggressive BTC investment strategy? Let’s delve into the key factors: Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating traditional markets, companies are increasingly looking for alternative assets to safeguard their treasury. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and limited supply, presents itself as an attractive option for diversification, potentially offering a hedge against inflation and economic downturns. Long-Term Value Proposition of Bitcoin: Metaplanet’s actions suggest a strong conviction in the long-term appreciation of Bitcoin . They are not just trading; they are accumulating, indicating a belief that Bitcoin’s value will continue to grow over time. This perspective is shared by many crypto enthusiasts and analysts who see Bitcoin as a nascent asset class with significant growth potential. Strategic Alignment with Future Finance: Embracing Bitcoin can be seen as a forward-thinking move, positioning Metaplanet at the forefront of financial innovation. As digital assets gain wider acceptance and integration into the global financial system, companies holding Bitcoin may be better positioned to navigate and capitalize on these evolving trends. Potential for Enhanced Returns: Compared to traditional low-yield investments, Bitcoin offers the potential for significantly higher returns, albeit with increased volatility. For companies seeking to optimize their treasury management and enhance returns, Bitcoin can be a compelling, albeit riskier, option. Decoding Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Why Metaplanet’s Move Matters Metaplanet’s continued investment in Bitcoin is more than just a company making a financial decision; it’s a significant case study in corporate Bitcoin adoption . As a publicly listed company in Japan , Metaplanet’s actions carry weight and can influence other corporations considering similar strategies. Here’s why their move is noteworthy: Setting a Precedent: Metaplanet is demonstrating a practical example of how a publicly traded company can incorporate Bitcoin into its treasury strategy. This real-world example can provide valuable insights and confidence to other businesses exploring the same path. Normalization of Bitcoin in Corporate Finance: Each instance of corporate adoption contributes to the normalization of Bitcoin as a legitimate and viable asset for businesses. Metaplanet’s continued investment reinforces this trend, pushing Bitcoin further into the mainstream of corporate finance. Geographical Significance – Japan’s Evolving Crypto Landscape: Metaplanet being a Japanese company adds another layer of intrigue. Japan has historically been at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption and regulation. Metaplanet’s bold move could signal a renewed wave of corporate interest in crypto within Japan and potentially across Asia. Navigating the Bitcoin Landscape: Benefits and Challenges for Corporations While the potential benefits of corporate Bitcoin adoption are becoming increasingly clear, it’s also crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that companies must navigate. Let’s weigh the pros and cons: Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin’s limited supply of 21 million coins positions it as a potential hedge against inflationary pressures, as fiat currencies can be subject to devaluation over time. Diversification and Reduced Correlation: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds can enhance portfolio diversification and potentially reduce overall risk. Enhanced Treasury Returns: In a low-interest-rate environment, Bitcoin offers the potential for significantly higher returns compared to traditional cash reserves or fixed-income investments. Brand Innovation and Market Positioning: Embracing Bitcoin can project an image of innovation and forward-thinking, potentially attracting a new generation of customers and investors. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and robust blockchain technology offer a secure and transparent alternative to traditional financial systems. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a significant concern for corporate treasuries. Companies need to have risk management strategies in place to mitigate potential downside risks. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies need to stay informed about and compliant with relevant regulations in their jurisdictions. Accounting and Tax Implications: Accounting standards and tax treatments for Bitcoin holdings are still developing. Companies need to understand and address these complexities. Security and Custody: Safeguarding Bitcoin holdings requires robust security measures and secure custody solutions to prevent theft or loss. Public Perception and Education: Companies may need to educate stakeholders, including investors and the public, about their Bitcoin strategy and address any potential concerns. Metaplanet as a Case Study: Actionable Insights for Aspiring Corporate Bitcoin Adopters Metaplanet’s journey into BTC investment offers valuable lessons for other companies considering a similar path. Here are some actionable insights gleaned from their example: Start with Strategic Alignment: Clearly define the reasons for considering Bitcoin adoption and ensure it aligns with the company’s overall financial strategy and risk tolerance. Develop a Robust Risk Management Framework: Volatility is inherent in the Bitcoin market. Implement comprehensive risk management strategies, including position sizing, dollar-cost averaging, and potentially hedging mechanisms. Prioritize Security and Custody: Invest in secure custody solutions and robust security protocols to protect Bitcoin holdings from theft or loss. Consider working with reputable custodians or implementing multi-signature wallets. Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. Maintain awareness of relevant regulations and ensure compliance in all jurisdictions where the company operates. Educate Stakeholders: Proactively communicate the company’s Bitcoin strategy to investors, employees, and other stakeholders. Address potential concerns and highlight the rationale behind the decision. Consider a Phased Approach: Companies may choose to start with a smaller allocation to Bitcoin and gradually increase their holdings as they gain experience and confidence. Conclusion: Metaplanet’s Audacious Bitcoin Bet – A Sign of Things to Come? Metaplanet’s latest Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful signal. It demonstrates a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset and underscores the potential for wider corporate Bitcoin adoption in the future. As more companies observe and learn from pioneers like Metaplanet, we may witness a significant shift in how businesses manage their finances in the digital age. The journey is not without its challenges, but the potential rewards of embracing this revolutionary asset class are becoming increasingly compelling. Metaplanet’s audacious bet on Bitcoin could very well be a harbinger of things to come, marking a new era in corporate finance and the accelerating integration of digital assets into the global economy.

40446886,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129415,1739786931,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Blockchain Analysis: MELANIA Token Developer Likely Mastermind Behind Controversial LIBRA,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/melania-libra-token-blockchain-analysis/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! A bombshell report just dropped, and it’s sending shockwaves through the digital asset world. Bubblemaps, a leading blockchain analytics platform, has unveiled a potentially explosive connection between the MELANIA token and the infamous LIBRA token. Could the same individuals be behind both ventures? Let’s dive deep into this developing story and uncover what this groundbreaking blockchain analysis reveals. Unveiling the Connection: What Does the Blockchain Analysis Show? Bubblemaps’ recent investigation, shared on X (formerly Twitter), points to a startling overlap in the addresses associated with the creation of both the MELANIA and LIBRA tokens. This isn’t just a minor coincidence; the data suggests a deliberate pattern. The core finding revolves around transaction histories and fund movements, meticulously tracked and visualized by Bubblemaps. Here’s a breakdown of the key points: Shared Addresses: Addresses involved in the initial setup and launch phases of the MELANIA token have also been linked to activities surrounding the LIBRA token. Sniper Trading Activity: Both token launches witnessed aggressive “sniper” trading. This involves sophisticated actors rapidly buying large amounts of tokens immediately upon launch to capitalize on initial price surges before dumping them for quick crypto profits . Profit Trails: A specific address, identified as “P5tb4,” stands out. This address reportedly raked in a staggering $2.4 million by trading MELANIA tokens shortly after launch. Fund Transfers to Key Wallets: Crucially, all the profits from address P5tb4 were then funneled into another wallet, labeled “0xcEA.” This 0xcEA wallet is strongly suspected to be associated with the creator of the MELANIA token. LIBRA Link and DEfcyK: Here’s where it gets even more interesting. Wallet 0xcEA also played a role in funding “DEfcyK,” identified as the creator of the controversial LIBRA token. DEfcyK allegedly withdrew a massive $87 million. Repeat Offender? Wallet 0xcEA didn’t just fund LIBRA; it also allegedly profited handsomely from sniping the LIBRA launch itself, amassing around $6 million in crypto profits . What is Sniper Trading and Why Does it Matter for Crypto Profits? Let’s demystify “sniper trading” and understand its implications. In the context of cryptocurrency launches, sniper bots are automated programs designed to execute trades within milliseconds of a token becoming available on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Here’s why this is a contentious issue: First-Mover Advantage: Sniping exploits the initial price discovery phase of a token. Before the broader market can react, snipers scoop up tokens at the lowest possible prices. Artificial Price Inflation: This rapid buying pressure can artificially inflate the token price in the very short term, creating a false sense of demand. Dump and Profit: Snipers then quickly sell off their holdings to regular investors who buy in at the inflated price, securing substantial crypto profits at the expense of others. Unfair Advantage: Critics argue that sniper trading gives an unfair advantage to those with the technical resources to deploy these bots, effectively front-running regular traders and manipulating market dynamics. In the case of MELANIA and LIBRA, the alleged sniper activity linked to addresses connected to their creators raises serious questions about fairness and transparency. LIBRA Token: A Recap of Controversy The LIBRA token, even its name itself carries a weight of controversy within the crypto space. For those unfamiliar, here’s a quick recap: Launched Amidst Hype: LIBRA emerged during a period of intense interest in meme coins and celebrity-endorsed tokens. Red Flags and Skepticism: However, from the outset, LIBRA was plagued by red flags. Lack of clear utility, vague promises, and aggressive marketing tactics raised eyebrows. Price Manipulation Allegations: Concerns about price manipulation and potential pump-and-dump schemes quickly surfaced within the crypto community. Investor Losses: Many investors who bought into the hype surrounding LIBRA reportedly suffered significant financial losses when the token’s price plummeted after the initial frenzy. The association of the MELANIA token with the controversial LIBRA token, through shared addresses and alleged developer connections, amplifies the concerns surrounding both projects. Is This Insider Trading? The Shadow of Suspicion The Bubblemaps report strongly suggests a pattern of potential insider trading . Let’s break down why this accusation is so serious and relevant to this situation: Aspect Description Relevance to MELANIA/LIBRA Case Definition of Insider Trading Using non-public, confidential information to gain an unfair advantage in trading financial instruments. If the creators of MELANIA and LIBRA used their privileged knowledge of launch timings and market-making activities to snipe their own tokens, it would fit this definition. Ethical and Legal Implications Insider trading is widely considered unethical and is often illegal in traditional financial markets. It erodes trust and market integrity. While crypto regulations are still evolving, the ethical implications are clear. Such actions damage the reputation of the crypto space and discourage legitimate participation. Bubblemaps Findings and Insider Trading The repeated pattern of wallet 0xcEA profiting from sniping both MELANIA and LIBRA launches, coupled with its funding of DEfcyK (LIBRA creator), strongly indicates potential insider trading activities. The $6 million and $2.4 million crypto profits generated from sniping, allegedly by wallets linked to the creators, are significant sums that raise serious red flags. While further investigation is needed to definitively prove insider trading in a legal sense, the evidence presented by Bubblemaps paints a concerning picture. The crypto community is now watching closely to see if regulatory bodies will take notice and investigate these allegations. MELANIA Token and LIBRA Token: What’s Next? The revelations from this blockchain analysis are still unfolding. Here are some key takeaways and questions moving forward: Reputational Damage: Both the MELANIA and LIBRA tokens, and any future projects associated with the involved individuals, will likely suffer significant reputational damage. Trust is paramount in crypto, and these allegations severely undermine it. Regulatory Scrutiny: This case could attract increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies regarding market manipulation and insider trading within the cryptocurrency space. Investor Awareness: This situation serves as a stark reminder for investors to exercise extreme caution when investing in new and hyped tokens, especially those with unclear origins or celebrity endorsements. Thorough due diligence is crucial. Need for Transparency: The crypto industry needs to prioritize transparency and accountability to build trust and attract mainstream adoption. Cases like this highlight the vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto? The alleged link between the MELANIA and LIBRA tokens, uncovered through meticulous blockchain analysis , is more than just a crypto drama. It’s a potential wake-up call. It underscores the risks of unchecked speculation, the allure of quick crypto profits , and the ever-present threat of malicious actors exploiting the decentralized nature of the crypto ecosystem. As the crypto space matures, robust mechanisms for transparency, accountability, and investor protection are not just desirable—they are essential for its long-term sustainability. Stay tuned as this story develops; the implications for the future of crypto regulation and investor confidence could be profound.

Analysts anticipate this momentum to continue in 2025, with growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin fueling the market’s rapid growth. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s price fluctuations continue to play a pivotal role in shaping the broader crypto market, ultimately determining the industry’s future trajectory. Reportedly, the crypto market’s continued growth is expected to hinge on BTC trends, with a key focus on whether it can sustain its current support level. Crypto Market to View Continued Growth in 2025 Despite a recent marginal drop of 1.13% in the market cap, the crypto space’s overall sentiment remains positive in 2025. The market has grown from a mere $1 trillion in 2023 to over $3.3 trillion in 2025. The market’s trading volume has also witnessed a massive surge, increasing from $40 billion to a whopping $400 billion. As reported by crypto financial services platform Matrixport , via an X post, this large-scale growth is primarily driven by the increasing adoption of Bitcoin. In addition, the BTC bull market has also largely influenced the crypto market growth. Bitcoin trading above its crucial support level could prevent panic selling, instead attracting more buyers and further fueling the market’s upward momentum. This, in turn, could help maintain investor confidence, supporting the ongoing market rally. Will Bitcoin Sustain the Crucial Support Zone? As highlighted by Matrixport, Bitcoin’s $90K support zone is crucial in maintaining the current bullish momentum in the crypto market. If Bitcoin holds this $90,000 support, investors will remain in profit, limiting the possibilities of a bearish dip. Notably, the support level pointed out by key analysts lies around $90k. As per Man of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency’s support is at $93,637. Similarly, ZAYKCharts has pinpointed a crucial support level for Bitcoin at approximately $93,000, suggesting that a breakout above this level could propel BTC to $130,000. Traders Remain Confident about a Market Rebound As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $96,106, down by 1.24% over the last 24 hours. It is noteworthy that the coin has been fluctuating between $92k and $100k over the past few days. This turbulent price action has resulted in a sharply divided market, characterized by uncertainty and conflicting views on its short-term direction. Despite facing significant bearish pressure, Bitcoin has consistently traded above $89,000 during the consolidation phase. This resilience is largely attributed to bulls buying the dips, particularly around the $90k mark. This reflects their conviction in Bitcoin’s potential for a rebound. As confidence in BTC surges, it reflects broader market confidence, with traders now expressing renewed optimism about the crypto market’s potential for development and expansion. Increased Adoption and Crypto Market Growth In a comprehensive analysis, market research platform Mordor Intelligence forecasted a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.77% for the cryptocurrency market through 2030. The market is expected to grow from $47.73 billion in 2025 to a substantial $69.39 billion by the end of the decade. Significantly, this prediction is based on the growing institutional adoption and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Large investment firms and institutions have increasingly adopted cryptocurrencies, with digital assets now accounting for 90% of their transactions. Also, the seamless integration of cryptocurrencies into payment infrastructure is fueling the market’s expansion Changing Regulatory Landscape: How It Influences Crypto Market? In addition to Bitcoin’s dominance, the changing crypto environment under President Donald Trump significantly influences the market growth. With his pro-crypto stance, Trump envisions fostering industrial development, solidifying the US’ position at the forefront of the global crypto market. The restructured Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brings hope to the crypto regulatory space. As the SEC takes a more crypto-friendly approach, the crypto market sees further growth and establishment. The SEC’s recent acknowledgement of the ETF filings submitted by major investment firms have also fueled expectations.

Standard Chartered, Animoca Brands and HKT to Launch HKD-Backed Stablecoin Joint Venture The partners plan to apply for a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as part of the government's effort to establish the region as a global digital asset hub. Strategic Collaboration for a Regulated Stablecoin The partnership brings together expertise in banking, Web3 and telecommunications: Standard Chartered will leverage its bank-grade infrastructure and experience in global stablecoin markets. The bank has actively participated in the HKMA’s tokenized currency projects and is committed to driving innovation in Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), tokenized deposits and stablecoins. Animoca Brands, a leading Web3 company, will contribute its extensive crypto network and expertise in blockchain ecosystems to develop use cases for stablecoins in decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital assets.

40446930,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129625,1739787033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Bets: The Rise of Bitcoin Gambling in India’s Betting Ecosystem!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-bets-the-rise-of-bitcoin-gambling-in-indias-betting-ecosystem/,"Bitcoin is changing how people gamble online, and more players turn to it daily. Cryptocurrency has already influenced many industries, and gambling is one of the biggest areas where its impact is growing. In India, gambling laws are complicated, and banks often refuse to process betting transactions. It makes it difficult for people to participate in online gambling the traditional way. Bitcoin is becoming a popular alternative because it allows players to place bets without using regular banks. Transactions between users and betting platforms can be made directly, avoiding government restrictions. Unlike credit card payments that may take days to process, Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals can be much faster. There are risks, though. Bitcoin is highly volatile, meaning that the value of winnings can rise or fall quickly. Some gambling platforms that accept Bitcoin are not regulated, increasing the chance of fraud. Without proper knowledge, players may lose money to scams or dishonest platforms Why People Like Bitcoin for Gambling Online gambling in India has many problems. Banks do not allow transactions related to betting, so players struggle to deposit and withdraw money. Bitcoin helps solve this problem. Gamblers can use it without restrictions since it does not go through banks. Privacy is another big reason people choose Bitcoin. Many bettors do not want their gambling history linked to their bank accounts. Bitcoin transactions do not need personal details, so users feel safer. It also works well for people who do not have easy access to banks but still want to bet online. Another advantage is speed. Traditional banking methods can take days for withdrawals. Bitcoin transactions can be much faster, often processing in minutes. Lower transaction costs also make it attractive. Many online casinos charge extra for card payments, but Bitcoin fees are usually lower. Crypto betting platforms also attract players by offering special promotions. Many sites provide lucrative bonuses for Bitcoin users, including deposit matches, free bets, and VIP rewards. Top platforms promote special deals through promotions like Batery bet promo codes , which players can use to unlock exclusive bonuses and enhance their betting experience. International betting platforms that accept Bitcoin have grown in popularity. Indian players are joining these sites because they do not have to worry about local restrictions. While it sounds great, not all platforms are safe. Without proper research, gamblers can end up using untrustworthy sites. Rules and Legal Issues India’s gambling laws vary by state. Some places allow gambling, while others ban it. Online betting is not legal or illegal, which makes things complicated. Bitcoin makes it even more confusing since no government can control it. The Indian government has not said whether using Bitcoin for gambling is legal. People continue to bet, but there are risks. If a platform turns out to be a scam, players have no legal way to get their money back. Unlike traditional casinos, some Bitcoin gambling sites do not have proper licenses. Even with the risks, Bitcoin gambling is still growing. Without clear rules, people will keep using it while regulators try to decide what to do. Risks and Benefits of Betting with Bitcoin Betting with Bitcoin can be exciting, but it also has dangers. The value of Bitcoin goes up and down. A player might win a big bet, but if Bitcoin’s value drops, their winnings could be worth much less. Security is another concern. Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed. If a player deposits money on a fake website, they will not be able to get it back. Some platforms disappear overnight, taking all user funds with them. Despite the risks, many bettors like using Bitcoin. It gives them access to betting sites they could not use otherwise and helps them avoid banking problems. Faster payments and lower fees are bonuses, but gamblers must be careful where they bet. Final Thoughts Bitcoin betting is growing fast. More people are using it, and authorities are taking notice. The Indian government is working on cryptocurrency regulations, but gambling laws remain unclear. If regulations are introduced, they could make Bitcoin gambling safer. Licensed platforms would be more trustworthy, and scammers would have a harder time tricking players. However, if strict rules are enforced, gamblers might move to underground betting options. For now, Bitcoin gambling in India is unregulated. Players take risks using it, but many believe it is the future of online betting. Whether the government bans it or sets new rules, Bitcoin’s role in gambling only increases.",Crypto News|Press Release|Crypto Bets,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-02-17 10:10:33

Dawgz AI isn't just another meme coin. it's shaking up the crypto space with a blend of AI-driven trading, staking rewards, and a community that actually believes in long-term growth. But what does the future hold for $DAGZ, and how do you get in before it potentially skyrockets? In this guide, we’ll break down everything you need to know, from what makes Dawgz AI unique to its price prediction and the best way to buy Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) before it lands on major exchanges. Understanding Dawgz AI The world of meme coins is overflowing with projects that skyrocket overnight only to fizzle out just as quickly. But Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is positioning itself differentlyby integrating AI trading into a meme-powered ecosystem. While it still embraces the humor and community-driven nature of meme culture, Dawgz AI offers features designed for growth rather than just short-term speculation. What is Dawgz AI? The Hottest AI Meme Coin Right Now At its core, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is a meme coin that takes things a step further by incorporating AI trading strategies and staking incentives. Instead of being just another speculative token that relies solely on social media, it brings real utility to investors who want to optimize trading strategies and generate passive revenue through staking. The project is designed to be both entertaining and rewarding, with a focus on strong community engagement, early adoption benefits, and upcoming features that set it apart from the usual meme tokens. While most meme coins depend on hype alone, Dawgz AI is structured to bring long-term investors into the fold by offering features that create sustainable value. Here’s what makes Dawgz AI unique: AI-powered tools that analyze market trends and provide insights for traders. Lucrative rewards from staking that allow holders to earn passive income rather than relying solely on price appreciation. A fast-growing community, leveraging meme culture while building real investor interest. Presale access for investors, offering lower prices before listing on major exchanges. How to Purchase $DAGZ Buying Dawgz AI is a straightforward process, whether you’re looking to secure tokens at presale prices or purchase them later on exchanges. The earlier you get in, the better your chances of earning passive revenue from staking rewards and benefiting from growth as the project expands. In this section, we’ll walk you through exactly how to purchase $DAGZ, both during the presale and after it’s listed on exchanges. Buying $DAGZ During the Dawgz AI Presale The presale is the best opportunity for investors to buy $DAGZ at a lower price before it hits exchanges. This phase is crucial because once the token is publicly available, demand is expected to drive prices higher. Here’s how you can secure your $DAGZ before the presale ends: Step 1: Set Up a Crypto Wallet To participate in the presale, you’ll need a crypto wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens (Ethereum-based tokens). Recommended options include: MetaMask (Browser extension & mobile app) Trust Wallet (Mobile app) Phantom Wallet (For Solana-based transactions) Make sure your wallet is set to the Ethereum (ERC-20) network before proceeding. Step 2: Fund Your Wallet with Crypto The presale accepts multiple cryptocurrencies, including: Ethereum (ETH) Tether (USDT – ERC-20) Binance Coin (BNB – BEP-20) Solana (SOL) USD Coin (USDC – ERC-20 or BEP-20) To fund your wallet, you can either: Purchase ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL, or USDC from an exchange like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken and transfer it to your wallet. Use a wallet’s built-in buy crypto feature if available. Step 3: Visit the Official Dawgz AI Presale Page Once your wallet is funded, go to the official presale website. Always double-check the URL to avoid scams. Step 4: Select Your Payment Method & Enter Purchase Amount Choose the cryptocurrency you’ll use to buy $DAGZ. Enter the amount you’d like to invest. The system will calculate how many $DAGZ tokens you’ll receive. Step 5: Confirm Your Transaction Click “Buy” and approve the transaction in your crypto wallet. Pay a small gas fee (Ethereum transactions require a gas fee). Wait for the transaction to confirm on the blockchain. Step 6: Stake Your Tokens for Extra Rewards (Optional) After purchasing, you can choose to stake your Dawgz token immediately to start earning staking rewards. This allows you to earn passive revenue while holding onto your tokens. Step 7: Claim Your Tokens After the Presale Ends If you didn’t stake your tokens, you’ll need to claim them once the presale is over. The Dawgz AI team will announce the claiming process, so keep an eye on their social media and official updates. Buying $DAGZ After the Presale (Exchange Listings & Trading) Once the presale ends, $DAGZ will be listed on major exchanges, making it available to a broader audience. Here’s how you can buy it post-launch: Step 1: Find a Supported Exchange Dawgz AI will be available on both decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs). Likely platforms include: Uniswap (DEX – Best for early trading) PancakeSwap (If listed on Binance Smart Chain) Binance, Coinbase, or KuCoin (Potential future CEX listings) Step 2: Transfer Funds to Your Exchange Account If you’re using a CEX, deposit ETH, USDT, or BNB to trade for $DAGZ. If you’re using a DEX, ensure your crypto wallet is funded and connected to the exchange. Step 3: Swap ETH/USDT for $DAGZ On Uniswap or another DEX, search for $DAGZ and swap ETH or USDT for it. If liquidity pools are set up properly, the transaction should be smooth. Step 4: Store Your $DAGZ in a Secure Wallet Once purchased, transfer your $DAGZ tokens to a secure wallet (like MetaMask or Trust Wallet) for safekeeping. Which Buying Option is Best? Both presale and post-listing purchases have their advantages: Buying During Presale: Lower prices before public trading. Immediate staking rewards and passive revenue opportunities. Less risk of price fluctuations compared to open-market trading. Buying After Exchange Listings: Easier access through well-known exchanges. More liquidity for buying and selling. Less risk of presale sell-offs. Dawgz AI Price Prediction: How High Can $DAGZ Go? The Dawgz AI price prediction has been a hot topic among investors, with many wondering how high $DAGZ could climb after its presale and once it hits exchanges. While no one can predict the crypto market with absolute certainty, we can analyze market trends, tokenomics, staking, and AI trading utility to make an educated estimate of where $DAGZ could go in the short and long term. This section will break down short-term, mid-term, and long-term price predictions, factors influencing market cap growth, and how Dawgz AI compares to other meme coins that have exploded in value. What Influences Dawgz AI’s Price? Key Market Factors Several elements can impact how high $DAGZ might climb, including: 1. Staking Rewards and Token Scarcity With staking rewards incentivizing investors to hold their $DAGZ tokens, a significant portion of the supply could be locked up, reducing available liquidity. When fewer tokens are circulating, demand naturally pushes prices up. 2. Dawgz AI Presale Demand and Early Investors A strong presale phase often indicates future success. If investors continue to stake and hold instead of selling immediately, it could prevent price crashes after exchange listings. 3. Exchange Listings and Market Liquidity Once $DAGZ gets listed on major exchanges, increased exposure could bring a flood of new buyers, further driving demand. If the token secures listings on top-tier platforms like Binance, KuCoin, or Coinbase, the price could surge significantly. 4. Growth of AI-Driven Trading Features The more AI-powered tools Dawgz AI integrates, the more long-term value it brings. If traders find trading bots useful for optimizing trading strategies, this could create sustained demand. 5. Meme Culture and Community Hype Many meme coins thrive on trends and community-driven hype. If Dawgz AI maintains strong community engagement, this could fuel long-term success similar to Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. Short-Term Dawgz AI Price Prediction (Post-Presale & Early Exchange Listings) Immediately after the presale ends, early buyers may look to take profits, which could cause some price fluctuations. If staking incentives encourage investors to earn passive revenue rather than sell, we could see steady price appreciation instead of a dump. Short-Term Price Drivers: Increased demand from investors who missed the presale. Staking reducing the circulating supply, pushing prices up. Exchange listings attracting more buyers. Estimated Short-Term Price Range: Low estimate: 2x-4x increase from the presale price. High estimate: 5x-7x if demand surges quickly after listings. Mid-Term Dawgz AI Price Prediction (3-6 Months After Launch) By this stage,$DAGZ will likely have expanded its staking ecosystem, gained more exchange listings, and started rolling out additional AI-powered features. If community engagement remains high, it could maintain steady growth. Mid-Term Price Drivers: More liquidity from exchanges. Expansion of AI trading features. Increased adoption from crypto traders looking for staking rewards. Estimated Mid-Term Price Range: Low estimate: 6x-10x from the presale price. High estimate: 10x-15x if AI integration and marketing efforts boost adoption. Long-Term Dawgz AI Price Prediction (1-2 Years and Beyond) The long-term price outlook for $DAGZ depends on mass adoption, continued development, and how well it establishes itself beyond just a meme coin. If the project secures institutional partnerships, expands its AI-driven trading offerings, and maintains a dedicated community, it could become a top player in the crypto space. Long-Term Price Drivers: Mainstream adoption of AI-powered trading tools. Continued staking rewards attracting long-term holders. Potential integration with DeFi platforms and AI projects. Estimated Long-Term Price Range: Low estimate: $0.05 if growth remains steady but limited. High estimate: $0.10+ if $DAGZ becomes a widely used AI-powered crypto. How Dawgz AI Stands Out from Other Meme Coins The meme coin market is notoriously unpredictable, with many projects launching simply to take advantage of fleeting hype. However, Dawgz AI is different in several key ways: 1. AI-Driven Trading Tools for Smarter Crypto Moves Unlike standard meme tokens, Dawgz AI integrates AI trading bots that provide insights for both novice and experienced traders. These AI-powered tools analyze the crypto market, helping investors make informed trading decisions instead of blindly speculating. 2. Staking Rewards for Passive Income Most meme coins require investors to rely entirely on price appreciation to make money. Dawgz AI, however, offers staking rewards, allowing holders to earn passive revenue by locking up their tokens. This strategy helps stabilize the ecosystem and reduces selling pressure. 3. Strong Community Engagement Successful meme coins thrive on community support, and Dawgz AI is building a strong, engaged following that actively contributes to its growth. This community-first approach ensures long-term interest and reduces the risk of short-lived hype cycles. 4. Real Use Cases Beyond Speculation Many meme coins exist purely for entertainment, with no real-world application. Dawgz AI is different, its AI trading features and staking incentives provide investors with actual tools that can enhance their crypto trading experience. 5. Upcoming Listings on Major Exchanges As the presale moves forward, plans for listings on exchanges are in place. This is a major advantage for investors looking for liquidity and exposure to a broader market. Tokens that make it to exchanges tend to see significant price action, as demand increases from mainstream traders. Why Dawgz AI Presale is Attracting Early Investors Every major crypto success story starts with investors who spot potential before the wider market catches on. The official presale is currently one of the best opportunities to get in early on a high-potential meme coin before it reaches exchanges. Key Benefits of Buying During the Presale: Discounted Prices: Buying $DAGZ during the presale means securing tokens at a lower cost before open-market trading begins. Immediate Staking Rewards: Investors who buy early can earn passive revenue from staking before the token even lists publicly. Limited Supply for First Investors: Presale allocations are capped, meaning once they’re gone, new buyers will have to purchase at market-driven prices. Potential for High ROI: Many successful crypto projects see significant price increases after launch, getting in early increases the chances of maximizing returns. Community Involvement from the Start: Presale participants become part of a growing community that helps shape the project’s direction. Dawgz AI Tokenomics: Breaking Down the $DAGZ Supply Tokenomics plays a crucial role in the long-term success of any cryptocurrency. A well-structured token distribution model can determine how sustainable a project is and whether it can attract long-term investors rather than just short-term speculators. Dawgz AI has designed its tokenomics to reward investors, incentivize staking, and support long-term growth in the crypto space. Let’s break down how the supply of $DAGZ is allocated, why staking rewards matter, and how its market cap could develop over time. Understanding the $DAGZ Supply and Distribution Dawgz AI has a carefully planned total supply designed to maintain balance within its ecosystem. Instead of dumping large amounts of tokens onto the market all at once, its distribution is structured to encourage strong community engagement, long-term holding, and staking incentives. Breakdown of the Dawgz AI Token Supply: Presale Allocation: A portion of tokens is set aside for the presale, allowing investors to buy at lower prices before the token reaches exchanges. Liquidity Pool: To ensure smooth trading and prevent extreme price fluctuations, a percentage of the supply is dedicated to liquidity when it gets listed. Staking Rewards: A significant portion of the total supply is allocated for staking rewards, allowing holders to earn passive revenue by locking up their tokens. Marketing and Development: Funds are set aside for growing the Dawgz AI brand through social media trends, partnerships, and influencer marketing. Team and Project Growth: A small allocation is reserved for project developers and ongoing enhancements to AI trading bots and crypto trading integrations. Why Staking Rewards Matter for Dawgz AI Holders One of the standout features of Dawgz AI is its staking rewards system, which allows investors to earn passive revenue while holding onto their tokens. Instead of relying solely on price appreciation, staking gives holders an additional way to grow their investments over time. How Staking Rewards Work: Investors stake their Dawgz token by locking them in a staking pool. Staked tokens earn rewards over time, based on the duration and amount staked. Rewards are distributed regularly, providing a consistent stream of earnings. Long-term investors benefit most, as staking reduces circulating supply and creates a scarcity effect that can drive price appreciation. Benefits of Staking Dawgz AI: Passive revenue generation without needing to trade actively. Encourages long-term holding, reducing sell pressure. Strengthens the Dawgz AI ecosystem by rewarding community members. Dawgz AI Market Cap and Growth Potential A cryptocurrency’s market cap (total value of all circulating tokens) is a key indicator of its growth potential. While meme coins often start with a low market cap, strong projects with engaged communities and real utility tend to see significant appreciation over time. What Could Drive Dawgz AI’s Market Cap Higher? Increased demand from presale investors once the token lists on exchanges. Wider adoption of AI trading features, making the project more appealing to traders. Staking participation, which removes tokens from circulation, creating scarcity. Community expansion through social media and influencer marketing. Dawgz AI Roadmap: The Future of $DAGZ A solid roadmap is one of the most important factors in determining the long-term success of a crypto project. Unlike speculative tokens that launch without a clear direction, Dawgz AI has a structured plan designed to ensure its growth and expansion. The Dawgz AI roadmap outlines key milestones, from its presale phase to future exchange listings, AI trading integrations, and long-term ecosystem enhancements. By looking at what’s ahead, investors can better understand where $DAGZ is heading and how it plans to establish itself as a dominant force in the crypto space. Phase 1: Dawgz AI Presale and Early Adoption The official Dawgz AI presale marks the first step in making $DAGZ accessible to investors. This phase is crucial as it allows the project to raise initial funding, build community engagement, and attract serious investors before launching on major exchanges. Key Highlights of Phase 1: Presale begins, allowing early investors to buy Dawgz AI at a lower price. Staking rewards become available, enabling holders to earn passive income immediately. Initial marketing push through social media trends and influencer collaborations. Community building efforts to create a strong, dedicated following around the project. Phase 2: Exchange Listings & AI-Driven Trading Features Once the presale is complete, the focus shifts toward expanding the token’s availability and utility. This includes securing listings on exchanges, increasing liquidity, and rolling out the first version of its AI-powered trading tools. By listing on multiple exchanges and introducing AI trading, Dawgz AI will transition from a meme coin with potential to a full-fledged crypto asset with real-world application. What to Expect in Phase 2: Listing on exchanges, making $DAGZ accessible to a larger audience. Liquidity pools established, ensuring smooth trading and price stability. Launch of AI trading bots, providing insights and strategies to help optimize trading decisions. Increased staking participation, as more investors take advantage of staking rewards. Phase 3: Expanding the Dawgz AI Ecosystem To ensure long-term growth, Dawgz AI isn’t stopping at basic trading bots and exchange listings. This phase focuses on expanding the project’s ecosystem, introducing new AI-powered tools, and forming strategic partnerships that further solidify its presence in the crypto space. Key Developments in Phase 3: Enhancements to AI-driven trading algorithms, offering better analysis and predictions. Expansion into DeFi and staking pools, allowing holders to earn even more rewards. Community-driven governance model, giving holders a say in future updates. Increased media presence, with more exposure through crypto influencers and major news outlets. Phase 4: Institutional Growth & Global Adoption The final phase of the Dawgz AI roadmap focuses on mass adoption, institutional involvement, and long-term scaling. As AI technology and crypto trading continue to evolve, $DAGZ aims to position itself as a leader in the AI-powered meme coin sector.

The winds of institutional adoption are blowing stronger than ever. In a move that’s sending ripples through the digital asset space, news has broken that Paul Tudor Jones, the legendary hedge fund titan, is making a significant play in the Bitcoin ETF arena. And not just any ETF – we’re talking about BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. Let’s dive into the details of this groundbreaking development and explore what it means for the future of crypto. Why is Paul Tudor Jones’ IBIT Investment a BIG Deal? For those unfamiliar, Paul Tudor Jones isn’t just another name in finance. He’s a billionaire hedge fund manager with a reputation for prescient market calls. His firm’s reported $426.9 million investment in IBIT is not just a drop in the ocean; it’s a powerful statement. Here’s why this news is creating such a buzz: Validation from a Wall Street Legend: Paul Tudor Jones’ involvement lends immense credibility to Bitcoin and the burgeoning Bitcoin ETF market. His firm’s investment signals to other institutional investors that Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class worthy of serious consideration. Significant Capital Inflow: $426.9 million is a substantial amount, especially for a relatively new investment vehicle like spot Bitcoin ETFs. This injection of capital can contribute to increased demand for Bitcoin and potentially drive up its price. Broader Institutional Trend: This move by Paul Tudor Jones’ firm could be indicative of a larger trend. Many institutional investors have been waiting on the sidelines, seeking regulated and accessible ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT are providing that avenue. Increased Market Liquidity: Institutional participation typically brings greater liquidity to the market. Higher trading volumes in Bitcoin ETFs can lead to tighter spreads and smoother trading for all investors, both large and small. Spot Bitcoin ETF: IBIT – A Game Changer for Crypto Adoption? BlackRock’s IBIT, or iShares Bitcoin Trust, is at the heart of this story. Spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT are revolutionary because they directly hold actual Bitcoin. This differs from previous Bitcoin ETFs that were based on futures contracts. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US has been a watershed moment, opening the doors for a wider range of investors to access Bitcoin through traditional investment channels. Key Features of IBIT and Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Feature Spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) Futures-Based Bitcoin ETF Underlying Asset Actual Bitcoin Bitcoin Futures Contracts Direct Bitcoin Exposure Yes Indirect Tracking Error Potentially Lower Potentially Higher due to futures roll costs Investor Accessibility Wider range of investors, including institutional Primarily retail and sophisticated traders initially Regulatory Approval (US) Recently Approved (2024) Approved earlier Institutional Investment in Bitcoin: What are the Benefits? The entry of institutional giants like Paul Tudor Jones’ firm into the Bitcoin space brings a host of potential benefits to the crypto ecosystem: Increased Market Maturity: Institutional involvement elevates the perceived legitimacy and maturity of the Bitcoin market. This can attract further investment and foster greater stability over time. Price Stability and Reduced Volatility?: While Bitcoin is known for its volatility, increased institutional participation, with their longer-term investment horizons, might contribute to reduced price swings in the long run. (Note: Bitcoin will likely remain volatile, but institutional investment could moderate extreme fluctuations). Enhanced Liquidity and Trading Efficiency: As mentioned earlier, institutional trading adds depth and liquidity to the market, making it more efficient and easier to execute large trades without significant price impact. Innovation and Product Development: Institutional interest can spur further innovation in the crypto space, leading to the development of new financial products and services centered around Bitcoin and other digital assets. Challenges and Considerations for Bitcoin ETF and Institutional Adoption While the Paul Tudor Jones’ IBIT investment and broader institutional adoption are overwhelmingly positive developments, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional involvement will likely bring greater regulatory attention to the crypto market. While regulation can provide structure and protection, overly restrictive regulations could stifle innovation. Market Manipulation Concerns: With larger players entering the market, concerns about potential market manipulation might arise. Robust surveillance and regulatory oversight are crucial to maintain market integrity. Custodial Risks: Ensuring the secure custody of large amounts of Bitcoin held by institutions and ETFs is paramount. Robust security measures and reputable custodians are essential. Impact on Decentralization: Some purists worry that increased institutional involvement could dilute the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin. It’s crucial to strike a balance between institutional participation and the core principles of decentralization. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should you, as a crypto enthusiast or potential investor, take away from this news? Bitcoin’s Long-Term Narrative Strengthens: The Paul Tudor Jones’ IBIT investment reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is not just a fleeting trend but a legitimate asset class with long-term potential. Consider Diversification: If you’re interested in gaining Bitcoin exposure, spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT offer a regulated and accessible option within traditional investment portfolios. However, always remember to diversify and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on institutional adoption trends and regulatory developments in the crypto space. These factors will significantly shape the future of the market. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, conduct thorough research on Bitcoin, Bitcoin ETFs, and the broader crypto market. Understand the risks and rewards involved. Conclusion: The Dawn of Institutional Bitcoin is Upon Us Paul Tudor Jones’ firm’s $426.9 million investment in BlackRock’s IBIT is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful indicator of the evolving landscape of crypto. It signals a significant step towards mainstream institutional adoption of Bitcoin, potentially ushering in a new era of growth, maturity, and stability for the digital asset. While challenges remain, the momentum is undeniable. The smart money is moving into Bitcoin, and the world is watching. This is just the beginning of a truly fascinating chapter in the Bitcoin story.

Here’s the Implication,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-doge-forms-death-cross-with-200-day-ma-heres-the-implication/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) , the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has flashed a potentially bearish signal, according to renowned Chartist, Ali. In a recent post on X , Ali pointed out that Dogecoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has just crossed below its 200-day moving average (MA)—a pattern known as a “death cross.” Historically, this has been a precursor to significant price declines. What Is the MVRV Ratio? The MVRV ratio measures an asset’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization (the price at which coins last moved on-chain). This indicates if an asset is overvalued or undervalued. When the MVRV ratio is above the 200-day MA, it often signals strength, as the market is willing to price the asset above its long-term realized value. However, when it falls below the 200-day MA, it suggests declining investor confidence and a possible downtrend. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Chart/ Ali Historical Precedent Ali highlighted that the last two instances of this death cross resulted in sharp corrections for DOGE . The first occurrence led to a 26% decline, while the second saw prices drop by 44%. Given this pattern, traders and investors are now bracing for another potential downturn. The market has often reacted strongly to such signals, with investors taking precautionary measures or preparing for potential accumulation at lower levels. Current Market Context Dogecoin has been trading amidst market turbulence, mirroring broader market sentiment. While Bitcoin and major altcoins have seen renewed volatility, DOGE has struggled to break key resistance levels. The appearance of this death cross could add downward pressure, especially if macroeconomic factors and market-wide sentiment remain weak. The cryptocurrency market has been highly reactive to such technical signals, and with Dogecoin already facing resistance, this could be another catalyst for a pullback. What’s Next for DOGE? If history repeats, DOGE could be in for a double-digit percentage drop. Traders should watch key support zones around psychological levels like $0.07 and $0.06. A breach of these levels could accelerate selling pressure, leading to further declines. However, if Dogecoin finds strong support after a pullback, it could present a buying opportunity for long-term holders. Historically, sharp corrections in DOGE have often been followed by strong rebounds, driven by retail enthusiasm and market sentiment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another crucial factor to watch is Bitcoin’s price movement. As with most altcoins, Dogecoin’s trajectory is closely tied to Bitcoin’s overall trend. A strong BTC rally could mitigate some of the bearish effects on DOGE, while further downside in Bitcoin could exacerbate Dogecoin’s weakness. Market participants should also monitor trading volume and whale activity, as these could indicate whether the selling pressure is intensifying or if accumulation is taking place. The MVRV death cross is a concerning signal for Dogecoin holders, especially given its historical impact. While past performance does not guarantee future results, traders should approach DOGE with caution in the short term. Monitoring price action and key support levels will assess whether this bearish setup plays out as expected. Ali’s analysis serves as a valuable heads-up for market participants, emphasizing the importance of historical patterns in crypto trading. As always, traders should combine technical signals with a broader market context before making investment decisions.

Although Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are big names in crypto, most investors have now shifted their attention to projects that offer solutions to real-world problems. FXGuys ($FXG) is one of the most promising crypto projects of this year, with its trader-focused ecosystem revolutionizing how people earn in crypto. Is it time to trade old coins for new blockchain solutions? Read on to find out what experts say! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Litecoin Has Stability, But Growth Is Limited Litecoin has been a stalwart digital currency for the better part of the decade. In its lifetime, many events have moved its price, including when Canary Capital filed an S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the first Litecoin ETF, which will spur institutional interest in LTC. As of February 10, 2025, Litecoin is valued at $116 . Recent updates, such as MimbleWimble Extension Blocks , finally fixed the two most important blockchain issues: privacy and scalability, making LTC more usable in payments. But the real question is: Does Litecoin maintain relevance in this DeFi-driven world? The more traders and institutions seek to leverage multi-utility crypto assets to drive their investments, the more Litecoin risks being pushed into the background. Dogecoin: How Much Higher Can the King of Meme Coins Go? As one of the top meme coins, DOGE has survived on community hype alone, supported by Elon Musk. Only recently did Grayscale Investments introduce the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust to grant investors exposure to DOGE, reflecting the broader institutional interest. More recently, the director of the Dogecoin Foundation hinted that future partnerships with major American brands are in the works to develop further DOGE’s adoption for making payments. As of February 10, 2025, Dogecoin’s DOGE is trading at approximately $0.25 . Valour launched a DOGE Exchange-Traded Product , or ETP, in Sweden—the doorway for institutional investors. But at what cost—making it a viable blockchain solution? As one of the top meme coins, DOGE is still fun and viral. However, serious money is moving onto platforms that can offer structured earning opportunities instead of relying on social media-fueled price jumps. FXGuys: The New Blockchain Solution for Crypto Traders FXGuys is not just a cryptocurrency but an ecosystem in trading for active and passive earners. On the other hand, Litecoin and Dogecoin are highly speculative, especially in the current market. They stand in contrast to all the ways FXGuys gives their users to earn, trade, and grow their holdings with real utility. One amazing feature is the FXGuys Trader Funding Program, which allows traders to access up to $500,000 in trading capital. This eliminates every financial barrier when a traditional risk assumption does not require profit maximization. Not one blockchain solution gives access to that level of capital. What’s more, FXGuys doesn’t require KYC checks. While most of these services jump through hoops, verifying identity, FXGuys will make it possible to trade instantly without asking for one piece of your documentation. No need to wait for your request to be processed; just jump right into the thick of it. You are at the head of your data while embracing each perk at FXGuys. FXGuys also brings a Trade2Earn system that, once you make a trade, some reward in the form of $FXG tokens always comes your way. Cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin or Dogecoin wait for the price move, while FXGuys actively rewards you for staying active within its platform. Whether a pro trader or a fresher, the program benefits your portfolio with each trade. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE The Best Cryptocurrency to Buy Now: It’s Time to Trade Old Coins for $FXG! The hottest presale in town is currently underway. $FXG is available in Stage 3 of its public presale at $0.05. Early investors who got in at the Seed Funding Round will receive a 900% ROI, and those getting in now during this stage will be able to lock in a 100% gain at launch, with the launch price set at $0.10. Demand is going through the roofs now, with over $4 million already raised and 78% of Stage 3 tokens sold. As the presale moves forward, $FXG is quickly shaping up to be the best cryptocurrency of 2025. Unlike Litecoin and Dogecoin, which have seen their biggest gains, FXGuys is still in its early stages and has massive growth potential. Experts are optimistic that $FXG will see a 100x rise in its price after its launch on multiple exchanges. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big evolution in blockchain!

The SEC accepted Grayscale’s call for an XRP ETF; that decision aroused interest in Ripple’s XRP and cleared a path for institutional use. XRP pairs with FedNow services, showing bright prospects for cross-border payments. At the same time, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) finds its space, secures investor notice with a play-to-earn gaming plan and runs a presale that captures focus. This article examines how these moves affect XRP price and explains why Yeti Ouro stands out as a promising investment having just moved into Stage 3 of its presale. XRP: Market Impact And Recent Developments Ripple’s XRP leads the news thanks to several key moments. The SEC accepted Grayscale’s XRP ETF application, a historic step that gives investors a regulated route for XRP. This may affect XRP price because it draws traditional investors into crypto using a familiar method. XRP works with FedNow services after recent deals with bank firms, which have put XRP among the main helpers in real-time payments and are driving more demand. Currently, XRP’s price sits near $3.13 ; its market cap has reached $157.4 billion, making it the third biggest cryptocurrency. The investor mood lifts with these events, and many in the group hope for cost gains. Experts see the price move toward $5 if the ETF path clears and the FedNow tie wins approval. Yeti Ouro (YETIO): A Game-Changing Investment Yeti Ouro stands out in the crypto market with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game Yeti Go. The game built on Unreal Engine 5 creates an engaging experience where players receive YETIO tokens as rewards. This mix of gaming along with blockchain tech adds value to the token or makes it more useful for players. Investors are now making a strategic shift, betting on security, utility and decentralized financial infrastructure as the future of crypto innovation. This makes YETIO a top contender in the cryptocurrency market. The developers have joined forces with the talented creators behind Call of Duty, Spider-Man, Dead Space, and The Witcher to craft outstanding character assets, while Grammy-nominated industry professionals compose the audio, drawing inspiration from their work with Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid. The financial outlook for YETIO shows promise. A positive response to the Yeti Ouro token presale proves that investors trust the project. The token sells at $0.024 now in Stage 3, with a 10% extra reward for all buyers. These presale details point to market confidence in the project’s future. The project progressed to Stage 3 today having sold more than 200M tokens already, increasing the price to $0.024 per YETIO token and granting early investors a return exceeding 100%. Tokenomics and Presale: Unlocking High Investment Potential The tokenomics of Yeti Ouro are designed to incentivize long-term holding and participation. The project has implemented a strategic burn mechanism to reduce supply and drive token scarcity. This approach, combined with a capped total supply of 1 billion tokens, lays a solid foundation for price appreciation. The financial setup of Yeti Go lets players turn their game success into actual value through in-game purchases as well as token staking. This setup keeps players active or makes YETIO more valuable for investors who see future benefits in the project. Why Yeti Ouro Could Be The Best Investment Of 2025 The comparison of Yeti Ouro with major cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu shows a distinct mix of profit potential and practical value. YETIO’s Play-to-Earn platform provides real returns when users take part in games, which makes it different from basic meme coins that depend on market opinions. A combination of these features points to a possible rise in market value as new updates or the full release of Yeti Go takes place. Conclusion In summary, XRP has made significant moves with the acceptance of its ETF by the SEC and its link to FedNow. Analysts hope it will hit $5 or more soon. Yeti Ouro stands apart because it features a play-to-earn model, fixed smart contracts and a successful presale. Market signs and investor views next to the coin’s plan give it a chance for further gains in 2025. Investors seeking cryptocurrencies that serve a purpose and offer room for gains may choose early options like Yeti Ouro as it joins a gaming model with money matters from the blockchain.

The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. ""U.S. listed bitcoin miners are increasing their share of the network hashrate, leveraging access to capital, land and power,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. These companies grew their share of the Bitcoin network to around 29% in January, from about 20% a year ago, the report said, adding that large miners aggressively expanded their hashrates in 2024. IREN (IREN) is growing its hashrate the fastest, followed by CleanSpark (CLSK), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and MARA Holdings (MARA), Bernstein said. Bernstein has an outperform rating on IREN (PT $26), CleanSpark (PT $30) and Riot Platforms (PT $22). MARA Holdings (PT $23) is market-perform rated. IREN, MARA Holdings and CleanSpark all performed well on ""power efficiency and uptime"" the report added. Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) said January was a quiet month for hashrate growth.

With volatility at historic lows, the market remains directionless as geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty weigh on sentiment. Over the past week, Bitcoin’s peak-to-trough movement was just 4.3 percent, closing with a modest 0.82 percent gain, underscoring the lack of either strong buying or selling pressure. Altcoins have suffered significant losses , with meme coins like PEPE plunging 46.4 percent over the past month, while OM, LTC , and HYPE remain the only large caps posting gains. BTC/USD Daily Chart. (Source: Bitfinex) Bitcoin’s Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP)—a useful indicator of market sentiment—has turned bearish for the first time since June 2024, suggesting potential downside. The IFP records moves in BTC exchange flows from derivatives wallets to spot wallets suggesting reduced risk appetite , and this can often lead to market corrections. Meanwhile, realised losses have spiked during recent re-tests of range lows, mirroring past capitulation events within the ongoing bull cycle. Despite signs of near-term market heaviness, Bitcoin remains, however, structurally intact. Historically, 81-day consolidation phases resolve within 90 days, meaning a decisive breakout—up or down—could be imminent. The US economic landscape is also facing a renewed challenge as inflation surged in January 2025, marking the most significant rise in consumer prices in nearly 18 months. The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 percent for the month, pushing the year-on-year inflation rate to 3 percent—exceeding market expectations. The unexpected inflationary surge comes at a time when the Federal Reserve has maintained restrictive monetary policies to control price stability, making an imminent rate cut unlikely. The labour market remains strong , with rising wages fueling consumer demand, further complicating efforts to control inflation. Consumer Price Index (Source: Macromicro) Adding to inflation concerns, the Producer Price Index climbed by 0.4 percent in January, following a 0.5 percent rise in December, marking the sharpest two-month increase in nearly a year. The acceleration in wholesale prices indicates persistent inflationary pressures in the supply chain, making it more difficult for businesses to absorb rising costs without passing them on to consumers. Initially, markets priced in several interest rate reductions, but with inflation proving more stubborn than anticipated, the Federal Reserve may keep rates elevated for longer, impacting borrowing costs and business investment. It is true that US retail sales sharply declined in January, falling by 0.9 percent, and marking the most significant drop in nearly two years. But this downturn was primarily attributed to adverse weather conditions, ongoing vehicle shortages, and wildfire disruptions. The coming months will be critical in determining whether this decline is a seasonal adjustment or an indication of broader economic headwinds. In the meantime, Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has expanded its Bitcoin holdings once again, acquiring an additional 7,633 BTC last week. This brings its total holdings to 478,740 BTC, with an average purchase price of $62,473. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor remains steadfast in his long-term “buy and hold” strategy, reaffirming his commitment to not selling the company’s Bitcoin holdings. This latest acquisition, disclosed in a February 10 filing, further solidifies Strategy’s position as one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, reinforcing confidence in the asset’s long-term value proposition. Meanwhile, institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to gain momentum as Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company, made a significant investment of $436.9 million in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF during the fourth quarter of 2024. The investment coincided with BlackRock receiving a commercial license to operate in Abu Dhabi during the same period, further cementing the region’s role as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction.

Solana ( SOL ) and XRP slipped 4% to lead losses among major cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin ( BTC ) dropping 1.1% and BNB Chain’s bnb down 0.5% in the past 24 hours. Dogecoin ( DOGE ) lost 3%. Both Cardano’s ADA and ether ( ETH ) rose 2% as of midday in Europe. Jupiter’s JUP slid 9% to lead losses among midcap tokens, reeling from its apparent connections to the controversial LIBRA coin. Libra was briefly touted by Argentina's President Javier Milei last week as a project that could help small businesses, but instead crashed in value shortly after issuance, with its operators now facing legal heat . The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) , a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, fell 1.29%. “With no significant crypto-specific catalysts in sight, price action appears to be more macro driven particularly as the correlation between BTC and equities remains largely intact,” QCP Capital said in a broadcast message. “However it is interesting to note that despite the macro uncertainties (tariffs, debt ceiling, inflation etc) and the unpredictability of Trump, crypto implied vols and VIX are still trading at their lows. “BTC has proven to be relatively unfazed by the recent macro data and OI has not recovered significantly after the January month-end expiry. This suggests that the crypto options market is just waiting on the sidelines for concrete policy changes rather than just pro-crypto rhetoric,” the Singapore-based firm added. OI, or open interest, is the number outstanding options contracts that have not been closed. Rising open interest represents more money flowing into the options market. The $110,000 call option listed on Deribit has been the most preferred options play this month, as a CoinDesk analysis noted earlier Monday, while bitcoin itself remains confined in a narrow range below $100,000.Traders say a preference for BTC stems mainly from its appeal among institutional investors.“While many altcoins are down 40-60% over the last month or so, Bitcoin's price has proved to be surprisingly resilient, holding at around $96-97k. This is likely because its holder base has shifted towards institutional investors, and this is likely to continue,” Jeff Mei, COO at Taiwan-based crypto exchange BTSE told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.",Markets|Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|SOL|XRP|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-17 11:51:13

Before its listing, the price of the IOU token has stabilized between $61 and $70, providing insight into the potential listing price. Features of the Pi Network Pi Network is one of the most talked-about crypto projects. Unlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that require powerful computers for mining, Pi allows users to mine tokens through a mobile app. Traditional mining demands significant investment in hardware and is primarily accessible to large companies, while Pi Network is available to anyone with a phone, attracting millions of users. On February 11, when the project announced its mainnet launch, the price of the IOU token surged by 62% within hours. Currently, some exchanges allow pre-trading of tokens (IOU), giving traders a chance to speculate on future prices. The project's popularity is also evident on social media, with Pi Network's official account on X amassing 3.7 million followers, surpassing Ethereum and nearing leaders among meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. What Will Happen to the Token After Launch? Recent experiences with major token launches do not inspire optimism. Highly anticipated projects such as PENGU, BERA, and BLAST have seen significant price drops after hitting exchanges. The only exception has been Hyperliquid, which managed to maintain a high token value. Pre-trading for Pi tokens offers a glimpse into potential prices following the official launch. Despite brief spikes up to $90-100, most activity remains in a lower range. Traders are actively purchasing tokens at $57-60, with most transactions occurring between $59 and $76. Analysts believe that after launch, the price of Pi could stabilize between $61-70 — where it appears most stable during pre-trading. If interest in the project persists, prices may rise further; however, experiences with other tokens indicate that early investors often begin to take profits, leading to sharp price fluctuations. Interesting Insights About Pi Network One intriguing aspect of Pi Network is its unique consensus algorithm , known as ”Proof of Consensus” (PoC). This model allows users to mine coins simply by tapping a button once every 24 hours, making it incredibly user-friendly and energy-efficient compared to traditional mining methods that require extensive computational power and resources. Moreover, as part of its commitment to inclusivity, Pi Network has classified its users into four distinct roles: Pioneers (basic miners), Contributors (who add trusted members), Ambassadors (who invite new users), and Nodes (who run node software). This structure not only fosters community engagement but also enhances network security through collaborative efforts. Additionally, as Pi transitions from its enclosed mainnet to an open mainnet, it aims to ensure that transactions remain secure while preparing for broader market access. The project's founders: Stanford graduates Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis, Dr. Chengdiao Fan, and Vincent McPhillip have emphasized creating a platform that democratizes access to cryptocurrency mining. Factors Influencing Project Success The future of Pi Network largely depends on how the team manages token supply and ensures sufficient trading volume post-launch. These factors will determine whether Pi becomes another disappointment like most new tokens or replicates Hyperliquid's success. Experts in the crypto industry are divided regarding Pi Network's prospects. Some believe that the project could revolutionize cryptocurrency mining by making it genuinely accessible for everyone. Others point out risks associated with a large number of early investors who may initiate mass sell-offs after listing. Key Considerations Before Pi Network Launch: How will token unlocking occur? How many users will have access to trading simultaneously? Which major exchanges will support the listing? How does the project team plan to maintain liquidity? Conclusions Pi Network is an ambitious project that could either become one of the most successful launches of 2025 or another disappointment in the crypto market. Investors should closely monitor developments and remain aware of the high risks associated with new tokens during their initial trading days.",News|Blockchain,EN,0,0,TRADING|MINING|MARKET|BUSINESS|SHIB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-17 11:52:47

Trump nominated pro-crypto individuals for key positions. Atkins and Bessent’s appointment could be significant for crypto development. President Donald Trump followed his pre-election promises by initiating steps to revolutionize the crypto industry. In his first week as President, Trump issued a crypto executive order and appointed a few individuals to positions that could directly affect what happens in the crypto industry. Trump instituted a crypto council alongside the executive order, tasking them to work on creating rules that will govern the industry. Despite the steps taken by the US President, most crypto community members remain observant, as they want to know who the President would appoint in certain positions. The curiosity of crypto community members is justifiable, considering the prevailing perception about the former SEC chair, Gary Gensler, whom most crypto users consider an “enemy of the industry.” Gensler led the SEC under the last administration and spearheaded most lawsuits against crypto firms, earning himself a “crypto industry enemy” tag.

White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has revealed ongoing meetings with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, underscoring the administration’s interest in influencing monetary policy amid debates over interest rates. Meanwhile, stablecoin issuer Tether has engaged with lawmakers to help shape federal stablecoin regulations, signaling a shift toward compliance as US officials consider new oversight measures. White House Advisor Kevin Hassett Confirms Regular Meetings with Fed Chair Jerome Powell Amid Interest Rate Uncertainty The White House’s influence over US monetary policy has once again come into focus following the revelation that Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council and a key economic advisor to former President Donald Trump, is holding regular meetings with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell . Hassett confirmed this during a recent interview on CBS’ Face The Nation, emphasizing that while Powell remains independent, the president’s views on monetary policy should be acknowledged. The disclosure comes at a critical moment as interest rate policies remain a contentious issue, with the Federal Reserve facing mounting pressure to adjust its stance in response to economic uncertainties and persistent inflationary concerns. During his appearance, Hassett was asked if these meetings aimed to pressure Powell into lowering interest rates. In response, he noted the Fed’s independence while also asserting that the president’s opinions should carry weight in monetary policy discussions. ”Jerome Powell is an independent person. The Federal Reserve's independence is respected. The point is the president's opinion can also be heard — he is the president of the United States,” Hassett stated. Hassett pointed to a 40 basis point reduction in 10-year Treasury yields as evidence that financial markets anticipate declining inflation. This assertion suggests that the White House believes its economic policies are fostering a more stable long-term economic environment, despite broader concerns about inflation and economic growth. The Trump administration had previously criticized the Federal Reserve for its monetary tightening policies, arguing that higher interest rates could stifle economic growth and impact investment sentiment. Lower interest rates are traditionally seen as a stimulus for economic expansion, making borrowing cheaper and incentivizing investment in equities, cryptocurrencies, and other risk-on asset classes. Despite the Trump administration's push for lower interest rates, Powell and the Federal Reserve have adopted a more measured approach. In his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 11, 2025, Powell indicated that the Fed is in no rush to lower rates, citing concerns over inflation and financial stability. ”We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust interest rates,” Powell stated, casting doubt on the likelihood of rate cuts in 2025. The Fed's stance aligns with the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report , released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Feb. 12, 2025. The report showed that annual inflation reached 3% in January, exceeding expectations by 0.1%. While the increase was modest, it reinforced the Fed’s caution, as persistently high inflation could complicate monetary policy decisions. Following the CPI release, Bitcoin experienced a sharp correction, falling below $95,000 as traders braced for a prolonged high-rate environment. The broader cryptocurrency market also saw increased volatility, reflecting the close correlation between monetary policy and digital asset prices. Market Expectations and Investor Sentiment While the White House appears to favor lower interest rates, financial markets remain skeptical about imminent rate cuts. According to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) FedWatch tool, only 3% of market participants believe that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its next policy meeting in March 2025. This aligns with Powell’s cautious approach and suggests that investors are preparing for a prolonged period of higher borrowing costs. Higher interest rates typically reduce liquidity in financial markets, making riskier assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive to institutional investors. Despite this, some analysts argue that if inflation begins to cool in the second half of 2025, the Fed could reassess its stance and move toward gradual rate reductions. Such a shift would likely boost demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as lower interest rates generally support risk-on investments. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions will have far-reaching consequences beyond cryptocurrency markets. Persistently high inflation and global macroeconomic risks—including a looming trade war—are weighing on investor confidence, further complicating the economic outlook. Key takeaways from the current economic landscape: The White House, under Trump's administration, has expressed a preference for lower interest rates to support economic growth. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell remains cautious about rate cuts, citing inflation concerns. The 3% inflation rate in January 2025 exceeded expectations, prompting Bitcoin to drop below $95,000. The CME FedWatch tool suggests that rate cuts in March 2025 are highly unlikely, with only 3% of traders expecting a reduction. While the debate over monetary policy continues, the relationship between the White House and the Federal Reserve remains a focal point for investors. Any shift in policy could have major implications for financial markets, interest rates, and the broader economy. The revelation that Kevin Hassett is meeting regularly with Jerome Powell shows the ongoing tension between the White House and the Federal Reserve over interest rate policy. While Trump’s administration pushes for more accommodative monetary policies, Powell’s Fed is signaling that inflation remains a primary concern—delaying any immediate rate cuts. For crypto investors, this uncertainty presents a double-edged sword. While lower interest rates would provide a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin and other risk assets, inflationary pressures and cautious Fed policies could keep markets volatile in the coming months. The financial world will now closely monitor upcoming Federal Reserve meetings for any signs of a policy shift. Until then, investors may need to brace for continued uncertainty in both traditional and digital asset markets. Tether Engages with US Lawmakers to Shape Stablecoin Regulations Amid Growing Industry Scrutiny Stablecoin giant Tether (USDT) is actively engaging with US lawmakers to influence the regulatory framework surrounding digital dollar-pegged assets. According to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, Tether is working with Congressmen Bryan Steil and French Hill to provide input on the STABLE Act of 2025 , a landmark piece of legislation aimed at regulating stablecoin issuers at the federal level. Additionally, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed that the company is also providing input on two other stablecoin-related bills, emphasizing the firm’s commitment to working within US financial regulations. This marks a significant shift in Tether’s regulatory approach as the company faces increasing pressure to ensure its stablecoin remains compliant with global financial standards. Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer with a circulating supply exceeding $90 billion, has long faced scrutiny over its transparency and regulatory compliance. However, Ardoino’s comments indicate that Tether is willing to adapt to US legislation rather than risk regulatory exclusion. ”We are not going to just throw in the towel and let Tether die just for the sake of not adapting to US legislation,” Ardoino told Fox Business. ”But there is still a lot of uncertainty over what's actually going to happen, and we want our voice to be heard in the legislative process.” As part of the proposed regulations, Tether may be required to: Conduct monthly reserve audits through a US-based accounting firm. Ensure one-to-one asset collateralization for all tokenized fiat equivalents. Provide transparency regarding reserve backing and corporate governance. Such measures would align Tether with US financial reporting standards, making it more attractive to institutional investors and potentially opening the door for wider mainstream adoption. The Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for Banking and Law Enforcement (STABLE) Act of 2025, introduced by Congressmen Bryan Steil and French Hill, aims to establish clear rules for stablecoin issuers operating in the United States. While specific details of the legislation remain under discussion, the bill is expected to address key concerns, including: Reserve backing requirements to prevent insolvency risks. Regulatory oversight by federal agencies such as the SEC and the Federal Reserve. Clear legal definitions for stablecoin issuers, distinguishing them from banks and money transmitters. For Tether, this regulatory clarity could help legitimize its operations in the US market, reduce legal risks, and strengthen investor confidence in USDT as a reliable and fully backed stablecoin. Beyond legislative efforts, stablecoins have become a key focus for the Federal Reserve, as central bankers assess their role in preserving the dominance of the US dollar in global finance. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, in a Feb. 6 interview, expressed a cautiously optimistic stance on stablecoins , stating that US-pegged digital assets could strengthen the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. ”Stablecoins will broaden the reach of the dollar across the globe and make it even more of a reserve currency than it is now,” Waller stated. Stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle (USDC) are among the largest purchasers of US government debt, holding billions of dollars in US Treasuries as collateral for their tokens. This dynamic boosts demand for the dollar and reinforces its dominance in global capital markets. However, Waller also acknowledged concerns over stablecoin risks, particularly depegging events and market fragmentation. His remarks indicate that while the Federal Reserve sees potential benefits in stablecoins, policymakers still grapple with how to regulate them without destabilizing financial markets. A Political and Regulatory Crossroads Tether’s proactive engagement with Congress and US financial regulators comes at a time of heightened political interest in stablecoins. The Trump administration has pushed for bringing stablecoin operations onshore, aligning with efforts to establish the US as a global leader in blockchain-based financial services. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been increasing scrutiny over crypto-related businesses, with industry executives meeting regulators to navigate the evolving compliance landscape. For Tether, aligning with US regulations could provide both opportunities and challenges: Opportunities: Increased institutional adoption in regulated markets. Potential expansion into traditional banking and financial services. Improved stability and market confidence in USDT. Challenges: Increased operational costs associated with compliance. Greater regulatory oversight, which may limit Tether’s operational flexibility. Potential legal hurdles, especially if new laws force stablecoin issuers to comply with banking regulations. Tether’s willingness to engage with US lawmakers marks a pivotal moment for stablecoin regulation. If successful negotiations lead to clear regulatory guidelines, Tether could cement its status as a globally compliant digital dollar alternative—a crucial step in bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto. However, regulatory uncertainty remains a major risk. If the STABLE Act imposes stringent banking regulations on stablecoin issuers, firms like Tether may need to restructure their entire operational model to remain compliant. As the debate unfolds, the crypto industry will be watching closely to see how stablecoin regulations evolve—and whether the US embraces stablecoins as a pillar of its financial future or subjects them to rigid controls that could stifle innovation. Regardless of the outcome, one thing is clear: stablecoins are no longer an afterthought in Washington—they are now a central issue in the future of US financial policy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|USDT|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-17 12:00:00

After struggling to maintain upward momentum, SOL has been steadily retreating, now approaching the crucial $164 support level. This key zone will determine whether the cryptocurrency finds stability or extends its downward trajectory. Market indicators suggest that bears remain in control, with momentum shifting in favor of sellers. If Solana fails to hold above $164, it could open the door to even deeper losses. However, if buyers step in to defend this level, it would trigger a price reversal. Will SOL stabilize and recover, or is a larger correction on the horizon? SOL’s Battle With Bearish Momentum Recent price action reveals that SOL is grappling with persistent bearish pressure as its price struggles to maintain upward momentum. Following a series of failed attempts to break through key resistance levels, the cryptocurrency has seen a gradual decline, pushing it into a deeper retracement toward $164. Related Reading: Solana Faces Key Test – What Happens Next Could Be Game-Changing Technical indicators strongly back the bearish outlook for Solana, with one of the key signs being its price trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The fact that SOL is trading below this important threshold highlights the dominance of the bears in the market, making it more likely that the downward pressure will continue unless significant buying interest emerges. In addition to this, another key indicator reinforcing Solana’s bearish outlook is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is currently positioned at 25% in the lower territory. At 25%, the cryptocurrency is in the oversold zone, indicating strong selling pressure and a market dominated by bears. While this suggests SOL could be undervalued in the short term, it also implies that the upward trend is losing momentum. Combined, these indicators paint a picture of a market struggling to find support. With the 100-day SMA holding as a crucial resistance, Solana may face further declines unless there’s a reversal in market sentiment or a breakout above key resistance levels. Solana’s Market Outlook: $164 Support Level To Determine Next Price Action Solana’s market outlook remains highly dependent on its ability to maintain the crucial $164 support level. This level has proven to be a key battleground for bulls and bears, and its strength or weakness might set the stage for the next significant price movement. Should selling pressure persist and a breakdown below this level occurs, a bearish trend toward the next support zones, such as $137 or even $118 for SOL is likely. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) at a Crossroads: Can It Break Through and Turn Bullish? However, if Solana can defend the $164 support and generate a strong rebound, this may indicate that the selling momentum is slowing down and that the bulls could be ready to step in. A successful hold at this level hints at a relief rally, pushing the altcoin back toward key resistance levels like $240 and $260.

Speaking in an interview with YouTube investigator Stephen Findeisen, better known as “Coffeezilla,” Davis defended the controversial practices surrounding the Libra token’s rapid rise and fall. Davis insisted that early access and insider trading are inherent to memecoin culture, claiming that outrage typically comes from those excluded from these deals. “All the complaining on social media is from people who didn’t get in early. You never hear them complain if they were part of it,” he stated. When pressed about the ethical concerns surrounding insider advantages, Davis questioned what alternative existed, implying that profiting from memecoins is inherently tied to insider positioning. The Libra token saw a dramatic surge in popularity after receiving a now-deleted endorsement from Argentine President Javier Milei. Its market capitalization skyrocketed to over $4 billion before collapsing, with blockchain data revealing that at least eight wallets linked to the project cashed out significant amounts before the crash. The fallout has led to political scrutiny in Argentina, with lawmakers calling for Milei’s impeachment over his alleged indirect involvement in the scandal. Political memecoins under scrutiny The rise of political memecoins has become a growing concern in the crypto industry, particularly following the success of the U.S. President Donald Trump’s Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania Meme (MELANIA) tokens. Other political figures, including the Central African Republic’s president, have also entered the memecoin space, often resulting in rapid price surges followed by sharp declines. Blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps recently identified links between wallets involved in both the MELANIA and LIBRA tokens, raising concerns about coordinated insider activities. One wallet reportedly netted $6 million in profits from LIBRA alone. The prevalence of memecoin schemes has prompted warnings from industry experts. Samczsun, founder of security group SEAL911, cautioned that memecoins are fueling an unsustainable cycle of speculation and manipulation. “Memecoins are a wildfire burning through our industry. If we don’t want to be left with only ashes, it’s time to act,” he warned. Community backlash against Davis’ remarks Davis’ comments defending sniping—the practice of using automated bots to gain an early advantage in a token—have sparked backlash within the crypto community. When challenged by Coffeezilla on whether it was fair for project insiders to engage in sniping, Davis replied, “So, I would say no. But sometimes, it’s necessary to protect the project.” Industry figures reacted strongly to Davis’ remarks. Andre Cronje, co-founder of Sonic Labs, criticized his perspective, stating, “His base premise is ‘crypto only exists to extract money.’ He has never used a single real crypto project.” The post Libra Founder Defends Insider Deals as Political Memecoins Face Backlash appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Finance and Business News|Libra token,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-02-17 12:08:08

As AAVE, PEPE, and FXGuys ($FXG) capture investors' interest, many are curious if putting $100 into these tokens could potentially explode into $10,000. Following an assessment of the potential of AAVE, PEPE, and the FXGuys token, experts agree that $FXG has the best chance to turn $100 into $10,000 in 2025. Investors weighing their options are now asking why $FXG is the best crypto to invest in instead of AAVE or PEPE. Read on to learn what experts know! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Rising Whales Interest Sparks the AAVE Token Price Rally According to crypto market analyst Ali Martinez , large token holders, known as whales, purchased over 62 million AAVE tokens in January 2025. This increasing whale accumulation of AAVE coins sent the token price into an uptrend. AAVE jumped 10.62% from $306.44 to $338.96 just twenty-four hours into January 2025, and the token price rally extended by 2.10% to hit $346.07 by January 31. AAVE’s price then dropped by 33.38% to $230.52 by February 9. However, AAVE rebounded quickly to hit $258.17 on February 11. The increasing whale interest has made experts optimistic about AAVE's future. Some experts say that AAVE's price could rise to $270 this year. However, due to AAVE's recent price volatility, investors are now looking to turn pocket change into a fortune by investing in the $FXG presale.

Whale Activities Push the PEPE Token Into a Volatile Price Zone: Is It the Best Crypto Coin to Buy Now? Another crypto token with unexpected price swings due to the increasing whale activities is the PEPE token. According to Spot on Chain , a smart crypto whale recently spent 974.642 ETH to buy 280.85 billion PEPE coins. This led to volatile price actions for the PEPE token. PEPE jumped 10.53% from $0.000019 to $0.000021 just four days into January 2025. But dropped 42.86% to $0.0000120 on January 31. The PEPE token dipped even further by 14.16% to reach $0.0000103 on February 11. Despite the volatile price actions, some investors believe in the PEPE token's growth potential because of the increasing interest from crypto whales. Some predict that PEPE's price could rebound to hit $0.000020 in the following months. However, the $FXG token is attracting AAVE and PEPE investors with its potential to turn $100 into $10,000. This is why experts call $FXG the best crypto coin to buy now.

40453003,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129400,1739799014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Crypto Token Unlock Week: $91M MELANIA Leads the Charge,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/massive-crypto-token-unlock-melania/,"Get ready for another week of potential market movement in the crypto sphere! This week, several projects are set to release previously locked tokens into circulation, and one, in particular, is catching everyone’s attention: MELANIA . According to the latest data from DropsTab, a staggering $91.42 million worth of MELANIA tokens are scheduled to be unlocked, dwarfing other significant unlocks this week. Let’s dive into the details of this week’s token unlock schedule and what it could mean for the market. Understanding Crypto Token Unlocks: What’s the Big Deal? Before we delve into the specifics, let’s quickly recap what crypto token unlocks are and why they matter. When new cryptocurrency projects launch, they often allocate a portion of their total token supply to various stakeholders – including the team, advisors, investors, and for future development. To prevent immediate dumping and price volatility, these tokens are usually locked up for a predetermined period, following a vesting schedule. An unlock event is when these vested tokens are released and become available for circulation and trading. Why should you care about token unlocks? Potential Price Impact : Increased circulating supply can sometimes lead to downward pressure on the token price, especially if a significant portion of unlocked tokens are sold. Conversely, if the project is strong and demand is high, the unlock might have minimal impact or even be perceived positively as decentralization increases. Market Volatility : Large unlocks, like the upcoming MELANIA event, can introduce volatility into the market, especially for the specific token being unlocked. Traders often watch these events closely to anticipate price movements. Project Health Indicator : Unlock schedules are often public and can provide insights into a project’s tokenomics and long-term planning. Consistent and transparent unlock schedules can be a sign of a well-managed project. Investment Opportunities (and Risks) : Savvy investors may try to capitalize on potential price dips around unlock events, but it’s crucial to remember that predicting market reactions is never guaranteed, and it carries risks. This Week’s Crypto Unlock Schedule: A Detailed Breakdown Let’s break down the weekly unlock schedule as per DropsTab data, covering the period from February 17th to February 23rd. All times are in UTC. Token Unlock Date & Time (UTC) Amount Unlocked Value (USD) % of Circulating Supply WLD Feb 18, 00:00 3.42 million $4.19 million 0.33% DYDX Feb 18, 15:00 6.34 million $4.97 million 0.87% TIA Feb 18, 18:00 998,000 $3.04 million 0.19% PIXEL Feb 19, 10:00 91.78 million $6.08 million 7.17% MELANIA Feb 20, 00:00 70 million $91.42 million 46.67% PLUME Feb 21, 00:00 110 million $15.33 million 5.52% IMX Feb 21, 05:00 27.92 million $22.39 million 1.6% Spotlight on MELANIA: A Colossal Crypto Unlock Event As you can see from the table, while several cryptocurrency projects have unlocks scheduled, the MELANIA token unlock stands out significantly. Releasing 70 million tokens, valued at over $91 million, representing a massive 46.67% of its circulating supply, this event is hard to ignore. Key points to consider about the MELANIA unlock: Magnitude of Unlock : The sheer size of the unlock relative to the existing circulating supply is substantial. Such a large influx of tokens could potentially exert considerable selling pressure if holders decide to liquidate their newly unlocked assets. Market Sentiment : The overall market sentiment towards MELANIA and the broader crypto market will play a crucial role. Positive market conditions might mitigate potential negative price impacts, while bearish sentiment could exacerbate them. Token Distribution : Understanding who is receiving these unlocked tokens is important. Are they early investors, the project team, or community members? Their motivations for holding or selling will influence the market reaction. Long-Term Vision : Despite potential short-term volatility, it’s essential to consider the long-term prospects of the MELANIA project. A strong project with solid fundamentals might weather the unlock event and continue to grow. Navigating the Token Unlock Landscape: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights for navigating this week’s token unlock events: Stay Informed : Keep track of token unlock schedules using resources like DropsTab and other crypto data aggregators. Understanding upcoming unlocks is crucial for proactive portfolio management. Do Your Research (DYOR) : Don’t make investment decisions based solely on unlock events. Research the fundamentals of each project, understand their tokenomics, and assess their long-term potential. Manage Risk : Be prepared for potential volatility around unlock dates, especially for tokens with significant unlocks like MELANIA. Consider adjusting your trading strategies and risk management accordingly. Look for Opportunities : While unlocks can present risks, they can also create buying opportunities if prices temporarily dip due to increased supply. However, always exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence. Conclusion: Crypto Unlock Week – Prepare for Potential Market Shifts This week in cryptocurrency is marked by a series of token unlocks , with the massive MELANIA unlock event taking center stage. While unlocks can introduce short-term volatility, they are a natural part of the token lifecycle. By staying informed, doing your research, and managing risk effectively, you can navigate these events and potentially capitalize on opportunities in the ever-evolving crypto market. Keep a close eye on market movements this week, especially around the scheduled unlock times, and make informed decisions based on your own risk tolerance and investment strategy.

33767162,[object Object],1739799023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Deviates From Established Bullish Trends, Is It Headed For Another Red Month?",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-deviates-bullish-trends/,"Dogecoin has deviated from established bullish trends in the previous bull cycle, having started this year with significant price crashes. With this bearish trend, the foremost meme coin looks to be headed for another red month, which would further raise concerns about DOGE’s bull run this year. Dogecoin Deviates From Established Bullish Trends CryptoRank data shows that Dogecoin is deviating from the historical bullish trend in the 2021 bull run. The foremost meme coin has started the year with a bearish trend, having suffered significant crashes since January. In January, the meme coin closed the month with a meager 4% gain. However, its price has nosedived since the start of February, with a 20% loss since this month began. This is nothing compared to the bullish run that Dogecoin enjoyed at the start of the year during the 2021 bull run . Back then, DOGE recorded a 711% gain in January and then followed it up with a 26% gain in February. In fact, the foremost meme coin closed the first four months of 2021 in the green, recording gains of 11% and 546% in March and April, respectively. However, this 2025 bull run is playing out differently, especially with Dogecoin suffering a 20% crash this month and looks likely to end this month in the red. A monthly close in the red could invalidate similarities between the 2021 and 2025 bull run and raise concerns about how this market cycle could play out. However, the historical trend in the 2017 bull run provides some optimism amid Dogecoin’s current price action in this bull run. In 2017, the foremost started the year in the red, with a monthly loss of 7% and 2% in January and February, respectively. DOGE then went on a bull run the following three months, recording a gain of 59%, 124%, and 256% in March, April, and May, respectively. DOGE Still At Risk Of Further Crashes In The Short Term Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that Dogecoin is still at risk of further price crashes in the short term. In an X post, the analyst revealed that DOGE just saw a death cross between the market value to realized value (MVRV) and its 200-day moving average (MA). He further remarked that prices dropped 26% and 44% the last two times this happened. Meanwhile, Martinez also noted that Dogecoin is in a downtrend , forming lower lows and lower highs. He added that a breakout above key resistance levels is needed to shift momentum. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE needs to break above the resistance at $0.27 to enjoy a potential bullish reversal. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.26, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|Ali Martinez|Coinmarketcap|CryptoRank|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|MA|moving average|MVRV,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-17 13:30:23

Although Litecoin also started February on a decline alongside the rest of the crypto market, it has since detached and has recovered from these losses. This interesting Litecoin price move has seen it outperforming against Bitcoin. In a post shared on social media platform X, Severino projected that Litecoin could significantly outperform Bitcoin in the coming months and pump by 1,500%. LTC’s Growing Strength Against Bitcoin Litecoin has remained relatively quiet in this market cycle, drawing less attention compared to top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP. However, technical analysis shows that LTC has started to outperform Bitcoin, especially in the past two months. Related Reading: Litecoin Sees 2M Bollinger Bands Tighten – What A Move Above $130 Will Mean For Price This trend with Litecoin and Bitcoin was highlighted through a multi-year monthly candlestick chart shared by crypto analyst Tony Severino. As shown by the chart below, the Litcoin / Bitcoin pair has been on an uptrend after rebounding on the bottom trendline of its multi-year descending channel. Tony Severino noted that Litecoin will continue to push upwards in this channel, which will cause the price to continue outperforming Bitcoin on the monthly timeframe. Regarding a price prediction, the analyst noted two targets for the pair. The first target is at 0.006275 BTC, which is just around the upper trendline of this channel. From here, a continued breakout is expected to push the Litecoin / Bitcoin pair to the final target of 0.02 BTC. As of now, the LTC/BTC pair is trading at approximately 0.003, meaning the first target suggests a 110% increase against Bitcoin, while the final target points to a 566% surge. Litecoin Price Targets If It Continues To Grow Against Bitcoin The predicted outperformance of Litecoin against Bitcoin places Litecoin at new all-time highs. Provided that Bitcoin continues to trade around the $100,000 mark and the LTC/BTC pair continues its upward trajectory, Litecoin’s first price target at 0.006275 BTC would correspond to a valuation of approximately $630. Should the pair reach the final target of 0.02 BTC, the price could skyrocket to around $2,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Dunks On Shiba Inu, Cardano, And Litecoin, Reveals Bullish Cryptocurrencies This scenario of Litecoin strongly outpacing Bitcoin if it continues to range around $100,000 could set off a domino effect and cause an altcoin season. This altcoin season could cause capital flows from Bitcoin into the altcoin market, causing other altcoins to also outperform Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin could eventually start climbing beyond $100,000. In this case, Litecoin’s relative strength on the Litecoin / Bitcoin pair would still be crucial. If it continues to trend upward even while the Bitcoin price appreciates, the price targets for Litecoin will be even higher. A push toward 0.006275 or 0.02 in the LTC/BTC pair amid a rising Bitcoin market would result in prices that exceed the initial $630 and $2,000 targets. At the time of writing, LTC is trading at $126 after recently reaching an intraday high of $136.

This puts the price up against the strong horizontal resistance at $2,750. Can $ETH bulls break the resistance and go on to turn the whole bull market around? Breaking the $ETH downtrend will require a huge effort Source: TradingView Looking at the daily chart for $ETH (ETH/USDT), it can be seen that the bears possibly have just as much of a case as do the bulls. The current horizontal resistance is quite pronounced, and it will be tough for the bulls to overcome it. Also, all the daily moving averages are above the price. The 200 day SMA coincides with the $3,000 horizontal resistance. If you also throw the descending trendline into the equation, breaking the downtrend is going to require a gargantuan effort from the bulls. Huge upside price momentum coming for $ETH? Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly chart, things do start looking up for the bulls. The candle wick that went all the way down to confirm the horizontal support at $2,150 was an excellent retest of this level. However, the most bullish element on the chart is arguably the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart. This looks to be bottoming, and in the next two to three weeks a crossover of the indicator lines above the 20.00 level could signal huge upside price momentum. $ETH bulls have so far managed to save the day against $BTC pair Source: TradingView Perhaps the most telling chart of all for price is the ETH/BTC pairing. From looking like $ETH was going to completely break down against $BTC, the bulls have since managed to get the price back inside the descending channel, and also back above the major horizontal support. Obviously, there is still a huge amount of work for the $ETH bulls still to do. Breaking back above the bull market ascending trendline is one task, breaking up through the major horizontal resistance is another, and breaking out of the descending channel is another. Finally, making a higher high above 0.0057 BTC would reverse the downtrend. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Negative consequences in the segment could undermine the development of the crypto industry. Solana's price may have peaked two weeks ago amid the meme coin hype. Insiders of TRUMP, MEV participants, Pump.fun, and various DEXs have collectively earned between $3.6 billion and $6.6 billion from the meme coin frenzy on Solana. These calculations were provided by 0xngmi, the co-founder of DeFi Llama. The expert emphasized that these figures are conservative due to the difficulty of tracking meme coin volumes across AMMs and losses from insider launches. The distribution is as follows: Trading bots and dapps — $1.09 billion Pump.fun — $492 million MEV — $1.5 billion-2 billion TRUMP insiders — $0.5 billion-1 billion AMM (Raydium, Meteora, Orca) — up to $2 billion The profit of one of the main MEV bots for sandwich attacks (front-running) on Solana was ~$500 million. Profit structure of trading bots: Phantom — $120 million Photon — $357 million BullX — $153 million Maestro — $27 million ($102 million across all networks) Moonshot — $27 million Mevx — $30 million Bonkbot — $168 million gmgn — $38 million Trojan — $166 million Root Causes According to 0xngmi, in previous cycles, traders went to CEXs like Binance and paid 0.1% for each trade in fees. Now, those targeting TRUMP trades are using MoonShot, where the fee is 2.5%. According to the co-founder of DeFi Llama, market participants see meme coins as an ”unstable casino” and want to ”cash in” before the ”music stops.” While Binance is interested in maximizing user retention because it focuses on the long-term development of cryptocurrencies, Moonshot does not have such a goal. The goal is to earn as much as possible before customers leave, added 0xngmi. ”It seems that the narrative 'this is the last cycle' is forcing everyone to focus on the short term,” the specialist emphasized. 0xngmi recalled that during the previous bull run, OpenSea and NFT royalty recipients earned ~$3 billion. Later, the focus shifted to the BYAC ecosystem with a peak capitalization of $10 billion and DeFi tokens like AAVE. ”If trading meme coins is a zero-sum game, you need a huge influx to keep it [afloat],” 0xngmi emphasized. Risks For The Industry The founder of DeFi Llama presented his reasoning against the backdrop of active discussion of the LIBRA token. On February 14, after being mentioned on social network X by Argentinian President Javier Milei, the asset reached a capitalization of $4.56 billion, but within the next few hours, its price collapsed by 94%. After the crash, Milei deleted the promotional post and clarified that he simply ”supported a private initiative” and accused political opponents of using the incident to harm him. According to Lookonchain, eight wallets associated with the project withdrew liquidity of more than $107 million (57.6 million USDC and 249,671 SOL). According to Bubblemaps, 82% of the project's supply was unlocked and available for sale from the start. Some Argentinian politicians are threatening the president with impeachment due to his connection with the failed token. https://coinpaper.com/7532/bubblemaps-uncovers-evidence-linking-libra-and-melania-meme-coins 0xngmi expressed concern about the current hype: ”If most of society begins to perceive cryptocurrency as purely evil, or if the consequence is stricter regulation, we will find ourselves in a situation where the negative effects of meme coins spread and prevent the prosperity of other ideas like sovereign money or trust minimization.” In conclusion, 0xngmi cited the opinion of DeFi enthusiast Patrick Scott (Dynamo DeFi) that the Solana course peaked two weeks ago. The latter found that every time revenues from dapps (highlighted in purple) jumped, SOL approached a local peak (yellow). The same pattern occurred two weeks ago. It is worth noting that the founder and former head of the Binance exchange, Changpeng Zhao, provoked a wave of meme coins dedicated to his Belgian Shepherd dog named Broccoli. https://coinpaper.com/7386/cz-criticizes-binance-token-listing-process-and-calls-for-change",News|Memecoins,EN,0,0,ZRX|SOL|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-17 13:34:21

This will allow the joint venture to use its bank-grade infrastructure and strict oversight fully. Animoca Brands will use its industry expertise and extensive network in the Web3 space to help the JV capitalize on crypto-native opportunities. In addition, it will explore innovative use cases across the Web3 ecosystem that will support the JV’s long-term growth. HKT, a technology company, will leverage its mobile wallet expertise to enable the JV to develop unique stablecoin use cases. This will improve both domestic and cross-border payments and provide additional benefits to consumers and merchants alike. This is a major move for China’s crypto—the US stablecoins, especially the USDT which is already having trouble in some nations. Recently, the US introduced two stablecoin bills to regulate stablecoin issuers. Analysts said that for Tether to follow the planned US stablecoin rules, it might have to sell assets that don’t follow the rules. In addition, Tether has struggled in Europe. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rules say that large fiat-pegged token issuers must keep 60% of their reserves in banks in the European Union. This caused USDT to be taken off of a number of European exchanges. This said, US stablecoins might welcome a new competitor. The organization’s execs’ statements about the JV Standard Chartered’s Group Chief Executive Bill Winters asserted that digital assets are here to stay and the development of various forms of tokenized money is essential to the advancement of this industry. The company is actively engaged in a variety of Central Bank Digital Currencies, tokenized deposits, and stablecoins projects He said, “We are introducing solutions and instruments that service this market and meet the growing client demand. As public chain instruments with proven use cases, stablecoins play a critical role in the overall digital asset ecosystem. Standard Chartered’s bank-grade infrastructure, governance and global reach mean that we are in a good position to materially contribute to the development of the ecosystem being built in Hong Kong and globally.” Mary Huen, Chief Executive Officer, Hong Kong and Greater China & North Asia, Standard Chartered, expressed excitement about this move. She said Standard Chartered looks forward to becoming one of the first issuers to launch an HKD-backed stablecoin. She said they look forward to bringing an innovative medium of exchange to Hong Kong and charting a new chapter for Hong Kong’s digital asset market. She added, “By leveraging the bank’s and our partners’ core strengths, we aim to launch a stablecoin that can be used securely by institutions and individuals across a wide number of use cases. We are dedicated to staying at the forefront in driving fintech innovation alongside the regulators, partners, and clients, further consolidating the role of Hong Kong as an international financial center.” In the same light, Evan Auyang, Group President, Animoca Brands, said, “Stablecoins are one of the best proven and most widely recognized use cases for Web3, and we are still in the early stages for mass adoption of stablecoins across retail, enterprises, and institutions.” Evans Auyang added, “This opportunity to become one of the first to issue a fiat-backed stablecoin under the HKMA’s licensing regime reinforces our conviction that Hong Kong has a bright future as a global Web3 hub, leading the charge to grow the industry in a safe and compliant manner.” Susanna Hui, Group Managing Director, HKT, said, “We believe that issuing an HKD-linked stablecoin will enhance payment efficiency, streamline transactions, and provide greater security and transparency through advanced Web3 innovations, ultimately benefiting the broader retail sector.” When it comes to the crypto industry, China would rather choose a more secure path. Stablecoins come with some level of safety. This year, China’s startup AI shook global AI by innovating a smart AI chatbot with the least funds ever used.

40453200,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129487,1739799357,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alert: Japan’s Cautious Stance on Trump Tariffs – Will USD/JPY Feel the Shockwaves?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japan-cautious-trump-tariffs/,"Financial markets are on high alert as Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, voices concerns over potential economic shockwaves from former US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. With Trump hinting at a return to trade protectionism, nations worldwide are bracing for impact, and Japan is no exception. Hayashi’s statement underscores Japan’s cautious approach as it navigates the uncertainties of potential Trump tariffs and their repercussions on the global economic landscape. Let’s delve into the specifics of Japan’s stance and what it means for the markets, particularly the USD/JPY currency pair. Japan’s Cautious Response to Potential Trump Tariffs In a recent address, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi articulated Japan’s position regarding the possible resurgence of Trump tariffs . He stated, “Japan faces significant challenges if its companies become targets amid US President Donald Trump’s policies; the government will respond carefully to potential impacts.” This carefully worded statement highlights a mixture of concern and preparedness. Japan, heavily reliant on exports, is acutely aware of the potential disruptions that tariffs could impose on its businesses and overall economic health. Here’s a breakdown of the key takeaways from Hayashi’s statement: Acknowledging the Challenge: Hayashi directly acknowledges the ‘significant challenges’ that Trump tariffs pose to Japanese companies. This isn’t downplaying the risk but rather a realistic assessment of the situation. Emphasis on Careful Response: The phrase ‘respond carefully’ suggests a measured and strategic approach, avoiding knee-jerk reactions and aiming for a well-thought-out plan to mitigate negative impacts. Focus on Potential Impacts: By highlighting ‘potential impacts,’ Hayashi emphasizes the need for proactive planning and risk assessment, rather than waiting for tariffs to materialize and then reacting. This cautious stance reflects Japan’s experience during Trump’s previous term, where trade tensions significantly impacted global trade flows and supply chains. Now, with the possibility of renewed tariffs, Japan is proactively preparing to safeguard its economic interests. Decoding Japan’s Economic Resilience Amid Global Trade Tensions While expressing caution about Trump tariffs , Hayashi also presented a snapshot of Japan’s current economic condition, painting a picture of underlying resilience amidst global uncertainties. Despite external pressures and fluctuations in domestic demand, the Japanese economy has shown signs of stability and even growth in certain sectors. Let’s examine the key economic indicators discussed: Economic Indicator Details Significance Exports (Services) Demonstrated growth Highlights Japan’s competitive edge in service exports, acting as a buffer against domestic demand fluctuations. Year-on-Year Value Rose by 2.9%, exceeding 609.3 trillion yen for the first time Indicates overall economic expansion and increased economic activity despite challenges. Domestic Demand Positive trends over the past three and a third quarters Signals strengthening internal economic drivers, although with nuances in personal consumption. Personal Consumption Negative growth due to reduced disaster-related storage needs and beverage demand decline Suggests temporary factors are influencing consumer spending, not necessarily a fundamental weakness. Equipment Investment Primary driver of increasing domestic demand Points to business confidence and willingness to invest in future growth, a positive sign for long-term economic health. These figures suggest a nuanced economic landscape in Japan. While acknowledging potential headwinds from Trump tariffs and global trade uncertainties, the data also reveals underlying strengths in exports and equipment investment, providing a degree of insulation and potential for continued recovery. USD/JPY Reaction: A Barometer of Tariff Anxiety? The currency markets, ever sensitive to geopolitical and economic shifts, reacted to Hayashi’s comments and the broader context of potential Trump tariffs . Notably, the USD/JPY pair experienced a dip, falling towards the 151.50 level, marking a 0.39% daily loss at the time of reporting. This market movement can be interpreted as: Risk Aversion: Concerns about Trump tariffs and their potential to disrupt global trade often trigger risk aversion in markets. Investors may seek safe-haven assets or currencies, potentially moving away from currencies perceived as being more exposed to trade tensions. Japanese Yen Strength: In times of global economic uncertainty, the Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven currency. Increased anxiety about Trump tariffs could be driving demand for the Yen, strengthening it against the US Dollar. GDP Data Influence: The article also mentions stronger-than-expected Japanese Q4 GDP data as a factor undermining USD/JPY . Positive economic data from Japan can bolster the Yen’s value, further contributing to the pair’s downward movement. Therefore, the USD/JPY ‘s reaction is likely a confluence of factors, with anxieties surrounding Trump tariffs playing a significant role. Currency markets are often forward-looking, and this movement could be an early indication of how investors are positioning themselves for potential trade-related volatility. Navigating Global Trade Tensions: Japan’s Strategy Given the potential for renewed global trade tensions and the specific challenge of Trump tariffs , what strategic options might Japan consider? Hayashi’s emphasis on a ‘careful response’ suggests a multi-pronged approach, potentially including: Diplomatic Engagement: Japan is likely to engage in diplomatic efforts with the US and other nations to express its concerns about tariffs and advocate for open and fair trade practices. This could involve bilateral discussions and multilateral forums. Trade Diversification: To reduce reliance on specific markets and mitigate the impact of tariffs, Japan may further pursue trade diversification strategies, strengthening ties with other trading partners and exploring new markets. Domestic Economic Measures: The Japanese government might implement domestic economic policies to bolster internal demand and reduce vulnerability to external trade shocks. This could involve fiscal stimulus, support for domestic industries, and measures to enhance productivity and innovation. Industry Support: Specific support measures for industries potentially targeted by Trump tariffs could be considered. This might include subsidies, tax breaks, or assistance with market diversification. Monitoring and Analysis: Continuous monitoring of global trade developments and in-depth analysis of the potential impacts of Trump tariffs will be crucial for informed decision-making and timely policy responses. Japan’s approach will likely be a delicate balancing act, aiming to protect its economic interests while maintaining stable international relations. The coming months will be critical in observing how these strategies unfold and their effectiveness in navigating the complexities of global trade tensions . Conclusion: Japan’s Cautious Optimism in a Tariff-Threatened World Japan’s response to the potential resurgence of Trump tariffs is characterized by a blend of caution and underlying economic resilience. While acknowledging the significant challenges that tariffs could pose, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi’s statements and recent economic data also suggest a degree of preparedness and inherent strengths within the Japanese economy. The USD/JPY market reaction reflects the anxieties surrounding trade tensions, but also highlights the safe-haven appeal of the Yen in uncertain times. As the global trade landscape continues to evolve, Japan’s strategic and measured approach will be crucial in navigating the potential shockwaves and ensuring continued economic stability and growth.

A tiny startup called Firecrawl, backed by the prestigious Y Combinator, recently posted a job ad that sent ripples across the tech world and beyond. The job? Not for a human, but for an AI agent . The salary? A modest $15,000 a year. This audacious move has ignited a fiery debate about the future of work and the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence. Let’s dive into this fascinating story and explore what it means for the future. The Viral AI Job Ad: A Glimpse into the Future of Work? Last week, the Y Combinator startup job board became the unlikely stage for a viral sensation. Firecrawl, a seven-person company, posted an ad that explicitly stated: “Please apply only if you are an AI agent, or if you created an AI agent that can fill this job.” This wasn’t a typo or a prank. Firecrawl was genuinely seeking an AI agent to autonomously research trending models and develop sample applications showcasing their product. The salary range of $10,000 to $15,000, while significantly lower than a human developer’s wage, sparked immediate conversation. Is this a pittance or a fortune for a non-biological entity? The founders, Caleb Peffer and Nicolas Silberstein Camara, clarified to Bitcoin World that the AI job ad was “equal parts PR stunt, experiment.” “We are currently looking for incredible AI engineers. Humans who are good at building AI systems. And we thought, huh, let’s just put a posting out there for an AI agent, see what people build,” Peffer explained. What Does Firecrawl Do? AI Web Crawlers Explained So, what exactly does Firecrawl do that necessitates hiring an AI agent ? Firecrawl develops an open-source web crawling bot specifically designed for AI agents and models. Think of it as a tool that allows AI to navigate and gather information from the vast expanse of the internet. Businesses leverage Firecrawl’s technology for various crucial tasks: Training Data Collection: AI models need massive datasets to learn. Firecrawl helps gather this data from websites. AI Interaction with Public Websites: When AI needs to access real-time information from the web to perform tasks, Firecrawl provides the means. AI web crawlers are essential for the modern internet, powering everything from search engines to market research. However, they also raise ethical questions. Firecrawl emphasizes its compliance with Robot.txt, the internet’s standard for website crawling permissions, addressing some of these concerns. Reactions and the Dystopian AI Future The AI job ad ignited a flurry of reactions online, primarily on X (formerly Twitter). Many saw it as a harbinger of a new era: The Rise of AI Employees: One user envisioned a future where companies are staffed by legions of AI agents , dramatically reducing labor costs. Build-Your-Own Employee: Others pointed out the irony – the founders could use LLMs to create the very AI agent they sought to hire, highlighting the accessibility of AI development tools. Dystopian Concerns: A significant portion of the commentary expressed unease, questioning the societal implications of humans creating AI to replace themselves. “Humans creating AI to replace humans … And now humans are writing job postings for AI to apply to. We’re in the simulation, aren’t we?” one user pondered. Here’s a glimpse of the online conversation: Private equity firm: We want to buy your business. How many employees do you have? CEO: Zero…But we have 275 AI agents doing the work of 3,000 employees while we only pay them $15k a year PE buyer: … — Sieva Kozinsky (@SievaKozinsky) February 7, 2025 Humans creating AI to replace humans… And now humans are writing job postings for AI to apply to. We’re in the simulation, aren’t we? — Andrew Vo | CRO (@conversiongeek) February 7, 2025 The Real Plan: Hiring Human AI Talent Despite the viral buzz around hiring an AI agent , Firecrawl’s primary goal was to identify talented human AI engineers. The founders revealed that the $10,000-$15,000 salary was intended to be rolled into the full-time salary offer for the human who created the most impressive AI agent applicant. While Firecrawl received around 50 AI agent applications, none met their rigorous standards. However, they haven’t abandoned the idea of hiring a bot in the future. “We would have loved to put one of these in production, but none of them were up to our standards,” Peffer admitted. “We’re gonna make another job posting in this manner, and we are going to be actively looking for AI agents that are able to accomplish the tasks that we need.” From Coding Education to AI Web Crawlers: Firecrawl’s Pivot The story of Firecrawl’s journey to becoming an AI web crawlers company is equally intriguing. The three founders, college friends from the University of New Hampshire, initially applied to Y Combinator startup accelerator with a programming education startup. They already had a user base, a waitlist, and revenue generation. Their initial product was designed to be embedded in VS Code, similar to Cursor, but focused on teaching coding. However, Y Combinator advisors steered them away from the crowded edtech coding space. After exploring various ideas, they landed on a chatbot for developers to answer documentation questions. This led them to confront the challenge of reliable information retrieval for AI systems. “If you give garbage to an AI system, you’re gonna get garbage out,” Peffer stated, highlighting the critical need for accurate data. This realization spurred them to build a web crawler/scraper as a side project, which they released as open source. The open-source AI web crawlers project became an instant hit, trending on GitHub and amassing 25,000 stars in just ten months. This unexpected success led to the commercial version of Firecrawl, which now serves paying customers for diverse applications like resume parsing and lead generation. Firecrawl has raised $1.7 million and anticipates that AI agent jobs will become increasingly integrated into their operations. “What we imagine happening is that every one of our real employees is going to become highly leveraged with AI. And it’s not a clear distinction. It’s like, what’s the difference between a tool or a workflow or a full agent?” Peffer concluded, hinting at a future where humans and AI agents collaborate seamlessly. Conclusion: The Unfolding Future of AI and Work Firecrawl’s AI job ad is more than just a quirky news story; it’s a powerful symbol of the rapidly approaching future. It raises profound questions about the nature of work, the role of AI in our lives, and the potential for both incredible innovation and societal disruption. While the notion of AI agent jobs might seem futuristic or even unsettling to some, it’s clear that AI is fundamentally changing the landscape of employment and business. As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect more companies to explore unconventional approaches to leveraging its power, blurring the lines between human and artificial labor. The experiment by this Y Combinator startup serves as a potent reminder that the future of work is not a distant concept – it’s unfolding right now.

The inaugural institutional pilot of the course will take place in Zug, Switzerland, which is often referred to as the ”Crypto Valley.” A delegation of UK Members of Parliament (MPs), led by Dr. Lisa Cameron, a prominent advocate for crypto policy and the Founder of the UKUS Crypto Alliance, is confirmed to attend the three-day intensive training. Bridging the Gap Between Policy and Blockchain Innovation The initiative comes at a time when governments worldwide seek to regulate and integrate blockchain technology into their economies. The UK, in particular, is positioning itself as a global hub for financial innovation. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also recently unveiled a £14 billion AI action plan that is aimed at expanding the country’s technology sector and creating over 13,000 new jobs. Dr. Cameron has been a vocal proponent of blockchain adoption within the UK’s legislative framework, having previously contributed to a Parliament-endorsed report on the UK’s development as a crypto hub in 2022. Speaking about the significance of the course, she stated, “Given the prominent role that blockchain technology is poised to play in the UK’s tech sector, it is essential that policymakers are equipped with the knowledge to make informed decisions. Polkadot Blockchain Academy’s inaugural course offers a valuable opportunity for MPs to gain firsthand insights into the real-world applications of Web3.” The course will cover fundamental blockchain concepts, regulatory considerations, and potential guardrails for AI-driven applications, ensuring policymakers understand how emerging technologies intersect with Web3. Additional delegations from other jurisdictions are expected to follow, marking this as a global initiative to educate lawmakers on blockchain’s potential. Industry Leaders Back the Initiative The first institutional pilot of the program will also be attended by Chrissy Hill, Chief Legal Officer and Interim Chief Operating Officer at Parity Technologies, the core development team behind Polkadot. She places a lot of emphasis on the critical role education plays in bridging the knowledge gap between policymakers and the blockchain industry, and said, “Policymakers play a crucial role in shaping the future of blockchain, yet have empirically lacked access to structured education on its technical and regulatory foundations.” She then added that “ Polkadot Blockchain Academy is committed to bridging this gap, ensuring that decision-makers have the resources they need to craft practical policies that foster innovation while maintaining safeguards.” Policymakers to Return with Strategic Insights Upon completion of the three-day course, the UK MPs and other policymakers in attendance will return to Westminster with a deeper understanding of blockchain’s applications across governance, finance, and enterprise sectors. This knowledge will be crucial as the UK and other nations navigate regulatory frameworks for digital assets, ensuring that policies foster innovation while maintaining consumer protection. Initiatives like Blockchain Basics for Policymakers are a major step toward bridging the gap between the crypto industry and the public sector. With governments increasingly recognizing the strategic importance of Web3, educational programs like these could play a huge role in shaping global blockchain policy for years to come.

40453443,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129493,1739799773,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Forex Alert: AUD/USD Under Pressure Awaiting RBA Rate Decision – Will Aussie Dollar Plunge?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/aud-usd-rba-rate-decision/,"Cryptocurrency investors are keenly watching traditional financial markets for signals that could ripple into the digital asset space. The AUD/USD pair is currently under a microscope as traders brace for a pivotal event: the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) upcoming rate decision . Will this decision trigger a significant move in the Aussie Dollar and potentially impact broader market sentiment? Let’s dive into the factors influencing this crucial forex pair. Why is the Market Focused on the RBA Rate Decision? The Australian Dollar (AUD) is currently navigating choppy waters, hovering around 0.6345 against the US Dollar (USD) in early Asian trading sessions. The primary driver of this market tension is the widespread anticipation of a potential interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on Tuesday. If the RBA proceeds with this cut, it would be the first in four years, marking a significant shift in monetary policy. Market analysts widely expect the RBA to trim its Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points (bps), bringing it down to 4.10%. This dovish expectation is weighing heavily on the Australian Dollar as traders anticipate reduced returns on AUD-denominated assets. Craig Vardy, head of fixed income at BlackRock Australasia, aptly summarizes the RBA’s dilemma: “The prudent action for the RBA now would be to cut, but cut slowly and just see how data evolves through time. The worst thing they could possibly do is cut hard and then have to reverse.” What Factors are Influencing the AUD/USD Exchange Rate? Several key factors are currently in play, shaping the trajectory of the AUD/USD pair: RBA Rate Cut Speculation: As discussed, the looming RBA decision and the strong probability of an interest rate cut are the dominant forces pushing the AUD lower. US Tariff Uncertainty: Counterbalancing the RBA pressure is the potential delay in implementing former US President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs. The slower-than-expected progress on these tariffs is easing concerns about immediate global trade disruptions, offering some support to risk-sensitive currencies like the AUD. Weak US Economic Data: Recent disappointing US Retail Sales data, showing a 0.9% decline in January, has exerted selling pressure on the Greenback. This weakness in the USD provides a degree of respite for the Australian Dollar . Understanding the Fundamentals: What Drives the Australian Dollar? To truly grasp the movements of the Australian Dollar , it’s crucial to understand its fundamental drivers. Here’s a breakdown of key factors: Factor Impact on AUD RBA Interest Rate Decisions Higher rates generally support AUD; lower rates weaken AUD. Iron Ore Prices As Australia’s largest export, rising iron ore prices typically boost AUD. Chinese Economic Health Strong Chinese economy (Australia’s largest trading partner) strengthens AUD. Trade Balance Positive trade balance (more exports than imports) is AUD-positive. Market Sentiment (Risk-On/Risk-Off) Risk-on sentiment generally favors AUD; risk-off sentiment weakens AUD. Australian Dollar FAQs: Key Questions Answered Let’s address some frequently asked questions to deepen your understanding of the Australian Dollar : What key factors drive the Australian Dollar? Several factors influence the Australian Dollar (AUD). Primarily, the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) interest rate policy is paramount. Being a resource-rich nation, iron ore prices, Australia’s top export, are also crucial. The health of the Chinese economy, Australia’s largest trading partner, plays a significant role, alongside domestic factors like inflation, economic growth, and the trade balance. Furthermore, global market sentiment – whether investors are embracing risk or seeking safety – impacts the AUD, with risk-on periods generally benefiting the currency. How do the decisions of the Reserve Bank of Australia impact the Australian Dollar? The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) exerts considerable influence over the Australian Dollar (AUD) through its control of interest rates . By setting the rate at which Australian banks lend to each other, the RBA shapes the broader interest rate landscape of the economy. The RBA’s primary objective is to maintain inflation within a 2-3% target range, adjusting interest rates accordingly. Higher interest rates relative to other major economies typically bolster the AUD, while lower rates tend to weaken it. The RBA also employs quantitative easing and tightening measures to manage credit conditions, with easing being AUD-negative and tightening AUD-positive. How does the health of the Chinese Economy impact the Australian Dollar? China’s economic performance is a major determinant of the Australian Dollar’s (AUD) value, given that China is Australia’s largest trading partner. A robust Chinese economy translates to increased demand for Australian raw materials, goods, and services, thereby boosting demand for the AUD and driving its value upward. Conversely, a slowing Chinese economy reduces this demand, putting downward pressure on the AUD. Consequently, positive or negative surprises in Chinese economic data often trigger direct reactions in the Australian Dollar exchange rates. How does the price of Iron Ore impact the Australian Dollar? Iron ore, Australia’s leading export, significantly impacts the Australian Dollar (AUD). With China as the primary destination for Australian iron ore, fluctuations in iron ore prices directly influence the AUD. Generally, rising iron ore prices lead to an appreciation of the AUD due to increased demand for the currency. Conversely, falling iron ore prices tend to weaken the AUD. Higher iron ore prices also contribute to a more favorable trade balance for Australia, further supporting the AUD. How does the Trade Balance impact the Australian Dollar? The trade balance, representing the difference between a nation’s exports and imports, is another crucial factor influencing the Australian Dollar’s value. Strong demand for Australian exports generates surplus demand for the AUD from international buyers seeking to purchase these exports. A positive trade balance, where exports exceed imports, strengthens the AUD, while a negative trade balance has the opposite effect, weakening the currency. Navigating the AUD/USD Landscape: Key Takeaways The AUD/USD pair is currently in a state of flux, heavily influenced by the anticipated RBA rate decision . While the expectation of an interest rate cut is exerting downward pressure on the Australian Dollar , factors like potential delays in US tariffs and recent US economic data are providing some counterweight. For traders and investors, closely monitoring the RBA’s announcement and subsequent market reactions will be crucial in the coming days. Understanding the fundamental drivers of the AUD, including interest rates , commodity prices, and global economic conditions, remains essential for informed decision-making in the forex market.

The deposit makes Brevan Howard Digital one of the first traditional financial firms to tap into Kinto’s on-chain mining program, the protocol said. Kinto operates as an Ethereum layer-2 network with built-in compliance mechanisms, including Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, facilitating financial institutions that face strict regulatory requirements to participate in decentralized finance. It also offers a smart contract wallet with default insurance and security enhancements.

Mining programs have been a staple in the DeFi sector but have largely been out of reach for traditional financial institutions due to compliance hurdles. Brevan Howard Digital’s participation signals growing interest from legacy financial firms in blockchain-based finance, particularly as platforms like Kinto adapt to meet institutional needs, Ramon Recuero, according to Kinto’s co-founder and CEO. “Institutions have been waiting for two things: regulatory clarity and compliance features.

Four particularly noteworthy altcoins are under great scrutiny by investors: Jupiter (JUP), Rexas Finance (RXS), Polygon (POL), and Optimism (OP). These Altcoins Are Worth Keeping An Eye On These coins’ creative technology, close relationships, and growing acceptance have been driving traction. Buying these cryptocurrencies now could generate huge returns if the market attitude becomes positive. Acting quickly could be the secret to grabbing this unheard-of market boom, given a historic rally forecast. Jupiter (JUP) Solana’s most sophisticated swap aggregation engine, Jupiter, provides flawless token swaps and extensive liquidity infrastructure.

Within the Solana ecosystem, the altcoin, Jupiter’s liquidity aggregation guarantees ideal pricing and reduces slippage, making it appealing as a DeFi solution. Jupiter’s distributed limit orders are among its best characteristics. They let users automate trades based on set price targets. Jupiter’s role in liquidity provisioning should increase as Solana’s DeFi space develops, strengthening its value offer. For investors looking for exposure to Solana’s fast-changing ecosystem, JUP, trading at $0.96, shows promise. At press time, the altcoin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick. This meant that buying pressure on Jupiter is rising, which can push the altcoin’s price up in the coming days. Source: TradingView Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance (RXS) is a blockchain-based technology changing the DeFi scene through asset tokenization, particularly in real estate. Using modern blockchain technology, RXS lets consumers tokenize actual assets and access quick, open, and safe financial services. With around $280 trillion worth of real estate worldwide, Rexas Finance seeks to release this wealth by giving institutional and private investors fresh liquidity sources. Right now, in stage 12, its last presale stage, RXS coins cost $0.20. The presale has been an absolute success, with sales rising over $45 million and more than 445 million tokens sold. Beyond real estate, Rexas Finance includes goods and financial assets in the worldwide financial market of $486 trillion. As an Ethereum-based token, RXS presents great security and utility, which helps position it for a possible 10,000% increase after launch. Rexas Finance chose a public presale instead of raising money from venture capitalists to guarantee greater accessibility to individual investors. The team intends to list RXS on three Tier 1 exchanges, promoting global acceptance and liquidity. The project’s roadmap includes strategic alliances and additional platform advancements, supporting RXS’s long-term leadership. Click Here To Buy Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale Optimism (OP) One layer-2 scaling technique designed to enhance Ethereum’s efficiency without losing the core principle of decentralization is optimism. Optimism handles off-chain transactions while maintaining Ethereum’s security architecture using optimistic roll-ups.

OP price is at $1.28, Optimism will significantly increase as more projects incorporate its layer-2 technology. In fact, Santiment’s data revealed that development around the altcoin has already rising. This was evident from the hike in its development activity. Source: Santiment Polygon (POL) Addressing congestion and excessive transaction fees, a polygon has become solidified as a top layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Polygon has become the preferred platform for DeFi apps and NFT projects by offering a more affordable and quick substitute. Beyond transaction facilitation, the Polygon ecosystem comprises governance and network security, where the POL token is fundamental. Reward-earning stakers help the network to be resilient, hence encouraging long-term ownership. As its growing number of alliances and applications shows, Polygon is becoming a necessary component of Ethereum’s scalability architecture. POL price at $0.36 right now, the altcoin offers a strong chance for investors trying to profit from Ethereum’s layer-2 expansion. Demand for Polygon’s products is expected to grow as Ethereum 2.0 advances, which may cause a notable price increase. Interestingly, Polygon’s supply on exchanges have dropped last week—an indication of rising demand of the POL token, which often results in price upticks. Source: Santiment Conlcusion Altcoins like Rexas Finance, Jupiter, Optimism, and Polygon are high-potential investments as the crypto market prepares for its largest surge since 2021. Strong candidates for exponential development, each of these currencies adds special value and invention to the blockchain environment. Securing a place in these cryptocurrencies now could pay off handsomely in the months ahead as institutional interest and acceptance explode.

US Crypto Task Force to Focus on National Bitcoin Reserve: Bernstein Analysts led by Gautam Chhugani at Bernstein noted that the creation of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve raises critical structural questions, such as whether the Federal Reserve or the U.S. Treasury would be responsible for purchasing BTC. If the Federal Reserve were to make those purchases, legislative approval would be required. Bernstein outlined potential financing mechanisms for Bitcoin purchases: New debt issuance Selling some of the US gold reserves Using $20 billion worth of Bitcoin seized from criminal organizations Global Implications of US Bitcoin Reserve The report suggests that the creation of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve could trigger a global race among governments to accumulate BTC as part of their sovereign wealth holdings. “The creation of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve could spark a global race among governments to purchase Bitcoin as one of their reserve assets,” Bernstein analysts wrote. This development aligns with broader discussions regarding Bitcoin’s role in national reserves, particularly as an alternative to gold in an evolving monetary environment. Trump Administration’s Wealth Fund Plan In addition to the national Bitcoin reserve, the Trump administration recently announced plans to create a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) focused on major U.S. crypto companies and market leaders. Bernstein emphasized that such a fund could strategically invest in leading crypto firms and position the United States as a dominant player in the blockchain economy. “Investors should position themselves for the next leg of the bull market in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related stocks,” Bernstein advised. *This is not investment advice.

This meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, marks a significant step in navigating the complex landscape of US-Russia relations and could inject fresh momentum into resolving the ongoing conflict. Will this diplomatic push alter the prevailing risk sentiment in the markets and trigger a notable market reaction ? Let’s delve into the details. Why are Ukraine Peace Talks a Hot Topic Now? The upcoming meeting gains prominence following a recent phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, hinting at a possible thaw in relations. This dialogue is seen as a crucial precursor to any substantial progress in de-escalating tensions in Ukraine. However, it’s important to note that Ukrainian officials will not be present at this particular meeting, according to BBC reports, raising questions about the inclusivity and scope of these initial discussions. Here’s what we know so far: US-Russia Engagement: This meeting signifies a direct engagement between US and Russian officials at a time of heightened global tensions. Saudi Arabia as Mediator: The choice of Saudi Arabia as the meeting location underscores the Kingdom’s growing role in international diplomacy and its potential to facilitate dialogue between conflicting parties. Ukraine’s Absence: The exclusion of Ukrainian officials from this initial US-Russia discussion is a point of contention and raises concerns about the negotiation process. How Could Ukraine Peace Talks Impact Financial Markets? Geopolitical events, especially those involving major global powers like the US and Russia, invariably send ripples through financial markets . Any positive movement towards de-escalation in Ukraine could be interpreted as a signal of reduced global risk, potentially shifting risk sentiment towards a more ‘risk-on’ environment. Conversely, any setbacks or lack of progress could exacerbate existing uncertainties and trigger a ‘risk-off’ response. Let’s break down potential market reactions: Market Sentiment Typical Asset Performance Risk-On (Optimistic about Peace) Stocks: Likely to rise as investors become more optimistic. Commodities (ex-Gold): Generally increase in value due to positive growth outlook. Cryptocurrencies: Tend to rally as investors seek higher-risk, higher-reward assets. Commodity Currencies (AUD, CAD, NZD): Strengthen due to increased demand for commodities. Risk-Off (Peace Talks Stagnate) Bonds (Government): Prices increase as investors seek safe havens. Gold: Price rises as a safe-haven asset. Safe-Haven Currencies (USD, JPY, CHF): Strengthen due to increased demand for safety. Decoding Risk Sentiment: What Does ‘Risk-On’ and ‘Risk-Off’ Really Mean? Understanding risk sentiment is crucial for navigating the volatile world of trading. These terms essentially describe the overall attitude of investors towards risk. In a “risk-on” market, optimism prevails. Investors are confident about future economic prospects and are willing to invest in assets perceived as riskier but with higher potential returns. Conversely, a “risk-off” market reflects investor anxiety and uncertainty. In such times, investors prefer safer assets, even if returns are modest, prioritizing capital preservation over high yields. Key Assets to Watch for Risk Sentiment Shifts Monitoring specific asset classes can provide valuable insights into prevailing risk sentiment . Here are some key indicators: Stock Markets: A rising stock market often signals ‘risk-on’ sentiment, while a falling market suggests ‘risk-off’. Commodities (excluding Gold): Broad commodity gains typically align with ‘risk-on’, reflecting positive economic growth expectations. Gold: Gold’s performance is often inversely related to risk sentiment . It tends to shine during ‘risk-off’ periods as a safe haven. Government Bonds: Increased demand for government bonds, especially US Treasuries, German Bunds, etc., usually points to ‘risk-off’ sentiment. Currencies: Certain currencies are considered barometers of risk sentiment . Commodity currencies like AUD, CAD, and NZD thrive in ‘risk-on’ environments, while safe-haven currencies like USD, JPY, and CHF strengthen during ‘risk-off’ periods. Currency Dynamics: Risk-On vs. Risk-Off The foreign exchange (FX) market offers a clear illustration of how risk sentiment plays out. Different currencies react distinctly to shifts in market mood. Which Currencies Benefit from ‘Risk-On’ Sentiment? Commodity-linked currencies are the primary beneficiaries of a ‘risk-on’ environment. These include: Australian Dollar (AUD) Canadian Dollar (CAD) New Zealand Dollar (NZD) Emerging Market Currencies (e.g., RUB, ZAR) These currencies are tied to economies that heavily rely on commodity exports. When risk sentiment is positive, expectations of increased global economic activity drive up demand and prices for commodities, boosting these nations’ export revenues and strengthening their currencies. Which Currencies Thrive in ‘Risk-Off’ Conditions? During ‘risk-off’ periods, investors flock to safe-haven currencies, seeking stability and security. The main beneficiaries are: US Dollar (USD): As the world’s reserve currency, the USD is the ultimate safe haven. Demand surges during crises. Japanese Yen (JPY): Japan’s strong net creditor position and historically low interest rates make the JPY a safe haven. Swiss Franc (CHF): Switzerland’s political neutrality and robust banking system attract investors seeking capital preservation. Current Market Reaction: A Wait-and-See Approach As of writing, the US Dollar Index (DXY) remains relatively unchanged at 106.78. This suggests that the market is currently in a wait-and-see mode, cautiously observing developments surrounding the Ukraine peace talks . The muted market reaction indicates that investors are likely holding their breath, awaiting concrete outcomes from the US-Russia meeting before making significant directional bets. The coming days will be critical in determining whether this diplomatic initiative can indeed pave the way for de-escalation and a shift in risk sentiment . Conclusion: Hope and Uncertainty in Equal Measure The upcoming Ukraine peace talks between US and Russian officials represent a potentially vital juncture in international relations. While the absence of Ukrainian representatives in this initial phase raises questions, the very fact that these discussions are taking place offers a glimmer of hope for de-escalation. For financial markets , the outcome remains uncertain. A positive breakthrough could unleash a wave of ‘risk-on’ sentiment, propelling stocks and cryptocurrencies higher, while failure to progress could reinforce ‘risk-off’ dynamics, favoring safe-haven assets. Traders and investors should closely monitor news flow from Saudi Arabia and related geopolitical developments to gauge the evolving risk sentiment and anticipate potential market reactions .

Currently, the spotlight is on Gold as Gold Price Forecast indicators suggest a downward drift for XAU/USD. After hovering near the coveted $2,900 mark, the precious metal is facing headwinds, primarily due to profit-taking. Let’s delve into the factors influencing this price movement and what it means for traders and investors. Why is XAU/USD Drifting Lower? Understanding Profit-Taking Dynamics In Monday’s early Asian trading session, XAU/USD , the symbol representing Gold against the US Dollar, is experiencing negative momentum, trading around $2,880. This dip is largely attributed to profit-taking. After periods of price appreciation, it’s common for investors to secure their gains, leading to selling pressure that can push prices down. Several factors are contributing to this profit-taking scenario: Easing of Trade War Fears: President Trump’s decision to delay the implementation of reciprocal tariffs has eased some market panic. Gold, often seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty, loses some of its shine when fears subside. Technical Correction: After a potential run-up to near $2,900, some traders might view the current levels as an opportune moment to take profits, especially if they anticipate resistance at this psychological level. Broader Market Sentiment: While not explicitly stated in the original content, broader market sentiment can also play a role. If equity markets are performing well, or if risk appetite increases for other reasons, investors may reduce their exposure to safe-haven assets like gold. Trump Tariffs and Their Impact on Gold Prices The shadow of Trump tariffs looms large over the gold market. While the immediate implementation of reciprocal tariffs has been delayed, the underlying policy direction remains a point of concern. Here’s how these tariff proposals are influencing gold: Initial Panic and Safe-Haven Buying: When President Trump initially announced his plan for reciprocal tariffs, it triggered fears of a global trade war. This uncertainty historically boosts demand for safe-haven assets like gold, driving prices up. Delaying Implementation and Profit-Taking: The subsequent delay in implementing these tariffs has calmed immediate market jitters. This easing of panic is a key factor contributing to the current profit-taking in gold. Potential for Future Escalation: Despite the delay, the risk of escalating trade tensions remains. Investors are closely monitoring developments surrounding Trump’s trade policies. Any indication of renewed or intensified trade disputes could quickly reignite safe-haven demand for gold, potentially reversing the current downward trend. The Safe-Haven Asset Appeal of Gold Amidst Uncertainty Despite the current dip, the fundamental reasons why gold is considered a safe-haven asset remain strong. In times of economic turmoil, geopolitical instability, or market uncertainty, investors often flock to gold as a store of value. Let’s examine why gold holds this coveted status: Gold: A Timeless Store of Value Feature Description Historical Significance Gold has been used as currency and a store of value for millennia, building inherent trust and recognition. Tangible Asset Unlike fiat currencies or digital assets, gold is a physical commodity, providing a sense of security and scarcity. Hedge Against Inflation Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation because its value tends to rise during periods of rising prices, preserving purchasing power. Currency Diversification Gold’s value is not tied to any single government or issuer, making it a diversifier against currency depreciation and economic instability in specific regions. Central Banks and Gold Reserves: A Strong Endorsement Central banks are significant players in the gold market. Their actions underscore gold’s importance as a reserve asset: Reserve Diversification: Central banks hold gold as part of their foreign exchange reserves to diversify away from reliance on single currencies like the US Dollar. Currency Stability: Large gold reserves are perceived as a sign of economic strength and can bolster confidence in a country’s currency. Record Purchases: In 2022, central banks globally added a record 1,136 tonnes of gold to their reserves, highlighting its continued importance in the global financial system. Emerging economies like China, India, and Turkey are leading this trend, further solidifying gold’s role. Factors Influencing the Gold Price Forecast Predicting the Gold Price Forecast accurately requires understanding the interplay of various economic and geopolitical factors. Here are some key drivers to watch: US Dollar Strength: Gold is priced in US dollars (XAU/USD). A weaker US Dollar generally makes gold more attractive to buyers using other currencies, pushing prices up. Conversely, a stronger dollar can exert downward pressure on gold prices. Recent downbeat US retail sales data, for instance, weakened the USD and could offer some support to gold. Interest Rates: Gold is a non-yielding asset. When interest rates rise, bonds and other interest-bearing investments become more attractive, potentially reducing the appeal of gold. Conversely, lower interest rates tend to be supportive of gold prices. Geopolitical Risks: Events like wars, political instability, and international tensions typically increase demand for safe-haven assets, benefiting gold. Economic Recession Fears: Concerns about economic slowdowns or recessions also drive investors towards gold as a safe store of value. Inflation Expectations: As mentioned earlier, gold is often used as an inflation hedge. Rising inflation expectations can increase demand for gold. Navigating the Gold Market: Key Takeaways The current Gold Price Forecast suggests a period of consolidation or potential further downside in the short term due to profit-taking and easing trade war fears. However, the fundamental drivers supporting gold’s safe-haven status remain relevant. Investors should consider the following: Monitor Trade War Developments: Keep a close watch on news and announcements related to US trade policy and international trade relations. Escalating tensions could quickly shift market sentiment back in favor of gold. Track US Dollar Performance: The strength or weakness of the US Dollar will continue to be a significant factor influencing gold prices. Economic data releases and Federal Reserve policy decisions are key indicators to follow. Assess Risk Appetite: Overall market risk appetite will impact demand for safe-haven assets. Monitor equity market performance and investor sentiment as gauges of risk appetite. Consider Long-Term Value: Despite short-term fluctuations, gold has historically proven to be a valuable asset for portfolio diversification and wealth preservation, particularly in uncertain economic times. Conclusion: Gold’s Enduring Appeal Amidst Market Swings While XAU/USD is currently experiencing a dip below $2,900 due to profit-taking and a temporary easing of trade war anxieties, the underlying allure of gold as a safe-haven asset persists. The interplay of Trump’s tariff policies, US economic data, and global risk sentiment will continue to shape the Gold Price Forecast in the coming weeks and months. Investors should remain vigilant, informed, and prepared to navigate the dynamic gold market, recognizing both the potential for short-term volatility and the enduring long-term value proposition of this precious metal.

The EUR/USD pair, a bellwether of global market sentiment, has recently paused its winning streak, dipping below the crucial 1.0500 level. This movement arrives amidst intriguing economic signals and geopolitical undercurrents, creating a potentially lucrative landscape for savvy traders and investors to navigate. Let’s delve into the factors driving this shift and what it could mean for your trading strategy. Why is EUR/USD Under Pressure Below 1.05? Despite a generally positive market mood, the EUR/USD pair finds itself trading lower, currently hovering around 1.0490 during Asian trading hours. This subdued performance comes after a four-day winning streak was abruptly halted. Several factors are contributing to this pause in the Euro’s upward momentum against the US Dollar : Weaker US Retail Sales Data: Recent data from the US Census Bureau revealed a significant 0.9% drop in US retail sales for January, exceeding market expectations of a 0.1% decline. This disappointing figure has reignited speculation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) might consider cutting interest rates later this year, even with persistent inflation concerns. Lower interest rates can weaken the US Dollar , but in this instance, the broader market reaction seems to be more nuanced. Presidents’ Day Holiday in the US: Liquidity in the market might be thinner than usual during the North American session as major US financial markets are closed on Monday for Presidents’ Day. Reduced trading volumes can sometimes lead to increased volatility and unexpected price swings. Profit-Taking After Gains: The EUR/USD pair had experienced a notable rally recently, partly fueled by delays in the implementation of US President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs and overall weaker US economic data. It’s natural for some traders to take profits after such gains, leading to a temporary pullback. The Role of US Economic Data and Fed Rate Cut Speculation The weaker-than-expected US retail sales report has been a key catalyst in the recent EUR/USD price action. To understand its impact, consider these points: Factor Impact on US Dollar Impact on EUR/USD Weaker US Retail Sales Negative (suggests economic slowdown) Positive (initially, due to USD weakness) Fed Rate Cut Speculation Negative (lower rates reduce currency attractiveness) Positive (initially, due to USD weakness) However, the initial positive impact on EUR/USD from US Dollar weakness appears to be fading. This could be due to several reasons, including: Inflation Concerns Persist: Despite weaker retail sales , inflation remains a concern for the Fed. This could limit the extent to which the Fed can cut interest rates , potentially capping US Dollar weakness. Eurozone Economic Outlook: While the US economic data is under scrutiny, the Eurozone’s economic outlook also plays a crucial role in the EUR/USD pair’s direction. Any negative developments in the Eurozone economy could weigh on the Euro , offsetting US Dollar weakness. Will a Ukraine Ceasefire Trigger a Euro Surge? Geopolitical developments, particularly the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, significantly influence the Euro . A JP Morgan note suggests a potentially substantial upside for the EUR/USD pair – as much as 5% – if a ceasefire in Ukraine is achieved and gas supplies from Russia resume. Recent reports indicate potential diplomatic movement, with suggestions that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to initiate negotiations to end the conflict. Sources cited by the BBC suggest that Trump administration officials are scheduled to meet with Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss a possible peace agreement. A ceasefire and resumption of gas supplies would be profoundly positive for the Eurozone economy, which has been heavily impacted by the energy crisis stemming from the Ukraine conflict. This positive scenario could indeed trigger a significant rally in the Euro . Understanding the Euro: Key FAQs for Traders For traders navigating the EUR/USD pair and the broader Forex market, understanding the fundamentals of the Euro is crucial. Let’s address some frequently asked questions: What is the Euro? The Euro (€) is the official currency of the Eurozone, comprising 19 member states of the European Union. It stands as the second most traded currency globally, only behind the US Dollar . In 2022, the Euro accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, boasting an average daily turnover exceeding $2.2 trillion. The EUR/USD pair is the king of the Forex market, commanding an estimated 30% of all transactions. Other significant Euro pairs include EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%), and EUR/AUD (2%). What is the ECB and How Does it Impact the Euro? The European Central Bank (ECB), headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany, acts as the central bank for the Eurozone. The ECB’s primary mandate is to maintain price stability within the Eurozone. To achieve this, the ECB sets interest rates and implements monetary policy. The ECB’s main tool is adjusting interest rates . Higher interest rates , or even the expectation of them, typically strengthen the Euro , making it more attractive to investors seeking higher returns. Conversely, lower interest rates tend to weaken the Euro . The ECB Governing Council, composed of the heads of Eurozone national central banks and six permanent members (including the ECB President), convenes eight times a year to make monetary policy decisions. How Does Inflation Data Influence the Euro’s Value? Eurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is a critical economic indicator for the Euro . If inflation rises above expectations, particularly exceeding the ECB’s 2% target, it often compels the ECB to raise interest rates to control price increases. Relatively higher interest rates compared to other major economies generally benefit the Euro . This is because higher rates attract global investors to park their capital in Eurozone assets, increasing demand for the currency. How Does Economic Data Impact the Euro’s Strength? Various economic data releases serve as gauges of the Eurozone’s economic health and can significantly impact the Euro ‘s value. Key indicators include: GDP (Gross Domestic Product) Manufacturing and Services PMIs (Purchasing Managers’ Indices) Employment figures Consumer sentiment surveys A robust Eurozone economy is generally positive for the Euro . It attracts foreign investment and may prompt the ECB to raise interest rates , both of which strengthen the currency. Conversely, weak economic data tends to exert downward pressure on the Euro . Economic data from the four largest Eurozone economies – Germany, France, Italy, and Spain – are particularly influential as they collectively represent 75% of the Eurozone’s total economic output. How Does the Trade Balance Affect the Euro? The Trade Balance, which measures the difference between a country’s exports and imports, is another crucial data point for the Euro . A positive Trade Balance (exports exceeding imports) strengthens a currency. This is because countries with strong export sectors see increased demand for their currency from foreign buyers seeking to purchase their goods and services. Conversely, a negative Trade Balance weakens a currency as it indicates more money flowing out of the country to pay for imports than coming in from exports.

PancakeSwap historic price sentiment PancakeSwap price history PancakeSwap’s native token, CAKE, has had an eventful price history since its inception in September 2020. CAKE launched on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) in September 2020, initially trading at a fraction of a cent. Over time, it experienced gradual growth. The first notable surge occurred during the first DeFi bull run in early 2021. CAKE’s price skyrocketed from less than $1 to over $20 in just a few weeks, reflecting the growing popularity of PancakeSwap and the broader DeFi market. Following this surge, CAKE went through a correction and consolidation phase, trading within the $10 to $15 range, allowing the token to stabilize. The second DeFi bull run in April and May 2021 saw CAKE’s price reaching new all-time highs. At its peak, CAKE briefly touched $44, highlighting its resilience and potential. Like many cryptocurrencies, CAKE faced increased market volatility during the mid-2021 crypto market correction, with its price fluctuating between $10 and $20. In late 2021, CAKE saw a resurgence, reaching and maintaining a price of around $20 between August and October. However, the bearish trend began in November, and throughout 2022, CAKE struggled, only having hit a peak of $12 in early January 2022. By the end of 2022, it was trading at approximately $3.2. In early 2023, there were brief price corrections, pushing CAKE to $4.68. Unfortunately, the bears returned, driving the price down to $1.3 by mid-2023. Till the year 2023 came to an end, CAKE regained bullish momentum and spiked up to $3.5 range. 2024 started with a lower break from the peak, and the price reduced to $2.41 by the end of January. At the start of February 2024, Pancakeswap started another bullish run, and it peaked at $5.15. By the end of April, CAKE had lost almost 50% of its value, and its price had decreased to the $2.5 level. In May, CAKE neared the $3 mark and jumped to 3.19 on June 5, 2024. However, the coin remained on a downslope till the end of July. CAKE traded around the $1.48 to $2.21 range in August and remained in the said range till the end of October. The token started spiking in November with a peak price of $3.17, and it jumped to $4.18 in December 2024. It ended the year 2024 with a price tag of $2.50. CAKE saw a high price of $2.84 in January 2025, but it corrected down to the $2.6 range in February.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CAKE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-17 13:55:00
40453877,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129498,1739800557,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Fragile Bounce: USD/CAD Fails to Conquer 1.4200 Amid Forex Uncertainty,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usd-cad-fragile-forex-bounce/,"In the ever-turbulent world of Forex trading, the USD/CAD currency pair is currently caught in a tug-of-war. After briefly dipping to a two-month low, it’s attempting a modest recovery, but faces significant hurdles in breaking above the critical 1.4200 level. Let’s dive into the factors influencing this struggle and what it means for traders. Why is USD/CAD Struggling to Break 1.4200? The USD/CAD pair’s recent price action is a fascinating study in contrasting forces. While it has managed a slight bounce from its recent lows, the upward momentum remains weak. Several key factors are contributing to this hesitant recovery: Crude Oil Price Weakness: Canada’s economy is closely tied to crude oil, being a major exporter. The recent drop in oil prices, fueled by hopes of a Russia-Ukraine peace deal and the potential easing of sanctions against Russia, is weighing heavily on the Canadian Dollar (CAD), also known as the Loonie. This should, in theory, support USD/CAD, but the bounce remains limited. Subdued US Dollar (USD) Momentum: Conversely, the US Dollar (USD) itself is not showing strong bullish momentum. Concerns about potential economic fallout from US President Trump’s proposed tariffs and recent disappointing US Retail Sales data are keeping USD bulls at bay. This lack of USD strength is capping the upside for the currency pair . Bank of Canada (BoC) Rate Cut Expectations: While reduced, expectations for a March rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) are still present. Any hint of a less dovish stance from the BoC could strengthen the Canadian Dollar and further pressure USD/CAD . Decoding the Forex Cross-Currents: USD vs. CAD To understand the USD/CAD dynamic, we need to analyze the individual forces acting on both the US Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. US Dollar (USD) – Hawkish Fed vs. Economic Worries The US Dollar’s performance is currently a mixed bag. On one hand: Hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed): The prevailing expectation is that the Federal Reserve will maintain its hawkish stance to combat sticky inflation. This hawkish outlook generally supports the US Dollar. Trump’s Tariff Plans: President Trump’s directive to formulate plans for reciprocal tariffs is creating uncertainty. While no immediate tariffs have been announced, the potential for trade disputes is weighing on market sentiment and, consequently, the USD. Weak US Retail Sales: Friday’s release of surprisingly weak US Retail Sales data, showing the largest drop in nearly two years, has further dampened enthusiasm for the USD. Canadian Dollar (CAD) – Oil Price Drag and BoC’s Balancing Act The Canadian Dollar, on the other hand, is navigating its own set of challenges and supports: Oil Price Decline: As mentioned, the drop in crude oil prices is a significant headwind for the commodity-linked Loonie. Reduced BoC Rate Cut Bets: Market expectations for a further rate cut by the Bank of Canada in March have diminished somewhat. This provides some support to the Canadian Dollar, as higher interest rates are generally CAD-positive. Canadian Dollar FAQs: Understanding the Loonie’s Drivers Want to understand the Canadian Dollar better? Let’s address some frequently asked questions: What key factors drive the Canadian Dollar? Several factors influence the Canadian Dollar’s value: Bank of Canada (BoC) Interest Rates: Higher rates tend to attract foreign investment, boosting CAD. Crude Oil Prices: As Canada’s top export, oil price fluctuations directly impact the CAD. Canadian Economic Health: Strong economic data supports a stronger CAD. Inflation: Higher inflation can lead to higher interest rates, supporting CAD. Trade Balance: A positive trade balance is generally CAD-positive. Market Sentiment (Risk-On/Risk-Off): CAD is often seen as a risk-on currency. US Economic Health: As Canada’s largest trading partner, the US economy’s performance is crucial. How do the decisions of the Bank of Canada impact the Canadian Dollar? The BoC’s monetary policy is a major driver. By adjusting interest rates and employing tools like quantitative easing/tightening, the BoC influences borrowing costs and credit conditions, directly affecting the Canadian Dollar’s appeal. How does the price of Oil impact the Canadian Dollar? Oil is a cornerstone of the Canadian economy. Rising oil prices typically increase demand for CAD, strengthening its value, and vice versa. How does inflation data impact the value of the Canadian Dollar? Contrary to traditional views, higher inflation now often leads to central banks raising interest rates to combat it. This attracts foreign capital seeking higher yields, thus increasing demand for the Canadian Dollar. How does economic data influence the value of the Canadian Dollar? Strong economic indicators like GDP growth, employment figures, and positive PMIs suggest a healthy economy, attracting investment and potentially prompting the BoC to raise rates, all of which are CAD-positive. Weak data has the opposite effect. Tariffs FAQs: Trump’s Trade Policy and Market Impact President Trump’s tariff proposals are injecting volatility into the Forex market. Let’s clarify some common questions about tariffs: What are tariffs? Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. They aim to protect domestic industries by making imported goods more expensive, thus giving local producers a price advantage. What is the difference between taxes and tariffs? While both generate government revenue, tariffs are levied on imports at ports of entry, while taxes are broader and paid by individuals and businesses at the point of purchase or income generation. Are tariffs good or bad? Economists are divided. Some argue tariffs protect domestic jobs and correct trade imbalances. Others warn they raise consumer prices, invite retaliatory tariffs, and harm global trade. What is US President Donald Trump’s tariff plan? Trump aims to use tariffs to bolster the US economy, particularly focusing on major trading partners like Mexico, China, and Canada. He intends to use tariff revenue to reduce income taxes. Navigating the Forex Landscape: Key Takeaways for USD/CAD Traders The USD/CAD currency pair is currently in a delicate balance. Here’s what traders should watch: Monitor Oil Prices: Keep a close eye on crude oil price movements, as they will continue to exert significant influence on the Canadian Dollar. Track BoC and Fed Communication: Pay attention to statements and policy signals from both the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates and economic outlook. Economic Data Releases: Be aware of key economic data releases from both the US and Canada, as these can trigger volatility in Forex markets and the USD/CAD pair. Geopolitical Developments: Events like the Russia-Ukraine situation and global trade policy discussions can have a significant impact on currency valuations. Conclusion: USD/CAD at a Crossroads The USD/CAD pair’s struggle below 1.4200 reflects the complex interplay of oil prices, central bank policies, and global economic uncertainties. While the pair has shown a modest bounce, sustained upward momentum remains elusive. Traders should remain vigilant and closely monitor the factors outlined above to anticipate future movements in this dynamic currency pair . The Forex market is known for its volatility, and USD/CAD is no exception in the current climate.

40454015,https://coinpaper.com/7545/vitalik-buterin-aims-to-streamline-ethereum-s-layer-2-interoperability,1739800800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Vitalik Buterin Aims to Streamline Ethereum’s Layer-2 Interoperability,https://coinpaper.com/7545/vitalik-buterin-aims-to-streamline-ethereum-s-layer-2-interoperability,"As Ethereum continues to refine its scalability strategy and Ripple strengthens its foothold in key Asian markets, two significant developments are shaping the cryptocurrency landscape. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has introduced a proposal aimed at improving decentralization and efficiency in the network’s rollup ecosystem, while new data highlights XRP’s growing popularity among Japanese investors, surpassing Ethereum in exchange holdings. Vitalik Buterin’s Vision for Ethereum’s Future: A Universal Light Client for Decentralized Scalability Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has unveiled a long-term strategy to address the growing challenges of decentralization and scalability in Ethereum’s rollup-centric ecosystem. As Ethereum continues to expand horizontally through Layer-2 (L2) rollups, concerns about the complexity of running light clients without relying on centralized intermediaries have intensified. Buterin’s latest proposal, centered around Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3668, aims to standardize proof verification across the diverse and evolving L2 landscape. Ethereum's roadmap prioritizes rollups as the primary scaling solution, enabling high throughput and low fees while maintaining the network’s security. However, as more applications and wallets interact with multiple L2s, the lack of a standardized and decentralized approach to validating state proofs has become a pressing issue. Developers are grappling with how to embed and verify proofs efficiently across different rollups without depending on centralized entities. Light clients—Ethereum nodes that rely on cryptographic proofs rather than maintaining a full copy of the blockchain—are particularly affected by this fragmentation. In the absence of a universal proof verification standard, developers must either implement rollup-specific verification methods or rely on centralized service providers, undermining the decentralization ethos of Ethereum. To solve this issue, Buterin has proposed leveraging an Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) similar to EIP-3668. This solution would enable L2 networks to define an on-chain configuration contract that specifies the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) code responsible for verifying state proofs. In effect, this would create a universal light client capable of interacting seamlessly with all rollups, using a standardized proof verification mechanism. The key innovation in this approach is the use of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, where the universal light client can request proofs and verify them using on-chain EVM code. This eliminates the need for external intermediaries while enhancing the efficiency and security of state proof verification. By adopting this model, Ethereum’s L2 ecosystem would benefit in several ways: Elimination of Centralized Middlemen Currently, many wallets and applications rely on centralized services for proof verification, which introduces points of failure and potential censorship risks. Buterin’s proposal removes this dependency by allowing L2s to validate proofs in a decentralized manner. Cross-Rollup Compatibility Each rollup currently operates its own proof system, making interoperability difficult. The universal light client would introduce a common proof format, streamlining interactions between different L2s and Ethereum’s base layer. Enhanced Security and Transparency By verifying proofs on-chain through the EVM, the system would ensure that no single entity controls the verification process. This maintains Ethereum’s security guarantees even as the network scales through rollups. Future-Proofing Ethereum’s Scalability As rollups continue to evolve, a universal proof verification standard will allow Ethereum’s infrastructure to remain flexible, accommodating new cryptographic advances and emerging L2 technologies. Despite its promise, implementing a universal light client is not without hurdles. One of the major concerns raised by developers is the lack of uniformity among rollups when it comes to proof generation. Different rollups use varying cryptographic schemes and proof formats, making it challenging to enforce a single standard. Buterin addressed these concerns by emphasizing that the proof format would be byte-based, meaning that each rollup could interpret the data according to its own verification logic. This flexibility ensures that rollups maintain their autonomy while still aligning with Ethereum’s broader decentralization goals. Another challenge is the need for continuous updates and coordination among L2 networks. Establishing a universal proof standard requires extensive collaboration between rollup developers, Ethereum core developers, and wallet providers. The specification must be robust enough to support future innovations while maintaining backward compatibility. A Step Towards a More Unified Ethereum Ecosystem Buterin’s vision for a universal light client represents a critical step in Ethereum’s long-term evolution. As the network transitions to a rollup-centric future, ensuring seamless interoperability across L2s will be crucial for maintaining decentralization and user autonomy. If successfully implemented, this approach could set a new standard for blockchain scalability, making Ethereum more resilient and accessible while reducing reliance on centralized infrastructure. The Ethereum community now faces the task of refining and adopting this proposal, paving the way for a more decentralized and efficient multi-rollup future. XRP Gains Stronghold in Japan, Outpacing Ethereum in Popularity Among Investors In other news, XRP, the cryptocurrency closely associated with Ripple, continues to assert its dominance in Japan, where it has outperformed Ethereum (ETH) in terms of exchange holdings. According to recent data, XRP holds an 18% share of the tokens stored on Japanese exchanges, making it the second most popular cryptocurrency in the country. In contrast, Ethereum lags behind with a 14.4% share, while Bitcoin remains the undisputed leader with a commanding 65% of total exchange holdings. The sustained growth of Bitcoin's market dominance in Japan highlights the resilience of the leading cryptocurrency despite the increasing number of altcoins. However, the substantial adoption of XRP in Japan shows the unique position Ripple has built in the country over the years. XRP’s prominence in Japan is not a coincidence. Ripple has been actively fostering relationships within the Japanese financial sector for nearly a decade, which has contributed to its strong standing among investors and institutions alike. One of the key milestones in Ripple’s expansion into Japan was its partnership with SBI Holdings, one of the country’s most influential financial conglomerates. In 2016, SBI teamed up with Ripple to create SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture aimed at facilitating cross-border payments using Ripple’s blockchain technology. This initiative has played a crucial role in promoting the adoption of XRP in Japan's banking and financial ecosystem. The collaboration between Ripple and SBI has only strengthened over the years. In 2019, SBI CEO Yoshitaka Kitao joined Ripple’s board of directors, further solidifying the company’s influence in Japan’s financial industry. The partnership has also paved the way for real-world use cases of XRP in remittances and international transactions, making it an attractive asset for Japanese investors. One of the primary reasons for XRP’s widespread adoption in Japan is the country’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies. Unlike the United States, where Ripple has faced an extended legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Japan has been relatively supportive of the cryptocurrency industry. In 2021, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) officially clarified that XRP was not considered a security, a stark contrast to the US SEC’s position. This regulatory certainty has given Japanese investors confidence in holding and trading XRP, allowing the cryptocurrency to flourish in the region. Ripple’s regulatory struggles in the US even prompted the company to consider relocating its global headquarters to Tokyo in 2020. However, Ripple ultimately decided to remain in San Francisco while continuing to expand its presence in Asia. Japan’s clear and well-defined crypto regulations continue to make it one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions in the world. Ripple’s deep ties with SBI Holdings have led to several groundbreaking initiatives aimed at promoting blockchain innovation in Japan and South Korea. Last year, Ripple launched a new fund dedicated to fostering the growth of blockchain startups and projects in these two markets. The fund’s goal is to support companies leveraging Ripple’s technology, particularly those building on the XRP Ledger. Additionally, SBI has taken steps to integrate XRP Ledger into its operations, marking a significant development for the Japanese market. The move signifies growing institutional acceptance of XRP’s underlying technology, further cementing its position as a major player in Japan’s crypto ecosystem. XRP’s Rising Popularity in South Korea While Japan remains a stronghold for XRP, the cryptocurrency has also witnessed a surge in popularity in South Korea. The country is well-known for its enthusiasm toward altcoins, often referred to as “kimchi coins” in local trading circles. South Korean traders were a driving force behind the massive XRP rally in the fourth quarter of last year, demonstrating their continued interest in the asset. XRP’s liquidity and active trading volume in South Korea further show its appeal in Asia. As regulatory clarity improves and more financial institutions integrate blockchain-based solutions, XRP could see even greater adoption in the region. The strong foothold XRP has established in Japan is unlikely to diminish anytime soon. With ongoing collaborations between Ripple and SBI, regulatory support from Japanese authorities, and increasing institutional adoption of XRP Ledger, the cryptocurrency is well-positioned for sustained growth in the region. As Ripple continues to expand its influence across Asia, the growing adoption of XRP in Japan and South Korea could serve as a blueprint for other markets. The combination of regulatory clarity, strategic partnerships, and real-world use cases makes XRP one of the most promising cryptocurrencies in the Asian financial landscape. While Ethereum remains a dominant force in the global crypto market, XRP’s unique standing in Japan suggests that local dynamics play a crucial role in shaping investor preferences. With Japan’s financial sector increasingly embracing blockchain technology, XRP’s prominence is likely to grow, reinforcing its position as a favored digital asset among Japanese investors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|ASIA|XRP|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-17 14:00:00

However, while SHIB experiences short-term volatility, WallitIQ (WLTQ) positions itself as a more potent investment opportunity with a 10,000% surge projection. With a robust technological foundation and real-world utility, this AI token presents investors with a more sustainable and promising growth trajectory.

With surging demand during its presale phase, analysts predict this AI-driven token could sell out swiftly, solidifying its place as a groundbreaking force in the crypto revolution. Shiba Inu Price Skyrockets As SHIB Netflow Jumps 5,277% The Shiba Inu price has sent shockwaves through the crypto market with an astonishing 5,277% surge in net inflows, signaling a potential price reversal. Investors are speculating whether this influx of liquidity marks the beginning of a SHIB rally or just a fleeting anomaly. The Shiba Inu price has seen volatile swings, but an impressive increase in capital inflow by SHIB suggests renewed investor confidence. Historically, SHIB has thrived on community-driven momentum, and this latest surge could reignite bullish sentiment. If the trend continues, the Shiba Inu price may break through resistance levels, attracting more traders to the market. However, skeptics warn that sharp inflows by SHIB don’t always equate to sustained price action for the Shiba Inu price. The Shiba Inu price has a history of dramatic movements, and investors are eyeing key support and resistance zones.

40454004,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129502,1739800879,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding US Dollar Impact: NEC Director’s Fed Meetings Spark Interest Rate Speculation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-dollar-fed-meetings-impact/,"Cryptocurrency and Forex traders are keenly watching every move in the traditional financial world, as these shifts often ripple through digital asset markets. Recently, a key development has emerged from the US economic landscape: regular meetings between National Economic Council (NEC) Director Kevin Hassett and Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell. This news has sparked discussions and speculation, particularly around the future direction of interest rates and the US Dollar. Let’s delve into what this could mean for the markets and your trading strategies. Why are Regular Meetings Between the NEC Director and Jerome Powell Significant? The fact that the NEC Director is regularly meeting with the Federal Reserve Chair is noteworthy. Here’s why: Economic Coordination: The NEC advises the President on economic policy. Regular meetings suggest a close coordination between the White House and the Federal Reserve, although officials are keen to stress the Fed’s independence. Market Sensitivity: Any hint of communication between the executive branch and the Fed, especially concerning monetary policy, can move markets. Traders are always looking for signals about future economic direction. Transparency vs. Influence: While the official line is that these meetings are not to influence interest rate decisions, the very existence of these discussions raises questions about potential White House input, even if indirect. Unpacking the Key Takeaways: Interest Rates and Inflation Expectations According to the report, Director Hassett downplayed any intention to influence interest rates during these meetings, emphasizing Jerome Powell’s autonomy. However, he pointed to a significant drop in long-term interest yields – a 40 basis point decrease in 10-year Treasury yields – as a sign that the market anticipates lower inflation in the future. Let’s break down what this means: Declining Long-Term Interest Yields: A Glimmer of Hope for Lower Inflation? The drop in 10-year Treasury yields is a critical market signal. It suggests that investors are betting on lower inflation in the years to come. Why is this important? Inflation Expectations: Bond yields reflect inflation expectations. Lower yields often indicate that the market believes inflation will be contained. Future Monetary Policy: If inflation expectations are indeed moderating, it could give the Federal Reserve room to become less aggressive in raising interest rates, or even consider rate cuts down the line. Impact on the US Dollar: Lower interest rate expectations can sometimes weaken the US Dollar, as it becomes less attractive to yield-seeking investors. US Dollar’s Reaction: Wounds Licked, But Still Subdued The US Dollar Index (DXY) was reported to be “licking its wounds” near two-week lows following this news, down 0.07% at 106.57. This reaction, though modest, is telling. Here’s what to consider: Market Indecision: The subdued reaction suggests that the market is still processing the information and hasn’t made a definitive directional bet on the US Dollar yet. Broader Factors at Play: The US Dollar’s movement isn’t solely dictated by this news. Global economic conditions, geopolitical events, and other central bank policies also play significant roles. Potential for Volatility: Any further statements from the Fed or the White House regarding these meetings or economic outlook could trigger more pronounced moves in the US Dollar and related markets. Federal Reserve (Fed) FAQs: Understanding the Basics For those newer to understanding the intricacies of the Federal Reserve and its impact, let’s address some frequently asked questions: What Does the Federal Reserve Do, and How Does it Impact the US Dollar? The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, plays a pivotal role in shaping monetary policy. Its primary mandates are: Price Stability: Keeping inflation under control, aiming for a target of 2%. Full Employment: Promoting maximum employment in the US economy. The Fed’s main tool to achieve these goals is adjusting interest rates . Here’s how it works: Scenario Fed Action Impact on Economy Impact on US Dollar High Inflation (above 2%) Raises interest rates Increases borrowing costs, slows down economic activity to curb inflation Strengthens US Dollar (USD) – attracts investors seeking higher yields Low Inflation (below 2%) or High Unemployment Lowers interest rates Encourages borrowing and spending, stimulates economic growth Weakens US Dollar (USD) – lower yields make USD less attractive How Often Does the Fed Hold Monetary Policy Meetings? The Federal Reserve conducts eight scheduled policy meetings each year. These meetings are where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses the current economic landscape and decides on monetary policy adjustments. The FOMC comprises twelve key officials: The seven members of the Board of Governors The President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Four presidents from the remaining eleven regional Reserve Banks (on a rotating basis) Quantitative Easing (QE) and its Impact on the US Dollar In times of severe economic distress, the Federal Reserve might resort to Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is an unconventional monetary policy where the Fed injects liquidity into the financial system. Key aspects of QE include: Purpose: To increase credit flow during financial crises or periods of very low inflation. Mechanism: The Fed essentially prints more dollars and uses them to purchase high-grade bonds from financial institutions. Impact on US Dollar: QE typically weakens the US Dollar because it increases the supply of dollars in the market. Quantitative Tightening (QT) and its Impact on the US Dollar Quantitative Tightening (QT) is the opposite of QE. It’s a process where the Federal Reserve reduces its balance sheet. This is achieved by: Stopping bond purchases: The Fed ceases buying new bonds. Not reinvesting maturing principal: As bonds held by the Fed mature, the principal is not reinvested into new bond purchases. Impact on US Dollar: QT is generally positive for the US Dollar. By reducing the money supply, it can increase the dollar’s value. Actionable Insights for Crypto and Forex Traders So, how can you use this information in your trading decisions? Monitor US Dollar Index (DXY): Keep a close watch on the DXY for reactions to Fed announcements, economic data, and news related to these NEC-Fed meetings. Track Treasury Yields: Pay attention to movements in 10-year Treasury yields as an indicator of inflation expectations and potential shifts in Fed policy. Stay Informed on Fed Communication: Follow speeches, statements, and meeting minutes from Federal Reserve officials, particularly Jerome Powell, for clues about future policy directions. Consider Macroeconomic Factors: Remember that cryptocurrency and Forex markets are influenced by a wide range of macroeconomic factors. Factor in global economic trends, geopolitical risks, and other central bank actions alongside US-specific news. Conclusion: Navigating the Economic Landscape The regular meetings between the NEC Director and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlight the intricate dance between fiscal and monetary policy in the US. While the direct impact on interest rates remains to be seen, the market’s sensitivity to these interactions is undeniable. For cryptocurrency and Forex traders, staying informed about these developments is crucial. By closely monitoring the US Dollar , inflation indicators, and Federal Reserve communications, you can better navigate the economic landscape and make more informed trading decisions. The insights gleaned from these high-level discussions can provide valuable context for understanding market movements and positioning yourself for potential opportunities and risks.

Moreover, it has lost 33.11% over the past month and has a Year-to-Date (YTD) return of -16.16%. With a market cap of $39.224 billion, it has a dominance of 1.2695%. TradingView: DOGE/USDT The EMA 50-day displays a bearish curve in the daily time frame. On the other hand, the 200-day EMA acts as a strong support in the DOGE price chart. With its RSI indicator hovering below the neutral trendline, this memecoin hints at increased price volatility. Reclaiming the price above its resistance level of $0.2650 could set the stage for the Dogecoin price to head toward its upper high of $0.3250. Conversely, if the bears maintain dominance, this meme coin could retest its low of $0.20750 in the coming time. Curious to find out if the DOGE coin price will reach $1 this 2025? Read CoinPedia’s latest Dogecoin Price Prediction today to explore the possible long-term mysteries! Shiba Inu (SHIB) Despite recording a jump of ~3% over the last seven days, the SHIB memecoin has lost 29.53% in 30 days and has a YTD return of -24.05%, highlighting a long-term bearish action for the memecoin in the cryptocurrency space. TradingView: SHIB/USDT The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a rising green histogram in the daily time frame with its averages recording a similar price action. However, the EMA 50/200-day records a negative price action in the SHIB price chart, suggesting mixed price sentiment for the 2nd largest meme coin. Suppose, the market favors the bulls, in that case, the Shiba Inu price will surpass its immediate resistance level of $0.0000170 and head toward its upper high of $0.00002350. However, a bearish reversal could pull the price toward its low of $0.00001175 in the coming time.

Nonetheless, one crypto market veteran believes that the Ripple (XRP) price may soon surge to new highs if it completes the formation of a cup and handle pattern. XRP Price May Hit New Highs as Cup and Handle Pattern Forms In an X post , Ali Martinez, a popular crypto market veteran, predicted that the ongoing XRP price consolidation was strategic. He believes that the coin is in the process of forming a cup and handle (C&H) pattern on the 30-minute chart . A C&H pattern is a continuation sign made up of three key parts: a rounded bottom, a horizontal resistance joining the two key swings, and a handle. In most cases, this pattern leads to a strong bullish breakout when the handle section concludes, In XRP’s case, the upper side of the cup is about $2.6752, while the lower side is about $2.26. This means that this cup has a depth of about 15%. By measuring the cup’s depth and extrapolating the figure from the upper side, Martinez estimates that the XRP stock price will jump to $3.35, much higher than the current $2.67. XRP Price Forecast Ripple Price Has Numerous Bullish Catalysts Fundamentally, XRP price has numerous bullish catalysts that may push it higher in the coming months. Odds of a spot Ripple ETF approval are rising, a move that JPMorgan estimates will lead to over $8 billion in inflows in the first year. Further, the XRP Ledger ecosystem is starting to boom , a move that may see it compete more with the likes of Solana and BNB Chain. Some of the top players of its ecosystem are XRP Army, Ripple USD, and Coreum. XRP price may benefit from the RLUSD stablecoin usage in the future. Recent data shows that the coin is gaining market share in the crypto industry. Its daily volume soaring to over $150 million. XRP Technical Analysis: Needs to Flip $3.3915 The daily chart shows that the value of XRP has lacked direction in the past few months. It has remained between the support level at $1.7292 and the resistance point at $3.3915. The coin has moved slightly below the 23.6% retracement level and the middle line of the Andrew’s pitchfork tool. Ripple is also showing signs of forming a head and shoulders chart pattern , a popular bearish sign. Therefore, a bullish breakout will be confirmed if the XRP coin jumps above the key resistance level at $3.3913. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to $5. XRP Price Chart However, a drop below this month’s low of $1.7292 will invalidate the bullish XRP price forecast as it will signal that there are more sellers left.

The ChowWow presale has recorded impressive market volume so far, while top meme coins like Popcat and Floki have faced downtrends. However, both Popcat and Floki are likely on the path toward bullish momentum as positive market dynamics set the tone for a possible extended bullish breakout. Possible Breakout on the Horizon for Popcat as Token Gets Listed on Coinbase Spot Investors may start gearing for a significant uptrend as the latest reports announce the listing of Popcat on the Coinbase Spot . Popcat went live on Coinbase on February 13th, 2025, prompting increased bullish momentum for the meme coin. However, before the news of the listing, Popcat’s price experienced something of a bloodbath, losing about 50% of its value within the past month. However, Popcat’s market trend has rebounded, as market stats show a significant growth in value within the past week. Meanwhile, the Popcat token will need to generate 82% in price value to match its all-time high of $2.07, which it reached on November 17th, 2024. Overall, investors are hopeful about the possibility of the Popcat crypto price retesting its all-time high soon. While the Popcat trading volume is booming, holders will be seeking more uptrends in the coming weeks. Bullish Signal Opens Up for Floki Amid Extended Bear Trend According to CoinMarketCap , the Floki token has also lost about 37% within the last month. However, the bloodbath might be ending, and the recent price trajectory of the token has started correcting with a 7% value growth over the last week. While the market volume of Floki is still negative in the monthly chart, the project is one of the top meme coins with multiple use cases. With its gaming metaverse, marketplace, and content platform, Floki harbours the features of a future top crypto asset. Floki market adoption may increase given the launch of the Floki Trading Bot , which is centred around transacting tokens directly from Telegram. The bot’s availability on the Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and Solana means more usage of the Floki token and increased value. However, only time will tell and recent movements have been unfavourable. ChowWow (CHOW) Set to Flip Top Meme Coins in Presale Thanks to its high-end use cases and engagement value, the ChowWow meme coin project is already on course to outshine many popular meme coins in the industry. As it stands, thousands of investors have already begun acquiring the ChowWow presale in view of riding the potential imminent bullish wave for exponential ROIs. While the ChowWow presale stage is projected to generate up to 260% in price value, the $CHOW token in its ecosystem will yield investors high-end profits. ChowWow aims to break into the top 200 crypto assets post-launch and within 2025. Its deflationary mechanism is on hand to aid value growth through token burns that increase scarcity and value. In the same way, ChowWow’s play-to-earn feature will reward players on the platform with gifts that can be converted to real-world value. There is also the stake-to-earn protocol, which is on hand to generate up to 15% APY for investors who stake the $CHOW token. That is why, at $0.008, investors can buy the presale, boost their portfolio and position for gains. About 50% of the total 888.77 million $CHOW supply is on sale in the presale, making now the best time to buy. As most experienced investors know, early investment in top-quality crypto assets like ChowWow is where the most profits are made. Best Crypto Investment Option in Q1 Given ChowWow’s early-stage entry advantage, low price point, engaging ecosystem, and high growth potential, the project’s surging trajectory is on course to outshine Popcat and Floki by percentage growth. ChowWow is the go-to crypto investment alternative for investors looking to ride the bullish wave of both presale and post-launch price rallies.

Recently, Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa offered a cautiously optimistic perspective, suggesting that the nation is on track for a “modest recovery.” But what does this mean for the Japanese Yen , global investors, and even the cryptocurrency market, which often mirrors traditional financial trends? Let’s dive into the details of Akazawa’s statement and explore the potential implications. Is Japan Really on the Path to Economic Recovery? According to Minister Akazawa, the outlook is for a “modest recovery.” This isn’t a boom, but rather a steady climb. He highlighted key factors influencing this trajectory, both positive and negative. Here’s a breakdown of the key points: Positive Outlook: Akazawa expects the economic recovery to continue. This provides a sense of stability and potential growth in the near future. Global Risks: He cautioned about “overseas economic downside risks,” specifically mentioning China and the impact of US policy. These global factors can significantly influence Japan’s economy, particularly in terms of trade and investment flows. Domestic Challenges: Inflation concerns are also on the radar. Rising prices for food and daily necessities could dampen consumer sentiment, which in turn might slow down consumption – a critical component of economic growth. Government Response: Akazawa assured that the government is ready to implement “thorough measures to counter rising prices.” This proactive stance could be crucial in mitigating the negative impacts of inflation. Essentially, Japan is navigating a complex economic landscape, balancing domestic aspirations for growth with external pressures and internal challenges related to rising costs. The focus is on a gradual, sustainable improvement rather than a rapid surge. How Does Global Policy Impact Japan’s Economic Recovery and the Yen? Akazawa specifically pointed to the “impact of US policy” as a key overseas risk. Why is this so significant? The interconnectedness of global economies means that policies enacted in major economies like the United States have ripple effects worldwide. For Japan, this is particularly relevant due to trade relationships and currency dynamics. US monetary policy, for example, directly affects the USD/JPY exchange rate, a crucial factor for Japanese businesses and investors. Furthermore, economic slowdowns in major trading partners like China can reduce demand for Japanese exports, impacting Japan’s growth prospects. Therefore, monitoring global economic trends and policy shifts in key nations is vital for understanding the trajectory of Japan’s economic recovery . The Japanese Yen: A Safe Haven in Uncertain Times? The Japanese Yen (JPY) is often considered a safe-haven currency. This means that during times of global economic uncertainty or market stress, investors tend to flock to the Yen as a perceived stable store of value. Let’s explore the factors that influence the Yen and its safe-haven status: Key Factors Driving the Japanese Yen: Bank of Japan (BOJ) Policy: The BOJ policy is paramount. Historically, the BOJ’s ultra-loose monetary policy weakened the Yen. However, recent shifts towards unwinding this policy have provided some support. Any future changes in BOJ policy will significantly impact the Yen’s value. US-Japan Bond Yield Differentials: The difference in bond yields between the US and Japan plays a crucial role. A wider differential favoring the US Dollar typically weakens the Yen. However, as other central banks consider rate cuts and the BOJ adjusts its stance, this differential is narrowing, potentially supporting the Yen. Risk Sentiment: During periods of global market turmoil, the Yen tends to strengthen as investors seek safety. Conversely, in times of optimism and risk-on sentiment, the Yen may weaken as investors pursue higher-yielding assets. USD/JPY Reaction: A Glimpse into Market Sentiment The immediate market reaction to Akazawa’s comments saw the USD/JPY pair decline by 0.36% to 151.77. This suggests a slight strengthening of the Yen, possibly reflecting a cautious optimism about Japan’s economic outlook or a broader risk-off sentiment in the market at that time. Currency movements are complex and influenced by numerous factors, but this initial reaction provides a snapshot of market interpretation. Inflation Concerns: Will Rising Prices Derail the Recovery? Akazawa’s mention of inflation concerns is crucial. While moderate inflation can be a sign of a healthy economy, rapidly rising prices, especially for essential goods, can erode consumer purchasing power and stifle economic growth. If consumers feel the pinch of higher living costs, they may reduce spending, impacting businesses and the overall economic recovery . The government’s commitment to “thorough measures to counter rising prices” is therefore vital. These measures could include fiscal policies, subsidies, or interventions aimed at stabilizing prices. The effectiveness of these measures will be a key determinant in whether inflation concerns become a major hurdle or are effectively managed to support sustainable growth. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Enthusiasts? While this news directly concerns the Japanese economy and the Forex market, cryptocurrency enthusiasts should also pay attention. Here’s why: Global Economic Interconnectedness: The health of major economies like Japan influences global market sentiment. A stable and recovering Japanese economy can contribute to a more positive global economic outlook, which can indirectly impact cryptocurrency markets. Safe-Haven Assets: Just as the Yen is considered a safe-haven in traditional finance, certain cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as digital safe havens. Understanding the dynamics of traditional safe havens like the Yen can offer insights into investor behavior and potential shifts towards or away from risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. USD/JPY and Crypto Trading: The USD/JPY pair is a major Forex pair. Fluctuations in this pair can reflect broader market trends and risk appetite, which can sometimes correlate with movements in cryptocurrency markets. Monitoring traditional Forex markets can provide a broader context for understanding crypto market dynamics. Conclusion: Cautious Optimism for Japan’s Economic Future Japan’s Economy Minister Akazawa’s outlook paints a picture of cautious optimism. The expectation of a “modest recovery” is tempered by awareness of global risks and domestic inflation concerns . The Japanese Yen remains a key indicator of market sentiment and a safe-haven asset in times of uncertainty. For those watching the global economic landscape, including cryptocurrency enthusiasts, Japan’s economic journey will continue to be a significant narrative to follow.

Today, we delve into a significant update from the East – the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has announced its latest daily fixing of the USD/CNY reference rate . This seemingly minor adjustment carries weight, influencing not just the Yuan’s trading band but also signaling broader economic policy directions. Let’s break down what this means for you, the crypto-savvy investor, and the wider financial landscape. Unpacking the PBOC’s USD/CNY Reference Rate Adjustment On Monday, February 17, 2025, the PBOC set the USD/CNY reference rate at 7.1702. This is a slight adjustment from the previous fixing of 7.1706 on Friday. While the change might appear minimal at first glance, these daily fixings are crucial tools employed by the PBOC to manage the Yuan’s exchange rate against the US dollar. For context, Reuters’ estimates placed the expected rate much higher at 7.2617, highlighting the PBOC’s firm hand in guiding the currency. This daily rate acts as the central point around which the Yuan can fluctuate in onshore trading, effectively managing volatility and signaling the central bank’s intentions for currency stability. What is the Role of the PBOC and Why Does the Reference Rate Matter? Understanding the significance of the USD/CNY reference rate requires insight into the PBOC’s functions. Think of the PBOC as China’s equivalent of the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank. However, its operational framework and objectives are uniquely tailored to China’s economic structure. Key Objectives of the People’s Bank of China: Price Stability: This is a core mandate, encompassing both domestic price levels and, crucially, exchange rate stability . Maintaining a stable Yuan is vital for China’s trade-oriented economy. Economic Growth: The PBOC plays a role in fostering sustainable economic expansion through its monetary policies. Financial Reform and Development: The PBOC is tasked with modernizing China’s financial system, including opening up markets and promoting healthy financial sector growth. Unlike many Western central banks that prioritize autonomy, the PBOC operates under a different structure. PBOC Ownership and Governance: State-Owned: The PBOC is owned by the state of the People’s Republic of China. This means it is not an independent institution in the same way as, for example, the US Federal Reserve. Communist Party Influence: The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exerts significant influence on the PBOC’s direction. The CCP Committee Secretary, nominated by the State Council Chairman, holds a key position, even alongside the Governor. Currently, Mr. Pan Gongsheng holds both roles, indicating a consolidation of leadership. Decoding the PBOC’s Monetary Policy Toolkit The PBOC employs a diverse set of monetary policy instruments, some of which differ from those typically used by Western central banks. These tools are instrumental in achieving its objectives, including influencing the USD/CNY reference rate indirectly and maintaining exchange rate stability . Primary Policy Tools of the PBOC: Seven-day Reverse Repo Rate (RRR): This is a short-term liquidity management tool. Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF): Provides medium-term funding to banks. Foreign Exchange Interventions: Direct buying or selling of foreign currency to influence the Yuan’s value. Setting the daily USD/CNY reference rate is a key aspect of this intervention. Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR): The percentage of deposits banks must hold as reserves, impacting lending capacity. The Loan Prime Rate (LPR): China’s Benchmark Interest Rate It’s important to note the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) in the context of Chinese monetary policy. The LPR serves as China’s benchmark interest rate, akin to the Fed Funds rate in the US or the policy rates in other major economies. Changes to the LPR directly affect borrowing costs for businesses and individuals, influencing loan and mortgage rates, as well as savings interest. Critically, by adjusting the LPR, the PBOC can also indirectly influence exchange rates , including the USD/CNY reference rate , by impacting capital flows and market sentiment. Private Banks in China: A Growing Sector While China’s financial system is traditionally state-dominated, the landscape is evolving. The presence of private banks, though still a small segment, indicates a gradual shift. As of now, China has 19 private banks. Key Points about Private Banks in China: Emerging Sector: Private banks are a relatively recent development, with the first licenses granted in 2014. Digital Focus: Leading private banks like WeBank (backed by Tencent) and MYbank (backed by Ant Group) are digital lenders, leveraging technology to reach a broader customer base. Limited Scale: Despite their growth, private banks still represent a small fraction of the overall financial system compared to state-owned giants. Why This Matters for Forex and Crypto Traders For those involved in Forex trading, particularly in Asian currency pairs, and for cryptocurrency enthusiasts who monitor global economic trends, the PBOC’s USD/CNY reference rate is a vital indicator. It reflects China’s monetary policy stance and its approach to managing its currency. A stable or appreciating Yuan can have ripple effects across Asian markets and potentially influence global risk sentiment, which in turn can impact cryptocurrency valuations. While the direct link between the USD/CNY reference rate and crypto prices is not always immediate or obvious, understanding these macroeconomic factors provides a crucial layer of context for informed trading and investment decisions. Monitoring these announcements allows traders to anticipate potential shifts in market dynamics and adjust their strategies accordingly. In Conclusion: Staying Informed in a Global Market The PBOC’s daily setting of the USD/CNY reference rate is more than just a technical adjustment; it’s a pulse on the world’s second-largest economy and its approach to currency management. By keeping abreast of these developments, traders and investors gain a deeper understanding of the forces shaping global financial markets.

Despite recent market volatility, DOGE has maintained key support levels, fueling optimism among traders. While the other tokes struggle to recover, bullish sentiment around Dogecoin price persists, with investors closely watching resistance levels for confirmation of an uptrend. Massive Dogecoin Price Hints $10 Target Crypto Trader has suggested that the Dogecoin price may still have room for upward movement before reaching its peak. According to a recent post on X , the analyst highlighted a key Relative Strength Index (RSI) retracement on the two-week chart, indicating that Dogecoin has not yet triggered a topping-out signal. The historical pattern suggests that a market top tends to follow when the RSI reaches a specific overbought level. However, the latest analysis implies that Dogecoin has not yet hit that threshold, leaving further gains possible. The analyst compares previous market cycles, showing that Dogecoin experienced substantial rallies before the RSI signaled a peak. The pattern appears to be repeating, with the RSI currently retracing but not yet reaching the extreme levels observed in prior topping signals. If history follows a similar trajectory, Dogecoin could continue its bullish momentum to $10 before encountering a significant correction. Will Dogecoin Recover? Dogecoin price has entered a strong bearish cycle, dropping from its December peak of $0.4845 to a low of $0.265. Despite this downturn, analysts suggest potential catalysts could drive a future rebound. A BTC nears $100k may trigger renewed momentum across altcoins, including DOGE. Additionally, speculation is growing over the possibility of a spot Dogecoin ETF gaining regulatory approval. This, combined with increased whale accumulation and rising meme coin enthusiasm, could fuel a strong recovery. Market sentiment suggests these factors may help Dogecoin regain strength, though broader crypto trends will determine its trajectory in the coming months. Short Term DOGE Technical Analysis As of February 17, the DOGE value is $0.265, reflecting a 0.73% increase over the past 24-hours. The meme coin is showing resilience, holding above the key support level of $0.25 despite market fluctuations. The MACD histogram is trending downward, indicating that bearish momentum remains. The MACD line remains slightly below the signal line, a potential warning of further consolidation before a breakout. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart stands at 47, hovering near the neutral zone. The primary support zone is at $0.25, which has held firm against selling pressure. A break below this level could lead to a retest of $0.20. If this resistance breaks, The Dogecoin price prediction could aim for $0.35 and eventually $0.40. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView Market optimism together with strong technical indicators could drive the Dogecoin price to reach $10 until a top signal appears. Several analysis specialists observe optimistic market signals which indicate Dogecoin may experience additional gains before experiencing a price drop.

While many projects focus on speculation, this one brings real-world utility and a structured growth plan. Investors are taking notice as demand for its presale tokens surges, making it one of the most promising opportunities in February. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) This project is gaining momentum as a decentralized lending and borrowing platform, giving users direct access to financial services without intermediaries. Built on smart contracts, it ensures secure and transparent transactions while offering opportunities to earn passive income. By allowing users to supply assets and borrow funds with flexible terms, the platform provides a trustless and efficient alternative to traditional lending models. Its two lending models—Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C)—give users full control. P2P lending allows direct agreements between borrowers and lenders, while P2C lending lets users deposit assets into liquidity pools to earn interest automatically. These features make it an attractive option for those looking for long-term gains. Currently priced at $0.01, the token is in its first presale phase, with 11 total stages leading to a launch price of $0.06. Early investors are positioning themselves for massive gains, with analysts projecting a 1700% increase as demand and adoption grow. For example, an investor who buys $1,500 worth of tokens now at $0.01 will hold 150,000 tokens. When the token reaches $0.17 post-launch, this investment would be worth $25,500, demonstrating the project’s high-growth potential. The team is preparing to launch a beta version of the platform, allowing users to experience its decentralized lending and borrowing features firsthand. With such strong utilities, MUTM is expected to be listed on popular exchanges, further increasing its visibility and attracting more investors. These developments will drive demand and push the token’s price higher by launch. The platform also introduces mtTokens, which represent deposits in the liquidity pools. These tokens accrue interest over time and can be redeemed along with earned rewards. For instance, mtETH, mtDAI, and mtUSDT allow lenders to supply assets and receive a growing balance, ensuring steady returns without the need to sell their holdings. Each mtToken maintains a 1:1 ratio with the deposited asset, increasing in value as interest accumulates. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens, allocations are structured to support long-term growth. A significant portion is designated for presale, liquidity, ecosystem expansion, and mining incentives. This ensures the token remains sustainable and in high demand, benefiting long-term holders. Additionally, the buy-and-distribute mechanism reinvests part of the platform’s revenue into purchasing tokens from the market. These tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders, creating consistent buy pressure and driving price appreciation over time. To reward early supporters, the team is hosting a $100,000 token giveaway, where 10 lucky winners will receive $10,000 each. This initiative aims to boost community engagement and provide investors with additional opportunities to gain exposure before the token launches on exchanges. With a fast-selling presale, strong DeFi utilities, and expert-backed growth potential, this project is shaping up as February’s top investment opportunity. As demand increases and key milestones are reached, early investors will see 1700% returns, making it one of the most exciting prospects in the crypto market today.

Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley says that a bank – who is yet to be named – essentially turned off their bank account for unexplained reasons after two years of working with the lender, reports CNBC . “Our story is pretty ridiculous… We had a bank that we had a growing relationship with for a number of years, who basically on a dime, decided to turn off our bank account.” McCauley didn’t mention the name of the bank and a spokesperson for Anchorage declined to provide any other details with CNBC. The CEO says the bank cut them off in June of 2023, around the same time that numerous reports of “Choke Point 2.0” – or a coordinated effort by the government to shut down the crypto industry – were running rampant. Says McCauley, “You can only imagine what was happening to the smaller entrepreneurs who didn’t have the resources to be able to marshal in order to keep their bank accounts open.” Last month, US Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) said she wants the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to secure materials that could be related to the government’s alleged efforts to de-bank crypto firms. In a letter to FDIC chair Marty Gruenberg, Lummis said whistleblowers claim that the deposit insurer is destroying materials linked to its digital asset activities. The senator said the FDIC’s alleged efforts to destroy and conceal materials related to Operation Choke Point 2.0 are unacceptable and illegal. “If it is uncovered that anyone within the FDIC has knowingly destroyed materials or sought to obstruct the oversight functions of the Senate, it will result in swift criminal referrals to the U.S. Department of Justice.

As we navigate the complexities of global economics, all eyes are on the upcoming Indian Trade Balance data and potential shifts in US tariff policies. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and seasoned traders, understanding these macroeconomic factors is crucial, as they can indirectly influence broader market sentiment and investment strategies. Let’s dive into the key drivers shaping the USD/INR landscape and what to expect in the near term. USD/INR Gathers Momentum Amid Global Cues The Indian Rupee (INR) is currently navigating a mixed bag of economic signals. While it showed initial weakness in Monday’s early trading sessions, snapping a brief two-day winning streak, it’s important to understand the underlying factors at play. Several elements are contributing to the Rupee’s current stance: Economic Slowdown: Concerns about a slowdown in the Indian economy continue to weigh on the INR. Foreign Outflows: Persistent selling by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) exerts downward pressure on the Rupee. RBI Rate Cuts: The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) accommodative monetary policy, including rate cuts, can also soften the Rupee. However, it’s not all bearish for the INR. Counteracting forces are also in motion: RBI Intervention: Strategic interventions by the RBI, through selling USD, aim to stabilize the Rupee and prevent excessive depreciation. Lower Crude Oil Prices: The decline in crude oil prices offers a cushion for the INR, given India’s status as a major oil consumer. The interplay of these factors is creating a dynamic environment for the USD/INR pair, making it essential to monitor upcoming economic releases and policy announcements. Indian Rupee Forex Under Pressure: Decoding the Trade Balance Later today, the release of the Indian Trade Balance data will be a pivotal moment. But what exactly is the trade balance, and why does it matter for the Indian Rupee Forex market? The Trade Balance represents the difference between a country’s exports and imports. A surplus (exports > imports) generally strengthens a currency, while a deficit (imports > exports) can weaken it. India, like many developing economies, often runs a trade deficit. Here’s why the Indian Trade Balance is significant for the Rupee: Economic Health Indicator: It reflects the competitiveness of India’s exports and the strength of domestic demand. Currency Demand: A larger deficit might increase demand for foreign currency (like USD) to pay for imports, potentially weakening the INR. Investor Sentiment: Trade balance figures can influence investor perception of India’s economic stability and future growth prospects. Traders are keenly awaiting this data to gauge the direction of the Rupee. Market expectations and the actual figures will dictate the immediate reaction in the USD/INR pair. RBI Monetary Policy and Rupee Dynamics: What’s the Connection? The RBI Monetary Policy plays a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of the Indian Rupee. Understanding the RBI’s mandate and tools is key to predicting INR movements. Let’s break down the essentials: What is the RBI’s Role? As India’s central bank, the RBI is tasked with: Price Stability: Maintaining inflation at a target level (around 4%) to ensure stable prices. Economic Growth: Supporting economic growth while keeping inflation in check. Exchange Rate Stability: Managing the exchange rate to avoid excessive volatility that could harm exporters and importers. How RBI Decisions Impact the Rupee? The RBI uses various tools, primarily interest rates, to achieve its objectives: Interest Rate Adjustments: Raising Rates: To combat high inflation, the RBI may raise interest rates. Higher rates can attract foreign investment, increasing demand for INR and potentially strengthening it. Cutting Rates: To stimulate economic growth when inflation is low, the RBI might cut rates. Lower rates can reduce the attractiveness of INR for foreign investors, potentially weakening it. FX Market Intervention: The RBI directly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to manage Rupee volatility. This involves buying or selling Rupees to influence the exchange rate. The RBI’s actions and policy announcements are closely watched by market participants for cues on future INR direction. The current context of economic slowdown and inflation management makes the RBI’s role even more critical. US Tariffs Impact on USD/INR and Global Trade The global trade landscape is significantly influenced by US Tariffs Impact and policies. Recent developments and statements regarding tariffs are adding another layer of complexity to the USD/INR dynamics. Trump’s Tariff Talk and India: Former US President Trump’s remarks about potential tariff easing with India, coupled with discussions about increased US oil and gas imports by India, are noteworthy. These discussions aim to address the trade deficit between the two nations. Potential Implications: Trade Relations: Easing tariffs could improve trade relations and potentially boost economic activity between the US and India. USD/INR Impact: Positive trade developments could indirectly support the INR by improving overall economic sentiment and potentially increasing foreign investment. Global Trade Flows: Changes in US tariff policies have broader implications for global trade flows and currency valuations. However, uncertainties remain regarding the actual implementation and extent of these tariff adjustments. Market participants are awaiting further clarity on US trade policy, which will continue to influence currency markets, including USD/INR. Technical Outlook for USD/INR: Key Levels to Watch From a technical analysis perspective, the USD/INR pair maintains a bullish outlook. Here are the key technical levels to monitor: Bullish Momentum: The price consistently trading above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) signals underlying bullish strength. Consolidation Phase: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering around the midline suggests a potential consolidation phase before the next major move. Resistance Levels: Immediate Resistance: 87.00 psychological level. Next Targets: All-time high near 88.00, followed by 88.50 if bullish momentum persists. Support Levels: Initial Support: 86.35 (February 12 low). Further Support: 86.14 (January 27 low). Traders should watch for breakouts above resistance or breakdowns below support levels to anticipate potential directional moves in the USD/INR pair. Technical indicators, combined with fundamental analysis, offer a comprehensive view for informed trading decisions. In Conclusion: Navigating the USD/INR Landscape The USD/INR currency pair is currently influenced by a complex interplay of domestic and global factors. While the Indian Rupee faces headwinds from economic slowdown, FII outflows, and RBI rate cuts, it also finds support from RBI interventions and lower oil prices. The upcoming Indian Trade Balance data and developments in US tariff policies are critical events to watch. For traders, staying informed about these macroeconomic trends, understanding RBI’s monetary policy, and monitoring key technical levels are essential for navigating the USD/INR market effectively. The dynamic nature of this currency pair offers both challenges and opportunities in the ever-evolving world of forex trading.

The event, which begins on February 17 and runs until March 14, aims to accelerate innovation across multiple blockchain verticals, including gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and artificial intelligence (AI). Hackathon Tracks and Judging Criteria According to a press statement shared with CryptoPotato, the hackathon will feature four distinct tracks: Attention Capital Market, DeFi, AI, and Gaming. Participants in the event will be tasked with creating apps that address specific needs within these categories. This will include content tokenization for social media platforms, yield-generating tools, AI agent aggregators, and high-revenue gaming experiences. Additionally, a panel of industry experts will evaluate submissions on the basis of their innovation, technical depth, and viability in the real world. The judges will also offer constructive feedback to help the participating teams refine their projects, ensuring they all gain valuable feedback from the experience. The experts are expected to share updates on social media, promoting standout entries in the hackathon to highlight the potential of Sonic’s ecosystem. Once the competition runs its course, they will assess final submissions and announce winners on April 2, with the $1 million prize pool distributed across the top projects. Sonic hopes the initiative will help accelerate the growth of its ecosystem, while demonstrating its ability to improve Solana’s scalability via a specialized high-performance layer. Sonic’s Framework and Recent Milestones The platform is built on HyperGrid, a horizontal scaling framework for orchestrating Solana rollups. It enables games to launch their own blockchain layers, which lets developers create highly customizable game economies. Last year, Sonic celebrated the success of its incentivized testnet called “Odyssey,” which saw more than 100,000 wallets connected to it and 17 million transactions performed on it. The launch of the hackathon comes on the back of reports that apps on Solana had generated 10 times more revenue than their Ethereum counterparts. Over a 24 hour period in mid-February, Solana apps raked in up to $8.4 million, dwarfing Ethereum’s $875,000. The trend was also witnessed in the network’s trading volume, where Solana recorded activity worth $5.39 billion compared to its bigger rival’s $2.14 billion.

Just as Bitcoin and Ethereum react to market sentiment, traditional currencies like the Australian Dollar (AUD) are also influenced by global events and central bank decisions. Currently, the Australian Dollar is making waves, surging amidst a ‘risk-on’ mood. But a crucial Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decision looms – could this potential rate cut be a game-changer for the Aussie Dollar’s upward trajectory? Let’s dive into the factors driving the AUD and what to expect from the RBA. Decoding the Australian Dollar’s ‘Risk-On’ Surge The Australian Dollar (AUD) has shown remarkable strength recently, climbing against the US Dollar (USD) for three consecutive days. This upward momentum is largely fueled by a ‘risk-on’ sentiment sweeping through global markets. What exactly does ‘risk-on’ mean and why is it boosting the AUD? Trump Tariff Postponement: US President Trump’s decision to postpone reciprocal tariffs has calmed market anxieties. This reduces the immediate threat of trade wars, encouraging investors to move away from safe-haven assets like the USD and into riskier, growth-linked currencies such as the AUD. Weak US Retail Sales Data: Disappointing US retail sales figures have ignited speculation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) might delay interest rate cuts. This weakens the US Dollar, further bolstering the appeal of the Australian Dollar. US Treasury Yields Decline: Lower US Treasury yields are also contributing to USD weakness. As the Dollar loses ground, currencies like the AUD, which offer potentially higher yields (at least for now), become more attractive. Essentially, a cocktail of global factors is creating a perfect storm for the Australian Dollar to appreciate. But this bullish run might face a significant hurdle – the upcoming Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decision. The Looming RBA Decision: Will an Interest Rate Cut Pressure the AUD? While the ‘risk-on’ mood is currently propelling the Australian Dollar higher, the market is keenly anticipating the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)’s upcoming interest rate decision. The RBA is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut on Tuesday. Why is this significant, and how could an interest rate cut impact the AUD? The expectation is that the RBA will cut its Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points (bps) to 4.10%. This would be the first interest rate reduction in four years. Here’s a breakdown of why this potential rate cut is crucial: Dovish Sentiment Intact: Despite recent positive economic data, underlying dovish sentiment regarding inflation remains in Australia. Consumer inflation expectations have actually climbed, reaching their highest level since April 2024, signaling potential concerns for the RBA. Impact of Rate Cuts on Currency: Generally, when a central bank cuts interest rates, it can weaken the currency. Lower interest rates make a currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns. Therefore, an RBA interest rate cut could exert downward pressure on the Australian Dollar, potentially counteracting the current ‘risk-on’ momentum. Balancing Act for the RBA: The RBA faces a delicate balancing act. They need to manage inflation while also supporting economic growth. An interest rate cut could stimulate the economy but might also fuel inflation and weaken the AUD. US Economic Data and Fed Rate Cut Speculation: A Double-Edged Sword Recent US economic data is playing a significant role in the Australian Dollar’s current strength and the broader forex market outlook. Weaker-than-expected US Retail Sales figures, coupled with sticky inflation, have created a complex scenario for the Federal Reserve (Fed) and influenced market expectations for interest rate cuts. Here’s a closer look at the key US data points and their implications: Data Point Actual Expected Previous Impact US Retail Sales (January) -0.9% -0.1% 0.7% (Revised) Significantly weaker than expected, fuels Fed rate cut speculation. US Core PPI Inflation (January YoY) 3.6% 3.3% 3.7% (Revised) Higher than expected, but slightly below revised previous, mixed signals for Fed. US CPI Inflation (January YoY) 3.0% 2.9% 3.0% Slightly higher than expected, reinforces inflation concerns. US Core CPI Inflation (January YoY) 3.3% 3.1% 3.2% Higher than expected, reinforces inflation concerns. This mixed bag of US economic data has led to: Delayed Fed Rate Cut Expectations: Initially, many economists anticipated a March rate cut by the Fed. However, the persistent inflation and comments from Fed officials like Powell and Hammack suggest a more patient approach. The market is now leaning towards a rate cut later in the year, possibly in the second half. US Dollar Weakness: The uncertainty surrounding the timing of Fed rate cuts and the weaker retail sales data are weighing on the US Dollar. This USD weakness is providing a tailwind for the Australian Dollar and other currencies. However, this situation is dynamic. Stronger-than-expected US data in the future could quickly shift expectations and strengthen the USD, potentially reversing the AUD’s recent gains. Technical Outlook for AUD/USD: Ascending Channel in Play From a technical analysis perspective, the AUD/USD pair is currently navigating within an ascending channel pattern on the daily chart. This pattern typically suggests bullish momentum. Let’s examine the key technical levels: Current Price Action: The AUD/USD pair is hovering around 0.6360, moving upwards within the ascending channel. Bullish Bias: The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above 50, reinforcing the bullish bias. Potential Upside Targets: Upper boundary of the ascending channel: 0.6380 level Psychological level: 0.6400 Key Support Levels: 9-day EMA: 0.6310 level 14-day EMA: 0.6294 Lower boundary of the ascending channel: 0.6270 level A break above the ascending channel could signal further bullish momentum, while a break below key support levels could indicate a potential trend reversal. Traders should closely monitor these levels in conjunction with the RBA decision.

Percentage changes are indicative and may vary slightly in real-time markets. Frequently Asked Questions: Understanding the Australian Dollar What key factors drive the Australian Dollar? Several factors influence the Australian Dollar’s value. These include: RBA Interest Rate Decisions: Interest rate levels set by the Reserve Bank of Australia are a primary driver. Higher rates generally attract foreign investment, boosting the AUD. Iron Ore Prices: As a major exporter of iron ore, Australia’s economy and currency are sensitive to iron ore price fluctuations. Higher prices are typically AUD-positive. Chinese Economic Health: China is Australia’s largest trading partner. The strength of the Chinese economy directly impacts demand for Australian exports and, consequently, the AUD. Australian Economic Fundamentals: Inflation, GDP growth, and the trade balance in Australia all play a role in the AUD’s valuation. Market Sentiment: Global risk appetite significantly affects the AUD. In ‘risk-on’ environments, the AUD tends to perform well, while in ‘risk-off’ scenarios, it may weaken. How do the decisions of the Reserve Bank of Australia impact the Australian Dollar? The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) wields considerable influence over the Australian Dollar through its monetary policy decisions. By adjusting the Official Cash Rate, the RBA impacts borrowing costs and overall economic activity. Here’s how RBA decisions translate to AUD movements: Interest Rate Adjustments: Raising interest rates can strengthen the AUD by making Australian assets more attractive to international investors. Conversely, cutting rates can weaken the AUD. Quantitative Easing (QE) and Tightening: QE (bond-buying) is generally AUD-negative as it increases money supply, while quantitative tightening (reducing bond holdings) is AUD-positive. Forward Guidance: The RBA’s communication about future policy intentions, known as forward guidance, can also influence the AUD. Dovish signals (indicating potential rate cuts) can weaken the AUD, while hawkish signals (suggesting rate hikes) can strengthen it. How does the health of the Chinese Economy impact the Australian Dollar? The Chinese economy’s performance is inextricably linked to the Australian Dollar. China’s massive demand for Australian resources makes it a critical trading partner. Here’s the connection: Demand for Australian Exports: A robust Chinese economy increases demand for Australian raw materials like iron ore, coal, and natural gas. This increased demand boosts Australian export revenue and strengthens the AUD. Trade Surplus: Strong Chinese demand contributes to Australia’s trade surplus, which is generally positive for the AUD. Economic Data Impact: Positive Chinese economic data releases often lead to AUD appreciation, while negative data can trigger AUD depreciation. How does the price of Iron Ore impact the Australian Dollar? Iron ore is Australia’s single largest export commodity, making its price a significant determinant of the Australian Dollar’s value. The relationship is quite direct: Export Revenue: Higher iron ore prices directly increase Australia’s export revenue, leading to a stronger trade balance and greater demand for the AUD. Terms of Trade: Rising iron ore prices improve Australia’s terms of trade (the ratio of export prices to import prices), which is AUD-positive. Mining Investment: High iron ore prices can spur investment in Australian mining, further boosting economic activity and supporting the AUD. How does the Trade Balance impact the Australian Dollar? A country’s trade balance, the difference between exports and imports, is a fundamental factor influencing its currency value. For the Australian Dollar: Trade Surplus = AUD Strength: A positive trade balance (exports exceeding imports) indicates strong demand for Australian goods and services. This demand increases the need for AUD to purchase these exports, driving up its value. Trade Deficit = AUD Weakness: Conversely, a trade deficit (imports exceeding exports) can weaken the AUD as it implies less demand for the currency from foreign buyers. Investor Confidence: A consistently positive trade balance can boost investor confidence in the Australian economy, further supporting the AUD. Conclusion: Navigating the Australian Dollar’s Crucial Week The Australian Dollar is currently riding a wave of ‘risk-on’ sentiment, bolstered by global factors and a weaker US Dollar. However, the upcoming Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) interest rate decision poses a significant challenge to this upward momentum. While technical indicators suggest continued bullish potential in the short term, the fundamental impact of a potential RBA rate cut cannot be ignored. Traders should closely monitor the RBA announcement and subsequent market reactions to gauge the Australian Dollar’s true trajectory. This week promises to be pivotal for the AUD, demanding careful analysis and strategic decision-making in the forex markets.

CoinShares highlighted this data in its latest weekly report on crypto investments, particularly the ETF market. The latest figure marks the end of an unprecedented streak of inflows that saw $29.4 billion poured into the sector following the U.S. election.Notably, the 19-week record of $29.4 billion post-November election surpassed the $16 billion recorded in the first 19 weeks following the launch of U.S. spot ETFs in January 2024. However, the inflow streak ultimately came to an end last week.According to CoinShares, the sudden reversal followed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish tone during a Congressional meeting and higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data. Notably, these events spooked investors. The U.S. market bore the brunt of the withdrawals, with $464 million in outflows. Meanwhile, other regions remained resilient with positive flows.

Currently, the EUR/GBP pair is navigating a complex environment, hovering around the 0.8350 mark, primarily influenced by the European Central Bank’s (ECB) dovish stance on interest rates. Dovish ECB Sentiment Weighs on EUR/GBP The Euro is currently experiencing downward pressure as several ECB officials have indicated their comfort with the prospect of three more interest rate cuts in 2025. This follows the ECB’s recent decision to reduce its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.75% last month. This dovish mood surrounding the ECB is a primary factor keeping the EUR/GBP exchange rate subdued. Here’s a breakdown of why the ECB’s stance is impacting the Euro: Anticipated Rate Cuts: The expectation of further interest rate cuts makes the Euro less attractive to investors seeking yield. Lower interest rates typically reduce the attractiveness of a currency. Economic Outlook: The ECB’s dovish tone may reflect concerns about the Eurozone’s economic growth, signaling potential headwinds for the region. Inflation Targets: While aiming for price stability, the ECB’s current approach suggests a priority to stimulate economic activity, even if it means tolerating slightly higher inflation in the short term. Ukraine Ceasefire Talks: A Potential Catalyst for Euro Recovery? Despite the prevailing downward pressure, the Euro could find a silver lining in geopolitical developments. A potential ceasefire in Ukraine could act as a significant tailwind for the Euro. Reports suggest that negotiations between US and Russian officials are on the horizon, aiming to de-escalate the conflict. How could a Ukraine ceasefire boost the Euro? Gas Supply Resumption: A ceasefire could pave the way for the resumption of gas supplies from Russia to Europe, easing energy security concerns and potentially lowering energy prices. Reduced Economic Uncertainty: The Ukraine conflict has been a major source of economic uncertainty for Europe. De-escalation could reduce this uncertainty, boosting investor confidence in the Eurozone economy. Improved Investor Sentiment: Peace talks could improve overall market sentiment towards the Euro, leading to increased demand and a potential appreciation against currencies like the British Pound. UK Economic Data in Focus: Will Strong Figures Support the GBP? On the other side of the EUR/GBP pair, the British Pound is drawing strength from recent positive UK economic data. The UK economy showcased robust growth in Q4 2024, expanding by 1.4% year-on-year, surpassing market expectations. This positive momentum has provided support for the Pound. Key highlights of the recent UK economic performance: Indicator Q4 2024 Growth Previous Quarter (Revised) Market Expectation GDP Growth (Year-on-Year) 1.4% 1.0% 1.1% Full Year 2024 GDP Growth 0.9% 0.4% (2023) N/A Looking ahead, traders are keenly anticipating the upcoming UK labor market and Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data releases this week. These figures will be crucial in shaping market expectations regarding the Bank of England’s (BoE) future monetary policy decisions. The BoE recently reduced its key borrowing rate to 4.5% at its February meeting, and further data will dictate their next move on interest rates. Interest Rates and Currency Dynamics: A Quick Recap Understanding the interplay between interest rates and currencies is crucial for navigating the forex market. Here’s a simplified overview: Interest Rates Defined: Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money, set by central banks to manage inflation and stimulate economic growth. Impact on Currencies: Higher interest rates tend to attract foreign investment, strengthening a country’s currency. Conversely, lower rates can weaken a currency. Gold and Interest Rates: Higher interest rates can negatively impact gold prices as they increase the opportunity cost of holding gold compared to interest-bearing assets. Navigating the EUR/GBP Landscape For cryptocurrency enthusiasts venturing into forex or understanding macroeconomic influences, the EUR/GBP pair presents a dynamic scenario. The pair’s movement is currently dictated by the dovish ECB, counterbalanced by potentially positive UK economic data and the wildcard of Ukraine ceasefire negotiations. Traders should closely monitor these factors to anticipate potential shifts in the EUR/GBP exchange rate. Actionable Insights for Traders: Monitor ECB Statements: Pay close attention to speeches and announcements from ECB officials for further clues on future interest rate decisions. Track UK Economic Data: The upcoming UK labor market and CPI data releases are critical. Strong figures could further bolster the Pound. Geopolitical Developments: Stay informed on the progress of Ukraine ceasefire talks as they could inject volatility and opportunity into the EUR/GBP pair. Conclusion: EUR/GBP at a Crossroads The EUR/GBP pair is currently subdued, caught between the dovish signals from the ECB and the potential for positive catalysts from UK economic data and geopolitical events. The interplay of these factors makes the EUR/GBP a pair to watch closely in the coming days. Whether the dovish ECB pressure will persist or if positive developments will provide support for the Euro remains to be seen, creating potential trading opportunities for astute observers of the forex market.

40457401,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129523,1739806861,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Soaring Gold Price: Safe-Haven Demand Ignites Rally Above $2,900 Amid USD Weakness",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gold-price-usd-weakness-rally/,"Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts! While the digital asset space keeps evolving, traditional safe-haven assets like gold are making headlines too. Today, we’re diving into the fascinating surge of the gold price , which has impressively climbed above $2,900. What’s fueling this rally, and how does it connect to the broader financial landscape? Let’s unpack the key factors driving gold’s upward trajectory in today’s market. Why is the Gold Price Climbing Amidst USD Weakness? The primary driver behind gold’s recent gains is the persistent USD weakness . The US Dollar has been under pressure, and this has historically been beneficial for gold. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements contributing to this scenario: Trump’s Tariff Concerns: Former President Trump’s policies, particularly his talk of imposing reciprocal tariffs, are injecting uncertainty into global trade. These concerns act as a significant tailwind for gold, a traditional safe-haven. Delayed Tariffs & Trade War Fears: The delay in implementing Trump’s tariffs, rather than calming markets, is actually amplifying worries about a potential global trade war. Investors are seeking refuge in safe assets like gold as a result. Disappointing US Retail Sales: Recent US Retail Sales data was worse than expected, signaling potential economic slowdown. This further weakens the USD and strengthens the appeal of gold. Fed Rate Cut Expectations: The weak retail sales data has led markets to price in a potential Federal Reserve rate cut sooner than anticipated, adding more pressure on the US Dollar and boosting the gold price . Essentially, the confluence of trade tensions, economic data, and monetary policy expectations is creating a perfect storm for USD weakness , and in turn, a powerful surge for gold. Safe-Haven Demand: Is Gold the Ultimate Shelter in a Storm? In times of economic uncertainty or geopolitical turmoil, safe-haven demand for gold typically increases. Why is this the case, and what makes gold such a reliable safe haven? Store of Value: Gold has been recognized as a store of value for centuries. Unlike fiat currencies, its value is not tied to any single government or economy. Inflation Hedge: Historically, gold has acted as an effective hedge against inflation. When inflation rises, the purchasing power of fiat currencies erodes, but gold tends to maintain or increase its value. Tangible Asset: Gold is a physical, tangible asset, unlike digital currencies or stocks. This physicality provides a sense of security and stability, especially during market volatility. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Events like the war in Ukraine and global trade tensions heighten geopolitical risks, driving investors towards the safety of gold. The ongoing conflict and the potential for escalating trade disputes are bolstering safe-haven demand . Therefore, the current global landscape, characterized by both economic and geopolitical uncertainties, is significantly amplifying the safe-haven demand for gold, pushing its price higher. Trump Tariffs: How Do Trade Policies Impact Gold? Trump tariffs are playing a significant role in the current gold market dynamics. But how exactly do these trade policies influence the gold price ? Trade War Fears: Trump’s protectionist trade policies, particularly the threat of tariffs, raise concerns about global trade wars. These fears create economic uncertainty and drive investors towards safe assets like gold. USD Weakness: Tariffs can sometimes lead to a weaker domestic currency. If tariffs are seen as detrimental to the US economy, they can contribute to USD weakness , which, as we’ve discussed, is positive for gold. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs can increase the cost of imported goods, potentially leading to inflationary pressures. As gold is considered an inflation hedge, this scenario can further boost its appeal. Market Volatility: The uncertainty surrounding trade policies and potential retaliatory tariffs can increase overall market volatility. In volatile markets, investors often seek refuge in gold, increasing safe-haven demand . In essence, the specter of Trump tariffs and their potential ramifications on global trade and the US economy are acting as a bullish catalyst for gold, contributing to its price surge. Inflation Fears: Is Gold a Reliable Inflation Hedge Today? With inflation fears lingering in the global economy, many investors are turning to gold as a traditional inflation hedge. But is gold still effective in protecting against inflation in today’s financial environment? Historical Performance: Historically, gold has often performed well during periods of high inflation. It has served as a store of value when fiat currencies lose purchasing power due to rising prices. Real Asset Value: Gold is a real asset, meaning its value is not solely based on financial contracts. In inflationary environments where the value of paper money erodes, real assets like gold can hold their value or even appreciate. Limited Supply: The limited supply of gold can also contribute to its effectiveness as an inflation hedge. As inflation rises and fiat currency supply increases, the relatively fixed supply of gold can make it more attractive. Investor Sentiment: During times of inflation fears , investor sentiment towards gold tends to become more bullish. This increased demand further supports gold prices. While the relationship between gold and inflation can be complex and influenced by various factors, the current environment of elevated inflation fears is undoubtedly contributing to gold’s attractiveness and its recent price appreciation. Navigating the Gold Market: Key Takeaways for Investors The current market conditions present both opportunities and risks for investors interested in gold. Here are some key takeaways: Monitor USD Movements: Keep a close eye on the US Dollar. Further USD weakness could provide continued upward momentum for gold. Assess Trade Policy Developments: Track developments related to Trump tariffs and global trade policies. Escalating trade tensions are likely to support gold prices. Gauge Inflation Expectations: Pay attention to inflation data and expectations. Persistent inflation fears will likely maintain gold’s appeal as a hedge. Technical Levels: From a technical perspective, watch the $2,925 resistance level and the all-time peak around $2,942-$2,943. A break above these levels could signal further bullish momentum. Support levels to watch are around $2,885, $2,855, and $2,834. In conclusion, the gold price is currently riding a wave of momentum fueled by USD weakness , safe-haven demand driven by geopolitical and trade uncertainties, and persistent inflation fears . While the market can be volatile, the fundamental and technical setup suggests that gold may continue to shine as a valuable asset in the current economic climate.

While seemingly from the traditional finance world, FX option expiries can offer valuable insights into potential currency movements, which indirectly impact the crypto market, especially for those trading crypto against fiat pairs. Today, we’re diving into the FX option expiries for the New York cut on February 17th, providing you with the key levels to watch across major currency pairs. Decoding FX Option Expiries: What Crypto Traders Need to Know FX option expiries represent the dates and times at which options contracts in the foreign exchange market cease to exist. Large option expiries, particularly at key strike prices, can sometimes act as magnets or barriers for price movements as market participants, including large institutions, adjust their positions leading up to and on the expiry date. For crypto traders, understanding these levels can be beneficial because: Potential Volatility Indicator: Large expiries can sometimes lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the underlying currency pairs, which can spill over into crypto markets, especially for pairs like BTC/USD or ETH/USD. Liquidity Insights: Knowing where large options are expiring gives a sense of potential areas of liquidity or resistance in the Forex market. Correlation Awareness: While not direct, movements in major FX pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY can sometimes correlate with risk sentiment, influencing broader market trends that affect cryptocurrencies. Key Currency Pairs and Option Expiry Levels for NY Cut Here’s a breakdown of the significant currency options expiries for the NY cut at 10:00 Eastern Time, sourced via DTCC. These levels indicate where substantial option positions are concentrated and could influence price action. EUR/USD: Levels to Watch The EUR/USD pair is exhibiting significant option expiries at several key levels. Keep a close eye on these: 1.0300: €466 million 1.0500: €4.7 billion (A massive expiry level!) 1.0525: €538 million 1.0530: €480 million The massive expiry at 1.0500 for EUR/USD is particularly noteworthy. This level could act as a significant point of contention for price action today. Will the price be drawn towards it, or will it act as a strong barrier? GBP/USD: Key Expiry Point For GBP/USD , one notable level stands out: 1.2450: £503 million While less concentrated than EUR/USD , this level for GBP/USD still represents a considerable amount of options. USD/JPY: Important Expiry Zones The USD/JPY pair has a cluster of expiries at these levels: 148.20: $986 million 152.00: $680 million 152.05: $660 million 152.20: $710 million Notice the concentration around the 152.00-152.20 zone. These levels for USD/JPY could be crucial in determining the pair’s movement, especially given the ongoing discussions around potential Bank of Japan policy shifts. Other USD Pairs: USD/CHF, AUD/USD, USD/CAD Here are the notable expiry levels for other USD pairs: USD/CHF: 0.9000 ($502 million) AUD/USD: 1.4285 (A$559 million – Note: This level seems unusual for AUD/USD and likely is a data error, typical AUD/USD range is 0.60-0.70. Traders should verify this data point.) USD/CAD: 0.6300 ($495 million – Note: Similar to AUD/USD, this level is likely a data error as typical USD/CAD range is 1.20-1.40. Verify this data point.) Important Note on Data Accuracy: As highlighted in the original source disclaimer, always verify data independently. The AUD/USD and USD/CAD levels provided look highly improbable and are likely data entry errors. Focus on the more plausible levels for EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CHF. Actionable Insights for Traders Monitor Price Action: Observe how prices react around these expiry levels as the NY cut approaches. Increased volatility or price reversals near these levels could signal the influence of option expiries. Cross-Market Awareness: Keep an eye on correlations. Significant moves in EUR/USD or USD/JPY can sometimes have ripple effects across crypto markets. Risk Management: Be mindful of potential increased volatility around expiry times. Adjust your trading strategies and risk management accordingly. Verify Data: Always cross-reference option expiry data with multiple sources to ensure accuracy, especially for outliers like the initially reported AUD/USD and USD/CAD levels. Conclusion: Staying Informed for Smarter Trading While FX option expiries are a Forex market phenomenon, understanding them provides another layer of market intelligence for crypto traders. By monitoring these key levels, particularly for major pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY , you can gain valuable insights into potential market movements and refine your trading strategies. Remember, informed trading is empowered trading. Stay vigilant, verify your data, and navigate the markets with awareness.

Dogecoin closed green on the weekly timeframe for the first time in four weeks amid a macroeconomic boost . The prominent meme coin recorded a 6.5% upsurge from its closing price two weeks ago, suggesting it might be building momentum.The uptrend last week ensured DOGE trades around the 0.618 Fibonacci level as identified by market analyst Ali Martinez. While the prominent meme coin remains around this area, analysis suggests it could see more upside.Notably, Martinez is not the only analyst suggesting higher prices for the leading meme coin; multiple other commentaries indicate the asset would sustain its recent momentum to unprecedented prices before the cycle ends.Dogecoin Far from Cyclical Top: AnalystIn a recent post, prominent market analyst Trader Tardigrade identified trends that suggest Dogecoin’s top signal has yet to arrive. His analysis highlighted a relative strength index (RSI) indicator in the 2-week timeframe, which has historically pointed to the meme coin’s top.An accompanying chart further supported Trader Tardigrade’s argument, as it showed a slight RSI retracement in 2016, followed by a larger regression in the cycle’s top in 2017. A similar pattern played out in the 2021 cycle, accurately indicating the market’s top in both seasons. 2-Week RSI Indicating Cyclical Tops Meanwhile, Dogecoin is just consolidating with the first RSI retracement for this cycle. As a result, the analyst insisted that the meme coin would target higher prices when the RSI hits similar levels to other cycles, with his chart showing a possible 3,310% surge from the current market price to $9.Further Confirmation of an Imminent Dogecoin BreakoutKrissPax, a notable Dogecoin enthusiast, further discussed the possibility of an imminent surge for the largest meme coin by market cap. He stated that DOGE has broken out from two consecutive descending channels since late 2023 amid strong upsurge momentum.The analysis , citing Tardigrade, shows a first breakout from a channel with the February 2024 outburst, peaking at $0.2290 a month later. Notably, the route started forming from Dogecoin’s surge to $0.1075 in December 2023.Furthermore, the next channel kicked in immediately after the March 2024 peak and consolidated till November. After Donald Trump’s notable election win, the asset broke out to its current cyclical peak of $0.4846.Meanwhile, KrissPax suggested another breakout is on the horizon, with the bull cycle still in full force. An accompanying chart shows the meme coin could break past $1 with the imminent price outburst. Dogecoin's Descending Channel Breakouts Whale Traction RequiredDespite the bullish calls, on-chain activities in the Dogecoin ecosystem remain flat. A recent analysis shows that whale traction towards the meme coin has dropped 88% since mid-November, reflected in the recent price actions. Dwindling Whale Activities on Dogecoin If Dogecoin is to regain bullish momentum, activities around its ecosystem, especially among large holders, must resume.

Yes, you heard it right – humanoid robotics! While known for its virtual world ambitions, Meta is now venturing into building robots that can walk, work, and potentially revolutionize how we interact with technology in our physical spaces. For those in the cryptocurrency and tech sphere, this pivot signals a fascinating convergence of AI, hardware, and everyday life, mirroring the disruptive innovation we’ve seen in blockchain and digital assets. Why is Meta Betting Big on Humanoid Robotics? Meta’s foray into humanoid robotics isn’t just a random tech experiment; it’s a strategic move that could redefine the company’s future and the broader tech landscape. According to a Bloomberg report, Meta is establishing a new team within its Reality Labs division – the same division working on VR and AR – to develop these robots. The goal? To create robots capable of assisting with physical tasks, potentially starting with household chores. Think about it – robots that could fold laundry, load dishwashers, or even assist in more complex tasks around the home and eventually in various industries. This isn’t just about creating another gadget; it’s about building a foundational hardware platform for the entire robotics industry , much like Google’s Android did for smartphones. Meet the Robotics Dream Team Leading this ambitious project is Marc Whitten, a seasoned tech executive who previously served as CEO of driverless car startup Cruise. His resume boasts stints at tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Sonos, indicating a wealth of experience in hardware, software, and AI integration. Whitten’s leadership suggests Meta is serious about combining cutting-edge AI with robust hardware to create truly capable AI robotics . The team will be responsible for not just the physical robots but also the crucial software and AI brains that will power them. This holistic approach is vital for creating robots that are not just mechanically sound but also intelligent and adaptable. Building the Android of Robotics? Meta’s vision isn’t to immediately launch a Meta-branded robot for consumers. Instead, the company is reportedly aiming to build a hardware foundation for the wider robotics market . This strategy mirrors Google’s successful Android playbook. Android wasn’t about Google making its own phones initially; it was about creating an open-source operating system that other phone manufacturers could use. Meta seems to be thinking along similar lines – creating a robust and versatile hardware platform that other robotics companies can build upon. This approach could foster innovation and accelerate the growth of the entire humanoid robotics ecosystem. Partnerships on the Horizon? To further accelerate development, Meta is reportedly in discussions with established robotics firms like Unitree Robotics and Figure AI. These partnerships could be crucial for prototyping and leveraging existing expertise in the field. Unitree Robotics is known for its agile and dynamic robots, while Figure AI is focused on developing general-purpose humanoid robots. Collaborating with such companies could provide Meta with valuable insights and resources, speeding up the development process and potentially leading to more sophisticated and capable Meta robotics platforms sooner rather than later. What Does This Mean for the Future of Tech? Meta’s venture into future tech with humanoid robotics has significant implications: Boost for the Robotics Industry: Meta’s investment and platform approach could inject massive momentum into the robotics industry, attracting more investment and talent. AI Advancement: Developing intelligent humanoid robots requires significant advancements in AI, particularly in areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning. Meta’s project could drive breakthroughs in these fields. New Hardware Ecosystem: Just as Android created a vast ecosystem of smartphones, Meta’s robotics platform could spawn a new ecosystem of robotic devices and applications. Household and Industrial Automation: Humanoid robots have the potential to revolutionize household chores, manufacturing, logistics, and numerous other industries by automating physical tasks. Ethical Considerations: As robots become more integrated into our lives, ethical considerations around job displacement, privacy, and robot autonomy will become increasingly important. Challenges Ahead While the potential is immense, Meta will face significant challenges: Technological Hurdles: Building truly capable and affordable humanoid robots is incredibly complex. It requires breakthroughs in areas like battery technology, motor control, sensor technology, and AI algorithms. Market Adoption: Convincing consumers and businesses to adopt humanoid robots will take time and require demonstrating clear value and usability. Competition: Meta will face competition from established robotics companies, as well as other tech giants also exploring robotics. Regulatory Landscape: Regulations around robotics are still evolving, and navigating this landscape will be crucial. The Takeaway Meta’s move into humanoid robotics is a bold and potentially transformative bet. While still early days, the company’s resources, ambition, and platform-centric approach could position it as a major player in the burgeoning robotics industry. For those watching the intersection of crypto and cutting-edge tech, this development is a clear indicator of how AI and hardware are converging to shape our future. Keep an eye on Meta’s robotics journey – it could be the start of a new era in how we live and interact with technology.

If you’re tracking the crypto world, you know disruptive tech when you see it. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI lab, has suddenly become a major player, much like a new cryptocurrency surging onto the scene. Their AI chatbot app has skyrocketed to the top of app store charts, sparking intense debate about the future of AI leadership and the demand for AI chips. Let’s dive into the story of DeepSeek and understand why this AI chatbot is creating such a buzz. What are the Origins of DeepSeek AI? DeepSeek’s story is rooted in the world of finance. It’s backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese hedge fund that leverages AI models for smart trading decisions. Liang Wenfeng, an AI enthusiast and former student, co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. By 2019, High-Flyer was a full-fledged hedge fund, deeply invested in AI algorithms. In 2023, the DeepSeek lab was born, branching out from High-Flyer’s financial focus to explore broader AI model development. This lab then spun off into its own company, retaining the name DeepSeek. From the start, DeepSeek prioritized building its own data centers for training its powerful AI. However, like other Chinese tech companies, DeepSeek has faced headwinds from U.S. export restrictions on advanced hardware. To train its cutting-edge models, DeepSeek reportedly had to rely on Nvidia H800 chips, a less powerful alternative to the H100 chips favored by U.S. companies. Despite these challenges, DeepSeek has assembled a young and ambitious technical team, aggressively recruiting top AI researchers from leading Chinese universities. Interestingly, they also bring in talent from non-computer science backgrounds, aiming to broaden their AI’s understanding across diverse subjects, as reported by The New York Times. DeepSeek’s Breakthrough: How Strong are their AI Models? DeepSeek first made waves in November 2023 with the launch of its initial models: DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat. But it was the release of the next-generation DeepSeek-V2 models in spring that truly grabbed the AI industry’s attention. DeepSeek-V2, a versatile system capable of analyzing both text and images, demonstrated impressive performance in AI benchmarks. Crucially, it was significantly more cost-effective to operate than comparable models available at the time. This price advantage forced competitors in China, including tech giants like ByteDance and Alibaba, to slash prices for their own models, and even make some entirely free. The subsequent launch of DeepSeek-V3 in December 2024 further solidified DeepSeek’s rising prominence. Internal testing by DeepSeek suggests that V3 surpasses both open-source models like Meta’s Llama and closed models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o in performance. Adding to their arsenal is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model, unveiled in January. DeepSeek claims R1 rivals OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. Reasoning models like R1 excel at self-correction and fact-checking, leading to greater reliability, particularly in fields like physics, science, and math. While reasoning models may take slightly longer to generate responses, the increased accuracy is a significant advantage. Here’s a quick comparison of DeepSeek’s key models: Model Key Features Strengths Considerations DeepSeek-V2 General-purpose text and image analysis High performance, cost-effective Preceded by V3 DeepSeek-V3 Advanced general-purpose model Outperforms Llama and GPT-4o (per DeepSeek testing) Subject to Chinese regulatory oversight DeepSeek R1 Reasoning model Fact-checks itself, reliable in technical domains Slightly slower response times What are the Downsides of China AI like DeepSeek? There’s a critical aspect to consider with DeepSeek and other China AI models. As they are developed in China, they are subject to content regulations by China’s internet regulator. This means their responses are monitored to ensure they align with “core socialist values.” In practical terms, within the DeepSeek AI chatbot app, certain topics are off-limits. For instance, R1 will not engage with questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. This censorship is a crucial factor for users to be aware of, especially when compared to more openly accessible AI models developed in other regions. Is DeepSeek’s Business Model Sustainable? DeepSeek’s approach to the market is… unconventional. Its pricing strategy is highly disruptive, often undercutting competitors and even offering some products and services for free. DeepSeek attributes this aggressive pricing to breakthroughs in efficiency, allowing them to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. However, some industry experts question the company’s cost figures. Regardless of the exact mechanisms, developers are flocking to DeepSeek’s models. While not strictly open source in the traditional sense, DeepSeek provides permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. Clem Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, notes that developers on their platform have created over 500 derivative models of R1, accumulating over 2.5 million downloads. What Impact is DeepSeek Having on the AI Industry? DeepSeek’s rapid ascent has been described as both “upending AI” and “over-hyped.” Its impact is undeniable. Notably, DeepSeek’s success was partially blamed for an 18% drop in Nvidia’s stock price on a recent Monday, and even prompted a public statement from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Microsoft has also integrated DeepSeek into its Azure AI Foundry service, showcasing its significance in the enterprise AI landscape. Mark Zuckerberg, when questioned about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending, emphasized that AI infrastructure remains a “strategic advantage” for Meta. Interestingly, while some embrace DeepSeek, others are wary. Certain companies, and even entire countries and governments, are reportedly banning DeepSeek. New York state has also prohibited its use on government devices, reflecting growing concerns about foreign influence in AI. What’s Next for DeepSeek AI? The future of DeepSeek remains uncertain, but further advancements in its AI models are almost guaranteed. However, the increasing scrutiny from the U.S. government regarding potential foreign influence could present challenges. DeepSeek’s journey is one to watch closely, as it navigates the complex landscape of global AI competition and regulation. Will DeepSeek continue its disruptive rise, or will geopolitical factors limit its reach? Only time will tell. Stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving world of AI.

CZ stated that Binance is not for sale, acknowledging that top investors have always shown interest and said that over time they may consider allowing investments with a single-digit percentage. CZ responded to the FUD news with the number 4 and said: “4. Some self-proclaimed competitors in Asia are talking nonsense about selling Binance (CEX). Binance is not for sale as a shareholder. “The best investors have always been interested in Binance. Over time, we may allow some investments in the single-digit percentage range.” Binance co-founder Yi He also responded to claims that “Binance is about to be sold.” Yi He said that such claims were rumors spread by competitors and that Binance regularly interacts with institutions for investment and cooperation discussions. Yi He also added that while Binance is open to exploring partnerships and acquiring other exchanges, there are currently no plans to sell. 4.

Reports are swirling that Liang Wenfeng, the visionary founder of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, is poised to meet with China’s President Xi Jinping. This potential summit, also expected to include Alibaba’s Jack Ma, is sending ripples through the tech world, particularly in the cryptocurrency and AI sectors. What could this mean for the future of technology and global power dynamics? Let’s dive deep into this developing story. Why is a Meeting Between DeepSeek’s Liang Wenfeng and Xi Jinping a Big Deal? Imagine the founder of a rapidly rising AI company, one that’s directly challenging the dominance of US tech giants, meeting with the paramount leader of China. That’s the magnitude of what’s reportedly on the horizon. Liang Wenfeng , the mind behind DeepSeek, has propelled his startup into the limelight in a remarkably short time. Founded in 2023 as an offshoot of his quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer, DeepSeek has rapidly gained recognition for its powerful, openly accessible AI models. These models have demonstrated impressive capabilities, rivaling and in some cases surpassing leading models from OpenAI and other prominent American AI companies. Here’s why this meeting is generating buzz: Symbolic Support: The meeting is interpreted by many as a strong signal from the Chinese Communist Party. It suggests a move towards a more supportive environment for domestic private-sector firms, especially those in cutting-edge technologies like AI. This is particularly noteworthy given the recent regulatory pressures faced by some Chinese tech giants. Economic Implications: After a period of tightened regulations, this summit could indicate a strategic pivot to bolster the private sector’s innovation and economic contributions. It could pave the way for more favorable policies and investments in the China AI landscape. Geopolitical Significance: With the US and China locked in a technological and economic competition, particularly in AI, this meeting underscores China’s commitment to becoming a global AI superpower. It sends a clear message about China’s ambition to not just compete, but to lead in the AI race . DeepSeek’s Meteoric Rise: A Challenger in the AI Arena Founded just last year, DeepSeek has quickly become a name to reckon with in the global AI landscape. Liang Wenfeng’s leadership has been instrumental in this rapid ascent. Here are some key highlights of DeepSeek’s journey and impact: Impressive Model Performance: DeepSeek’s AI models have showcased remarkable performance, competing directly with industry leaders like OpenAI. This has caught the attention of the global AI community and raised eyebrows in Washington. Open Access Approach: Unlike some of its competitors, DeepSeek has adopted a more open approach, making its models and services readily available. This strategy has fueled rapid adoption and increased its influence in the AI ecosystem. US Concerns: The rapid rise of DeepSeek has not gone unnoticed in the United States. US officials are reportedly concerned about DeepSeek’s growing popularity and capabilities, viewing it as a potential threat to the US’s leading position in AI. This underscores the high stakes of the current AI race . What Does This Mean for the Future of China’s Tech Sector? The reported meeting could be a watershed moment for China’s tech sector. After a period of regulatory headwinds, is the tide turning? Here are potential implications: Potential Impact Description Policy Shift A more supportive stance from the government towards private tech firms, potentially leading to relaxed regulations and increased investment.

Over 710 investors have already secured positions in the project’s opening phase, drawn by its $0.01 entry price and a clear path to 600% returns at launch. Unlike speculative tokens flooding the space, Mutuum Finance combines decentralized lending solutions with a structured ecosystem designed for long-term growth. Analysts tracking its progress now predict the token could soar 100x to $1 by 2025, positioning early backers for unprecedented gains. Mutuum Finance Core Features Mutuum Finance operates as a decentralized lending platform where users supply or borrow crypto assets seamlessly. Lenders deposit stablecoins like USDT into liquidity pools, earning passive income through adjustable interest rates tied to borrowing demand. A $10,000 deposit, for instance, generates annual yields based on real-time market activity. Borrowers, meanwhile, leverage assets such as ETH as collateral to access liquidity without selling holdings, a feature appealing to investors aiming to retain ownership during market swings. The platform’s dual Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models cater to diverse strategies. While P2C interactions use audited smart contracts for automated security, P2P allows direct negotiations between users, limited to pre-approved tokens for reduced risk. Though the P2C system remains under development, its roadmap prioritizes launching a beta platform alongside exchange listings, ensuring immediate utility post-presale. Phase One Presale Momentum Investor enthusiasm centers on Mutuum Finance’s presale structure, where the current $0.01 price will jump to $0.06 at launch, a guaranteed 6x gain for early participants. With 11 phases planned, the first stage is rapidly selling out, creating urgency among retail and institutional buyers alike. Over $465,000 raised so far indicates confidence in the project’s fundamentals, including an upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin launch. Market experts highlight the token’s post-launch potential, noting its buy-and-distribute mechanism as a key growth driver. A percentage of platform fees will automatically purchase MUTM from open markets, redistributing tokens to stakers. This system creates recurring buying pressure, directly linking platform adoption to token value. Combined with plans for a live product at launch, these features position MUTM to outperform established DeFi tokens lacking tangible use cases. Beyond financial incentives, Mutuum Finance is rallying community support through a $100,000 giveaway split among ten winners. To join, participants engage with the project’s social channels, a strategy amplifying visibility while rewarding early adopters. This initiative mirrors tactics used by successful DeFi projects, further validating MUTM’s potential to disrupt traditional lending models. Roadmap and Long-Term Vision Mutuum Finance’s phased roadmap includes a USD-pegged stablecoin backed by on-chain reserves. This aims to enhance transparency and stability, addressing common pain points in decentralized finance. By aligning each milestone with investor rewards, the team ensures continuous momentum ahead of its 2025 targets. As the presale advances, the window for securing tokens at $0.01 narrows. Subsequent phases will incrementally raise prices, making current entry points the most cost-effective. Early investors not only lock in instant gains but also position themselves for the predicted climb to $1. This price target is grounded in the platform’s operational plans rather than mere speculation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto market by prioritizing utility over hype. Its presale success, combined with a clear growth strategy, offers an opportunity to join a project before mainstream adoption. For those seeking high-yield investments with measurable milestones, MUTM’s presale is an unmissable entry into DeFi’s next evolution. Secure your position in Mutuum Finance today. Phase one closes soon, and missing this window could mean losing the lowest price ever offered.

This bold move, labeled as a ‘blunt’ rejection, highlights the intense rivalry and differing visions for the future of AI, particularly relevant to those in the cryptocurrency space closely watching tech giants’ moves. Let’s dive into the details of this high-stakes standoff. Why Did OpenAI Board Issue a Stinging Board Rejection ? According to a statement from Bret Taylor, OpenAI’s board chair, the rejection was not just unanimous but also firmly positioned against Musk’s motives. Taylor explicitly called Musk’s bid ‘an attempt to disrupt his competition.’ This suggests a deep-seated mistrust and a belief that Musk’s intentions are not aligned with OpenAI’s core mission. Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons behind this forceful board rejection : Mission Integrity: OpenAI was founded as a non-profit with the goal of ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all humanity. The board seems to believe that Musk’s acquisition would jeopardize this original mission. Competition Concerns: OpenAI views Musk, particularly with his AI company xAI, as a direct competitor. Selling to a competitor is inherently problematic, especially given the sensitive nature of AI development. Value Discrepancy: While $97.4 billion is a massive sum, OpenAI’s board, through its counsel, indicated that Musk’s bid ‘doesn’t set a value for [OpenAI’s] nonprofit’ and reiterated that the nonprofit is ‘not for sale.’ This implies the board believes OpenAI’s value, especially in terms of its mission and future potential, is beyond monetary offers. Legal Battles: Musk himself is already embroiled in a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging anti-competitive behavior and fraud. Accepting an acquisition bid from someone actively suing the company would be highly unusual and legally complex. Elon Musk’s Bold Acquisition Bid : A Power Play or Genuine Interest? Elon Musk’s surprise acquisition bid sent shockwaves through the tech world. Coming from a co-founder who later became critical of OpenAI’s direction, the offer raises questions about his true intentions. Was it a strategic move to gain control, a genuine attempt to steer OpenAI back to its original non-profit roots, or something else entirely? Consider these points: Unsolicited Offer: The bid was unsolicited, indicating Musk was attempting a hostile takeover of sorts, bypassing standard acquisition protocols. Timing and Context: The bid came amidst Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI, adding a layer of complexity and suspicion to his motives. Public Statements: Musk and his allies have publicly criticized OpenAI and Sam Altman, accusing them of deviating from the original mission and prioritizing profit over public benefit. This suggests a desire to ‘correct’ OpenAI’s course. Alternative Motives: Some speculate Musk’s bid was a tactic to disrupt OpenAI’s progress, slow down competition, or gain leverage in his ongoing lawsuit. The Broader Implications for AI and the Tech Landscape This dramatic rejection underscores the high stakes and intense competition in the AI sector. It’s not just about business deals; it’s about the future direction of a technology with profound implications for society. Here are some broader takeaways for the AI landscape: Value of Mission-Driven Companies: OpenAI’s board’s firm stance highlights the importance of mission-driven organizations, especially in rapidly evolving and impactful fields like AI. Regulatory Scrutiny: The clash between Musk and OpenAI could attract increased regulatory scrutiny of AI development and corporate structures within the industry. Increased Competition: The rivalry between Musk’s xAI and OpenAI is set to intensify, pushing both companies to innovate faster and potentially in different directions. Focus on Ethical AI: The debate around OpenAI’s non-profit versus for-profit structure and Musk’s accusations emphasize the ongoing discussion about ethical considerations in AI development and deployment. What’s Next in the OpenAI Saga? The OpenAI saga is far from over. While the acquisition bid has been rejected, the underlying tensions and legal battles remain. Here’s what to watch for: Lawsuit Outcome: Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI will continue, and its outcome could significantly impact OpenAI’s restructuring plans and future direction. OpenAI’s Restructuring: OpenAI is still in the process of transitioning to a public benefit corporation. Musk is attempting to halt this conversion, and the legal fight over this will be crucial. Public Opinion and Pressure: Public and industry opinion could play a role in shaping the narrative and influencing both OpenAI’s and Musk’s actions. Future Bids?: While this bid was rejected, it remains to be seen if Musk or other parties will make future attempts to acquire or influence OpenAI. In Conclusion: A Power Struggle for the Future of AI OpenAI’s resounding rejection of Elon Musk’s acquisition bid is a powerful statement about the company’s commitment to its mission and its determination to remain independent. This clash is more than just a business dispute; it’s a power struggle over the future of AI, its ethical development, and its accessibility. For those in the crypto world and beyond, this saga serves as a crucial reminder of the high stakes and intense competition shaping the future of technology.

It has slipped by over 30% from its November highs, meaning that it is in a technical bear market. One crypto analyst, however, believes that the ETH price has formed a megaphone pattern pointing to a strong surge. ETH Price Forms a Giant Megaphone Pattern The ongoing ETH price weakness may be a good sign to buy as it continues to set up the giant megaphone or a rising broadening wedge chart pattern on the weekly chart . According to Titan of Crypto , the coin started forming this pattern in 2023. As the name suggests, a megaphone pattern is made up of several higher highs and higher lows. One then connects the higher highs and higher lows with a trendline. The two trendlines move in a divergent pattern, forming what looks like a megaphone. Ethereum recently fell to the lower side of this megaphone, and Titan expects that it will bounce back and surge to between $7,700 and $9,900 in the long term. A move from the current $2,766 to the two targets is a 178% and 258% surge. Such a price action is possible since ETH price has jumped by 212% from its lowest point in May 2022 and by 3,700% from its 2020 low. The caveat for this Ethereum price forecast is that it is on the weekly chart. This means that it wlll take time to form and complete. As the chart below shows, Titan’s forecast is that the coin will get to the target price in 2026. Ethereum Price Forecast Ethereum Price Short-Term Targets The daily chart shows that the Ethereum price has pulled back in the past few weeks. This crash is mostly because of the sluggish spot Ethereum inflows , continued sales by the Ethereum Foundation , and the fact that it is losing market share to Solana and BNB Chain . Ethereum, which used to lead in terms of fees, has been overtaken by other projects like Jito, Circle, and Tron. The chart shows that the value of ETH has formed a death cross as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages have flipped each other. Ethereum formed such a cross lastly in August 2024, and it dropped by over 20% afterwards. On the positive side, Ethereum is forming a bullish pennant chart pattern . This pattern is characterized by a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. It often leads to a strong bullish breakout. Therefore, more upside will be confirmed if the Ethereum price rises above the upper side of the pennant and the psychological point at $3,000. A move above that level will point to more gains as it will invalidate the death cross pattern. Ethereum Price Chart On the flip side, a drop below the lower side of the pennant pattern at $2,520 will invalidate the bullish view and risk it crashing to this month’s low of $2,160.

They offer fast transactions, anonymity and no strict banking restrictions, making them particularly attractive to those looking for freedom of choice. Unlike traditional platforms, many crypto casinos allow you to bypass GamStop restrictions, giving players more ways to play. One of the main advantages of such casinos are free spins no deposit non Gamstop , which allow new users to test out games without investing. This is a great opportunity for gambling enthusiasts to try out popular slots and table games, using cryptocurrency for fast and secure transactions. But how is cryptocurrency more favourable than traditional payment methods? Why are UK players increasingly choosing bitcoin, etherium and other digital assets? In this article, we'll break down the key benefits of cryptocurrency online casinos and explain how they are changing the UK gambling industry. Why is cryptocurrency ideal for online casinos? Modern technology and the rise in popularity of decentralised payments have dramatically changed the online gambling industry. Cryptocurrency is becoming more and more in demand due to its speed, security and anonymity. Solving the problems of traditional payment methods Traditional payment systems, such as bank transfers or credit cards, have a number of limitations: Long transaction processing times High fees Bank restrictions and blocking of transfers to casinos The need to disclose personal data Cryptocurrency saves players from these problems by offering instant transfers, low fees and no interference from banks or government agencies. Convenience and anonymity for players Anonymity is one of the main factors that attract players to cryptocurrency casinos. Using digital currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum allows: Make deposits and withdrawals without revealing personal information Avoid banking controls and tax restrictions Guarantee the safety of funds thanks to blockchain technology In addition, cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, which reduces the risk of fraud and chargebacks by users. Rapid development of technology The popularity of blockchain and decentralised finance (DeFi) is driving the integration of cryptocurrencies into the online casino industry. More and more platforms are accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other coins, as well as creating their own tokens and NFT loyalty programmes. Thus, cryptocurrency not only simplifies financial transactions at online casinos, but also makes the game more accessible, secure and private. Types of cryptocurrencies used in gambling Cryptocurrency has become an integral part of the online gambling industry, offering players fast, anonymous and secure payments. Unlike traditional methods such as bank cards or e-wallets, cryptocurrency transactions take place without intermediaries, making it convenient for international users. Online casinos that accept crypto attract players with low commissions, high payout speeds and exclusive bonuses. However, the choice of cryptocurrency plays an important role, as each of them has its own peculiarities. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency widely used in online casinos. It offers a high level of security and anonymity thanks to blockchain technology. Many casinos accept BTC as the main payment method, offering instant deposits and fast payouts. However, due to bitcoin's busy network, commissions can be higher than other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency and is characterised by its fast transaction speeds and the ability to use smart contracts. This makes it a convenient choice for online gambling, especially in casinos that support decentralised games (dApps). Commissions on the Ethereum network can vary depending on how busy the blockchain is, but transactions are generally faster than Bitcoin. Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin is a lightweight and fast alternative to Bitcoin. This cryptocurrency features low fees and fast transaction processing speeds, making it ideal for frequent deposits and withdrawals of winnings. Casinos that support LTC usually offer instant deposits and minimal withdrawal delays. Tether (USDT). Tether is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, making it a stable means of payment at online casinos. Using USDT avoids the volatility common to other cryptocurrencies and keeps your winnings equivalent to traditional currency. Many casinos accept USDT on the ERC-20 (Ethereum) and TRC-20 (Tron) networks, providing fast transactions and low fees. Tron (TRX). Tron is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in gambling, thanks to its low fees and fast transaction speeds. Casinos that support TRX allow players to make deposits and withdraw winnings almost instantly, without additional costs. Tron is also actively used in decentralised applications (dApps), which makes it in demand among crypto-gambling enthusiasts. Dogecoin (DOGE). Dogecoin, originally created as a meme cryptocurrency, has gained popularity among players due to its low fees and fast transactions. Some online casinos accept DOGE for betting and offer special bonuses for users of this coin. Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Bitcoin Cash is a fork of bitcoin that offers faster and cheaper transactions. Its popularity in online gambling stems from the fact that it retains the advantages of BTC, but is faster and with lower fees. Ripple (XRP). Ripple is a cryptocurrency known for its super fast transactions and low fees. Although it is used less frequently in gambling than BTC or ETH, some casinos accept XRP for its efficiency in international payments. Benefits of cryptocurrency for gamblers Using cryptocurrency at online casinos offers players a host of benefits. Anonymity and confidentiality avoid unnecessary questions from banks, high speed transactions get rid of long waiting times for payments, and minimal commissions help to save money. In addition, cryptocurrency opens access to gambling all over the world, regardless of restrictions, and gives the opportunity to get exclusive bonuses. Anonymity and privacy One of the main advantages of cryptocurrency transactions is the ability to remain anonymous. Unlike traditional payment systems that require personal details such as first name, last name, bank card number and address, cryptocurrency transfers work without revealing your identity. When using bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, the player simply sends funds from one digital wallet to another using a unique address. This means that the owner's details remain hidden and the transaction is recorded in the blockchain without being tied to a specific person. Bank transfers and e-wallet payments are often subject to monitoring and can be blocked, especially when it comes to gambling-related transactions. In contrast, cryptocurrency is not subject to censorship, which means that players can deposit and withdraw winnings without too many questions from banks or payment systems. High speed of transactions Waiting to withdraw winnings is one of the most frustrating parts of online gambling. Traditional payment methods such as bank transfers or cards can take days to process. In some cases, if the transaction takes place on a weekend or public holiday, the wait can take even longer. Cryptocurrency solves this problem. Casino deposits made in bitcoin, ethereum or other digital currencies are credited instantly or within minutes. Withdrawals in cryptocurrency also take minimal time - in most cases the money arrives within an hour, while bank transfers can take several days to process. To avoid delays, it's worth choosing casinos that work with low-load blockchains, such as using Lightcoin or USDT on the Tron network, which process payments almost instantly. Minimal commissions Commissions are another reason why gamblers prefer cryptocurrency payments. Bank transfers, especially international ones, are often accompanied by additional fees that can reach several per cent of the amount. Even electronic payment systems like Skrill or Neteller take fees for transfers and currency conversions. Cryptocurrency allows players to save money, as the commissions are minimal or non-existent. For example, bitcoin transfers may have a small fee depending on network congestion, but if you use altcoins like Lightcoin or Tron, transaction costs are virtually nil. This is especially beneficial for players who make frequent deposits and withdrawals, as the savings on fees can be significant. Worldwide Availability In some countries, gambling is restricted or completely banned and banks block casino-related transactions. This creates difficulties for players who want to enjoy gambling but face restrictions. Cryptocurrency solves this problem as it does not depend on banking and government regulations. A player can easily transfer funds to the casino even if traditional payment methods are not available in their country. In addition, cryptocurrency works equally efficiently anywhere in the world. No matter where the player is located - in Europe, Asia or Latin America - he can easily deposit and withdraw winnings without being tied to national currencies or banking systems. Additional bonuses and promotions Many online casinos incentivise players to use cryptocurrency by offering exclusive bonuses for doing so. While standard deposit bonuses are available for all users, more favourable terms may be offered for players using bitcoins, etherium or other cryptocurrencies. Some casinos give increased bonuses when depositing in cryptocurrency. For example, if the usual bonus is 100% to the deposit, for cryptocurrency payments it can increase to 150% or even higher. Also popular are cashbacks, which allow you to return part of the lost funds, and special promotions, in which only players using crypto participate. Best online casinos that accept cryptocurrency With the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, many online casinos have started accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies. This provides players with anonymity, fast transactions and attractive bonuses. Below are some of the best crypto casinos that stand out for their reliability and lucrative offers.

Regular players can participate in weekly prize draws and receive personalised offers from the casino administration. Conclusion The best online casinos that accept cryptocurrency offer players convenient, fast and anonymous payment methods. However, when choosing a platform, it is important to consider a few key factors. First of all, you should pay attention to the casino's licence and reputation. Reliable operators work under the jurisdiction of such regulators as Curacao eGaming or Malta Gaming Authority. The licence guarantees fair play and timely payouts. In addition, it is worth studying reviews of real players to make sure that the platform is reliable. Another important aspect is the support of various cryptocurrencies. Many casinos accept bitcoin, etherium, lightcoin, USDT and other tokens. The more payment options available, the more convenient it is for players to deposit and withdraw winnings. One of the main advantages of cryptocurrencies is the high speed of transactions. Unlike bank transfers, which can take several days to process, crypto payments arrive in the account within minutes or hours. This is especially important for withdrawals, as players don't have to wait long to utilise their winnings. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, the path to sophisticated AI integration isn’t always smooth. Tech giants Amazon and Apple are discovering this firsthand as their highly anticipated generative AI upgrades for Alexa and Siri are reportedly facing significant hurdles. Why Are AI Voice Assistants Facing Setbacks? According to recent reports, both Amazon and Apple are grappling with unexpected bugs and engineering challenges as they attempt to infuse generative AI into their digital assistants. This news comes as a surprise to many, given the immense resources and technological prowess of these companies. Let’s break down what we know: Amazon’s Alexa Delay: Originally slated for a grand reveal in New York on February 26th, the revamped, generative AI Voice Assistants powered Alexa is now facing delays. The Washington Post reports that the launch is pushed back to March or potentially later. This setback indicates deeper issues than just minor tweaks. Apple’s Siri Struggles: Bloomberg’s report paints a similar picture for Apple. The ambitious AI overhaul of Siri is encountering engineering complexities and software bugs. Features initially planned for an April release might not materialize until May, or even later, suggesting significant roadblocks in development. These delays aren’t just minor hiccups; they represent a struggle to keep pace in the rapidly evolving landscape of voice technology and generative AI. The pressure is on for Amazon and Apple to compete with emerging AI voice technologies like OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode and Google’s Gemini Live, which are setting new benchmarks in the industry. The Race for Generative AI Supremacy: What’s at Stake? The urgency to upgrade AI Voice Assistants is fueled by the fierce competition in the AI space. Companies are racing to integrate generative AI, which promises more natural, context-aware, and human-like interactions. But what exactly are they trying to achieve, and why is it so challenging? Key Goals of Generative AI in Voice Assistants: Enhanced Natural Language Understanding: Moving beyond simple commands to understanding nuanced language, context, and even intent. Proactive Assistance: Anticipating user needs and offering help without explicit prompts, making interactions more seamless and intuitive. Personalized Experiences: Tailoring responses and functionalities based on user history, preferences, and real-time context. Complex Task Execution: Handling multi-step tasks, managing conversations more dynamically, and integrating with a wider range of services.

The Glassnode report comes as Bitcoin continues to trade within a critical range, with its price hovering near $96,788. Specifically, the analytics resource emphasized that if Bitcoin loses its grip on $96K, the next major support could be much lower, as there is minimal resilience.Key Bitcoin Support Levels at $80.1K and $71KIn the report, Glassnode called attention to Bitcoin's adjusted MVRV Z-Score, an indicator that helps traders gauge price support zones. https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1891438549506908518The firm noted that Bitcoin has been holding near its mean level of $96.3K, which marks a major threshold for market stability. According to Glassnode, if the price declines further, bulls might find the next major support at the -1.5 standard deviation (σ) level of $80.1K.For context, the last time Bitcoin saw the $80,000 region was in mid-November 2024, during the Donald Trump-led market-wide uptrend. Ever since the asset transcended this area, it has held above it, demonstrating resilience during the push to $89,164 in January 2025.However, Glassnode analysts believe BTC could revisit the $80K level if the current $96K support gives way. In addition, the firm called attention to Short-term holders (STHs). Specifically, the cost basis for this group sits at $92.2K, marking an important level for maintaining the current uptrend. Bitcoin Short-Term On-chain Cost Basis | Glassnode Additionally, the ±1σ bands, ranging between $71K and $131K, represent typical price boundaries. With Bitcoin still trading within this level, bulls maintain some control, but ongoing price action is testing their resilience.Further, major concern arises from the URPD volume profile, which indicates a liquidity gap below the current support, according to Glassnode's analysis . Few transactions have occurred in this range, suggesting that price movement into this zone could accelerate downward pressure. The -1σ level for STH cost basis, positioned at $71K, sits at the top of this liquidity void, making it a crucial region should Bitcoin's price dip further. Entity-Adjusted URPD | Glassnode Bitcoin Stuck Between Demand and Supply WallsMeanwhile, market analyst Ali Martinez recently pointed out that Bitcoin is currently stuck between strong demand and supply zones. A demand wall exists between $94,660 and $97,540, where market participants purchased about 1.43 million BTC. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1890754182774464802Meanwhile, he confirmed that a supply wall between $97,650 and $99,470 accounts for about 1.16 million BTC. According to Martinez, a breakout in either direction could set the market trend.In a previous analysis , Martinez had highlighted a resistance level at $97,530, which BTC has broken and seeks to flip to support. Below $92,110, he said support is weak, with a significant gap stretching from $90K to $70K. This confirms Glassnode's warning that a failure to hold current levels could lead to deeper price corrections.Demand Remains StrongDespite the range-bound movements, on-chain analyst Darkfost noted that Bitcoin demand remains strong. He points to the 30-day moving average (DMA) of the exchange inflow/outflow ratio as a bullish indicator. When this ratio falls below 1, it suggests that more Bitcoin is leaving exchanges than entering, often a sign of accumulation. Despite Bitcoin fluctuating within the $90K–$105K range, the continued outflows show strong demand. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow|Outflow | CryptoQuant Notably, such trends historically have preceded short-term price increases. However, Darkfost cautions that some of these outflows could come from routine exchange transfers to institutional or custodial wallets.",Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-02-17 16:07:19

These gains follow bullish news including Grayscale’s filing for a Cardano spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) and a potential alliance with Microsoft. At press time, ADA trades at $0.805 after retreating slightly from a daily high of $0.812. Analysts remain optimistic that it could outperform other altcoins during this cycle and possibly hit record highs. Rising Adoption Could Push Cardano Price to $7 In his Cardano price forecast , analyst Investing Broz opined that ADA could rally to $7 and attain a $250 billion market capitalization. He attributed this rally to the hype around the potential approval of Cardano ETFs and rising institutional adoption. Institutions are making bets on Cardano price after the altcoin saw $1.9M in inflows last week per CoinShares. This was notably higher than Ethereum’s negative flows. Cardano’s inflows during the week came in as the third-highest among altcoins. CoinShares: Crypto Weekly Flows As for the altcoin’s short-term performance, Investing Broz noted that ADA’s value could push toward $2.72 in the coming months after a bull flag appeared on its weekly chart. Another analyst, Dan Gambardello, also added that ADA could outperform the rest of the altcoin market in the current cycle. He stated that it was the “obvious blue chip coin of the cycle” that carried significant “macro value.” As positive sentiment around ADA rises, the altcoin’s daily chart suggests that an uptrend could be underway. RSI Shows Rising Buying Pressure Cardano had bounced from the lower Bollinger band to the middle band on its one-day chart, suggesting a shift in momentum to the upside. At press time, ADA had flipped resistance at the middle band ($0.79), and if it closes above this level, it could signal strong gains. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) line has been making higher lows for the past week, indicating that buying pressure is gaining strength. However, the RSI remains below 50, suggesting that bears remain in control. ADA/USDT 1-day chart If the bullish outlook holds, ADA’s next area of resistance lies at the upper band ($0.95). However, traders should watch out for a crossover of the RSI past 50 to confirm a bullish momentum. On the other hand, ADA’s open interest has surged by 27% in seven days per Coinglass data to $763 million. As open interest rises alongside the price, it reinforces the bullish thesis by showing conviction in the current trend.

Focus is Back on AAVE & Cardano Price Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The quick gains and effortless profits had attracted many towards the memecoin space. New tokens were constantly been launched and within a few moments faced a massive rug pull. The latest example of CAR or LIBRA has shaken the trader’s confidence over these types of memecoins, as they have been squeezing out the liquidity from the top ones like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe. Meanwhile, a notable shift in sentiments has been witnessed among the market participants as they are again focusing more on fundamentals. The presumed dead token, like Cardano & Aave, has been attracting massive attention. Here’s what to expect from these tokens ahead. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis After marking the highs above $1.2, the Cardano price has remained stuck within a bearish, descending parallel channel. The token has rebounded from the lower support of the channel and is heading towards the average bands. A rise above the range is expected to push the price towards the resistance, which is located above the psychological barrier at $1. Meanwhile, breaking above the channel may only trigger a bull run towards new highs. There are two major reasons to be bullish on Cardano: the rising RSI and bullish Ichimoku clouds. The conversion line and the baseline are about to undergo a bullish crossover while the RSI remains incremental. This suggests the bulls are gaining back control over the rally that may push the price above $0.86, which could push the levels beyond $0.9. Previously, the ADA price has failed to sustain above this range and hence, if the bulls manage to hold the rally, a rise above $1 is imminent. Aave (AAVE) Price Analysis The Aave price underwent a parabolic recovery after reaching the bottoms from the ATH above $660. Earlier, the price attempted to rise above $400 but the rise in bearish activity dragged the levels lower. However, the price has initiated a strong rebound, which suggests a rise to the pivotal resistance zone between $400 and $430 is imminent. The weekly chart of AAVE displays the very first bullish crossover between the weekly 50-day & 200-day MA levels. The impact has also been seen as the price has rebounded from the parabolic curve, which may push the prices towards the resistance zone. Meanwhile, the RSI, which had dropped below the support, is gearing up, and once it surges above the range, the AAVE price may begin a fresh rise and mark new highs above $700.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|AAVE|ADA|SHIB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-17 16:10:49
40458486,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129531,1739808733,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: Meta’s Shocking Pause on Book Licensing for AI Training Data,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-pause-ai-training-data/,"In a stunning turn of events for the world of artificial intelligence and copyright, recent court filings have shed light on Meta’s strategic shift regarding the data fueling its AI models. It appears the tech giant pressed pause on efforts to secure book licenses for AI training data , a move that has significant implications for the ongoing debate about fair use and intellectual property in the age of generative AI. Why Did Meta Halt Book Licensing for Generative AI Training? The revelation comes amidst the ongoing copyright lawsuit , Kadrey v. Meta Platforms , adding weight to previous whispers that Meta had cooled off on negotiations with book publishers. This legal battle is just one skirmish in a larger war between AI companies and creators, where the core question is: Is training AI on copyrighted material considered ‘fair use’? While AI companies like Meta argue in favor of fair use, copyright holders vehemently disagree. The newly submitted court documents, including deposition transcripts from Meta employees, suggest a pragmatic, if not slightly concerning, reason for the licensing pause. According to Sy Choudhury, Meta’s AI partnership lead, the outreach to publishers for book licensing met with unexpectedly low enthusiasm. Here’s a breakdown of the challenges Meta reportedly faced: Slow Publisher Engagement: Meta’s attempts to contact a wide range of top publishers for generative AI training data resulted in minimal responses. Many ‘cold calls’ went unanswered, indicating a lack of initial interest or perhaps apprehension from the publishing industry. Scalability Concerns: Even among publishers who did engage, the process seemed unsustainable. Negotiating individual licenses with numerous publishers for vast quantities of AI training data presented a logistical nightmare. Rights Ownership Issues: A significant hurdle emerged in the fiction category. Publishers often discovered they didn’t actually possess the rights to license content to Meta, as these rights resided with individual authors. This added layer of complexity would have required lengthy negotiations with countless authors. The ‘Fair Use’ Defense vs. The Copyright Lawsuit Meta’s stance in the copyright lawsuit hinges on the principle of ‘fair use,’ a legal doctrine that permits limited use of copyrighted material without permission under certain circumstances, such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. AI companies argue that training their models falls under research and transformative use, thus qualifying as fair use. However, authors and copyright holders like Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, the plaintiffs in Kadrey v. Meta Platforms , see things very differently. They argue that using their copyrighted books to train commercial AI models without explicit permission and compensation is a clear violation of copyright law. They contend that AI companies are profiting from their creative work without proper attribution or remuneration. Shadow Libraries and Torrenting: A Dark Side to AI Training Data? The amended complaint in the copyright lawsuit throws another serious allegation into the mix: Meta allegedly used ‘shadow libraries’ – essentially collections of pirated e-books – to train its generative AI models, including the popular Llama series. The complaint suggests Meta may have even used torrenting to access these illicit libraries. Torrenting, a peer-to-peer file-sharing method, requires users to not only download but also ‘seed’ (upload) files simultaneously. Plaintiffs argue that this seeding process constitutes copyright infringement, further complicating Meta’s legal position. Beyond Books: Meta’s Broader AI Training Data Strategy Interestingly, the court transcripts reveal this isn’t the first time Meta has paused licensing efforts related to AI training data . Choudhury mentioned a similar experience with licensing 3D worlds from game engine and game manufacturers for AI research. Faced with similar engagement challenges, Meta opted to develop its own solutions in that domain. This suggests a pattern: when licensing proves too difficult or slow, Meta seems inclined to explore alternative, in-house approaches for sourcing AI training data . What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Copyright? Meta’s paused book licensing efforts and the ongoing copyright lawsuit highlight a critical juncture in the development of AI. The industry is grappling with fundamental questions about data sourcing, intellectual property rights, and the ethical implications of training AI models on vast amounts of copyrighted material. Here’s what we can infer from these developments: Increased Scrutiny on AI Training Data: The legal challenges are forcing AI companies to re-evaluate their data acquisition strategies and consider the potential legal and reputational risks associated with using copyrighted material without explicit consent. Potential Shift Towards Open and Public Domain Data: If licensing copyrighted material becomes prohibitively complex or legally risky, AI developers may increasingly turn to publicly available data or explore methods of synthetic data generation. The Evolving Definition of ‘Fair Use’: These lawsuits could ultimately shape the legal definition of ‘fair use’ in the context of AI training, setting precedents for future AI development and copyright law. Uncertainty for Content Creators: Authors and other creators are in a state of uncertainty, seeking clarity and fair compensation for the use of their work in the rapidly expanding AI landscape. The situation remains fluid, and the outcome of the copyright lawsuit against Meta, along with similar cases, will undoubtedly have a profound impact on how AI companies approach generative AI training and their relationship with copyright holders. The pause in book licensing by Meta could be a temporary setback or a sign of a more fundamental shift in strategy as the tech giant navigates these complex legal and ethical waters.
