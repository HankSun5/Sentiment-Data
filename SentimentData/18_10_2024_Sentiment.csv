This bullish momentum is driven by price action and supported by key market data signaling a potential uptrend continuation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Buy Signal Hints At Upside As Funding Rate Keeps Rising Daan, a top crypto analyst, shared crucial insights showing that Bitcoin ETFs have been buying heavily for the past four days. This surge in institutional demand is a positive signal for the market, as it could further propel Bitcoin toward new all-time highs. The next few days will be critical for Bitcoin’s trajectory, with many traders and investors eyeing a potential breakout to historic levels. The anticipation grows as BTC edges closer to these highs, making the upcoming price movements pivotal in shaping the market’s direction. Bitcoin Demand Rising The whole market is buzzing with excitement and volatility, with Bitcoin leading the way by establishing a clear uptrend since early September. Analysts and investors are attributing part of this surge to the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts, but other significant factors influence Bitcoin’s price action. Key data shared by Daan, a top crypto analyst, reveals that Bitcoin ETFs have seen substantial inflows over the past week. The last four trading days alone have witnessed a combined $1.639 billion in inflows, making this week one of the most successful since the inception of Bitcoin ETFs. This surge in institutional demand signals that traditional investors are increasingly confident in Bitcoin’s future, driving up demand and boosting the price. Despite the current optimism, there is caution among market observers. Historically, periods of heightened excitement and euphoria in the market are often followed by price retracements or consolidation. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts XRP Bullish Breakout – A 1,000% Opportunity? Bitcoin tends to mark local tops when sentiment peaks, which could signal a cooling-off period before the next major move. Investors are closely watching for signs of a potential pullback or whether Bitcoin will continue to climb toward new all-time highs in the weeks ahead. Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is trading at $67,000 after a 2% retrace from its recent local top at $68,388. Despite this slight pullback, the price is holding firmly above the previous high of $66,500, signaling a strong consolidation phase that could set the stage for another move higher. For the bullish momentum to continue, BTC must maintain its position above $66,500. If it does, the price could soon push toward new highs. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold above this critical level, a healthy retrace to the daily 200-day moving average (MA) would still indicate strength in the market. The 200-day MA has historically been a reliable support level during uptrends, providing a foundation for further gains.

Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count Now Highest In Over 10 Weeks According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the Bitcoin whales have shown an increase in activity recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Whale Transaction Count,” which keeps track of the total amount of transfers taking place on the BTC blockchain that are carrying a value of at least $100,000. When the value of this metric is high, it means the whales are making a large number of moves on the network right now. Such a trend implies these humongous holders have an active interest in trading the coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Is Negative Despite $68,000 Rally: What It Means On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests the whales may not currently be paying much attention to the cryptocurrency as they aren’t making too many transactions. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count has seen a notable spike recently, suggesting that the whales have made a large amount of transfers. More particularly, these humongous entities made a total of 11,697 transfers in the span of 24 hours at the peak of this spike. Generally, it’s hard to say anything about what sort of transfer activity it is exactly that the whales are participating in based off the Whale Transaction Count alone, since both selling and buying transactions look the same from the perspective of the indicator. The accompanying price action, though, can provide some hints. The latest peak in the metric is the highest that the indicator has gotten since early August. Back then, the spike had coincided with a crash in the asset’s price, implying that a lot of the whales’ moves may have had been for selling. The current increase in the Whale Transaction Count has come as Bitcoin has been rallying, so it’s possible that the whales may be participating in profit-taking again. Since the spike occurred, BTC has slid down under $67,000, which may add evidence for this. In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another BTC metric: the Social Dominance. This indicator basically tells us about the share of social media discussions that Bitcoin is occupying as compared to the total for the top 100 assets in the sector. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Social Dominance has spiked to 25.5% for the cryptocurrency, which is the highest value since late July. Thus, Bitcoin’s mindshare is currently high when compared to that of the altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Greed Is Nearly Here: Will This Lead To A Top? This is usually a sign of fear of missing out (FOMO) among traders. Historically, excessive hype has been a poor sign for BTC, with tops often following it. “Both of these signals are signs that the rally may be on hold due to key stakeholder profit taking and high crowd FOMO,” notes the analytics firm. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,900, up more than 9% over the last week.

Based on their analysis, the long-awaited price breakout for XRP could soon happen. Something Big Is Coming For XRP Price Crypto analyst Amonyx stated in an X post that something big is coming for the XRP price. His accompanying chart showed that the crypto could enjoy a massive rally to $75. The analyst made this prediction based on XRP replicating a similar run that it enjoyed in the 2017 bull run when its price surged by over 61,000%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $130,000 By January, Here’s The Roadmap The chart showed that XRP consolidated for a year before it broke out and enjoyed that unprecedented rally. In line with this, the analyst highlighted how XRP has been consolidating since then, suggesting another price breakout is imminent. Amonyx has recently been more bullish on the XRP price. Before now, he predicted that the crypto would reach between $50 and $57 at the peak of this bull run. However, his recent prediction offers a more bullish outlook for XRP. Interestingly, he also recently predicted that the crypto could enjoy a “giga pump” to $400. These bullish XRP predictions are believed to be partly because of the recent applications by Bitwise and Canary Capital to offer an XRP ETF. These funds could contribute to a significant rally for XRP since they will attract more institutional investors into the coin’s ecosystem. Therefore, these XRP ETFs will positively impact the XRP price just like the Spot Bitcoin ETFs did for the Bitcoin price. Meanwhile, in the short term, Amonyx also expects that the XRP price could enjoy a significant rally. In a recent X post, he shared an XRP/Bitcoin chart and told XRP holders that a God candle was coming soon. XRP’s Breakout Target To Keep An Eye On Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto highlighted $0.61 and $0.62 as the breakout targets to keep an eye on. He noted that the breakout point is getting lower and added that the XRP has a maximum of 70 days left before it reaches the final pinnacle of the breakout point. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Can Port To $86,600 If It Breaks This Level Egrag Crypto further remarked that he is convinced that the price breakout could happen sooner than expected, within the next 15 to 30 days. According to him, the pressure is building and won’t stay contained for much longer. Indeed, XRP’s consolidation dates way back to the 2021 bull run when it failed to reach a new all-time high (ATH). The $0.60 price level has also proven to be strong resistance for the coin, as it has retested and failed to break above it multiple times since Judge Analisa Torres delivered her final judgment in the Ripple SEC lawsuit in August. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $0.55, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

However, recent analysis suggests that the $57,000 level could be one of the most critical support points for the ongoing bull rally.

Related Reading: Analyst Says This Bitcoin Price Rally Has A ‘Different Ring To It’, Places Next Target At $109,000 Bitcoin Resilience At The $57,000 Level Spot ETFs have emerged as a major instrument in the Bitcoin ecosystem, offering a regulated entry point for institutional investors.

This level is pegged at $57,000 and has held firm throughout the year, with only two significant exceptions. The $57,000 price level is significant because of its technical support and the psychological implications for Spot ETF investors.

The first instance was in early August, driven by Japan’s market turbulence, and the second in September due to a sharp price correction. Despite these market shocks, Spot ETF investors did not react with panic selling. Kesmeci wrote: Bitcoin Spot ETF investors proved, contrary to the expectations of many, that they are not weak hands. Foundation Set For Positive Move According to the CryptoQuant analyst, these investors demonstrated resilience by holding onto their investments, even when unrealized losses mounted. Their ability to withstand market pressure contrasts with typical behavior in other speculative sectors, where sudden price drops often lead to mass sell-offs. This suggests that Spot ETF investors have grown more comfortable with Bitcoin’s inherent volatility, recognizing its long-term potential. The analyst highlighted that minor outflows during these turbulent periods were not significant enough to disrupt the broader market. Even during Japan’s “carry trade” crisis, where many expected a stronger market correction, the overall sentiment among Spot ETF investors remained calm. In conclusion, Kesmeci noted: As you can see from the chart above, the average cost of Bitcoin Spot ETFs has become perhaps the most crucial support level in the 2024 bull rally. With this long-term perspective, the contribution of Spot ETFs to the Bitcoin rally has laid a solid foundation for the potential developments in the market’s future.

Reverse ‘Kimchi Premium’ Makes Bitcoin Cheaper In South Korea According to a report by The Korea Times, there is a price differential of more than $500 between Bitcoin’s price in South Korea and global markets. Analysts attribute this to a negative ‘kimchi premium.’ Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Market Shift: Are We Near A Major Sell-Off? For the uninitiated, kimchi premium refers to the price difference where BTC trades at a higher price on South Korean exchanges than on global markets. This premium is driven by local demand, regulatory factors, and capital controls in South Korea, leading to occasional price discrepancies. Currently, the kimchi premium stands at -0.74%, leading to a lower market price for BTC on South Korean exchanges than the rest of the world. Notably, the kimchi premium has been negative since October 15. A positive premium indicates strong demand for the underlying digital asset. In contrast, a negative premium might suggest that investors may be looking to trade on foreign exchanges due to South Korea’s stringent regulations surrounding digital assets. A positive Kimchi Premium is common on South Korean exchanges, which often experience high trading volumes. When BTC briefly crossed $72,000 in March 2024, the kimchi premium surged as high as 10%. The report suggests low domestic investor sentiment is a key factor behind the negative premium. While global crypto trading volumes have surged due to the upcoming US presidential elections and a Chinese stimulus package, sentiment in South Korea remains lukewarm. KP Jang, head of Xangle Research, commented: Korea prohibits foreign and institutional investors from using domestic exchanges, which makes the decline in retail investor demand a more direct factor. Further, the preference for typically riskier altcoins in hopes of extraordinary profits might influence the local South Korean crypto market, driving attention away from BTC and leading to lower trading volumes. That said, analysts expect the negative kimchi premium to be a temporary phenomenon. Jang explained that, historically, such price discrepancies have only persisted for a short period. Will A Regulatory Overhaul Help South Korea? The crypto regulatory framework in the peninsular country is witnessing several changes to streamline digital asset trading and ensure sufficient customer protection mechanisms are in place. Related Reading: South Korean Authorities Investigate Lawmaker Over Alleged Crypto Transfers In 2022, South Korea elected pro-crypto Yoon Suk-Yeol as president. As part of his election campaign, Yoon promised to reduce government interference in crypto markets, calling existing regulations “far from reality and absurd.” In contrast, neighboring Japan has openly embraced digital assets amid evolving crypto regulations. For instance, earlier this year, Japan’s Government Investment Pension Fund (GIPF), with $1.5 trillion in assets, expressed a desire to gain exposure to BTC. BTC trades at $67,559 at press time, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours. When writing, the leading cryptocurrency commands a total market cap of $1.33 trillion.

However, despite this, some positive signs may be on the horizon. According to a CryptoQuant analyst, Percival, Ethereum’s open interest has increased significantly, indicating rising investor optimism for a potential rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Are Quietly Accumulating—Is A Major Price Breakout Coming? Potential For Ethereum Rally And Longs Benefit According to the data shared by Percival, Ethereum’s open interest stands at $9.6 billion, marking a 28.57% increase from August, although it is still below the $13 billion recorded in June. The rise in open interest points to expectations of an upward price movement, with many traders positioning themselves for increased demand. Percival noted that several factors, including potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and a growing focus on the future of tokenization on the Ethereum blockchain, may fuel this uptick. This shift could drive more interest toward decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, making Ethereum more attractive for investors looking for long-term gains. Percival also highlighted that Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 61, suggesting that the market is overheated. A “convergence” between open interest and RSI levels indicates that price corrections will likely be short-lived, providing opportunities for traders to position themselves for a market rebound. The analyst estimated that Ethereum may experience a correction of around 7% to 9% before rallying again, favoring long positions as traders await a potential rise in both price and demand. The analyst particularly wrote in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform: The convergence of the highest lows in the RSI suggests a potential for a less pronounced correction, estimated to be between 7% and 9%. This scenario favors long positions, with traders patiently waiting for a market rebound to confirm new highs and higher lows. ETH’s Path To A Bullish Breakout At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,611, down slightly by 0.1% in the past 24 hours. This comes after a strong week where the cryptocurrency saw a 9.3% increase and a nearly 15% rise over the past month. According to another prominent crypto analyst, Ali, Ethereum could be on the verge of a significant rally. In a recent post on X, Ali revealed that Ethereum has recently touched the lower boundary of a channel, a level that has historically led to an average 130% price surge. Related Reading: Crypto Watch: Ethereum Poised for Upside Break! According to Ali, should this pattern continue to hold, Ethereum could potentially climb to $6,000 as long as it maintains its key support level of $2,300. Every bounce off this channel’s lower boundary has historically led to an average 130% price increase for #Ethereum. If this pattern holds, a similar move could push $ETH to $6,000—provided the key $2,300 support level stays intact. pic.twitter.com/CFpLrQWEih — Ali (@ali_charts) October 14, 2024 So far, despite ETH’s market’s volatility, the asset has managed to maintain its price above the critical $2,300 support level, which lends credibility to the theory that a bullish breakout could be on the way.

The price is trading above $2,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $2,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it clears the $2,650 and $2,680 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Aims For More Upsides Ethereum price remained stable above the $2,550 pivot level like Bitcoin. ETH corrected some gains and tested the $2,550 support level. Recently, it started a fresh increase above the $2,580 and $2,600 resistance levels. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,685 swing high to the $2,538 low. The bulls were able to push the price above the $2,620 resistance zone. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $2,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,650 level. It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,685 swing high to the $2,538 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,685 level. A clear move above the $2,685 resistance might send the price toward the $2,750 resistance. An upside break above the $2,750 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,840 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,880 level or $2,920. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,650 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,600 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $2,570 zone. A clear move below the $2,570 support might push the price toward $2,550. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,480 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,420.

There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5465 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5465 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5465 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.

A clear move above the $0.5650 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5880 resistance or even $0.5925 in the near term.

Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.3460 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. Cardano price is now trading below $0.350 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.3515 zone. The first resistance is near $0.3550 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3705 swing high to the $0.3394 low. The next key resistance might be $0.3620. If there is a close above the $0.3620 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.3700 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.3880. More Downsides in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.350 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.3420 level. The next major support is near the $0.3400 level. A downside break below the $0.3400 level could open the doors for a test of $0.3220.

Historically, October has been a strong month for BTC, and recent trends suggest that the cryptocurrency may be on the verge of a substantial upward movement. Over the past week alone, the Bitcoin price has surged more than 13%, approaching its all-time high of $73,700 set in March of this year. Increased Global Liquidity And Low Supply Deutscher notes that Bitcoin has been consolidating above critical support levels for much of the year, positioning it for potential expansion. Despite numerous failed breakouts in the past, which have led to a general distrust among traders, the analyst believes that this environment may create an opportunity for a significant price increase. Many retail investors remain sidelined, as indicated by Bitcoin’s current ranking on Coinbase and declining Google search interest in the cryptocurrency. This may suggests that the market force known as fear of missing out (FOMO), has yet to set in among investors. Related Reading: BNB Rejection At Key Level Hints At A Potential Price Correction The macroeconomic backdrop also supports Bitcoin’s potential for further gains. Increased global liquidity—now at its highest level in three years—has historically influenced Bitcoin’s price positively. Deutscher also emphasizes that as equity markets begin to recover, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, often correlating closely with the S&P 500. Additionally, Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has reached an all-time low, suggesting that a supply squeeze may be imminent. The analyst contends that this trend indicates that fewer BTC are available for trading, which could drive prices higher as demand increases. October To April As ‘Boom Period’ For Bitcoin Deutscher also emphasized in his analysis the upcoming US presidential election, which he believes adds another layer of complexity to the market. The analyst speculates that a victory for former President Donald Trump could lead to favorable market reactions, with Bitcoin potentially positioned as “a pillar of US financial stability.” The Republican candidate has made a number of promises, the most notable being plans to make Bitcoin a reserve asset for the country, with the aim of using it to reduce the $35 trillion national debt, further supported by pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis.

Deutscher explains that the period from October to April 2025 is traditionally seen as a “boom period” for cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin needs to break out of its current range—potentially facing resistance around $70,000—Deutscher believes this breakout is likely, especially given the substantial short interest in Bitcoin. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $66,940, down 1.5% in the 24 hour time frame, as it has encountered significant resistance at the $68,000 level, preventing it from tackling the biggest resistance yet at $70,000.
