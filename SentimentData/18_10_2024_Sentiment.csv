This bullish momentum is driven by price action and supported by key market data signaling a potential uptrend continuation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Buy Signal Hints At Upside As Funding Rate Keeps Rising Daan, a top crypto analyst, shared crucial insights showing that Bitcoin ETFs have been buying heavily for the past four days. This surge in institutional demand is a positive signal for the market, as it could further propel Bitcoin toward new all-time highs. The next few days will be critical for Bitcoin’s trajectory, with many traders and investors eyeing a potential breakout to historic levels. The anticipation grows as BTC edges closer to these highs, making the upcoming price movements pivotal in shaping the market’s direction. Bitcoin Demand Rising The whole market is buzzing with excitement and volatility, with Bitcoin leading the way by establishing a clear uptrend since early September. Analysts and investors are attributing part of this surge to the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts, but other significant factors influence Bitcoin’s price action. Key data shared by Daan, a top crypto analyst, reveals that Bitcoin ETFs have seen substantial inflows over the past week. The last four trading days alone have witnessed a combined $1.639 billion in inflows, making this week one of the most successful since the inception of Bitcoin ETFs. This surge in institutional demand signals that traditional investors are increasingly confident in Bitcoin’s future, driving up demand and boosting the price. Despite the current optimism, there is caution among market observers. Historically, periods of heightened excitement and euphoria in the market are often followed by price retracements or consolidation. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts XRP Bullish Breakout – A 1,000% Opportunity? Bitcoin tends to mark local tops when sentiment peaks, which could signal a cooling-off period before the next major move. Investors are closely watching for signs of a potential pullback or whether Bitcoin will continue to climb toward new all-time highs in the weeks ahead. Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is trading at $67,000 after a 2% retrace from its recent local top at $68,388. Despite this slight pullback, the price is holding firmly above the previous high of $66,500, signaling a strong consolidation phase that could set the stage for another move higher. For the bullish momentum to continue, BTC must maintain its position above $66,500. If it does, the price could soon push toward new highs. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold above this critical level, a healthy retrace to the daily 200-day moving average (MA) would still indicate strength in the market. The 200-day MA has historically been a reliable support level during uptrends, providing a foundation for further gains.

Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count Now Highest In Over 10 Weeks According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the Bitcoin whales have shown an increase in activity recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Whale Transaction Count,” which keeps track of the total amount of transfers taking place on the BTC blockchain that are carrying a value of at least $100,000. When the value of this metric is high, it means the whales are making a large number of moves on the network right now. Such a trend implies these humongous holders have an active interest in trading the coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Is Negative Despite $68,000 Rally: What It Means On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests the whales may not currently be paying much attention to the cryptocurrency as they aren’t making too many transactions. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count has seen a notable spike recently, suggesting that the whales have made a large amount of transfers. More particularly, these humongous entities made a total of 11,697 transfers in the span of 24 hours at the peak of this spike. Generally, it’s hard to say anything about what sort of transfer activity it is exactly that the whales are participating in based off the Whale Transaction Count alone, since both selling and buying transactions look the same from the perspective of the indicator. The accompanying price action, though, can provide some hints. The latest peak in the metric is the highest that the indicator has gotten since early August. Back then, the spike had coincided with a crash in the asset’s price, implying that a lot of the whales’ moves may have had been for selling. The current increase in the Whale Transaction Count has come as Bitcoin has been rallying, so it’s possible that the whales may be participating in profit-taking again. Since the spike occurred, BTC has slid down under $67,000, which may add evidence for this. In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another BTC metric: the Social Dominance. This indicator basically tells us about the share of social media discussions that Bitcoin is occupying as compared to the total for the top 100 assets in the sector. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Social Dominance has spiked to 25.5% for the cryptocurrency, which is the highest value since late July. Thus, Bitcoin’s mindshare is currently high when compared to that of the altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Greed Is Nearly Here: Will This Lead To A Top? This is usually a sign of fear of missing out (FOMO) among traders. Historically, excessive hype has been a poor sign for BTC, with tops often following it. “Both of these signals are signs that the rally may be on hold due to key stakeholder profit taking and high crowd FOMO,” notes the analytics firm. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,900, up more than 9% over the last week.

Based on their analysis, the long-awaited price breakout for XRP could soon happen. Something Big Is Coming For XRP Price Crypto analyst Amonyx stated in an X post that something big is coming for the XRP price. His accompanying chart showed that the crypto could enjoy a massive rally to $75. The analyst made this prediction based on XRP replicating a similar run that it enjoyed in the 2017 bull run when its price surged by over 61,000%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $130,000 By January, Here’s The Roadmap The chart showed that XRP consolidated for a year before it broke out and enjoyed that unprecedented rally. In line with this, the analyst highlighted how XRP has been consolidating since then, suggesting another price breakout is imminent. Amonyx has recently been more bullish on the XRP price. Before now, he predicted that the crypto would reach between $50 and $57 at the peak of this bull run. However, his recent prediction offers a more bullish outlook for XRP. Interestingly, he also recently predicted that the crypto could enjoy a “giga pump” to $400. These bullish XRP predictions are believed to be partly because of the recent applications by Bitwise and Canary Capital to offer an XRP ETF. These funds could contribute to a significant rally for XRP since they will attract more institutional investors into the coin’s ecosystem. Therefore, these XRP ETFs will positively impact the XRP price just like the Spot Bitcoin ETFs did for the Bitcoin price. Meanwhile, in the short term, Amonyx also expects that the XRP price could enjoy a significant rally. In a recent X post, he shared an XRP/Bitcoin chart and told XRP holders that a God candle was coming soon. XRP’s Breakout Target To Keep An Eye On Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto highlighted $0.61 and $0.62 as the breakout targets to keep an eye on. He noted that the breakout point is getting lower and added that the XRP has a maximum of 70 days left before it reaches the final pinnacle of the breakout point. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Can Port To $86,600 If It Breaks This Level Egrag Crypto further remarked that he is convinced that the price breakout could happen sooner than expected, within the next 15 to 30 days. According to him, the pressure is building and won’t stay contained for much longer. Indeed, XRP’s consolidation dates way back to the 2021 bull run when it failed to reach a new all-time high (ATH). The $0.60 price level has also proven to be strong resistance for the coin, as it has retested and failed to break above it multiple times since Judge Analisa Torres delivered her final judgment in the Ripple SEC lawsuit in August. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $0.55, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
