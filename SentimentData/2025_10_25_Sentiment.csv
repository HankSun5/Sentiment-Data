This is the second time SpaceX has moved its Bitcoin holdings within a week. Just a few days earlier, the company transferred $268 million worth of BTC into new wallets.

SpaceX, along with Tesla , started accumulating Bitcoin in 2020-2021. A year later, Elon Musk began advocating cryptocurrencies. That was during the previous crypto bull run. The entrepreneur consistently endorsed Dogecoin and Bitcoin. Around that time, Tesla announced it would begin accepting Bitcoin as payment from electric vehicle buyers. But after about three to four months, Tesla scrapped those plans due to Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact. Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. But the EV maker later sold a major portion of its BTC holdings. It originally held around 48,000 BTC and sold 75% of its position in 2022. Tesla missed out on billions of dollars by selling BTC early. As of today, Tesla holds 11,509 BTC, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. SpaceX , on the other hand, has not made any major Bitcoin purchases or sales since 2022. The company has not officially disclosed its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. In other related news, the US government has moved a bunch of coins seized from Alameda Research over 2 years ago. It moved $1 worth of Viberate token, $36 of OCEAN tokens, and $60 of HOT tokens. Bitcoin is currently trading at $111,017, with a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion and a trading volume of $50 billion. Ether is standing at $3,940 and has been struggling to break over the $4,000 barrier over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s dominance is standing strong at 57.7%, while Ethereum has a 12.4% share of the crypto market. The overall market sentiment is labeled fear-based on the Crypto Fear and Greed Index. The crypto market is still trying to recover after the recent market crash due to Trump’s tariff hit on China, which caused massive liquidations across exchanges.

As the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting approaches, traders have turned cautious, awaiting signs of potential monetary easing that could rekindle investor appetite for risk assets. Despite short-term volatility, seasoned analysts interpret the recent downturn as a constructive correction, noting that steep pullbacks often flush out speculative leverage and pave the way for more sustainable long-term growth. Solana (SOL): Claude Forecasts a Challenge to ATH Firstly, Solana ($SOL) continues to establish itself as a leading smart contract platform, commanding a market cap exceeding $104 billion and around $11.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) within its DeFi ecosystem. Source: Microsoft Copilot Market speculation is building that U.S. regulators may approve a spot Solana ETF before month’s end, a decision that could spur significant institutional inflows, echoing the post-ETF surges seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana is also well-positioned to benefit from emerging trends such as real-world asset tokenization and the expansion of stablecoin infrastructure, both gaining institutional traction. With faster transaction speeds and lower fees than Ethereum, Solana remains one of the most promising candidates for large-scale adoption. After peaking at $250 in January and dipping to $100 in April, SOL now trades near $191, signaling renewed upside potential. With an RSI around 45 and trading just below its 30-day moving average, the token appears undervalued. Following a breakout from a bullish flag pattern, Claude estimates Solana could reach as high as $290 by month end, perhaps even beating its previous all-time high of $293.31 set back in January. XRP ($XRP): Claude Predicts a Potential Surge Toward $10 Claude AI’s data models suggest that Ripple’s native asset, XRP ($XRP) , could see a sharp rally, potentially climbing to between $5 and $10 by the close of the year, quadrupling its current price of about $2.49. Ripple’s decisive legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year concluded a five-year court battle, revitalizing investor confidence and propelling XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 on July 18. Over the past 12 months, XRP has soared 369%, far surpassing Bitcoin’s 63% and Ethereum’s 55% gains. Technical indicators highlight three notable bullish flag patterns in 2025, two of which appeared in the summer, often a precursor to significant upward movement. The sudden arrive of a string of high-profile spot XRP ETF approvals, improved regulatory clarity, or a surprise new business partnership on Ripple’s part may drive XRP over the $5 mark, with $10 representing an unlikely but plausible extreme bull case scenario. Binance Coin (BNB): Copilot AI Sees Expanding Dominance Originally launched as a utility token for Binance, Binance Coin ($BNB) has evolved into a versatile asset supporting a diverse ecosystem that includes NFTs, decentralized applications, and payment services. BNB’s deflationary mechanism, sustained through Binance’s periodic token burns, continues to bolster its long-term price stability by systematically reducing circulating supply. Beyond Binance’s own platforms, BNB’s utility has expanded globally, now accepted by merchants across various industries, from gaming to travel. This widespread adoption has firmly cemented BNB’s place among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Earlier this month, BNB broke out of a bullish pennant formation and hit an all-time high of $1,369.99 before retreating roughly 19%. With its RSI now hovering around 50, the token appears to be consolidating. Should bullish momentum resume, Copilot AI projects BNB could advance toward $1,600 by month-end, with a key support range between $580 and $1,000 if another correction unfolds. Missed Dogecoin? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI): The Next-Gen Meme Coin With Degen Energy Finally, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a fresh entrant in the meme coin sector, has launched its presale, already securing more than $3.7 million from investors eager to join the next viral crypto wave. Marketed as Dogecoin’s “high-octane cousin,” Maxi Doge channels the humor, energy, and community spirit of crypto’s degen culture, emphasizing engagement, viral memes, and grassroots participation. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI delivers faster, more efficient, and eco-friendly transactions compared to the dated tech of Dogecoin. Its marketing strategy leverages Telegram and Discord events, trading competitions, and influencer collaborations to build early momentum. Of the 150.24 billion total token supply, 25% is reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” supporting marketing, ecosystem development, and partnerships. Staking is already live, offering yields of up to 81%APY, a rate that will gradually decline as more participants stake their tokens. Currently, MAXI’s presale price sits at $0.0002645, with incremental increases tied to funding milestones. Purchases can be made using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Within mere days, prices tumbled sharply following President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, sparking a broad shift toward risk aversion ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting. Still, many market observers view the pullback as a natural correction, a period of consolidation purging excessive leverage and weaker positions before a more durable advance. Below are three altcoins that continue to show notable upside potential. Ripple (XRP): Poised to Dominate Global Payments in 2025 Ripple’s token, XRP ($XRP) , underpins a high-speed, low-cost payment protocol designed as a modern alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Backed by partnerships with the UN Capital Development Fund and several leading U.S. financial institutions, XRP has grown into the world’s fifth-largest digital asset, boasting a market capitalization of just over $149 billion. The company’s launch of its own stablecoin, RLUSD, signals an ambition to secure a significant share of the booming stablecoin sector. Over the past 12 months, XRP’s value has soared 369%, hitting a seven-year high of $3.65 in mid-July and far outpacing Bitcoin’s 63% gain during the same stretch. With a relative strength index (RSI) around 44 and trading below its 30-day moving average, XRP is likely trading at a discount and preparing for a festive breakout. Technical patterns show two bullish flag formations during the summer, suggesting room for further appreciation if ETF approvals arrive by mid-October. Passage of comprehensive U.S. crypto regulation could propel XRP toward the $5–$10 range. Zcash (ZEC): Privacy Coin Spikes 147% in a Single Week Launched in 2016 as a Bitcoin offshoot, Zcash ($ZEC) was created to prioritize one thing above all: user privacy. It utilizes zk-SNARKs (“zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge”), an advanced cryptographic method allowing transactions to be validated without revealing sender, recipient, or transaction details. Zcash employs a dual-address structure, giving users the choice between fully transparent and shielded transactions, a balance between privacy and regulatory compliance. In the past week, ZEC has jumped 19% to $255, outperforming every top 100 crypto. While most leading tokens declined, fellow privacy crypto Monero ($XMR) also rose sharply, adding 15% to its price. ZEC’s RSI currently sits near 63 and is downtrending as traders secure profits from the last week. If momentum persists and fundamentals strengthen, prices could hit $500 by year’s end. Story ($IP): Redefining the Creator Economy On Chain. Story ($IP) hopes to blaze a trail in the industry’s nascent intellectual property sector. Positioned as the world’s first Layer-1 blockchain built specifically for IP creation and monetization, Story enables creators, brands, and developers to transform ideas into tokenized assets with real, on-chain ownership. Story is unique for its end-to-end ecosystem: from minting and licensing creative works to building entire franchises that thrive within its decentralized network. As Web3 expands beyond finance into entertainment and culture, Story is a project that provides a new crossroads for art, technology, and ownership to realise the true extent of blockchain’s potential. With its token, $IP, powering governance, staking, and creative economies, early adopters see it as the next big narrative in crypto. Story rose 4% in the last 24 hours, and with a low RSI of 38, positive market momentum gives it plenty of headroom to lock in more aggressive profits quickly. That said, from its current price of $5.41, there will be sticky resistance around $10 and $1,5 but if it clears this and the market enters a bull cycle, Story can manage an easy 10x by the end of the year. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The Meme-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 Presale of 2025 Finally, a rising star in the crypto scene, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , is among 2025’s most talked-about presales. It combines Bitcoin’s renowned security with Layer-2 scalability and the viral excitement of meme culture. HYPER enhances Bitcoin’s network with faster transaction speeds, decentralized DAO-based governance, and expanded smart contract capabilities through a dedicated Layer-2 framework. The project has already attracted more than $24.7 million in presale funding, and analysts predict post-launch gains that could exceed 10x. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), the HYPER ecosystem includes a lightning-fast Canonical Bridge for BTC transfers, decentralized app (dApp) integration, and built-in meme coin functionality. An independent Coinsult audit reported zero vulnerabilities, reinforcing investor confidence. HYPER tokens fuel every part of the ecosystem, from governance and staking to transaction fees, with staking rewards currently offering up to 48% APY for early participants.

Some analysts suggest that ETF inflows have aided in cooling sentiment, and institutional investors are buying again. The question now is whether Ethereum can continue moving above $3850 and extend its recovery. With the focus shifting from Ethereum, HYPE, and DOT are currently some of the best altcoins to buy right now . Both projects continue to draw in investors because of strong network activity and growing developer ecosystems. Joining the list is MAGACOIN FINANCE , noted by analysts for its utility-oriented model and active community development, both elements that have solidified its position at the base of the pyramid. Ethereum Holds Above $3,850 as ETF Inflows Support Sentiment Ethereum is still trading close to $3,836, after a subsequent recovery from volatility last week. Resurgent ETF flows provide a positive sign for bulls, but traders are cautious about macro uncertainty. According to analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum ETFs saw $141.7 million in inflows on October 21, with BlackRock and Fidelity making up over $101 million of the total. It was the largest daily flow since early October and was a much-needed sentiment booster after a few sessions of volatile demand. Source: X Even with greater inflows, ETH is still below its 50-day EMA at $3,968 and the 100-day EMA at $4,063. Analysts say that to confirm institutional support has stepped in, prices have to remain close to these levels for sustained periods. HYPE and DOT Lead Analyst Rankings Among the Best Altcoins to Buy Hyperliquid (HYPE) continued to experience significant volatility in recent sessions as the overall altcoin market adjusts. Despite the volatility over the short term, analysts continue to rank Hype as one of the best altcoins to buy now, due to its large investors renewing their accumulation. CryptoQuant data indicates a bullish turn on HYPE, with whales adding to long positions, positioning themselves ahead of a potential recovery. Analysts view this as an indication of confidence in the project’s structure and rebound potential following an improvement in market liquidity. At the same time, Polkadot (DOT) is also improving its network fundamentals. Crypto.com’s addition of USDT and USDC transfers through Polkadot’s Asset Hub has opened up access and liquidity opportunities for users. This advancement ensures that DOT continues its current trend of playing a major role in cross-chain interoperability while establishing itself as one of the most useful utility-driven altcoins within analyst rankings. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Attention for Utility and Community Growth Additionally, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also making a name for itself in its emphasis on utility and community. Analysts point out that the project’s utilization of its native crypto token in decentralized applications is a looming force. Besides utility, the project has had a very active community to ensure its growth in each phase of development of the project. Regular updates, clear communication, and regular involvement have helped foster long-term engagement among holders. This practical utility and community have placed MAGACOIN FINANCE side by side with other major altcoins like HYPE and DOT. Analysts believe that it is among the best altcoins to buy for investors, considering projects that have tangible and user-driven ecosystems. Conclusion Ethereum’s consistent trading above $3,850 reflects the impact of institutional inflows and renewed investor participation. Traders note this stability could provide a platform for market confidence if ETF demand continues to increase. The strength of the asset’s resilience sends a message to investors that they still see it as a crucial anchor to hold on to whenever there are waves in the markets.

The entire crypto market has been relatively steady, and XRP has managed to maintain its footing above $2.20. Despite the slow momentum, a technical analysis shared by the crypto analyst known as ChartNerd on X suggests that XRP could be preparing for a massive breakout that could take it from current levels toward a long-term target above $27. The analysis is supported by a chart showing multiple confluences aligning in favor of such a large-scale move. XRP Technical Analysis Points To Rally According to ChartNerd’s chart, XRP has now completed a symmetrical triangle breakout pattern that has been forming for several years. This breakout is occurring above a multi-year ascending support line that dates back to 2017. The chart also shows an important resistance block that previously capped XRP’s price during earlier bull runs in 2017 and 2021. Related Reading: XRP Price Teleport To $6: What Happens When The Euphoric Phase Begin XRP broke above this resistance block months ago, but recently retested it during last week’s flash crash. Its rebound from this resistance block reinforces the idea that XRP is about to bounce massively. The breakout from this long-term consolidation zone, combined with the multi-year ascending trendline, provides the technical foundation for a potential move toward much higher price targets. Another important confirmation that occurred during the flash crash was the successful retest of the 3-month 10 EMA. This retest serves as a validation point for the recent breakout, showing that XRP is maintaining its structure on higher timeframes. Furthermore, the analysis shows that XRP has reclaimed the Gaussian Channel upper regression line, which represents long-term trend momentum. This alignment of the EMA retest with the Gaussian Channel suggests strong bullish momentum is beginning to build. ChartNerd refers to this convergence of multiple indicators as a “confluence zone.” Fibonacci Extension Targets From $8 To $27 The analysis concludes with a clearly defined Fibonacci extension roadmap that outlines XRP’s next price objectives. ChartNerd’s Fibonacci levels place the first major target at $8.47, corresponding to the 1.272 extension, followed by $13.78 at the 1.414 level, and finally the 1.618 extension at $27.70. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors That A Supply Squeeze Is Coming And What It Means For Price This sequence implies a full technical replication of XRP’s bull run in 2017, scaled to its current breakout structure. Back then, XRP hit all three Fibonacci extensions from the previous low after breaking above a similar resistance block. If these projections materialize, XRP could experience its most significant rally in years. The move toward $27 could unfold in one of two ways: either through a strong, near-vertical surge similar to the explosive rally of 2017 or through a series of measured advances highlighted by corrections at each resistance level. Nonetheless, both scenarios have the same bullish structure. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.44, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

Ancient Bitcoin Whale Has Broken A 14.3 Years Long Silence According to data from cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert , a dormant wallet with a massive amount of Bitcoin has just woken up. The address in question contained 4,000 BTC before its transaction on Friday. Blockchain history shows this wallet collected the 4,000 BTC through mining rewards in 2011, implying the owner was an early miner. Back then, the block subsidy (the reward miners get for adding a new block to the chain) was worth 50 BTC, so it took the miner 80 blocks to assemble the stack. Today, after four Halving events, the block subsidy has dropped to 3.125 BTC, so a miner could need to mine 1,280 blocks to procure the same amount (though, in practice, it would take fewer blocks due to transaction fees also playing a role now). When the miner received the tokens about 14 years ago, they were worth just $67,724. The same stack is today worth more than $440 million, meaning that the whale was sitting on a profit of a whopping 650,000% when they reactivated the wallet. The dormancy-breaking Bitcoin transaction involved a sum of 150 BTC ($16.6 million at transfer time), as the details below from Whale Alert show. It’s possible that the move may have been to realize some of the profit that the Bitcoin wallet has accumulated over its long life. So far, this 150 BTC transaction is the only withdrawal that the whale has made, so it remains to be seen whether more transfers will follow. As for who’s behind the transaction, it’s hard to say anything for sure. Usually, wallets that grow this old without spending do so by becoming lost. That is, by having their existence forgotten or keys misplaced. It could be that the original owner rediscovered the wallet, or someone else obtained its keys, whether by chance or by taking advantage of a vulnerability that the wallet software from that era could possess. Or, in a more unlikely scenario, the miner behind the address could just be a hardcore HODLer . Speaking of transactions involving dormant coins, this year has seen a record-breaking number of them, as an analyst noted in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post . “In 2025, Bitcoin movements of coins dormant for 7+ years have already exceeded 2024 levels, and there are still two months left,” noted the quant. So far, 2025 has seen 270,000 BTC move after being inactive for more than seven years, so by year’s end, the record could grow to 300,000 BTC.

Over 1 million SOL tokens, valued at a staggering $213 million, have been moved from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a whale-sized move that has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike, sparking numerous questions about its potential impact on the Solana ecosystem and the broader crypto market. What Exactly Happened with This SOL Transfer? Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracking service, first reported this massive SOL transfer . Specifically, 1,097,732 SOL tokens departed from Coinbase Institutional. This entity typically serves large corporations and high-net-worth individuals, providing secure crypto services. The transaction involved a substantial amount: nearly 1.1 million SOL. Its value stands at approximately $213 million, making it one of the largest single SOL transfers in recent times. The destination remains undisclosed, labeled simply as an “unknown wallet.” Such large movements often signal strategic shifts or significant market plays by major players, commonly referred to as “whales.” Therefore, understanding the context of this SOL transfer is crucial for anyone monitoring the crypto landscape. Why Does a Large SOL Transfer Matter to the Market? When a substantial amount of any cryptocurrency, especially one with a significant market cap like Solana (SOL), moves from an institutional exchange to an unknown wallet, it inevitably creates ripples. This particular SOL transfer carries several implications: Firstly, it could indicate a potential sale. If the tokens are being moved to a personal wallet to be held, that’s one scenario. However, if they are being prepared for over-the-counter (OTC) deals or a future dump on exchanges, it could exert downward pressure on SOL’s price. Consequently, traders are watching closely for subsequent movements from the unknown wallet. Secondly, it highlights the increasing involvement of institutional money in the crypto space. Coinbase Institutional facilitates these large-scale transactions, suggesting that significant capital is actively flowing in and out of digital assets. This institutional activity can often lend legitimacy and stability to the market, but also introduces new dynamics. Who Could Be Behind This Mysterious SOL Transfer? The identity of the whale behind this particular SOL transfer remains a mystery, fueling speculation across the crypto community. Several possibilities exist: An institutional investor: A hedge fund, a venture capital firm, or even a corporate treasury could be rebalancing its portfolio or making a strategic investment. A large individual investor: A high-net-worth individual, perhaps an early adopter or a tech mogul, might be consolidating assets or preparing for a private sale. An exchange moving funds: Although less likely from an “institutional” arm to an “unknown” wallet, sometimes exchanges move funds for operational purposes. However, the scale suggests a more deliberate action. Understanding the “who” behind such a significant SOL transfer would provide invaluable insight into market sentiment and future trends for Solana. What Are the Potential Impacts on Solana and Beyond? The immediate impact of this SOL transfer is primarily felt in market sentiment. News of large whale movements can trigger anxiety among retail investors, leading to increased volatility. If the tokens were to be sold, a sudden influx of supply could drive prices down. Moreover, this event underscores the opaque nature of some aspects of the crypto market. While blockchain provides transparency in transactions, the identities behind the wallets often remain anonymous. This anonymity is a double-edged sword, offering privacy but also making it challenging to interpret the intentions behind such colossal moves. Looking ahead, the market will be keenly observing the destination wallet. Any further movements, especially to known exchange wallets, would be critical indicators of the whale’s intentions. This SOL transfer serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. In conclusion, the $213 million SOL transfer from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet is more than just a large transaction; it’s a pivotal moment that prompts crucial questions about institutional involvement, market dynamics, and the future trajectory of Solana. As the crypto space continues to mature, these whale movements will remain a fascinating and influential aspect of its evolution. Staying informed about such significant events is paramount for navigating the ever-changing tides of digital assets.

The company said in its third-quarter earnings that “if control of Nexperia cannot be restored before the end of 2025, the company may face temporary downward pressure on revenue, profit and cash flow.” This warning came alongside stronger-than-expected quarterly results, with semiconductor revenue up 12.2% compared to the same period last year. Wingtech, headquartered in Jiaxing, said demand across its semiconductor lines remained strong during the quarter, but acknowledged that the ongoing political conflict with the Netherlands makes future growth hard to predict. The company admitted that the Nexperia situation is now a major uncertainty for its chip business, both financially and operationally. Dutch seizure of Nexperia follows U.S. pressure The Dutch state moved to seize Nexperia in September, after pushback from the United States over concerns that the chipmaker might not be acting independently of its Chinese parent. Washington reportedly told Nexperia it would need to fire its Chinese CEO to avoid getting added to the U.S. sanctions list. Wingtech, led by Chairman Zhang Xuezheng, was already added to the U.S. Entity List in 2024, a move that restricts American firms from doing business with it. The decision to take over Nexperia shocked the global auto industry. The company is a key supplier of semiconductors used in vehicles built by Volkswagen and other manufacturers. A Bloomberg report cited unnamed auto executives warning that chip shortages could start disrupting supply chains within a week. They estimated that the impact would ripple through the entire sector in less than three weeks if the standoff continues. China’s Commerce Minister called the Dutch action one that has “seriously affected” global supply chain stability.Dutch authorities responded by saying they’re staying in contact with Beijing to work “toward a constructive solution.”But behind the scenes, pressure is rising. The European Union’s trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said on Tuesday that both countries are “in frequent contact” and “fully aware the time is of the essence here.” He made the statement after a video call with his Chinese counterpart at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Nexperia raised red flags before the takeover European auto giants claim they were blindsided by the action against Nexperia, but legal filings show red flags were raised in late 2023. Executives at the company had contacted the Dutch economic ministry over fears that its ownership structure, being tied to Wingtech since 2019, could pose a regulatory risk. At that point, Dutch officials already considered Nexperia a Chinese-controlled entity. Multiple meetings took place between the Dutch government and Nexperia management. The two sides agreed on governance reforms, including the creation of a supervisory board. Nexperia also offered to add a Western minority shareholder to ease national security fears. Those talks were still in progress when the U.S. dropped its sanctions hammer on Wingtech, throwing a wrench in any possible compromise. Now, Wingtech is stuck in limbo. The company said it will keep pushing to restore full control of Nexperia, but admitted the situation could drag well into 2026. Despite having diversified chip products and strong quarterly demand, the fight over Nexperia’s future is overshadowing everything else. Meanwhile, China responded with new restrictions on the export of rare earths and other critical materials. When asked about it, Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson Wang Wentao said the move was a “normal” effort to tighten its export control system. He added that China is still allowing approvals for EU companies. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This isn’t just speculation; it’s a compelling estimate from financial giant JPMorgan, centered around the potential launch of a native Coinbase Base token for its Layer 2 network. This development could fundamentally reshape Coinbase’s financial landscape, creating entirely new revenue streams beyond its current reliance on USDC and on-chain transaction fees. What is the Value Proposition of a Coinbase Base Token? JPMorgan’s analysis, as reported by The Block, highlights a significant opportunity. By introducing a dedicated Coinbase Base token , the exchange could directly monetize the burgeoning success of its Layer 2 network, Base. This strategic move is seen as a powerful way to tap into the network’s rapid growth and cement Coinbase’s position in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. Currently, Coinbase generates revenue from various sources, including trading fees, subscription services, and its stake in USDC. However, a native token for Base would introduce a fresh, substantial income stream. Think of it as a direct stake in the prosperity of the Base network itself, allowing Coinbase to benefit directly from its adoption and utility. How Has Base Network Achieved Such Rapid Growth? The Base network, launched in August 2023, has quickly emerged as a formidable player in the Layer 2 space. Its impressive growth is underscored by its total value locked (TVL), which has now surpassed a remarkable $5 billion. This rapid ascent indicates strong developer and user adoption, proving the network’s utility and appeal. Layer 2 networks like Base are designed to scale blockchain transactions, making them faster and cheaper. By building on Ethereum, Base leverages its security while offering an enhanced user experience. This efficiency is a major draw for decentralized applications (dApps) and users alike, contributing to its substantial TVL and vibrant ecosystem. This strong foundation makes the idea of a Coinbase Base token even more compelling. Why is a Coinbase Base Token a Game Changer? Launching a Coinbase Base token would not only create new revenue but also deepen engagement within the Base ecosystem. Tokens often serve multiple purposes, such as governance, staking, or paying for network fees. By offering a native token, Coinbase could empower its community, giving users a direct stake in the network’s future and encouraging further participation. Consider these key benefits: Direct Monetization: A token provides a direct mechanism for Coinbase to capture value from Base’s growth, independent of broader market trends affecting trading volumes. Ecosystem Alignment: It aligns the incentives of users, developers, and Coinbase, fostering a more robust and collaborative environment. Increased Utility: The token could unlock new functionalities and services within the Base network, enhancing its overall value proposition. Competitive Advantage: In a crowded Layer 2 landscape, a well-executed token launch could differentiate Base and attract more projects and liquidity. What Are the Considerations for Launching a Coinbase Base Token? While the potential benefits are immense, launching a Coinbase Base token also involves careful consideration. Regulatory clarity, market sentiment, and the token’s economic design are crucial factors. A thoughtfully designed tokenomics model is essential to ensure long-term sustainability and value accrual. Coinbase, as a publicly traded company, operates under significant scrutiny. Any token launch would need to navigate complex legal and compliance frameworks. However, given Coinbase’s established reputation and expertise, they are well-positioned to address these challenges effectively. The move could solidify Coinbase’s role not just as an exchange, but as a pivotal infrastructure provider in the decentralized world. The Future is Bright for the Coinbase Base Token JPMorgan’s projection underscores the transformative potential of a Coinbase Base token . This isn’t merely about adding another cryptocurrency to the market; it’s about strategically leveraging a successful Layer 2 network to create substantial shareholder value and innovate within the crypto space. The financial world is watching keenly to see if Coinbase will seize this remarkable opportunity. The prospect of a native Base token signals a maturing market where infrastructure providers are finding novel ways to monetize their contributions. For users and investors, it could represent a new avenue for participation and growth within the Coinbase ecosystem. This strategic pivot could cement Coinbase’s legacy as a true pioneer, constantly evolving to meet the demands of a dynamic digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Base network? A1: Base is a Layer 2 network developed by Coinbase, built on Ethereum. It aims to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications, enhancing transaction speed and efficiency. Q2: Why is JPMorgan interested in a Coinbase Base token? A2: JPMorgan, a major financial institution, analyzes potential revenue streams and value creation in emerging markets. Their interest stems from the significant financial opportunity a native Coinbase Base token could present for Coinbase, potentially generating billions in new revenue. Q3: How would a Coinbase Base token generate value? A3: A native token could generate value through various mechanisms, including network fees, staking rewards, governance participation, and general utility within the Base ecosystem. It would provide Coinbase with a direct monetization strategy for its Layer 2 network’s success. Q4: What are the potential challenges of launching a Base token? A4: Key challenges include navigating complex regulatory landscapes, designing effective tokenomics for long-term sustainability, managing market sentiment, and ensuring the token’s utility aligns with the network’s goals. Coinbase’s compliance expertise would be crucial here. Q5: Has Coinbase confirmed plans for a Base token?

While she maintains a bearish stance in the short term, Lingrid also highlighted the exact price point that could invalidate this downward outlook and signal a potential rebound. Market Overview At the time of analysis, XRP was trading at approximately $2.44, marking a 14% decline for the month. The asset’s performance follows a brief recovery after the October 10 market-wide crash, which affected most major cryptocurrencies. Despite this rebound, XRP has struggled to establish a sustained uptrend, continuing to exhibit weakness relative to the broader digital asset market. Lingrid first presented her detailed outlook on October 18, when XRP hovered around $2.33. The token had shown minor intraday recovery at the time, but her technical review confirmed that XRP remained confined within a descending channel on the four-hour chart, a pattern that has persisted since late August. Bearish Continuation Toward $2.10 Lingrid’s chart identified a blue descending trendline cutting through the channel, effectively dividing it into two halves. This trendline has acted as a consistent resistance level, restricting any sustained move toward the channel’s upper boundary. In early October, XRP briefly broke above this internal resistance, climbing to $3.10 before meeting significant selling pressure. The resulting rejection pushed the price back within the channel’s confines. The decline intensified following the October 10 selloff, which forced XRP below $2.70. Attempts to recover, including a move toward $2.63 on October 13, were unsuccessful, as the token again failed to overcome the trendline resistance. Based on these repeated rejections, Lingrid stated that XRP continues to form lower highs and lower lows, a structure typically signaling an ongoing bearish phase. Should this pattern hold, she believes XRP could fall to around $2.10, marking the lower boundary of the descending channel. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Conditions for a Reversal Despite the prevailing downtrend, Lingrid outlined conditions that could invalidate her bearish projection. She indicated that a decisive break above $2.45 could trigger a trend reversal, with the potential for XRP to rise as high as $2.83 in the short term. More broadly, a close above the $2.50 level would signal renewed buying pressure and a shift toward bullish sentiment. The analyst also noted that external market factors could support a reversal. A potential pivot in Bitcoin’s market direction from bearish to bullish could lift XRP and other altcoins. Additionally, macroeconomic shifts could enhance liquidity conditions across the crypto market. Lingrid pointed to JPMorgan’s recent assessment that the U.S. Federal Reserve may soon conclude its quantitative tightening program, a move that could ease liquidity constraints and improve overall investor sentiment. Mixed Market Sentiment While Lingrid’s analysis emphasizes caution, other market observers remain more optimistic. Analyst EGRAG Crypto recently argued that XRP’s monthly chart still shows structural strength, with no confirmed breakdowns. Similarly, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator on the four-hour chart, suggesting a possible short-term rebound. For now, XRP’s next move will depend on whether it can hold above key technical levels and whether broader market dynamics turn more favorable. A break above $2.45 could offer the first sign that bullish momentum is returning to the asset. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

For the very first time, the total crypto M&A value from mergers and acquisitions involving digital asset firms soared past an astonishing $10 billion in the third quarter. This isn’t just a slight bump; it represents an increase of more than 30 times compared to the same period last year, as reported by crypto market insights platform Unfolded. This massive leap signals a new era of consolidation and strategic growth within the crypto industry. What’s Fueling the Surge in Crypto M&A Value? Many factors contribute to this unprecedented boom in crypto M&A value . The digital asset space is no longer just a playground for individual enthusiasts; it’s attracting serious institutional players and established companies looking to expand their footprint. Here are some key drivers behind this remarkable growth: Market Maturity: The cryptocurrency market is becoming more established and regulated, making it a more attractive environment for traditional finance and tech firms to invest and acquire. Strategic Positioning: Companies are actively seeking to acquire cutting-edge technology, expand their user base, or gain a competitive edge in specific niches like DeFi, NFTs, or Web3 infrastructure.

Benefits of Crypto Mergers and Acquisitions: Innovation Acceleration: Mergers can combine expertise and resources, leading to faster development of new products and services. Enhanced Market Stability: Consolidation can lead to larger, more stable entities, potentially reducing volatility and increasing investor confidence. Broader Reach: Acquired companies often bring existing user bases and brand recognition, expanding the reach of the acquiring firm. Regulatory Clarity: Larger, more established firms might have greater resources to navigate complex regulatory landscapes, potentially setting industry standards. Challenges to Navigate: Regulatory Uncertainties: The evolving nature of crypto regulations can complicate M&A deals, requiring careful legal navigation. Valuation Complexities: Valuing crypto companies, especially those with innovative but unproven business models, can be incredibly challenging. Integration Hurdles: Merging different technologies, company cultures, and operational processes can be a significant undertaking. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can impact deal terms and post-merger performance. What Does This Unprecedented Crypto M&A Value Mean for the Future? The record-breaking crypto M&A value in Q3 suggests a significant shift in the digital asset industry. We are likely to see a landscape dominated by fewer, but larger and more diversified players. This trend could lead to increased institutionalization, greater market efficiency, and potentially a more stable environment for both users and investors. For startups, this means increased opportunities for acquisition, but also heightened competition. For established firms, it emphasizes the need for continuous innovation and strategic partnerships to remain relevant. The industry is maturing, moving from a wild frontier to a more structured financial ecosystem. In conclusion, the astounding $10 billion milestone in Q3 crypto M&A value is more than just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of the cryptocurrency market’s rapid evolution. It highlights a clear trend towards consolidation, strategic growth, and institutional confidence. As the digital asset space continues to mature, we can expect M&A activities to play an even more crucial role in shaping its future, driving innovation, and defining the next generation of blockchain-powered services.

53599721,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87474,1761350405,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert To XRP Holders: I’ve Got Uncomfortable News For You,https://timestabloid.com/expert-to-xrp-holders-ive-got-uncomfortable-news-for-you/,"As market participants anticipate a potential surge in XRP’s value, several industry analysts have cautioned that offloading XRP during a major rally may prove more difficult than many investors expect. The concern centers on the likelihood of declining liquidity during rapid price movements, which could restrict sellers from executing large transactions at their desired prices. Limited Liquidity Could Hinder Profit-Taking Jake Claver, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Ascension Group, recently addressed this issue in a statement, emphasizing the need for investors to prepare for the operational realities of major market events. When we see some major price action come for XRP, I've got uncomfortable news for you….a lot of exchanges won't have the liquidity to let you exit at market value, and with the supply shock, institutional buyers dominate OTC and retail will get stuck fighting for exposure… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 3, 2025 According to Claver, when XRP begins to experience substantial upward momentum, many exchanges may struggle to maintain sufficient liquidity to handle the surge in sell orders. He explained that such a situation could create a temporary imbalance between buyers and sellers, with demand for liquidity far exceeding what exchanges can provide. This, he warned, would allow institutional investors, who often conduct over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, to dominate the market, while retail traders could find themselves unable to sell at optimal prices. Claver advised XRP holders to prepare in advance by securing their assets in private wallets, developing a clear tax strategy, and planning for long-term wealth management. He noted that investors who fail to make these preparations could miss out on opportunities to maximize their returns during a potential price breakout. Analysts Explain Why Selling at Target Prices May Be Unlikely Market commentator Diana echoed Claver’s position in a separate discussion, stressing that many XRP investors have unrealistic expectations about how liquidity functions during rapid rallies. She observed that a large number of holders intend to sell once XRP reaches specific price targets, such as $10 . However, if too many traders attempt to sell simultaneously, market depth can quickly thin out, resulting in significant price slippage. Diana explained that in such cases, a trader placing a sell order at $10 might only receive an execution price closer to $8.50 or lower, depending on market conditions and trade size. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This discrepancy can cause substantial losses within seconds during periods of high volatility. She noted that this phenomenon is not unique to XRP but tends to be more pronounced when market participation becomes heavily one-sided. Institutional Activity May Further Reduce Market Liquidity Diana also pointed out that institutional trading practices contribute to this challenge. While most retail participants rely on public exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken, major corporations and financial institutions typically transact through private OTC arrangements. These private trades, though essential for large-scale settlements, effectively draw liquidity away from public exchanges during critical market moments. Additionally, Diana highlighted Ripple’s recent acquisition of GTreasury as a factor that may further tighten XRP’s available liquidity. The $1 billion integration of GTreasury is expected to increase the use of XRP within institutional payment systems, reducing the volume of tokens circulating on traditional exchanges. While this development enhances XRP’s utility and strengthens its role in global payments, it could also limit retail investors’ ability to exit positions efficiently when prices rise sharply. Both Claver and Diana urged investors to prepare before any significant rally begins. Their recommendations include moving assets from centralized exchanges to private wallets, establishing pre-set sell targets, and using limit orders rather than market orders to mitigate potential slippage. Analysts agree that although optimism around XRP’s long-term prospects remains strong, traders must be proactive in managing liquidity risks. Without proper planning, retail investors could face significant challenges in realizing profits when market conditions become highly volatile.

53599695,613384,1761350421,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53599695.jpeg,Analyst Says Understanding This Bitcoin Structure Is Like Having A Superpower,https://bitcoinist.com/understanding-this-bitcoin-structure/,"Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has shared a confident view of Bitcoin’s current market setup, describing the ability to read high-timeframe (HTF) structures as a superpower. His comments came at a time when Bitcoin had experienced notable volatility, fluctuating between $106,000 and $111,000 in recent days. According to the analyst, those panicking over short-term dips are overlooking what is a very healthy long-term structure that still supports a bullish trajectory to new Bitcoin price highs. The Superpower Of Reading Market Structure CrediBULL Crypto explained that understanding HTF inflection points and market structures separates confident traders from those who react emotionally to every correction. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s current setup is still structurally bullish, and its broader uptrend is intact, even if the price were to dip below $100,000. This outlook is in response to many crypto traders who are starting to turn bearish due to Bitcoin’s lack of strong bullish momentum in recent weeks. In his view, many market participants rely too heavily on external factors such as macroeconomic data or political events instead of focusing on what the charts are showing. He noted that chart literacy gives traders the clarity to stay calm during uncertainty. “Our HTF trend is intact and very healthy at current levels,” he wrote, stating that this is visible to anyone who understands how to properly identify market structure. To him, this ability is like a superpower, one that allows traders to see beyond noise and panic, focusing instead on trend integrity and higher-timeframe setups. The Path To Higher Highs CrediBULL Crypto’s comments were an extension of another post where he drew comparisons between Bitcoin’s current market behavior and its structure when it was trading around $58,000 in 2024. Back then, the invalidation level was set at $38,000, and even though Bitcoin dipped briefly, it never broke below that level before rallying above $100,000. He noted that the $74,000 level now holds the same importance that $38,000 did then, serving as a crucial line that confirms the continuation of the macro uptrend. The analyst added that traders often misinterpret large invalidation ranges as weakness. However, he maintained that such levels are a normal part of high-timeframe analysis. Whether the gap between spot price and invalidation is 5% or 20%, the important thing is to stay consistent with the structure and not allow emotions to override logic. CrediBULL Crypto’s chart projection outlines a continuation of Bitcoin’s larger-impulse fifth Elliott Wave. This large impulse wave is subdivided into smaller subwaves. The first subwave has played out successfully with a $37,500 move. The model implies that Bitcoin’s price could climb significantly higher once the current consolidation forms a confirmed higher low. The analyst projected the larger-impulse fifth wave at a peak price target of $200,000 . He also marked $74,445 as the HTF invalidation zone, meaning any sustained move below that would negate the current bullish count. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,120, up by 1.5% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CrediBULL Crypto|High-TimeFrame|HTF,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 00:00:21

Despite the ongoing consolidation, one crucial support zone is beginning to show signs of strength, hinting that a potential reversal could be on the horizon if buyers step in at the right moment. Momentum Hinges On RSI and BTC Dominance Levels Umair Crypto, in his latest update on Dogecoin, noted that the meme coin is currently consolidating just beneath the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), forming what appears to be a clear bearish setup. According to Umair, the structure suggests that the price could soon face rejection from this critical moving average, a move that may trigger a decline toward the $0.15 region, or potentially even lower if selling pressure intensifies. Related Reading: Dogecoin Awaits Risk-On Ignition As 2021 Pattern Repeats Despite the bearish tone, Umair highlighted that the $0.15 zone remains a crucial area of interest for buyers. He explained that this region could act as a strong bounce zone if the expected rejection occurs, offering the bulls a chance to defend the key support and potentially ignite a recovery from oversold conditions. On a more optimistic note, Umair pointed out that a recovery above the daily RSI trendline could change the short-term outlook for DOGE and fuel a move above the 200-day SMA, opening the door for renewed bullish momentum. However, Umair maintained a cautious stance for now until there’s a confirmed decline in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) below 59%. This shift would likely mark the beginning of a more sustainable upward phase, including Dogecoin. Dogecoin Regains Stability After Recent Correction In a more recent market update, BitGuru highlighted that Dogecoin is starting to display early signs of a potential recovery following its recent correction phase. After facing sustained downward pressure, the popular meme coin seems to be regaining some stability as its price action begins to level out. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Eyes Major Breakout, Is A Rally To $0.7 All-Time Highs Possible? BitGuru pointed out that DOGE has managed to hold firmly near a key support level despite recent volatility. This steady price action near the base suggests that buyers are gradually stepping back in, showing confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. The chart structure is beginning to curve upward, which often precedes a breakout or a notable shift in market sentiment He further explained that if this early momentum continues to develop, Dogecoin could be preparing for a breakout toward the $0.22–$0.25 range. A successful move in that direction would mark a meaningful recovery from its previous decline and could spark renewed interest from traders.

This matters because Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) use CPI data to calculate how much interest investors are owed. Without those numbers, payments cannot be calculated normally. TIPS work by paying lower base interest than regular government bonds, while the principal amount adjusts with the CPI. The CPI data is used with a two-month delay, which is why the late release of September numbers has not yet triggered any backup rules. But if the October CPI is not published by the end of November, fallback procedures will start for the first time. Fallback procedures create uncertainty Jonathan Hill, head of US inflation strategy at Barclays Capital, said this situation is similar to past moments when the national debt limit created concern about delayed Treasury payments. Jonathan said, “I’ve been saying this is the debt-limit equivalent for the TIPS market, something we all need to pay attention to and hopefully doesn’t come to pass.” But if the October data is still missing by late November, the fallback will apply not only to TIPS, but also to inflation swaps, which are contracts where a floating rate is exchanged for a CPI-based payment. Even if the CPI numbers are eventually released, their accuracy may be questioned. The White House said the government funding lapse has prevented price survey teams from gathering data, which means the CPI may not truly reflect conditions, and that uncertainty alone will definitely cause volatility. Investor demand reacts to data quality concerns Interest-rate strategists at Morgan Stanley, led by Aryaman Singh and Matthew Hornbach, said there are “concerns over deteriorating CPI data quality” due to weaker data collection during the shutdown. The strategists think this may be reducing investor demand for the roughly $2 trillion TIPS market, and may also explain why some exchange-traded funds that hold TIPS have recently seen outflows, while regular Treasury bonds have performed better. Aryaman and Matthew wrote , “As the data quality of CPI deteriorates, the demand for TIPS decreases as investors believe that they aren’t getting hedged against true inflation.” They added that weaker data could force TIPS to require a higher term premium than normal Treasuries. TIPS have already underperformed regular Treasuries since mid-July. One contributing factor has been a drop in oil prices, which pushed gasoline to its lowest level since December. Since gasoline makes up around 3% of the CPI, lower fuel prices reduce demand for inflation protection. At the same time, larger TIPS exchange-traded funds have not yet seen significant shrinkage. Investors who rely on these products for liquidity are not expected to exit suddenly. Jonathan said the disruption does not represent a major threat to the market unless it becomes long-lasting.Gang Hu, managing partner at Winshore Capital Partners and a specialist in inflation products, agreed, saying that as long as the CPI remains free from political interference, the situation should remain manageable. Gang said, “I don’t think it moves the needle here.” He added that if political interference were to occur, “we might be dealing with bigger problems before we deal with ‘Do people buy TIPS?’” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|U.S Treasury,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-25 00:05:23

A new study has discovered that the technology tends to “sycophantically” affirm users’ actions and beliefs, even when they are harmful, socially inappropriate or misleading. The scientists have warned that this “social sycophancy” raises urgent concerns over the power of AI to distort users’ self-perception and make them less willing to resolve conflicts. Researchers call on AI chatbots developers to address the risk This comes as chatbots are increasingly being used as a source of advice on relationships and other personal issues. With this, the AI tech however could “reshape social interactions at scale” according to the researchers, calling on developers to address the risk. According a Guardian article , the study, which was led by a computer scientist at Stanford University, Myra Cheng warns that turning to AI for personal, emotional or rational advice poses some serious insidious risks. The researchers found that common chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama, and the Chinese DeepSeek endorsed user behavior 50% more often than human respondents in similar situations. “Our key concern is that if models are always affirming people, then this may distort people’s judgments of themselves, their relationships, and the world around them.” Cheng. “It can be hard to even realise that models are subtly, or not-so-subtly, reinforcing existing beliefs and assumptions,” added Cheng. According to the Guardian, one test compared AI and human responses to posts on the Reddit forum “Am I the Asshole?,” where users ask the community to judge their behaviors. In one instance, a user admitted to tying a bag of trash to a tree branch in a park after failing to see a bin. While most human voters were critical of the action, ChatGPT-4o was supportive, declaring: “Your intention to clean up after yourselves is commendable.” AI Chatbots endorse users’ views The researchers also found that chatbots kept validating users’ views and intentions even when they were irresponsible, deceptive, or involved mentions of self-harm. In a follow-up experiment with more than 1,000 volunteers, participants discussed real or hypothetical social situations with either a publicly available chatbot or a version the researchers had doctored, to remove its sycophantic nature. The results of the test showed that participants who received fawning, affirmative responses felt more justified in their behavior – such as going to an ex-partner’s art show without telling their current partner. They were also less willing to patch things up after arguments, and the study also noted that chatbots hardly ever encouraged users to consider another person’s point of view. According to the study, users rated flattering chatbots more highly and said they trusted them more, suggesting that validation reinforces both user attachment and reliance on AI systems. This, according to the researchers, created what they described as “perverse incentives” – where both the user and the chatbot benefit from agreeable rather than honest exchanges. Dr Alexander Laffer, an emergent technology researcher at the University of Winchester said that this study was fascinating and highlighted a growing and unappreciated problem. “Sycophancy has been a concern for a while; it’s partly a result of how AI systems are trained and how their success is measured — often by how well they maintain user engagement.” Dr Laffer. “That sycophantic responses might impact not just the vulnerable but all users, underscores the potential seriousness of this problem.,” he added. Dr Laffer also added the critical need to enhance digital literacy. Cheng echoed warning and urging users to seek human perspectives. A recent study found that about 30% of teenagers talked to AI as opposed to real people for “serious conversations.” AI firms like OpenAI have pledged to build chatbots specifically for teenagers to create a safer space for the young users.

The bank’s analysts raised their rating to “Overweight” from “Neutral” and increased their price target to $404 per share, suggesting about 15% upside compared to present levels. JPMorgan noted that Coinbase is doubling down on its Base layer-2 blockchain and seeking to unlock more ways to capture more value from the platform’s growth. According to the bank, the launch of a Base token could represent a $12 billion to $34 billion market opportunity, with Coinbase’s retained share potentially worth $4 billion to $12 billion. Analysts suggest that the token’s distribution may give precedence to developers, validators, and the Base community. The report also highlighted potential margin expansion opportunities from changes to Coinbase’s USDC rewards program. JPMorgan noted that Coinbase may reduce interest rewards for most users, while offering them primarily to Coinbase One subscribers — a move that could add approximately $374 million in annual earnings at current USDC yields and interest rates. After the upgrade, COIN shares rose more than 9% on Friday to about $353. Data for YoY shows the stock is now up about 42%, pushing Coinbase’s market capitalization to roughly $90.6 billion. Analysts eye $12B–$34B opportunity from potential Base token launch Coinbase is scheduled to release its third-quarter results o n October 30. According to Zacks Investment Research , analysts anticipate the firm to post earnings of $1.06 per share, marking a 71% year-over-year increase, on revenue of $1.74 billion, a 44.1% increase from the same quarter last year. The upcoming report is coming on the heels of a mixed second quarter for Coinbase, which missed earnings but achieved several operational milestones, including growing stablecoin balances and revenue derived from stablecoins. The company has been working to fuel growth in its subscription and services segment, which is expected to contribute $665 million to $745 million in revenue during the third quarter. Among the major events in the quarter, Coinbase highlighted the passage of the GENIUS Act , which establishes a regulatory framework aimed at promoting the adoption of stablecoins within the United States. The company also noted that the House passed a broader market structure bill, seen as a step closer to greater clarity in crypto regulation. Coinbase’s Echo acquisition revives memories of the ICO boom On related development, Coinbase Global Inc.’s $375 million buy of digital asset investment platform Echo is evoking some not-so-distant memories—the boom times of less than a decade ago, when thousands of crypto projects raised billions of dollars by selling tokens directly to investors. Initial coin offerings, or ICOs, helped define the boom-and-bust cycle that made the general investing public aware of cryptocurrency for the first time. While the token sales came to a halt in 2018 after the speculative bubble that quickly developed burst and regulators cracked down on the scams that proliferated, Coinbase’s acquisition is seen by market participants as a signal that what’s old is new again. According to Coinbase’s statement announcing the acquisition, the company said the deal would help it build a “full-stack” solution for crypto fundraising. Cobie, the founder of Echo, said the company will continue to operate a standalone platform under its current brand for the time being. Still, he noted that they would integrate Sonar’s public sale product into Coinbase and likely establish new ways for founders to access investors.

The platform is called MultiSYG and it will be release in the first half of 2026 with a focus on institutions and high-net-worth clients who want “access to bank-level lending without having to surrender their assets fully into custody,” said the release. MultiSYG uses five total parties: Sygnum, the borrower, and independent signers. Any movement of collateral requires three signatures. The goal is to prevent rehypothecation, a practice where lenders quietly reuse client collateral to support separate financial positions. Borrowers can also check their funds on-chain throughout the loan period, according to the companies. Explaining the multisig structure Multi-signature wallets are often used for group-owned assets or corporate treasury operations because they require more technical knowledge than typical wallets, which usually rely on a single private key. In a regular wallet, there is one public address and one private key. The public address receives assets. The private key signs transactions and grants access to the wallet. Many consumers rely on software or hardware wallets that store private keys for them, requiring only a PIN or password to unlock. Multi-signature setups add extra security by splitting signing power across multiple parties.But they still come with risks.If the software managing the signatures is compromised, or if signers’ credentials are exposed, funds can still be at risk. Pascal Eberle, the initiative lead for Bitcoin projects at Sygnum Bank, said the setup allows borrowers to “hold your own keys while accessing regulated banking products and white-glove service.” Pascal added that borrowers would still receive bank-grade pricing, drawdown options, and flexibility in loan duration, while also maintaining cryptographic proof that the BTC remains in place. Still though, software and access credentials can be hacked and stolen, so while these wallets offer more security than other wallets, they can still be altered for malicious purposes.

This strategic move, initially reported by CoinDesk, marks a pivotal moment in Ripple’s expansion into comprehensive digital asset services, aiming to cater more effectively to the growing demands of institutional clients. What Does Ripple Prime Mean for Institutional Investors? The rebranding to Ripple Prime is more than just a name change; it signifies a deeper integration and a unified vision under the Ripple umbrella. Prime brokerage services are crucial in traditional finance, offering a suite of services to hedge funds and other institutional clients. These services typically include trade execution, clearing, settlement, custody, and financing. For the digital asset space, a robust prime broker like Ripple Prime can provide: Centralized Access: A single point of entry to multiple liquidity venues and exchanges. Enhanced Security: Secure custody solutions for digital assets. Efficient Trading: Streamlined trade execution and post-trade settlement processes. Risk Management: Tools and services to help institutions manage their exposure. This integration allows Ripple to offer a more complete ecosystem for institutions looking to engage with cryptocurrencies, reducing complexity and increasing operational efficiency. Why Is This Rebrand So Important for Ripple’s Strategy? Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road and subsequent rebranding to Ripple Prime underscores its ambition to become a dominant player in the institutional digital asset market. For years, Ripple has focused on cross-border payments with its XRP ledger technology. However, the firm has been steadily diversifying its offerings to include a broader range of services for financial institutions. This move is particularly strategic because: It addresses a critical need for institutional-grade infrastructure in the crypto space. It leverages Ripple’s existing relationships with banks and financial entities. It positions Ripple as a comprehensive solutions provider, not just a payment protocol. By offering prime brokerage services, Ripple aims to attract more traditional financial institutions into the digital asset fold, providing them with the familiar tools and reliability they expect. How Does Ripple Prime Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The emergence of strong institutional players like Ripple Prime is generally viewed as a positive development for the entire cryptocurrency market. As more established firms enter the space with robust, compliant services, it lends greater legitimacy and stability to digital assets. This can lead to increased liquidity, reduced volatility, and ultimately, broader adoption. Moreover, the competition among prime brokers in the crypto sector is heating up. This competitive environment encourages innovation and pushes service providers to offer better, more secure, and more efficient solutions. For institutions, this means more choices and higher quality services when venturing into digital asset investments. What Are the Benefits and Challenges Ahead? The benefits of a well-established Ripple Prime are clear: enhanced trust, improved efficiency, and a more accessible pathway for institutions into crypto. However, challenges remain. The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving globally, requiring constant adaptation and compliance efforts. Ensuring seamless integration across various digital asset platforms and maintaining top-tier security will also be paramount. Actionable Insight: For institutions considering entry into the digital asset market, evaluating prime brokers like Ripple Prime for their comprehensive service offerings, regulatory compliance, and security protocols is a crucial first step. Understanding their technological infrastructure and client support can significantly influence operational success. A New Era for Institutional Digital Assets The rebranding of Hidden Road to Ripple Prime is a powerful statement about Ripple’s long-term vision for the digital asset economy. It signifies a maturation of the institutional crypto market, moving towards more sophisticated and integrated financial services.

The news on Thursday increased investors’ confidence in crypto mining. Jane Street shared the news in a filing with the U.S. SEC and said the investments are passive and not meant to control the companies. Jane Street discloses 5% ownership in Cipher Mining Jane Street and its related companies said they now hold about 5% of Cipher Mining’s total stock (about 19.68 million shares). Of this amount, Jane Street Capital owns 0.2%, Jane Street Options owns 2.1%, and Jane Street Global Trading holds 2.7%. Jeremy Kahn, t he official representative for all Jane Street companies, signed the filing , which was then submitted under Rule 13d-1(c). Investors follow this rule when they buy company shares solely as an investment, not to exert control or influence over the company. Cipher Mining builds modern data centers that use high-powered computers to mine Bitcoin. Following Jane Street’s announcement, the company’s stock price increased by nearly 20% on Friday, reaching approximately $4.28. Just before Jane Street made this investment, Google announced that it had acquired a 5.4% stake in Cipher Mining in late September. Because both Google and Jane Street are now involved with Cipher Mining, Investors feel confident that the mining industry will expand. Bitcoin miners extend rally as sector outperforms Bitcoin After news spread that Jane Street had bought shares in several Bitcoin mining firms, investors began buying mining stocks, and the prices increased. A few Bitcoin miners had already gained between 8% and 13% by the end of Thursday. By the end of the day on Friday, Bitfarms (BITF) rose 10.68%, Cipher Mining (CIFR) climbed 19.73%, and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) increased 17.27%. American Bitcoin Corp. also increased by 11.29%, IREN Limited gained 12.60%, and Hive Digital Technologies rose 17.77%. These numbers showed that investors were moving money into companies that build and operate Bitcoin mining facilities, rather than just buying Bitcoin itself. Over the past year, large mining companies have invested in new and more powerful Bitcoin mining machines that use less electricity. They have also built bigger and more advanced data centers and negotiated cheaper electricity contracts to increase their profits. These upgrades keep miners profitable even when the price of Bitcoin is rising too slowly. At the same time, Bitcoin prices have remained high, which has restored investor confidence in the market. Over the past 12 months, Bitfarms increased by 131%, Hut 8 rose by 211%, and Bitcoin itself gained approximately 73%. Experts say that investments by Jane Street and Google have sparked interest among traditional investors in the industry. Additionally, improvements in global energy prices and clearer government rules have allowed companies to save more money and increase their production. The U.S. government and regulators have also begun working on clearer rules that enable companies to operate more openly, rather than creating new barriers. Mining companies don’t need to be afraid of sudden regulatory changes anymore and can now attract more investments to plan for future growth. On related developments, Chris Wright, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, recently proposed a new rule that would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish fair and efficient methods for facilities requiring more than 20 megawatts to connect directly to the bulk transmission system. This is because the electricity demand has never been higher, primarily due to the proliferation of AI infrastructure and large-scale cryptocurrency mining activities. The Secretary’s letter states that these sectors, which are now among the most energy-intensive in the U.S., require explicit rulemaking to accommodate them. Under the new rules, crypto mining companies and AI data centers can have their connections reviewed within 60 days, provided they cover the costs of upgrading the network. These companies usually have to wait a long time to connect to the U.S. grid. According to analysts , this change will enable miners to get started more quickly, which will help the U.S. maintain its competitiveness globally. The plan indicates that the administration is supportive of both technology and cryptocurrency, aiming to foster economic growth by promoting innovative ideas and concepts. Get seen where it counts.

Yet despite the sell-off, XRP bulls remain active as momentum builds. While XRP attempts to regain strength, investors are exploring new opportunities with stronger upside potential, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerging as a top alternative. This DeFi crypto has recently been named the best crypto presale of 2025 following stellar performance. Stage 6 which is now live has less than 30% of its initial allocation remaining. This speaks to the massive interest buyers are showing. MUTM’s explosive growth and innovative DeFi model have positioned it as the best crypto to buy now, and possibly the next crypto to hit $1 in the upcoming market cycle. XRP Price Prediction: Bulls Eye $2.80 Breakout Amid Volatile Market Conditions XRP continues to recover from the sustained bearish conditions following its drop on October 10th. On the 4-hourly chart, the token is in a contracting parallel channel below, which gives probability of an immediate breakout to the $2.80 resistance line also at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, which is an important zone for the confirmation of a bullish reversal. A close above this level of resistance will be required to win, which would result in a rally to $3.05 or even $3.40 in the near term. The momentum indicators are backing the recovery thesis with the RSI at 52 and the MACD lines heading for a bullish crossover, which suggests buyers in charge. A collapse of the momentum surge will jeopardize XRP dipping below $2.20, should risk-off sentiment in the overall market prevail. While investors sit with their breaths held waiting to see what’s next from the XRP, other investors are looking into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), what’s the best crypto to buy and next crypto to hit $1, picking up steam ahead of 2025’s anticipated boom in the market. Mutuum Finance Presale Sizzles in Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is igniting the crypto space as investor demand shoots through the roof in its Phase 6 presale. The token is currently on sale at the price of $0.035, which is 16.17% higher than Phase 5 and the lowest price at which it will be sold, giving early investors an amazing opportunity before prices rise to $0.04 in Phase 7. More than 17,380 investors have invested more than $17.8 million, and more than 70% of Phase 6 is sold. The strong presale performance signals building trust in Mutuum Finance’s upcoming lending and borrowing protocol and turning MUTM into what could be the next crypto to hit $1 in early-stage DeFi growth. Building a Secure and Community-Oriented DeFi Platform Mutuum Finance aims not only to construct a secure and scalable DeFi platform but also an active, user-driven ecosystem. Through its presale campaigns and current campaigns, MUTM has initiated a series of reward programs for users that directly involve investors as well as promote long-term stability of the project. For the sake of security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has joined forces with CertiK to launch an official Bug Bounty Program. Security engineers, developers, and bug bounty hunters are invited to discover and submit bugs on the platform, paying them from minor bugs to critical issues. A $50,000 USDT reward will be issued to participants of this activity. Mutuum Finance has raised more than $17.8 million from more than 17,380 investors and tokens of $0.035 are selling fast with more than 70% of Phase 6 already gone. Early birds can be part of its two-lending P2C and P2P network, enjoy passive income and flexible borrowing as they get ready for massive potential growth. Mutuum Finance remains the next crypto to hit $1 and continues to position itself as the answer for investors asking what’s the best crypto to buy.

Right now, a key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , is telling a clear story: it remains stalled at 24. This figure, provided by CoinMarketCap, isn’t just a random number; it offers crucial insights into which segment of the market is currently leading the charge. For any crypto investor, understanding this index is vital for navigating market cycles. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index and How is it Calculated? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is fundamental for any crypto enthusiast. It’s a straightforward yet powerful tool designed to gauge the performance of altcoins against Bitcoin over a specific period. This index helps you identify whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. The Core Metric: The index specifically tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Exclusions: To ensure accuracy, stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) and wrapped coins (like wBTC) are excluded from this calculation. This prevents their price stability or direct BTC correlation from skewing the results. Timeframe: The comparison is made over the last 90 days, providing a relevant snapshot of recent market trends. The Threshold: An “altcoin season” is officially declared when a significant majority – specifically, 75% of these top 100 altcoins – manage to outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day window. A score closer to 100 on the Altcoin Season Index indicates a robust altcoin season, where a wide array of alternative cryptocurrencies are seeing strong gains relative to Bitcoin. Conversely, a lower score, like our current 24, signals a “Bitcoin season,” meaning Bitcoin is largely outperforming the broader altcoin market. Why is the Altcoin Season Index Stalled at 24, Signaling a Bitcoin Season? The current reading of 24 on the Altcoin Season Index suggests that less than 75% of the top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. This isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm, but rather a reflection of prevailing market sentiment and capital flows. It highlights Bitcoin’s foundational role in the crypto ecosystem. Several factors often contribute to a “Bitcoin season”: Bitcoin’s Halving Cycle: Historically, periods leading up to and immediately following Bitcoin halvings can see renewed interest and capital flowing into BTC. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability, investors often seek refuge in perceived safer assets. Within crypto, Bitcoin is frequently viewed as the primary “store of value,” leading to increased demand. Dominance Cycle: The crypto market often moves in cycles where Bitcoin gains dominance, then altcoins catch up, and the cycle repeats. We might simply be in a phase where Bitcoin is consolidating its position. Lack of Strong Altcoin Narratives: Sometimes, the altcoin market lacks a compelling new narrative or breakthrough technology to attract significant capital away from Bitcoin. When the Altcoin Season Index is low, it means that while some altcoins might be performing well individually, the majority are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s momentum. This emphasizes the need for careful selection if you’re venturing into altcoins during such a period. Navigating the Current Crypto Climate: Tips for Savvy Investors A low Altcoin Season Index doesn’t mean you should abandon altcoins entirely. Instead, it calls for a more strategic approach to your crypto portfolio. Being informed and adaptable is key. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Prioritize Research: In a Bitcoin-dominated market, identifying altcoins with strong fundamentals, clear utility, and active development becomes even more critical. “Low cap gems” can still emerge, but they require diligent research. Consider Bitcoin as a Core Holding: If the index suggests a Bitcoin season, strengthening your Bitcoin position might be a prudent move. It often acts as a barometer for the broader market’s health. Diversify Wisely: While altcoins may be underperforming generally, a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk. Avoid overexposure to a single altcoin, especially those without a proven track record or strong community support. Risk Management: Implement strict risk management strategies, such as setting stop-losses or taking profits at predefined levels. Market volatility can be amplified for altcoins during a Bitcoin season. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on overall market sentiment, news, and technical indicators. These can provide early clues about potential shifts in the Altcoin Season Index . Understanding the signals, like the current Altcoin Season Index , empowers you to make better decisions and position yourself advantageously in the ever-changing crypto landscape. Looking Ahead: When Might the Altcoin Season Index Shift? The crypto market is cyclical, and the current Bitcoin season indicated by the Altcoin Season Index at 24 will not last forever. Several potential triggers could signal a shift back towards altcoin outperformance, bringing exciting new opportunities for investors. Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Often, after a strong run, Bitcoin will consolidate its gains. This period can allow capital to flow into altcoins, especially those that have been lagging, as investors seek higher returns. Emergence of New Narratives: Breakthroughs in specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, AI, or Layer 2 solutions can ignite interest and investment in related altcoins. A compelling new narrative can quickly shift the Altcoin Season Index . Reduced Bitcoin Dominance: As Bitcoin’s dominance (its market cap percentage of the total crypto market) begins to wane, it often creates room for altcoins to gain ground, indicating a broader market rally. Improved Macroeconomic Conditions: A more stable global economic outlook can encourage investors to take on more risk, potentially increasing their exposure to higher-beta assets like altcoins. Keeping a close watch on these macro and micro indicators will be essential for anticipating when the Altcoin Season Index might start to climb towards that coveted 75% mark, heralding a true altcoin season. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 24 serves as a vital snapshot of the current crypto landscape, clearly indicating a Bitcoin-dominated market. While altcoin seasons are exciting, understanding and navigating a Bitcoin season is equally important for strategic investment. By focusing on fundamentals, managing risk, and staying informed, investors can position themselves effectively for whatever the dynamic crypto market brings next. Remember, every season offers unique opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 24 signify? An Altcoin Season Index of 24 indicates that only 24% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This suggests we are currently in a “Bitcoin season,” where Bitcoin is generally performing better than the broader altcoin market. Q2: How is an “altcoin season” officially defined by the index? An altcoin season is officially declared when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin during the 90-day measurement period. A score closer to 100 means a stronger altcoin season. Q3: Should I avoid altcoins when the Altcoin Season Index is low? Not necessarily. A low Altcoin Season Index means the majority of altcoins are underperforming Bitcoin, but individual altcoins with strong fundamentals or unique narratives can still perform well. It emphasizes the need for thorough research and careful risk management. Q4: What factors could cause the Altcoin Season Index to rise? The Altcoin Season Index could rise if Bitcoin consolidates after a strong rally, allowing capital to flow into altcoins. The emergence of compelling new narratives (e.g., in DeFi, AI, or gaming), reduced Bitcoin dominance, or improved macroeconomic conditions could also trigger a shift. Q5: Where can I find the current Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is typically provided by platforms like CoinMarketCap, which calculates and displays this metric based on their methodology. Share Your Thoughts and Stay Connected!

53601379,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=843398,1761354052,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53601379.jpeg,Ethereum OG Drives $500M Liquidity Flow Into ConcreteXYZ & Stable Vaults – Details,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-og-drives-500m-liquidity-flow-into-concretexyz-stable-vaults-details/,"Ethereum is struggling to push above the $4,000 level, as market sentiment remains uncertain and volatility keeps investors cautious. Despite several attempts, bulls have failed to sustain momentum, suggesting hesitation at key resistance levels. However, new on-chain data is drawing attention to potentially large-scale liquidity moves that could influence Ethereum’s next direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH-SOPR Falls Below 1.0 for the First Time Since April – What This Means According to Lookonchain, an Ethereum OG holding 736,316 ETH (worth approximately $2.89 billion) recently deposited $500 million USDT into the vaults launched by ConcreteXYZ and Stable, just before their official announcement. This has sparked significant curiosity across the crypto community, as the transaction appears strategically timed and could signal preparation for major yield or liquidity activity. ConcreteXYZ is a next-generation liquidity protocol designed to connect institutional and DeFi capital through tokenized vaults. It allows users to allocate stablecoins and crypto assets into yield-bearing strategies while maintaining full transparency and composability within the Ethereum ecosystem. The whale’s massive deposit — preceding the public reveal — suggests potential insider positioning or high-conviction participation in these vaults. Such large inflows often act as early indicators of shifting liquidity dynamics, particularly when aligned with projects positioned at the intersection of DeFi infrastructure and institutional finance. Whale Dominance in Aave and Stablecoin Vaults Raises Strategic Questions According to Lookonchain, the same Ethereum OG who recently interacted with ConcreteXYZ and Stable deposited 300,000 ETH into Aave and borrowed $500 million USDT. Out of the total $775 million USDT deposited across the new vaults, this single whale accounted for 64.5% of the total liquidity, underscoring their dominant role in this sudden market activity. This move represents a sophisticated on-chain strategy often seen among experienced whales. By supplying ETH as collateral on Aave — one of the largest decentralized lending protocols — and borrowing USDT against it, the whale effectively unlocks liquidity without selling their Ethereum holdings. This allows them to deploy large sums into yield opportunities, such as the newly launched ConcreteXYZ vaults, while retaining exposure to ETH’s long-term upside. Such a concentration of liquidity from one entity can have several implications for the broader market. On one hand, it highlights growing confidence among deep-pocketed players in the DeFi ecosystem’s stability and profitability. On the other hand, it raises questions about market influence and systemic risk, since a single participant holds such a large portion of capital inflows. Related Reading: Chris Larsen Cashes Out: $764M In XRP Profits Since 2018 If this borrowed liquidity is used for yield farming or strategic positioning rather than short-term speculation, it could reinforce Ethereum’s ecosystem fundamentals by increasing DeFi activity and on-chain engagement. However, if market conditions deteriorate and collateral values fall, liquidations could amplify volatility. In essence, this massive Aave–ConcreteXYZ transaction demonstrates how whales leverage DeFi infrastructure to maintain dominance, optimize liquidity, and influence ecosystem-wide capital flows — making this one of the most significant on-chain moves of the quarter. Ethereum Rebounds but Faces Resistance Near $4,000 Ethereum’s price is currently trading around $3,964, showing signs of a modest rebound after recent volatility. The daily chart indicates that ETH has been attempting to recover from its October lows. But remains trapped below key resistance at $4,000–$4,200, where both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages converge. This is a zone that often acts as a strong rejection area during consolidation phases. Despite short-term gains, Ethereum’s broader structure still reflects uncertainty. The 200-day moving average, sitting near $3,200, continues to provide strong dynamic support, preventing a deeper breakdown. However, the inability to break above $4,000 has left the asset vulnerable to renewed selling pressure if momentum weakens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trapped On Binance: The Battle Between $107K and $119K Heats Up Volume patterns suggest limited conviction among buyers, as each rally attempt has been met with fading strength. To regain a sustainable bullish outlook, Ethereum needs a decisive close above $4,200. This would signal a potential continuation toward $4,500 and higher. Conversely, failure to reclaim that range could lead to a retest of $3,600–$3,500.

53603108,613359,1761354053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53603108.jpeg,Bitcoin Volatility Starts To Cool: Market Prepares For Potential Short Squeeze Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-volatility-starts-cool-market-short-squeeze/,"Bitcoin is struggling to establish a clear bullish structure in the short term, as selling pressure continues to dominate since the October 10 market crash. The asset remains caught in a volatile range, with traders unsure whether the next major move will mark the start of a recovery or the continuation of a broader correction. According to CryptoQuant data, volatility on the daily timeframe remains elevated — reflecting the ongoing uncertainty and aggressive repositioning among traders — but the slope of volatility is beginning to decline. This cooling could indicate that Bitcoin is gradually stabilizing after weeks of erratic movement, potentially setting the stage for a massive impulse move once momentum returns. However, analysts remain cautious about declaring a bullish reversal. Many point to the fragile macroeconomic backdrop — including fluctuating US Treasury yields, geopolitical risks, and investor rotation between risk-on and risk-off assets — as key variables that could determine Bitcoin’s next direction. For now, market sentiment remains mixed, with long-term holders showing resilience while short-term traders continue to exit positions amid uncertainty. Market Awaits As Bitcoin Consolidates Before Potential Rally According to top analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s current cooling phase may be a critical setup for the next bullish impulse. Adler explains that once the volatility index begins to decline, the market could finally start to realize accumulated short positions, potentially fueling a short squeeze that drives prices higher. This process often marks the transition from uncertainty to recovery — a pattern observed in past market cycles following high-volatility events. However, Adler cautions that this scenario depends heavily on the absence of external macro shocks. Any sudden rise in US Treasury yields or renewed gold strength could shift sentiment back into Risk-off mode, prompting capital outflows from risk assets like Bitcoin. In such an environment, even minor rallies could face swift rejection as liquidity retreats toward safer instruments. For now, the volatility slope is flattening, signaling that the extreme turbulence seen since the October 10 crash may be easing. This stabilization phase often precedes a significant move, as both bulls and bears reassess positioning. Some analysts share Adler’s cautiously optimistic view, suggesting that Bitcoin could be nearing a short-term bottom. The combination of reduced volatility, potential short covering, and cooling leverage ratios hints that market structure may be resetting in preparation for a bullish reversal. If macro sentiment stabilizes and risk appetite strengthens, Bitcoin could see renewed momentum toward the $115K–$120K zone. Until then, the market appears to be in a holding pattern — waiting for volatility to subside before confirming the next decisive move. Bitcoin Tests Resistance Near Amid Market Caution Bitcoin is currently trading around $111,326, showing a modest rebound after weeks of weakness following the October 10 crash. The daily chart highlights a clear sideways consolidation pattern, with BTC struggling to gain momentum above its 50-day moving average (blue line), which now acts as immediate resistance. The structure remains fragile, as the 200-day moving average (red line) around $106,000 continues to serve as a critical support level, repeatedly holding the price from a deeper breakdown. A sustained close above $112,000–$113,000 would be the first technical confirmation that bulls are regaining strength, potentially opening the door to a retest of the $117,500 resistance zone — a key liquidity level where sellers previously rejected the price. However, the broader trend remains neutral to slightly bearish as long as BTC trades below the cluster of moving averages. The market still shows hesitation, reflecting uncertainty across macroeconomic indicators and persistent risk-off sentiment. Bitcoin appears to be in a recovery attempt, but it needs stronger volume and a clear break above $113K to confirm bullish continuation. Otherwise, failure to maintain current levels could result in another retest of $108K–$106K, where buyer support remains concentrated.

His resignation marks another exit from the billionaire’s team, sparking endless debates among individuals. Nitti, who was appointed in January 2025, played a central role in shaping X’s advertising and monetization strategy during a critical period for the platform. He was once considered a potential successor to Linda Yaccarino as CEO. However, after careful consideration, he decided to depart on Friday, October 24, according to sources close to the situation. His exit marks the latest in a growing string of high-level departures across Musk’s businesses, including Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. The increased resignation from Musk’s company X raises endless debates Advertising remains X’s largest revenue source , but it has struggled to recover since Musk’s 2022 takeover. Several advertisers paused spending amid concerns about looser content moderation and brand placement. While Musk has introduced subscription tiers and AI tools to diversify income, ad sales remain central to X’s financial health. Yaccarino served as the CEO of X from mid-2023 until her resignation in July 2025. Since her departure, various leaders, including Angela Zepeda, the global head of marketing, and Nitti, who many industry experts believed could become the next CEO, were assigned to her role. Regarding Nitti’s departure, sources familiar with the situation noted that his exit followed a series of senior resignations from the company. An example is Mike Liberatore, who served as xAI’s chief financial officer. Liberatore exited after three months during the summer. Soon after his departure, Robert Keele, the general counsel, resigned. Notably, Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI obtained this social media platform X through an all-stock deal on March 28, 2025. Still, in early October, Mahmoud Reza Banki, the chief financial officer at X, who had served for less than a year, announced his withdrawal. At this point, individuals expressed concerns about the reason behind these exits. To address these discussions, sources close to the situation suggested that the turnover illustrated the frustration of some executives regarding Musk’s sudden shifts in strategy and the challenges they faced in attaining goals due to their billionaire boss’s direct approach. Additionally, analysts pointed out that Musk’s advertising team has been under constant pressure to maximize profits. This has intensified as the billionaire invests billions in infrastructure and works to create superhuman AI to compete with rivals such as OpenAI and Google’s DeepMind. At the same time, the tech analysts also mentioned that advertisers have been discouraged by Musk’s decision to ease content moderation regulations. This promotes his “free speech” beliefs and his harsh response to marketers who disagreed with him. Several sales chiefs express concerns over Musk’s business approach As more individuals adopt AI, the tech industry has undergone significant improvements. This has persuaded some brands to return, while xAI has recently signed media deals with companies including Disney. To attract more brands, the company has also informed them that its advertising performance is improving as a result of xAI’s AI technology, as stated in an earlier email. Still, a few advertisers have privately raised concerns about being forced to spend money on X after the platform sued several brands, including Shell and Pinterest, for allegedly participating in an illegal boycott. When reporters asked the companies whether the claims were true, they denied those allegations. On the other hand, an insider said that Nitti, a former Verizon executive, was among the sales chiefs who became fed up with Musk’s approach to managing the advertising business. In the meantime, sources have identified that Musk became distracted only during the first half of the year by his involvement in Donald Trump’s administration , with whom he finally split this summer after a disagreement with the president.

The company announced the move at the Plan B Forum in Lugano, stating that it aims to help creators earn and remain independent with crypto. Tether, which has already committed a sizeable investment in Rumble, is seen as providing the crypto-infrastructure and stablecoin (USDT/USAT) linkage. At the same time, Rumble brings the creator platform, user base, and distribution channel. Creators on the video-sharing platform will be able to receive Bitcoin tips directly from viewers, thereby supplementing their existing monetization streams (ads, subscriptions) with cryptocurrency payments. Rumble aims to position itself as a more creator-friendly, crypto-native alternative to traditional platforms like YouTube. Rumble teams up with Tether to add Bitcoin tips for creators Rumble’s CEO, Chris Pavlovski, announced the new feature at the Plan B Forum in Lugano, Switzerland, alongside Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. He said Rumble will roll out the feature between early and mid-December 2025 after a few tests. The new feature will work through the native Rumble wallet, allowing fans to send tips directly to their favorite creators on the platform. In turn, creators receive instant payments and don’t have to use other payment platforms with high fees. Popular content creator Viva Frei became the first person ever to receive a Bitcoin tip on Rumble during a demonstration of how the system works. Pavlovski called it a big moment for the Rumble community and said digital currencies like Bitcoin can make the internet fairer for everyone. The partnership with Tether also has its perks in this system. Tether invested $775 million in Rumble in December 2024 to support new projects, including the Bitcoin tipping system. CEO of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, stated that the tipping system will assist creators who struggle to access traditional financial services and protect others from being “debanked.” Rumble has always fought against censoring creators, so with this new system, users can control how they earn, spend, and grow their money. Rumble grows its crypto plans with Bitcoin treasury and new wallet Allowing tip-payments in Bitcoin could significantly change how creators earn. Instead of being solely reliant on ad revenue or platform-controlled subscriptions, they can receive value directly from their audience, and in a form of payment that may offer lower friction, global reach, and potentially better economics. Rumble also aims to establish a Bitcoin treasury and introduce a digital wallet for its users. The company currently holds Bitcoin, and earlier this year, it announced plans to invest up to $20 million of its cash reserves in Bitcoin. The video platform demonstrated its seriousness about its commitment by increasing its Bitcoin holdings to approximately $25 million by the end of the second quarter. The company is also collaborating with the crypto payment company Moonpay to launch a new digital wallet, enabling users to buy, store, and send digital assets directly through the Rumble app. Once it launches, creators will receive Bitcoin tips instantly from their fans, store them safely, and choose how to use or withdraw their funds. Rumble’s active user base went down from 9 million in the first quarter to around 51 million in the second quarter. However, analysts say its growing crypto features will attract new users, especially independent creators who want to avoid traditional financial systems that may limit or censor them. The company’s new Bitcoin tipping and digital wallet could also inspire other major platforms, such as YouTube, Twitch, or X (formerly Twitter), to develop their own systems. Rambo’s shares closed at $7.14 on Friday, which was slightly higher by 0.56% for the day. However, they remain down more than 45% since the year began, which shows just how weak the tech and crypto markets are. Despite this, Rambo is confident that its new crypto initiatives will improve its brand and business over time. Get seen where it counts.

Based on reports, that share translates to an estimated slice near 145 EH/s of computing power tied to Chinese influence. The figure, according to the Fourth Quarter 2025 update of Luxor’s Global Hashrate Map , places China behind two other major contributors and marks a return to a significant role after a sharp decline following policy moves in 2021. Hardware And Supply Chains Reports have disclosed that much of the world’s mining rigs are built by Chinese firms. Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan are still named as the main manufacturers. Because miners around the globe use that gear, the country’s grip on the supply chain remains strong. Equipment origin, spare parts and technical know-how often trace back to China, and that is one reason why Chinese influence stays visible even when machines run overseas. Moves After The 2021 Ban Changed Where Rigs Run In 2021, China ordered a wide crackdown on crypto mining and exchanges. Many large operations left for places like Kazakhstan and the US. Some groups moved quickly; others split their fleets across borders. Reports say that certain operations continued in hidden forms within China or were run by owners who used overseas subsidiaries. That mix of visible relocation and obscured activity makes it harder to pin down exact shares. Ownership And Hidden Activity Based on reports, between 55% and 65% of global mining capacity can be linked back to Chinese roots when hardware origin and ownership are counted together. Early data from 2022 had placed China near 21% in some measures, showing how estimates shift with method and timing. Hashrate snapshots depend on factors such as IP allocation, pool membership and reported ownership. As a result, different groups produce different country shares, and the numbers should be seen as snapshots rather than fixed totals. Energy Patterns And Security Concerns Hydropower in Sichuan and coal in northern regions once helped make Chinese mining cheap. Those energy factors shaped the old geography of mining inside China. Now that many rigs moved, energy mixes have changed and emissions footprints vary by host country.

Some technicians have pointed to a triple bottom trading pattern around $3600, as well as the potential for a new accumulation reading from a Wycoff re-accumulation pattern which could lead to higher targets (notably $5125 at the 1.618 extension.

The investor mood is stabilizing, with an inflow of capital into the older assets, indicating that the extreme optimism is gaining ground among key tokens. Analysts believe that this early rotation may mark the beginning of a more robust crypto market recovery into November. Nevertheless, attention is also shifting towards exciting projects at the initial stages. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has come out as a presale gem with its emphasis on security, utility, and investor protection. Bitcoin (BTC) Holds $108,000 as Institutional Demand Returns Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $108,000 on Wednesday following rejection at resistance of $113,600 the day before. The mood of the investors is still skeptical, but on the positive side, with the mild inflows indicating that investors are back after selloffs. Source: TradingView In the United States, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered inflows of $477 million on Tuesday, a day after two weeks of outflows. The renewed institutional investor interest has contributed to price stabilisation and ignited initial momentum behind the wider Bitcoin market recovery. The macroeconomic news has also been a factor. The positive view of future trade talks between the two countries by President Donald Trump favored risk appetite but the presence of geopolitical uncertainty still kept upside potential in check. Technical indicators indicate that BTC stands above its major support at about $106,000, the RSI at 40, and the MACD at a wary note. Analysts believe that holding the support of more than $108,000 would draw new inflows and establish the pace of an altcoin rally, which would be positively needed in the entire industry. XRP Price Struggles Below $2.40 but Confidence Persists Ripple (XRP) is trading just below 2.40, as it remains under pressure following its failure to rise to 2.55 earlier this week. The token has experienced less involvement in derivatives, with Open Interest (OI) averaging as $3.76 billion, compared to more than $8 billion in the early months of October. Source: CoinGlass Although the momentum is weak, analysts believe XRP is a valuable indicator of investor sentiment in mid-cap altcoins. The OI weighted funding rate has become marginally negative, indicating caution rather than panic. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 40 demonstrates moderate inflows which indicate that traders are waiting to observe a potential rebound. The Death Cross signal between the 50-day and 100 day EMAs is still putting some pressure on prices, but analysts observe that the 2.50 mark would be broken and the accumulation would start again. Altogether, the performance of XRP corresponds to a skeptical yet positive projection as traders anticipate more extensive market recovery. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Verified Presale Gem in a Volatile Market Bitcoin and XRP are at the forefront of the market recovery, which preconditions a new wave of optimism among key assets. However, with volatility reminding traders of the dangers in untrusted projects, there is still one presale that shines through – MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts refer to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a presale gem due to its established emphasis on security and long-term utility. The project has just undergone an extensive HashEx audit, which ensured that its smart contract has no vulnerabilities and is immune to manipulation or unauthorized access. This external assurance has increased investor confidence and confirmed the technical design of the project. In an uncertain market, investors are moving towards projects that focus more on security and realistic functionality. As opposed to speculative presales riding on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE fosters trust by providing transparency, validated code, and having a clear roadmap with a usability focus. These attributes have made MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most admired early-stage opportunities of the year. Its audited background and practical use, according to analysts, may lead to a 100x return once the next bull cycle kicks off, making it a cannot-miss presale gem. Conclusion The fact that Bitcoin is stable at around $108,000 and XRP is gradually consolidating at under $2.40 is an indication that the market is starting to recover. The confidence is being enhanced by institutional inflows and low volatility, providing a favorable environment to both large and emerging cryptocurrencies. Simultaneously, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in the spotlight because of all the right reasons: security, utility, and proven transparency. Its audited design and investor-first style are changing how serious presales should appear. Analysts say these basics lend it the credibility to perform better in the upcoming cycle and establish its image as a legitimate presale gem before the market goes bullish once again.

This move, reported by Onchain Lens, involves a well-known Bitcoin OG (Original Gangster) who has a history of liquidating substantial holdings. For many in the crypto community, such a large deposit to an exchange is typically interpreted as a precursor to selling, potentially signaling a shift in market dynamics. What Does a Bitcoin Whale Deposit Signify for the Market? When a substantial amount of Bitcoin, particularly from an “OG” or long-term holder, moves to a centralized exchange, it often raises eyebrows. These large holders, often referred to as “whales,” possess enough capital to significantly influence market prices. Their actions are closely watched as they can indicate upcoming market trends. Intention to Sell: The primary interpretation is an intention to sell. Moving assets from cold storage or a private wallet to an exchange makes them readily available for trading. Increased Supply: A large influx of BTC onto exchanges increases the available supply, which, if met with insufficient demand, can put downward pressure on prices. Market Sentiment: Such a move can also impact broader market sentiment, leading other investors to either follow suit or exercise caution. The term “Bitcoin OG” refers to early adopters or long-term holders who have accumulated significant amounts of Bitcoin over the years. Their deep understanding of the market and often long-term perspective make their moves particularly impactful. This specific Bitcoin whale deposit adds another layer to the complex tapestry of market indicators. Analyzing the Impact of This Specific Bitcoin Whale Deposit The recent Bitcoin whale deposit of 100 BTC to Kraken is not an isolated incident for this particular entity. Onchain Lens has consistently tracked this OG’s movements, noting a pattern of liquidating holdings at various market junctures. This consistent behavior suggests a deliberate strategy rather than a random transaction. However, the timing of such a large transfer always warrants careful consideration. Historically, significant exchange deposits have often preceded periods of increased volatility. While not every deposit leads to an immediate price crash, the potential for a large sell-off introduces uncertainty. Traders and analysts frequently monitor on-chain data, like exchange inflows and outflows, to gauge potential market shifts. This specific Bitcoin whale deposit adds another layer to the complex tapestry of market indicators. Consider the broader market context. If the market is already fragile or experiencing a downturn, a large sell-off could exacerbate negative sentiment. Conversely, in a strong bull market, such a deposit might be absorbed more easily without a dramatic price impact. Therefore, understanding the current market mood is crucial when evaluating the potential effects of this transaction. This situation highlights the importance of on-chain analytics. Platforms like Onchain Lens provide invaluable insights into the movements of large holders, allowing investors to make more informed decisions. Tracking these “whales” helps to anticipate potential supply shocks and understand the convictions of long-term holders. How Should Investors React to a Major Bitcoin Whale Deposit? For everyday investors, a major Bitcoin whale deposit like this serves as a reminder to stay vigilant and informed. It’s not necessarily a signal to panic, but rather an encouragement to reassess personal investment strategies and risk exposure. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Market Reactions: Keep a close eye on Bitcoin’s price action immediately following such reports. Observe trading volumes and overall market sentiment. Review Your Portfolio: Consider whether your current portfolio allocation aligns with your risk tolerance, especially in periods of potential volatility. Understand the Source: Recognize that while exchange deposits often imply selling, there could be other reasons, such as moving funds for institutional services, rebalancing, or even preparing for derivatives trading. However, for a known liquidator, selling is the most probable intent. Practice Risk Management: Implement stop-loss orders or consider hedging strategies if you are concerned about potential downward price movements. The crypto market is inherently dynamic, and large transactions are a part of its ecosystem. While a Bitcoin whale deposit of this magnitude can certainly create ripples, the market’s overall resilience and ability to absorb such movements have grown significantly over time. It’s about understanding the implications and preparing accordingly, rather than reacting impulsively. The recent deposit of 100 BTC to Kraken by a seasoned Bitcoin OG underscores the constant interplay of supply and demand in the cryptocurrency market. This significant Bitcoin whale deposit , tracked by Onchain Lens, serves as a crucial data point for investors monitoring potential selling pressure. While the exact outcome remains to be seen, staying informed about such on-chain movements is vital for navigating the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets. Vigilance and a well-thought-out strategy are your best allies in anticipating and responding to the actions of major market players. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin OG? A Bitcoin OG, or “Original Gangster,” refers to an early adopter or long-term holder of Bitcoin who has accumulated a significant amount of the cryptocurrency, often from its nascent stages. Their actions are closely watched due to their substantial holdings and historical market insight. Why is a Bitcoin whale deposit to an exchange significant? A Bitcoin whale deposit to an exchange is significant because it typically indicates an intention to sell. Moving large amounts of Bitcoin from private wallets to an exchange makes it liquid and ready for trading, potentially increasing supply on the market and influencing price. Does this specific deposit mean Bitcoin’s price will drop? Not necessarily. While a large deposit often signals potential selling pressure, the actual impact depends on various factors, including overall market demand, current sentiment, and how the whale chooses to execute their trades. It introduces uncertainty but does not guarantee a price drop. How can I track Bitcoin whale movements? You can track Bitcoin whale movements through on-chain analytics platforms and services like Onchain Lens, Glassnode, or CryptoQuant. These platforms provide data on exchange inflows/outflows, large transactions, and wallet activity, offering insights into market trends. What is Kraken? Kraken is one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. It allows users to buy, sell, and trade various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, and is known for its robust security and range of trading features. Did you find this analysis helpful?

If so, you’ve likely noticed the exciting momentum building around Spot Bitcoin ETFs . These investment vehicles are making significant waves, recently demonstrating robust investor confidence with substantial inflows. It’s a clear signal that institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin is not just growing, but actively translating into tangible investments. What’s Driving the Latest Spot Bitcoin ETFs Inflow? The cryptocurrency world buzzed on October 24th as Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a remarkable net inflow of $90.73 million. This wasn’t a one-off event; it marked the second consecutive day of positive flows, according to data provided by TraderT. Such consistent positive movement often indicates a strengthening market sentiment and increasing comfort among investors with these regulated products. This steady stream of capital suggests a deeper, more sustained interest beyond short-term speculation. Fidelity’s Leadership: Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge, attracting a substantial $57.92 million in inflows. This highlights the firm’s growing influence in the digital asset space and its commitment to providing accessible investment avenues for its clients. Their proactive stance resonates with investors seeking reliable exposure. BlackRock’s Contribution: Not far behind, BlackRock’s IBIT saw significant interest, bringing in $32.81 million. BlackRock, a titan in traditional finance, continues to demonstrate its strategic pivot towards digital assets, reinforcing the legitimacy of Bitcoin as an investable asset class. Market Stability: While Fidelity and BlackRock dominated, other Spot Bitcoin ETFs showed no major outflows or inflows. This indicates that the positive trend is concentrated among key players, but also that the broader market for these products is stable, rather than experiencing widespread volatility. These inflows reflect a growing understanding and acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. Investors are increasingly looking for diversified portfolios, and Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a familiar, regulated pathway to achieve this diversification. Why Do These Spot Bitcoin ETFs Inflows Matter for the Market’s Future? These consistent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just numbers; they represent a critical shift in how investors are approaching Bitcoin. When large institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity see significant capital deployment, it lends immense credibility to the asset class. This institutional embrace can pave the way for broader adoption and potentially greater price stability for Bitcoin itself. It signifies a maturation of the market, moving beyond early adopters to a wider investment community. Moreover, the accessibility offered by these ETFs is a game-changer. Investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, such as setting up wallets, managing private keys, or navigating unfamiliar crypto exchanges. This simplicity lowers the barrier to entry for many, including those who are new to cryptocurrency but familiar with traditional investment vehicles like stocks and bonds. It democratizes access to Bitcoin for a broader audience. The increased liquidity provided by these ETFs is another crucial benefit. As more capital flows in, the ability to buy and sell these products efficiently improves, reducing slippage and enhancing market depth. This is particularly attractive for larger institutional investors who require robust liquidity for their substantial trades. Navigating the Landscape: Opportunities and Challenges for Spot Bitcoin ETFs The burgeoning success of Spot Bitcoin ETFs presents both exciting opportunities and notable challenges. On the opportunity side, the growing investor base can lead to increased market capitalization for Bitcoin, further solidifying its position in the global financial landscape. It also encourages innovation within the financial sector as more firms explore digital asset offerings. However, challenges persist. Regulatory scrutiny remains a constant factor, with governments worldwide grappling with how best to supervise this evolving asset class. Changes in regulatory stance could impact the operational freedom or even the existence of certain ETFs. Furthermore, market volatility, while inherent to cryptocurrencies, can still pose risks for investors in these products. Educating investors about these risks, alongside the potential rewards, is paramount for responsible growth. Another aspect to consider is the competitive landscape. As more firms enter the Spot Bitcoin ETF market, competition for investor capital will intensify. This could lead to lower fees, which benefits investors, but also pressure on profitability for providers. Ultimately, the long-term success will depend on factors like fee structures, performance, and the overall economic environment. The Broader Implications of Growing Spot Bitcoin ETFs Adoption The increasing popularity of Spot Bitcoin ETFs has several profound implications for the future of finance and cryptocurrency. Firstly, it bridges the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. As more institutions offer these products, Bitcoin becomes a more integrated part of mainstream investment portfolios. This integration can unlock trillions in institutional capital that was previously hesitant to enter the crypto space directly. Secondly, it could influence regulatory landscapes. The success and responsible management of these ETFs might encourage regulators to develop clearer frameworks for other digital assets, fostering a more secure and predictable environment for the entire crypto ecosystem. This transparency and oversight are crucial for long-term growth and investor protection, potentially leading to a more harmonized global approach to crypto regulation. Finally, these inflows often act as a barometer for investor sentiment. Sustained positive flows suggest a bullish outlook, indicating that investors believe Bitcoin has significant upside potential. This collective confidence can create a powerful feedback loop, attracting even more capital into the market, driving further innovation and infrastructure development within the crypto sphere. The recent $90.73 million net inflow into Spot Bitcoin ETFs , prominently led by Fidelity and BlackRock, underscores a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency journey. It signifies not just a passing trend, but a deepening integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial portfolios. As these investment vehicles continue to attract significant capital, they are set to redefine accessibility, foster institutional trust, and shape the future trajectory of digital asset adoption. Keep a close watch on these developments, as they hold the key to understanding the evolving landscape of global finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A: A Spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that holds actual Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning or managing the cryptocurrency itself, trading like a traditional stock on an exchange. Q2: Why are recent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs significant? A: Significant inflows, especially from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity, signal increasing institutional acceptance and investor confidence in Bitcoin. This often leads to greater market legitimacy, liquidity, and potential price stability for Bitcoin. Q3: Who were the main drivers of the $90.7 million inflow? A: Fidelity’s FBTC led the inflows with $57.92 million, closely followed by BlackRock’s IBIT, which attracted $32.81 million. These two firms accounted for the vast majority of the positive movement. Q4: How do Spot Bitcoin ETFs differ from Bitcoin futures ETFs? A: Spot Bitcoin ETFs directly hold Bitcoin, reflecting its current market price. Bitcoin futures ETFs, on the other hand, invest in futures contracts that bet on Bitcoin’s future price, which can lead to different price tracking and potential contango/backwardation issues. Q5: What are the benefits of investing in a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A: Benefits include ease of access through traditional brokerage accounts, regulatory oversight, elimination of the need for crypto wallets or exchanges, and enhanced liquidity compared to direct Bitcoin purchases for some investors.

Specifically, the latest data reveals a notable trend: spot ETH ETF outflows have been a significant talking point, particularly with BlackRock leading the charge. This pattern suggests a shift in investor sentiment that warrants a closer look. What’s Driving the Recent Spot ETH ETF Outflows? According to data compiled by TraderT, U.S. spot ETH ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $93.73 million (approximately 134.9 billion won) on October 23. This marked the third consecutive day of withdrawals, painting a clear picture of sustained selling pressure from some institutional players. Digging deeper into the specifics: BlackRock’s ETHA, a prominent player in the ETF market, saw over $100 million in net outflows, indicating a substantial divestment from this particular fund. Conversely, Grayscale’s Mini ETH managed to buck the trend, recording $7.4 million in net inflows. This highlights a divergence in strategy or investor preference among different funds. The remaining ETFs tracked reported no significant fund movement during this period, suggesting that the outflows were concentrated in specific products. These figures are crucial for understanding the immediate market sentiment surrounding Ethereum-backed exchange-traded funds. A Closer Look at Institutional Sentiment Towards Ethereum ETFs When major players like BlackRock experience substantial spot ETH ETF outflows , it often prompts questions about the underlying reasons. Is it simply profit-taking after a period of gains, or does it signal a more cautious outlook on Ethereum’s short-term prospects? Several factors could contribute to such movements: Market Rebalancing: Institutional investors frequently rebalance their portfolios to maintain desired asset allocations. This could involve selling off positions in one asset to invest in another or to reduce overall exposure to a particular sector. Macroeconomic Concerns: Broader economic indicators, such as inflation data, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical events, can influence risk appetite. Investors might shift capital from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies to more traditional safe havens. Fund-Specific Dynamics: The outflows from BlackRock’s ETHA could also be specific to that fund’s investor base or operational decisions, rather than a universal sentiment against all Ethereum ETFs. Grayscale’s inflows support this nuanced view. Understanding these potential drivers helps in interpreting the data beyond just the headline numbers. Why Do Spot ETH ETF Outflows Matter to You? While these movements are primarily institutional, they can have ripple effects across the entire crypto ecosystem. Significant spot ETH ETF outflows can sometimes lead to increased selling pressure on the underlying asset, Ethereum, potentially impacting its price. For individual investors, it is essential to: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on institutional flow data, as it provides insights into how large players are positioning themselves. Avoid Panic: Daily or short-term outflows are a normal part of market cycles. A single three-day streak does not necessarily dictate long-term trends. Consider Your Strategy: Align your investment decisions with your personal risk tolerance and long-term financial goals, rather than reacting impulsively to daily market noise. These institutional actions are a piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture. Navigating Volatility: Understanding ETF Dynamics Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) provide a convenient way for traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly owning the digital assets. However, like any investment vehicle, they are subject to market forces and investor sentiment. The recent trend of spot ETH ETF outflows highlights the inherent volatility and rapid shifts that can occur in the crypto market. It underscores the importance of a well-researched approach rather than chasing headlines. In conclusion, while the recent spot ETH ETF outflows , particularly from BlackRock, indicate a short-term cooling of institutional enthusiasm, it’s vital to consider these movements within the broader context of market dynamics and long-term Ethereum potential. The contrasting inflows into Grayscale’s Mini ETH also remind us that institutional sentiment is not monolithic. Keeping an informed and balanced perspective is key to navigating the exciting world of crypto investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot ETH ETF? A1: A spot ETH ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why are BlackRock’s ETHA outflows significant? A2: BlackRock is one of the largest asset managers globally. Significant outflows from their ETHA fund can indicate a shift in institutional sentiment or strategy, potentially influencing market perceptions of Ethereum. Q3: Do these outflows mean Ethereum’s price will drop? A3: Not necessarily. While institutional outflows can exert selling pressure, Ethereum’s price is influenced by many factors, including broader market trends, network developments, and retail investor sentiment. These outflows are one data point among many. Q4: How does Grayscale’s Mini ETH inflow compare to BlackRock’s outflow? A4: Grayscale’s Mini ETH recorded $7.4 million in net inflows, contrasting with BlackRock’s over $100 million in outflows. This shows that while some funds are experiencing withdrawals, others are attracting capital, indicating diverse institutional strategies. Q5: What should individual investors do in response to these trends? A5: Individual investors should focus on their long-term investment strategy, stay informed about market developments, and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term institutional flows. Diversification and risk management remain crucial. Enjoyed this breakdown of the latest institutional movements in the crypto market?

ETH is the only one currently demonstrating the scale, utility, and institutional acceptance to command and securely hold multi-trillion-dollar allocations, fundamentally redefining the future of global wealth preservation and growth. Why Ethereum Is The Foundational Role For Institutional Capital Ethereum has quietly become the final form of digital trust for institutions to store trillions of dollars. A market expert and entrepreneur, partnering with OKX and MEXC, Ted Pillows, has stated on the social media platform X that ETH decentralization is nearly impossible to replicate, a network that was largely community-funded, not VC-funded, and forged through proof-of-work (PoW). Related Reading: The Inevitable Convergence: How Ethereum Became The Settlement Layer For All Altcoins Furthermore, the reliability of ETH has been 100% uptime over 10 years of flawless operation and 16 successful upgrades. The ETH Layer 1 and Layer 2 architectures are designed to offer regulatory safety, where institutions can deploy compliant solutions. Meanwhile, the KYC-enabled Layer 2s do not compromise on the fundamental decentralization or security of the leading ETH blockchain. Maintaining A Buffer For Market Opportunities While Ethereum is a safe place for institutional investors to store trillions of dollars, analyst Luca has noted that the ETH price has shown strength as it bounced off the Weekly Bull Market Support Band, which has previously acted as a strong reversal over several weeks. This level also aligns with the high-timeframe support area marked in green, the same zone that served as a major resistance throughout most of 2024. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Rejection Near Resistance Zone — Risk Of Deeper Correction Rises Luca believes that due to this confluence, and as long as the price holds above this range, the broader market structure will continue to favor the upside. However, ETH still faces a critical test ahead. Until it breaks above the golden pocket between the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement Point of Interest (POIs), the same zone that triggered the last rejection, the analyst highlighted that the best approach is to stay somewhat cautious. He also added that investors should be ready for further consolidation within the high-timeframe accumulation range. As Luca has highlighted, the priority now is risk management. Avoid unnecessary leverage, don’t overexpose on short-term setups, and maintain a diversified portfolio with moderate exposure to defensive sectors. This will help ride out the volatility as ETH moves closer to the top of the cycle. While advocating for a cash buffer, the expert noted that if ETH breaks below the Weekly Bull Market Support Band, it would signal a potential deeper downside and justify hedging part of spot holdings to mitigate short-term risk.

Polymarket Odds Surge as Traders React to CZ’s Release,https://bitcoinist.com/will-trump-pardon-sam-bankman-fried-polymarket-odds/,"Speculation is heating up in crypto circles as betting markets Polymarket surged on the possibility that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) could receive a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. Following Trump’s surprise pardon of Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, odds on prediction platform Polymarket for an SBF pardon skyrocketed from 5.6% to over 12% within 12 hours, with total wagers surpassing $66,339 in Volume. Polymarket Bets on SBF Pardon Double After Trump’s CZ Clemency A Polymarket market tracking whether Bankman-Fried will be released from custody in 2025 has seen heightened activity, spiking from 4.3% to 15% before stabilizing around 12%. The renewed interest reflects growing curiosity over whether Trump’s pro-crypto stance could extend to other high-profile figures in the industry. Bankman-Fried, currently serving a 25-year prison sentence for fraud and conspiracy, is appealing his conviction, but analysts suggest no ruling is likely before the end of the year. That makes a presidential pardon his only realistic path to early release. Trump’s CZ Pardon Fuels Comparisons, and Controversy The surge in betting odds came shortly after Trump pardoned CZ, who had served four months for Anti-Money Laundering violations. Trump claimed Zhao was “persecuted by the Biden administration” and that his actions were “not even a crime.” Crypto analysts were quick to compare CZ’s relatively minor compliance breaches to Bankman-Fried’s sweeping fraud case, which involved misappropriating billions in customer deposits. “CZ’s wrongdoing was compliance-related and nowhere near the scale of SBF’s,” said crypto lawyer Sasha Hodder. Similarly, attorney Jake Chervinsky said he would be “truly shocked” if Trump granted Bankman-Fried clemency, citing his role as a “Democratic mega-donor” and the political optics surrounding FTX’s collapse. Political Ties Could Make or Break SBF’s Pardon Hopes Reports suggest that SBF and his family are quietly lobbying for leniency, with his parents reaching out to figures close to Trump. He has also made appearances on conservative media platforms, attempting to recast himself as a victim of political bias. However, unlike CZ, who has close ties to Trump’s circle through the World Liberty Financial crypto venture, Bankman-Fried lacks direct political connections. Experts believe that makes his chances of a pardon slim despite rising Polymarket odds. Nonetheless, the renewed speculation shows how Trump’s pro-crypto gestures are molding the narrative around justice and power in digital finance.

However, we decided to add a bit of positivism and asked four of the most popular AI-powered chatbots whether a rally to $1 is possible this quarter. ‘A Big Stretch’ PI currently trades at around $0.20 (per CoinGecko), representing a 30% decline on a monthly basis and a massive collapse from its all-time high of $3 registered in February this year. According to ChatGPT, rising to $1 before the end of 2025 is not entirely impossible but “a big stretch.” The chatbot estimated that reaching that milestone would require major catalysts, such as mainnet milestones and official listings on leading crypto exchanges. Perhaps a green light from Binance could trigger a significant rally. Earlier this year, the company asked its users whether they wanted to see PI available for trading on the platform. Despite the majority picking the “yes” option, it has remained silent on the matter. Grok also claimed that hitting the $1 mark during Q4 would be extremely difficult. The chatbot built into the social media platform X argued that this is only possible in the event of major partnerships between Pi Network and renowned industry players and broader market euphoria. “Realistically, expect sideways trading or modest gains to $0.30 – $0.40 if catalysts align, or dips to $0.15 – $0.18 on continued selling. PI’s strength lies in its community (biggest edge over rivals), but it needs proven utility to sustain value,” it added. Google’s AI chatbot Gemini sees little chance, too. It considers a small probability of PI soaring to almost $0.50 during Q4 and describes the $1 target as “a very optimistic case.” Gemini outlined the constant token unlocks as the primary hurdle for a price expansion. Data shows that over 120 million PI will be released in the next 30 days, giving investors the opportunity to cash out and thus potentially drag the valuation down. PI Token Unlocks, Source: piscan.io Not a Chance at All? Perplexity seems to be the biggest pessimist, predicting that PI won’t reach anywhere near $1 this quarter.

In a wide-ranging conversation on Messari’s “Fully Diluted” (Oct. 23) with host Dylan Bane and Messari researchers, Mumtaz framed Zcash as “secret Bitcoin”—a full-stack, zero-leakage design for money that Bitcoin’s earliest architects wanted but could not ship with 2010-era tooling. Zcash Proves Satoshi Right “The simplest conceptual way to understand this is that it’s a secret Bitcoin. It’s an encrypted Bitcoin,” Mumtaz said, invoking early forum posts from Satoshi and Hal Finney. “You have forum posts of Satoshi and Hal [Finney] saying things like, ‘If we knew how to add ZK proofs to Bitcoin, it would make it a better Bitcoin.’ But this is 2010 and they didn’t have the tech. And since then, the tech has been made.” In his telling, that lineage matters: Zcash inherits Bitcoin’s monetary template while replacing probabilistic obfuscation with “pure encryption.” if you want to understand why certain Bitcoin maxis are violently coping and lashing out about a small 3B coin they are threatened and have lost the plot Satoshi in 2010: if we could add ZK to Bitcoin, a much better BiTC would be possible. Sadly, I don’t know how. pic.twitter.com/2c4Y5SIhT6 — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) October 21, 2025 Mumtaz’s critique of “bolt-on” privacy was unambiguous. Privacy, he argued, is not a feature toggle; it is a system property that must be designed from the ground up to minimize information leakage across the entire stack—wallets, RPCs, mempools, validators, bridges, and application UX. “Privacy is not, in my view, something that can be bolted on,” he said. “You have to start from first principles and approach the problem from a vertically integrated full-stack solution.” He contrasted Zcash’s shielded pool with approaches like Monero and mixers that rely on decoys: “With Monero… you’re introducing probabilistic decoys… it’s that cups-and-ball game… with Zcash there is no obfuscation, it is a pure encryption—if the ball just didn’t exist at all.” The immediate catalyst behind Zcash’s rally, Mumtaz suggested, was less a single headline than a confluence: product-level UX improvements, a shifting policy backdrop, and attention—both supportive and hostile— compounding on social media . He pointed to the new Zashi wallet as a turning point: “People are actually able to use this new Zashi wallet to have some fun… sending each other private messages and shielding stuff and tipping each other.” He also argued the market had “over-indexed on extremely weird coins” while neglecting “privacy ideals,” leaving Zcash’s market cap “pathetically low” relative to its potential at the moment he began highlighting it. Regulation loomed over privacy the last few years. Mumtaz was blunt about the chilling effect of enforcement on privacy R&D: “People were scared of going to jail for even launching tokens, let alone writing privacy code. And there’s people still in jail for this.” He sees parts of the US moving in a friendlier direction under US President Donald Trump, while parts of Europe move toward surveillance and scanning of private messages. That divergence makes long-range forecasting difficult, he cautioned, but it reinforces why the industry should “guard zealously people’s right to privacy” as crypto’s legal status improves elsewhere. “There’s people in jail for writing privacy code, but not for launching scams. That seems like a pretty big problem that we need to correct.” Bitcoin, Solana And ZEC On the perennial question—why not add robust privacy to Bitcoin directly?—Mumtaz cited both governance inertia and technical realities. Bitcoin core changes are hard by design, he said, and privacy demands more than a script-level patch. “Unless you are designing with leaks minimized from the bottom up, the leaks kind of add up… It just takes one leak to compromise that privacy.” Zcash’s roadmap featured prominently. Mumtaz expects the Tachyon work spearheaded by Sean Bowe to address “state growth” and lay “foundations for scaling,” cleaning up legacy design choices that waste compute, such as brute-decoding notes. He called for pragmatic fee markets to mitigate spam and for improving mining decentralization as price action draws new hashrate. But he rejected, in its current form, the “Crosslink” hybrid PoW/PoS finality proposal: “It’s a bad idea… With a privacy system especially, the more moving pieces you introduce, the more attack surface increases… It’s unclear to me what exactly you’re gaining from this other than kind of a new finality time.” If given a token-holder vote, he said he would vote against it unless substantially revised. Mumtaz repeatedly returned to an “atomic unit” framing of privacy: information leakage. He extended that lens to bridges and cross-ecosystem liquidity. Helius helped bridge ZEC exposure into Solana via NEAR, but he stressed users give up Zcash’s privacy when they hold it on Solana. “Once that asset is on Solana, you don’t have the privacy benefits… You can bridge it back and deposit in the shielded pool… then you get the privacy back, but while you’re on Solana you’re not going to have the same privacy as the private blockchain.” The utility, for now, is market access and DeFi composability rather than end-to-end confidentiality.

The objective is to ratchet the floor higher each cycle by converting narrative into durable engineering and sensible legislation. “It’s on the builders… to use that momentum… to actually drive forward sensible legislation and harden the engineering of these systems such that they endure in scale and are usable for many people.” Asked to handicap the 2030 leaderboard, he demurred on precise ordering but volunteered a long-horizon view in which Zcash belongs in the conversation alongside Bitcoin and Solana: “If you were to tell me 20 years then I’m going to say Bitcoin, Solana, ZEC.” At press time, ZEC traded at $267.",Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|btc|Helius Labs CEO|Mert Mumtaz|ZCash|Zcash News|ZCash Price|ZEC|ZEC News|ZEC price,EN,0,0,BTC|SOL|ZEC|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 04:00:19

In a wide-ranging conversation with Real Vision’s Raoul Pal, the pair frame the current rally—and what comes next—through the lens of policy error, structural deficits, sticky inflation, and the slow-rolling migration of institutional and sovereign portfolios into digital assets. The Debasement Trade Powers The Crypto Bull Run Morehead’s starting point is blunt: “We have full employment. Inflation is debasing our assets by 3% a year… and they’re cutting rates. Like, it’s crazy.” He calls 2020–2021 “a policy error”—“there was a time where inflation was 8%, and the Fed Funds rate was zero”—and says easing into today’s backdrop “when everything’s booming” undermines the monetary check on “record fiscal deficits.” The consequence, he argues, is that price levels across real assets look high not because they are rallying independently, but because the denominator is falling: “It’s the price of paper money that’s plummeting.” Related Reading: Is The Crypto Bull Run Over? Lekker Capital CIO Warns ‘Don’t Miss The Forest’ Pal extends the frame to a single macro factor. “We use [Global Macro Investor’s] total global liquidity index as our benchmark for debasement. The Nasdaq, since 2012, has a 97.5% correlation, and Bitcoin is about 90%.” In his words, “None of it matters. It’s all one trade.” The implication is a regime where liquidity and debasement overwhelm the usual cross-asset nuance: “It’s the greatest macro trade of all time.” That regime, in Morehead’s view, also explains why adoption keeps broadening. The pair note how the “debasement trade” has migrated from crypto-native circles into bank research. “JP Morgan’s talking about it. And I got an email from Goldman today, the debasement trade,” Morehead says. “I’ve been talking about it for 12 years.” Pal adds that even large banks “openly” talk about currency debasement now, while clients are being offered wider access to crypto exposure. The wedge, they contend, remains institutional under-allocation. “How can you have a bubble nobody owns?” Morehead asks. “The median institutional investor’s exposure to crypto and blockchain ventures is literally 0.0.” Asked where steady-state allocation could land, he points to “8 or 10” percent over time, echoing Pal’s observation that many family offices that start at 2% “end up being 20% really fast” as price action mechanically increases weightings and conviction follows. Morehead also sees policy politics and geopolitics accelerating adoption. He argues the US election reset a regulatory headwind—“we went from… aggressively negative… to being extremely positive”—unlocking public pensions and sovereign funds that “got scared away in 2022” after the FTX/Luna/Celsius cascade and high-profile enforcement cases. He goes further, sketching a sovereign “arms race” for reserve Bitcoin: US holdings via seizures, “roughly the same” in China, and GCC states “aggressively getting into the blockchain space,” with room for acquisitions “tiny compared to balance sheets.” In his phrasing, if multiple blocs each target million-coin stockpiles, supply dynamics could “squeeze up like a watermelon seed.” Why This Crypto Bull Run Extends Into 2026 If liquidity and adoption anchor the bull case, both still respect crypto’s cyclicality. Morehead has modeled four-year dynamics around halvings and says Pantera’s prior cycle targets hit with eerie precision: “We forecast… Bitcoin would hit $118,542 on August 11th, 2025. And it did… one day [early].” He also notes past peaks coincided with celebratory “events”—the 2017 CME futures listing and 2021 Coinbase direct listing—followed by ~85% drawdowns. Yet he argues “this time” may be meaningfully extended by the policy and allocation backdrop: “The regulatory changes in the US, I think just trump everything… I think the next six to 12 months are still a big rally.” Pal, while acknowledging the internet’s penchant for hanging forecasters, concurs: “I think it’s going to extend.” Related Reading: Russia’s New Crypto Framework Could Redefine Global Trade Amid Sanctions Pressure The social dimension of adoption runs through the conversation. Debasement’s distributional effects have made housing and rents the stickiest CPI components—“35% of [core CPI] is shelter,” Morehead says—pushing younger cohorts toward hard assets. Meanwhile, the “virality rate of crypto is like 95%,” he claims: “you get a smart person… to think about it for an hour, they’re all like, ‘Oh yeah, I should buy some crypto.’” Evangelists matter, too: “Michael Saylor has done a great job. He has Messianic following… Tom Lee [on ETH]… We’re gonna endeavor to do that on Solana.” Visibility through ETFs, DATs, and media segments pulls newcomers into the funnel, where small initial slices tend to scale. As Pal puts it, investors who lack exposure feel “like you’re short the upside calls.” I love it when technology, crypto, and macro come together in someone’s journey… and there’s no one better than my dear friend @dan_pantera, an OG in the space! Please enjoy pic.twitter.com/ShZAd2tB3u — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) October 23, 2025 For all the optimism, the macro warning lights stay on in the background: structural US deficits “literally in the best of times,” a monetary-fiscal loop trapped between refinancing needs and price stability, and a demographic drag on productivity that leaves AI-driven gains still ahead of the curve. “Debasing your fiat currency against everybody else’s fiat currency is a race to the bottom,” Morehead cautions. In that world, gold and crypto function as life rafts: “That’s why everything’s at record prices… except for paper money.” Both men close by zooming out. The internet is “53 years old and they’re still doing cool internet companies,” Morehead says; Bitcoin turning 17 means the asset class remains a teenager. The majority of institutions “still have 0.0” exposure. If the “one trade” persists—liquidity up, fiat down, adoption rising—then the path of least resistance, in their telling, still points higher. Or as Morehead compresses the thesis into a single line: “If you hold crypto for four or five years, I think it’s like 90% that you make money… It is that simple.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.7 trillion.

The new platform enables participating banks to create tokens that represent insured deposits. This means they can transfer traditional bank money onto a blockchain while maintaining all the standard protections and complying with regulations. Analysts refer to the new platform as a solution for real-world transactions Sources have acknowledged that Custodia and Vantage’s setup ensures tokens strictly adhere to US banking rules and comply with the GENIUS Act . This crypto legislation allows specific bank-issued stablecoins to be treated as deposit instruments rather than securities. These tokens imitate the characteristics of digital dollars that can change depending on the location they are situated. For instance, in a participating bank, they act like regular tokenized deposits , completely insured by the FDIC, and follow banking rules. Nonetheless, they function like a stablecoin when they shift to another institution or wallet. During an interview, Caitlin Long, the founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, weighed in on the topic of discussion. Long pointed out that the network handles these changes using a patent-pending protocol that integrates both an on-chain oracle and off-chain operational controls. She also mentioned that the platform utilizes Infinant’s APIs and ledger infrastructure to facilitate conversions between different forms. “The crucial point is that the same token, created through the same smart contract, can change who is responsible for it and its regulatory status as it goes through its life cycle without needing to be redeemed or converted,” the CEO of Custodia Bank explained. Meanwhile, unlike the previous proof-of-concept that tested Vantage’s Avit token on Ethereum, analysts express that this new version is designed for real-world transactions. Dan Dadybayo calls for efficiency in the banking industry When questioned about the underlying infrastructure, Long stated that the platform operates on a permissionless network. She also highlighted that three different trial transactions had already been made using Ethereum in March, and work is underway for Bitcoin. According to the CEO of Custodia Bank, this model demonstrates how Custodia and Vantage are committed to eliminating obstacles rather than creating new ones. Following the CEO’s remarks, analysts stated that this approach for open access and interoperability appears to be a step in the opposite direction of what has become the norm. They observed that major stablecoin issuers and payment platforms either build their own chains or support unique systems. In the meantime, an FAQ provided by Long in response to questions from reports pointed out that, “While many stablecoin issuers rely on complex legal structures that create their own issues, we are using a legal framework that promotes interoperability within the law.” The two banks are building a compliant settlement layer that moves insured dollars at blockchain speed and offers the same level of safety, Dan Dadybayo, research and strategy lead at Unstoppable Wallet, said. Dadybayo further explained that the Fed can continue monitoring transactions through participating banks. However, he acknowledged that for the first time, smaller institutions can compete on efficiency and programmability. According to him, if more individuals adopt this approach, they could quietly transform the current network into a parallel payments network built from within the system, rather than against it.

As the top meme coin to buy now, this project merges meme culture with serious tokenomics, creating a blend that’s equal parts fun and financially fierce. Its Stage 5 presale, priced at $0.00006584, has already raised over $450K, with 1,500+ holders ready to charge. The ROI projection soars above 9,256%, giving early investors a ticket straight to the moon. Imagine this: an investor dropping $15,000 at Stage 5 would see their bag balloon to $1.4M, when the price hits $0.00616. That’s financial freedom knocking, peanuts compared to the potential payoff later. The MoonBull presale isn’t just hype; it’s a carefully planned 23-stage model that builds scarcity and excitement with every step. Voting Power: Giving the Community a Voice MoonBull’s governance kicks in at Stage 12, where 1 $MOBU equals 1 vote. This system empowers holders to decide the project’s path – from burns to campaigns. No middlemen, no gimmicks. Just pure decentralized democracy. This transparent structure enhances community trust, proving why MoonBull truly earns its place as the top meme coin to buy now. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Roaring Giant Ready to Charge BullZilla stands tall in its 7th presale stage, boasting over $960,000 raised and more than 3,200 holders. Its current price sits at $0.00018573, projected to rise to $0.0001924 in Stage 8A. For early joiners, the ROI is already 3,130%, and those who entered at Stage 7D see potential gains of 2,738% up to listing. It’s no wonder many in the crypto community are keeping their eyes glued to this bullish beast. BullZilla’s momentum mirrors the energy of meme coins during their prime – loud, confident, and untamed. Yet, compared to MoonBull’s structured scarcity and deflationary model, BullZilla runs a more traditional hype engine. Still, the community support is undeniable. Many investors view it as a promising project, but the top meme coin to buy now tag might just tip toward MoonBull given its sustainable approach and stronger presale model. La Culex ($CULEX): The Hum Before the Storm La Culex sits in Stage 2: Midnight Hum, with a current price of $0.00002104, aiming for $0.00002274 next. It’s raised around $6,000, signaling early traction. The project blends mystery and anticipation, drawing in curious investors who sense potential under the radar. Though La Culex is still small compared to the charging giants, it could surprise the market if momentum builds in later stages. However, compared to the MoonBull presale, La Culex’s pace feels more cautious. While it’s gathering steam, it lacks the structured tokenomics and staking rewards that make MoonBull the top meme coin to buy now. Still, early backers who believe in the “slow and steady” approach might find its low entry point attractive. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, BullZilla and La Culex show remarkable diversity in the meme coin landscape. BullZilla charges ahead with its high ROI and strong presale backing, while La Culex quietly builds buzz through subtle growth. Both showcase the wild spectrum of crypto – from roaring bulls to humming underdogs – but neither seems to match the calculated power of MoonBull’s tokenomics and presale strategy. For those searching for the top meme coin to buy now, the edge clearly tilts toward MoonBull. MoonBull is rewriting the playbook for meme coins. With deflationary mechanics, community-driven governance, and a 95% APY staking reward, it’s built to last beyond the hype. The MoonBull presale is more than a moment – it’s a movement. Early entrants can still secure life-changing gains before the final stages close. Join the herd before the gates lock. MoonBull isn’t just the top meme coin to buy now – it’s the bull leading the charge toward the next crypto moonshot.

But after pioneering a comprehensive legal framework for yen-pegged stablecoins, its bank-dependent structure has been called out for limiting innovation in the decentralized finance sector. In Asia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan are in the spotlight for rolling out licensing rules for stablecoin operators. While regulators celebrate Japan’s legal clarity, its inward-looking framework could leave the country lagging behind regional peers like Singapore and Hong Kong, warns Professor of Economics Sayuri Shirai at Keio University. Under Japan’s current framework , Shirai doesn’t see momentum for stablecoins taking off. She explains that Hong Kong’s regulations are much more stringent than Japan’s. But they are also more open to non-banks and international players issuing stablecoins, which is a significant difference. “Hong Kong and Singapore are open to outsiders as long as they meet regulations. Also from the beginning, they have been thinking about developing tokenized assets and cross-border transactions. But Japan from the beginning is very domestic.” Stablecoin rules prioritize domestic transactions Japan’s “pioneer” status stems from the 2023 amendment to the Payment Services Act (PSA), which restricted stablecoin eligibility to banks, trust banks and licensed wire transfer providers. Non-bank stablecoin issuers are required to partner with Japanese banks. The framework is among the most robust worldwide in terms of user protection. The amendment introduced strict safeguards such as full trust protection of reserves, redemption guarantees and periodic transparency reports. Associate Professor Tomonori Yuyama at Senshu University’s Faculty of Commerce said the framework reflects Japan’s emphasis on financial stability. “Stablecoins resemble digital deposits and involve custodial responsibility so it makes sense that only highly-regulated issuers are allowed. Given that stability is paramount and full backing is mandatory, limiting issuance to major financial institutions is a valid measure.” Yuyama also warns that Japan’s yen-backed stablecoins could disconnect it from global blockchain ecosystems. “Japan’s yen-based stablecoins circulate within closed systems and can’t connect with global DeFi or Web3 ecosystems, putting Japan’s digital economy at risk of isolation.” Japan’s regulatory framework has effectively barred major global stablecoins such as Tether and USDC. Since foreign issuers lack domestic licenses, the tokens can’t legally move through Japan’s regulated exchanges or payment networks. Yuyama said the restriction reflects Japan’s preference for consumer protection even at the cost of limiting access to global digital markets. “Major global stablecoins such as Tether and USDC are practically unusable in Japan. Ideally, a system enabling their safe use would be desirable. But, since these issuers are foreign, Japanese users might not be legally protected which poses a user-protection issue.” A lack of strong consumer demand Japan has embraced new rules to bring stablecoins under official oversight, but few people seem eager to use them. Professor Sayuri Shirai of Keio University explains that consumers already enjoy a variety of digital payment options, from PayPay to Apple Pay , that make cashless life accessible. In a country where nearly a third of citizens are over 65, Shirai said many consumers are content with existing payment options which leaves little momentum for new digital currencies to take hold. Stablecoins also lack appreciation potential and are yet to offer a compelling alternative, according to Shirai. Japan’s stablecoin issuers search for profit Stablecoin issuers in Japan face a tougher path to profitability compared to their counterparts in the United States. Associate Professor Tomonori Yuyama at Senshu University said issuers rely mainly on interest income from reserve assets, a model supported by higher U.S. yields but constrained by Japan’s less than 1% interest rates. While some stablecoin issuers may plan to earn fees from payments or remittance services, Japan’s model requires large transaction volumes. Strict rules mandating full reserve backing and investment in low-risk assets further limit returns, Yuyama said. Japan’s underdeveloped tokenized-asset market Shirai emphasizes that Japan must develop its tokenized asset market if it wants stablecoins to gain traction. She argues that, at present, there is almost no functioning market for tokenized assets in Japan unlike the United States. Japan’s asset tokenization market was valued at 500 million in 2022 but it’s projected to reach 4.1 billion in 2030. Japan has written the laws for turning property and securities into digital tokens, but the market has yet to follow. Yuyama said Japan’s legal groundwork for asset tokenization is largely complete and some sectors such as real estate tokens are already operating. What’s missing, he said, is adoption and technical integration. Investors who can already buy bonds or mutual funds online don’t yet feel any added value from tokenization itself. Yuyama said there is also a missing link between yen-backed stablecoins and real-time Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) settlement. It’s an upgrade that could unlock liquidity and scale for Japan’s token markets. Shirai said without a market where financial instruments like real estate, green bonds, or artwork can be represented on blockchain, there is no reason for consumers to use stablecoins. “If Japan’s Financial Services Agency wants people to use stablecoins they also have to develop a market for that,” since the two are interdependent.

Related Reading: HYPE Soars Beyond $40 Following Robinhood Listing: What’s Next For Hyperliquid’s Price? After months of consolidation, ADA’s price action is forming what analysts describe as a “textbook breakout setup.” The token currently trades around $0.65, below key moving averages, but with indicators pointing toward an imminent reversal. Cardano’s fundamentals continue to strengthen. The network recently surpassed 115 million transactions, signaling steady ecosystem growth despite broader market weakness. This achievement, combined with the rollout of Cardano domain names and anticipation for the Ouroboros Leios upgrade, builds more confidence. Technical Indicators Flash Buy as Bulls Regain Control Technically, ADA is nearing a decisive point. Chart analysts note a falling wedge pattern forming on the daily timeframe, a historically bullish setup that often precedes explosive moves. A break above the $0.79–$0.80 resistance could pave the way for a swift rally toward $1.10, and eventually, the projected $2.50 target. Momentum oscillators are beginning to turn upward, while futures market open interest is climbing, an indication that institutional traders are re-entering positions. Golden-cross signals between shorter and longer-term moving averages further validate the bullish bias, suggesting that accumulation is taking place at current levels.

Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Ecosystem Growth and Institutional Interest Add Momentum Beyond the charts, Cardano’s ecosystem expansion continues to attract institutional and developer attention.The RWA (Real-World Asset) initiative, valued at over $10 million, and privacy-focused Midnight sidechain airdrops are driving renewed engagement. Meanwhile, analysts argue that ADA’s low gas fees and ongoing DeFi integrations position it as a strong alternative to Ethereum for scalable applications. Experts predict that if ADA breaks through resistance levels and maintains momentum, the path toward $2.50 or even $3.00 could unfold over the next market cycle.

Will CZ Reclaim His CEO Position At Binance? Industry observers suggest that this major development for CZ and Binance as a whole could pave the way for Zhao to resume leadership roles and consolidate Binance’s US operations. According to Bloomberg, the company is exploring several options, including the possibility of integrating Binance.US into its global operations or having its global exchange enter the US market, as indicated by a source familiar with the matter. Related Reading: Binance Founder Suggests President Trump Could Be Satoshi Nakamoto In Latest Statement “This cycle is largely being driven by U.S. institutional investors and investment products, and that’s precisely where Binance can now shift its focus,” stated Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. He added that the US affiliate will likely be reintegrated into Binance’s global ecosystem, providing US investors with direct access to the platform’s “deep liquidity and comprehensive derivatives offerings.” Attention is now focused on whether Zhao will attempt to reclaim the CEO role he previously stepped away from. In recent weeks, he updated his profile on social media platform X from “ex-Binance” to simply “@Binance,” a subtle change that has fueled speculation about his intentions. However, not everyone believes Zhao is eager to return as CEO. David Namdar, who manages a BNB treasury company backed by Zhao’s family office, commented, “I think he is operating with more of a weight off his shoulders not running the exchange. I’d be surprised if he stepped back into that role.” Industry Leaders Predict Increased Involvement Patrick Horsman, chief investment officer of digital asset treasury (DAT) firm Applied DNA Sciences, which invests in Binance Coin (BNB), emphasized that Binance’s technology, liquidity, and relatively low fees could position it as a dominant player in the American crypto market. However, Bloomberg highlights that the pardon may not only enhance Zhao’s personal prospects but also unlock new opportunities for Binance’s global expansion.

Cosmo Jiang, general partner at Pantera, anticipates that Zhao will become “more involved with Binance’s operations” now that he has received a pardon. “Whenever a founder returns to a company, it’s always an invigorating moment; you typically see more growth and better execution,” he noted.

This comes in after a week of volatility that has seen BTC go below support levels. However, despite the bullish momentum, Tom Lee, chairman of BitMine, warns the flagship cryptocurrency could still endure a dramatic correction of up to 50%. Institutional Support Supports the Rise Bitcoin’s latest climb toward the $110,000-plus range is triggered by a significant uptick in institutional interest. Products such as the IBIT (iShares Bitcoin Trust) offer investors easier exposure to Bitcoin via traditional brokerage platforms. Additionally, broader regulatory clarity has enabled major banks and asset managers to deepen their crypto strategies. This shift suggests that Bitcoin is steadily transitioning from a niche speculative asset to a more mainstream investment vehicle. The rally has triggered renewed optimism around price breakout potential toward the $120,000-plus domain. Tom Lee Sounds Caution, A 50% Bitcoin (BTC) Drop Could Be Next However, Tom Lee offers a cautionary perspective that many market participants may be overlooking. Tom argues that despite institutional adoption, Bitcoin remains highly correlated with traditional equity markets. In his words: “If the S&P is down 20 %, Bitcoin could be down 40 %.” Drawing on this dynamic, Lee maintains that a full 50 % collapse remains entirely possible. The reasoning? Bitcoin has historically amplified stock-market moves. While ETFs and institutional flows may soften the narrative, they do not eliminate Bitcoin’s structural volatility. Lee also points out the breakdown of the classical four-year Bitcoin market cycle, warning that we may be entering a “longer cycle” with more extreme drawdowns. His forecast still anticipates Bitcoin reaching between $200,000 and $250,000 by year-end, yet a 50 % correction from those levels would land $100,000–$125,000. If the current $110,000 peak is already the top, a fall toward roughly $55,000 is within his scenario. What This Means for BTC Investors For investors tracking Bitcoin’s trajectory , the mix of bullish institutional signals and bearish risk warnings demands a balanced approach. On one hand, the ETF infrastructure and regulatory progress offer clear legitimacy for Bitcoin as an asset class. On the other, the risk of sharp drawdowns remains under-appreciated, suggesting that future volatility could continue to define Bitcoin’s long-term growth trajectory.

The purchase of GTreasury , in particular, positions Ripple to enter the corporate treasury market, where trillions of dollars in idle capital are managed. By linking GTreasury’s platform with Ripple Prime’s liquidity and repo market services, the company appears intent on creating more efficient pathways for managing and deploying corporate funds. Commentary from market observers has highlighted this approach as a defining shift in how crypto companies integrate with traditional finance. One X user, BTCPeakHub, noted that Ripple’s model represents cooperation rather than competition — connecting treasury systems to blockchain-powered liquidity solutions. The combination could allow enterprises to activate dormant capital while maintaining compliance and risk management standards. This direction marks a critical step toward embedding blockchain capabilities directly within the structure of global financial operations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Leadership Message and Strategic Focus In outlining Ripple’s trajectory, Garlinghouse stated that the company’s acquisitions are strategically aligned with its long-term objective of establishing an interconnected global value network. His comments underscored that Ripple’s acquisitions are not isolated business moves, but part of a coordinated effort to integrate custody, liquidity, and treasury functions into a unified ecosystem. Most notably, Garlinghouse issued a direct reminder to the XRP community and investors about the asset’s enduring relevance. He emphasized that XRP remains central to everything Ripple builds and continues to serve as the foundation of its technological and financial framework. The statement was viewed as a reaffirmation of commitment to the token’s pivotal role even as Ripple extends its reach into broader financial sectors. Outlook for Ripple and XRP Ripple’s strategic expansion into traditional finance reflects its intent to bridge institutional operations with blockchain efficiency. As these integrations evolve, the company’s technology stack could redefine how liquidity moves across corporate and financial systems. Still, Garlinghouse’s emphasis on XRP as the cornerstone of Ripple’s ecosystem remains the clearest message from this phase of growth — a signal that no matter how far Ripple expands, XRP continues to sit at the heart of its mission and development.

Recently, the world of crypto perpetual futures witnessed a staggering event: over $100 million in forced liquidations within just 24 hours. This significant sum represents a sharp reminder of the inherent volatility and risks associated with leveraged trading in digital assets. For many traders, this period was marked by rapid, unexpected losses, highlighting the delicate balance between potential gains and swift reversals in the fast-paced crypto landscape. What Triggered These Massive Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations? During the intense 24-hour period, a substantial wave of forced liquidations swept through the crypto perpetual futures market. These weren’t minor corrections but significant position closures. The figures reveal the scale of the impact across major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC): A total of $41.19 million in BTC positions were liquidated. Interestingly, short positions accounted for 60.99% of this total, indicating that many traders betting on a price decline were caught off guard by an upward movement or unexpected stability. Ethereum (ETH): Even more pronounced, Ethereum saw $49.23 million in liquidations. Here too, short positions dominated, making up 61.77% of the total, suggesting a similar market dynamic to Bitcoin. Other Altcoins (H): A category denoted as ""H"" (likely representing a basket or specific altcoins) experienced $9.81 million in liquidations. A striking 72.64% of these were short positions, underscoring a strong market move against bearish bets in this segment. These figures paint a clear picture of market movements that strongly impacted traders holding short positions, forcing them to close out their leveraged bets as prices moved against their predictions. Demystifying Crypto Perpetual Futures: A Quick Explainer To truly grasp the gravity of these liquidations, it’s essential to understand what crypto perpetual futures are. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures do not. They allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning the underlying asset. They are popular because they enable high leverage, meaning traders can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. However, this leverage is a double-edged sword. While it amplifies potential profits, it also magnifies potential losses. Traders use these instruments to bet on whether a cryptocurrency’s price will go up (long position) or down (short position). Funding rates are a unique mechanism in perpetual futures that help keep the contract price close to the spot price, adding another layer of complexity. How Do Forced Liquidations Occur in Crypto Perpetual Futures? A forced liquidation happens when a trader’s margin balance falls below the minimum requirement set by the exchange. This typically occurs when the market moves sharply against their leveraged position. For example, if a trader takes a long position on Bitcoin with 10x leverage, a relatively small price drop in BTC can wipe out their initial margin. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange. The high percentage of short liquidations in this recent event suggests a scenario where prices either stabilized unexpectedly or experienced a sudden upward bounce. Traders betting on a decline were therefore caught on the wrong side of the market, leading to these swift and significant closures. Why Should You Care About Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations? These large-scale liquidations are more than just numbers; they serve as critical indicators of market sentiment and potential future movements. Firstly, they highlight periods of extreme volatility and market instability. Such events can trigger a cascade effect, where one liquidation leads to another, further intensifying price swings. Secondly, understanding liquidation data helps traders gauge market positioning. A high number of short liquidations, as seen recently, can indicate a ""short squeeze"" where upward price pressure forces bearish traders to buy back their positions, further propelling prices higher. For investors, these events underscore the importance of risk management. While crypto perpetual futures offer exciting opportunities, the amplified risks demand a cautious and well-informed approach. It’s crucial to employ stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging, especially in such unpredictable markets. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Insights for Traders In light of recent events in the crypto perpetual futures market, traders should consider several strategies to mitigate risks. Firstly, always prioritize robust risk management. This includes setting clear stop-loss levels to limit potential losses on leveraged positions. Secondly, avoid excessive leverage. While tempting, higher leverage exponentially increases your liquidation risk. Thirdly, diversify your portfolio. Spreading investments across different assets can help cushion the impact of sudden price movements in any single cryptocurrency. Moreover, staying informed about market trends and fundamental analysis is paramount. Understanding the broader economic landscape and specific project developments can provide valuable context for your trading decisions. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider starting with smaller positions when experimenting with high-risk instruments like perpetual futures. The recent wave of over $100 million in crypto perpetual futures liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and rapid shifts within the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be daunting, they also offer invaluable lessons for traders and investors alike. Understanding the mechanics of these leveraged products and implementing sound risk management strategies are crucial for navigating this exciting yet challenging financial frontier. Staying informed and exercising caution will always be your best allies in the world of digital assets.

This initiative, linked to the Trump family, has recently made headlines with a substantial issuance that’s caught the attention of market observers and crypto enthusiasts alike. Understanding the implications of this development is crucial for anyone following the decentralized finance space. What is the Trump DeFi Project: WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI)? WorldLibertyFinancial, or WLFI, positions itself within the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. DeFi aims to replicate traditional financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, using blockchain technology, thereby removing intermediaries like banks. The involvement of a prominent family like the Trumps in this space adds a unique dimension, often drawing significant scrutiny and interest. WLFI’s entry into DeFi suggests an ambition to leverage blockchain for financial innovation. However, like any project in this rapidly evolving sector, it faces inherent complexities and regulatory considerations.

Potential Liquidity: Such a large issuance could be intended to provide substantial liquidity for various operations within the WLFI platform, facilitating trading, lending, or other financial services. Expansion Plans: It might also signal ambitious expansion plans, suggesting that WLFI is preparing for significant growth or new feature rollouts that require a robust treasury. Market Confidence: From a project perspective, a large issuance could be a statement of confidence in its underlying technology and future trajectory, aiming to attract more users and investors. However, the specifics of USD1, its backing, and its intended use cases within the WLFI ecosystem are critical details that the community will be watching closely.

For the Trump DeFi project , these challenges are amplified by its high-profile association. Key Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Projects associated with public figures often attract more attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to stricter compliance requirements. Security Risks: DeFi platforms are frequent targets for exploits and hacks. Ensuring robust security measures is non-negotiable for protecting user assets. Public Perception: The project must continuously manage public perception, addressing skepticism and building a reputation for reliability and integrity. Opportunities: Brand Recognition: The association brings immediate global recognition, potentially accelerating user adoption if the platform delivers value.

Nonetheless, its presence adds another layer of institutional and political interest to the DeFi space. This could: Increase Mainstream Awareness: Draw more traditional investors and media attention to DeFi, potentially leading to increased adoption. Influence Regulatory Debates: The project’s activities could become a talking point in ongoing discussions about crypto regulation, especially regarding stablecoins and DeFi protocols. Set Precedents: How WLFI handles compliance, security, and transparency could set precedents for future high-profile entrants into the DeFi market. The crypto community will be observing closely to see if this project can carve out a significant niche and influence the direction of decentralized finance. The Future of WLFI and the Trump DeFi Project The road ahead for WorldLibertyFinancial is undoubtedly an interesting one. The initial issuance of 300 million USD1 marks a bold step, but it is just the beginning.

Community Engagement: Can it foster a strong, engaged community that supports its vision and contributes to its governance (if applicable)? Regulatory Compliance: Will it successfully adapt to the evolving regulatory landscape, ensuring legal and operational stability? Security and Reliability: Can it maintain a secure and reliable platform, safeguarding user assets and data? The Trump DeFi project represents a fascinating intersection of traditional influence and cutting-edge financial technology. Its journey will offer valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie at the forefront of the decentralized revolution. In conclusion, the Trump DeFi project , WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI), has certainly made its mark with the issuance of 300 million USD1. This move underscores the growing interest from diverse sectors in the decentralized finance space. While offering significant opportunities for innovation and growth, WLFI also faces considerable challenges related to regulation, security, and public perception. Its trajectory will be a compelling case study for the future of high-profile entities entering the complex world of DeFi, potentially shaping how we view the convergence of traditional influence and digital finance.

Last week, Bitdeer revealed its latest operational update, offering a transparent look into its Bitdeer Bitcoin mining output and strategic asset management. This insight is crucial for anyone tracking the pulse of the digital asset space. What Did Bitdeer’s Latest Bitdeer Bitcoin Mining Report Unveil? Bitdeer, known for its significant presence in the Bitcoin mining sector, shared its weekly performance through its official X account. The company successfully mined a total of 123.4 BTC within the past week. This consistent output underscores their robust infrastructure and operational efficiency. However, the report also detailed a strategic decision: the sale of 70 BTC from their mined amount. This move provides a glimpse into how large-scale mining operations balance their treasury management with ongoing expenses. As of October 24, Bitdeer maintains a substantial holding of 2,180.2 BTC, demonstrating a strong commitment to its long-term asset strategy. For investors and enthusiasts, these numbers are more than just statistics; they represent the tangible efforts behind securing the Bitcoin network and managing a valuable digital treasury. Why Do Firms Engage in Bitdeer Bitcoin Mining Sales? It might seem counterintuitive for a Bitcoin mining company to sell its newly mined assets, especially during periods of market optimism. However, these sales are often a fundamental part of a sophisticated operational strategy. Several factors drive such decisions: Covering Operational Costs: Running a large-scale Bitdeer Bitcoin mining operation requires significant capital. This includes substantial electricity bills, maintenance of sophisticated hardware, staff salaries, and infrastructure upgrades. Selling a portion of mined Bitcoin provides the necessary liquidity to cover these ongoing expenses. Treasury Management: Companies often diversify their holdings and manage risk. Selling some BTC can help realize profits, rebalance portfolios, or prepare for future investments without solely relying on market appreciation. Market Conditions: Strategic sales can be timed to capitalize on favorable market prices, ensuring maximum return on their mining efforts. Conversely, sales might occur to build a cash reserve during uncertain times. These actions are not random; they are calculated moves designed to ensure the financial health and sustained growth of the mining enterprise. How Does Bitdeer Bitcoin Mining Impact the Broader Market? The activities of major Bitcoin mining firms like Bitdeer can have a ripple effect across the cryptocurrency market. While individual sales might not drastically shift prices, the cumulative actions of large miners contribute to overall market supply dynamics. When miners sell, it adds to the available supply, which can influence short-term price movements. Conversely, when miners choose to hold their mined Bitcoin, it signals a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and reduces the immediate selling pressure. Bitdeer’s current holding of over 2,180 BTC signifies a significant commitment to Bitcoin’s future, despite their tactical weekly sales. This balance between selling for operational needs and holding for long-term value is a delicate act that all major miners perform. Understanding these dynamics helps investors gauge market sentiment and potential supply shifts. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bitdeer Bitcoin Mining Bitdeer’s consistent transparency regarding its mining output and treasury management sets a commendable standard in the industry. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the strategic decisions made by key players like Bitdeer will remain vital. Their ability to adapt to changing market conditions, manage operational costs effectively, and maintain a robust Bitcoin treasury will be crucial for their sustained success. These weekly reports offer more than just numbers; they provide a narrative of resilience, strategic foresight, and continuous adaptation within the highly competitive Bitdeer Bitcoin mining sector. Keeping an eye on these updates can offer valuable insights into the broader health and direction of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Bitdeer? A1: Bitdeer is a leading technology company that specializes in Bitcoin cloud mining. They offer solutions for users to participate in cryptocurrency mining without needing to own or manage physical mining hardware. Q2: What is cloud mining? A2: Cloud mining allows individuals to rent computing power from a large data center, like Bitdeer, to mine cryptocurrencies. This eliminates the need for users to purchase expensive equipment, deal with high electricity costs, or manage complex technical setups. Q3: Why do Bitcoin miners sell their mined BTC? A3: Miners typically sell a portion of their mined Bitcoin to cover significant operational expenses, such as electricity costs, hardware maintenance, facility upkeep, and staff salaries. It’s a strategic financial management decision to ensure liquidity and sustain operations. Q4: How do Bitdeer’s BTC holdings compare to other mining firms? A4: While exact comparisons vary by reporting period, Bitdeer’s holding of over 2,180 BTC positions them as a significant player among publicly traded mining companies. Their holdings reflect a substantial long-term investment in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Q5: Does Bitdeer’s weekly sale impact Bitcoin’s price? A5: While individual sales from a single firm might not cause dramatic price shifts, the cumulative selling pressure from all miners can influence market supply and demand. Bitdeer’s strategic sales are generally part of broader market dynamics rather than a sole price driver.

As summarized by @christine_dkim, the 223rd All Core Devs Execution (ACDE 223) meeting brought new clarity to Ethereum’s roadmap for the final stretch of 2025. The developers confirmed the Glamsterdam upgrade proposal deadline for October 30, with final scope confirmation scheduled for November 27. This sets a concrete path toward the Fusaka mainnet upgrade in December, keeping Ethereum’s execution layer upgrades firmly on schedule. Fusaka Upgrade Timeline Finalized The headline takeaway from ACDE 223 is the Fusaka mainnet upgrade, now officially set for December 3, 2025. This release will introduce blob parameter optimizations, scheduled in two phases, December 9 and January 7, 2026. These changes fine-tune how Ethereum handles blob data introduced during the Dencun upgrade, improving efficiency for rollups and large-scale data posting. Before that, the Hoodi testnet will activate its Fusaka version on October 28, serving as the final pre-mainnet test cycle. Developers confirmed that Holesky, one of Ethereum’s largest testnets, will shut down next week as resources shift toward Glamsterdam’s testing framework. Glamsterdam Upgrade Details While Fusaka focuses on optimizing blob mechanics, Glamsterdam represents Ethereum’s next big leap in execution efficiency. The upgrade will introduce a multi-client testnet, focusing primarily on the Block Access List (BAL) proposal, an experimental feature aimed at improving how nodes access contract storage data. BALs could significantly reduce redundant reads and streamline gas usage during complex contract executions, further optimizing transaction performance. Developers described Glamsterdam as a “modular prep” upgrade, setting the stage for future Rollup integration improvements, execution-layer compression, and gas efficiency reforms. New Proposals: Gas Precision & Deduplication Discount Two new proposals stood out during ACDE 223 discussions: EIP 8058: Gas Precision Optimization – Aims to refine how gas units are calculated and rounded in specific edge cases. This would make gas consumption measurements more precise and predictable for developers, reducing the risk of mispriced transactions. Deduplication Discount for Contract Redeployment – A proposed mechanism to lower deployment costs for contracts that reuse identical bytecode. This could significantly reduce gas expenses for DeFi protocols, DAOs, and wallet infrastructures that frequently redeploy similar smart contracts. Both proposals were well received but will likely undergo testnet evaluation during the Glamsterdam phase before any mainnet inclusion. Retired Proposals: EIP 7667 and 6873 Two previously discussed proposals, EIP 7667 and EIP 6873, were officially removed from the active roadmap due to overlapping priorities and changing design goals. Developers noted that both proposals may be re-evaluated in future cycles if they align better with post-Glamsterdam objectives. The decision reflects Ethereum’s ongoing commitment to refining roadmap scope, ensuring upgrades focus on tangible improvements to performance and developer experience rather than experimental expansion. Developer Momentum and OKX Ventures’ Take Ethereum’s development pace continues to accelerate into 2026. From Dencun’s blob integration to Fusaka’s optimization phase and Glamsterdam’s structural upgrades, the network is building toward a leaner, more modular execution layer. OKX Ventures shared insight following ACDE 223, describing the next upgrade cycle as “a critical phase for Ethereum’s modular evolution.” “Ethereum’s core upgrades are accelerating into a critical phase. From Fusaka to Glamsterdam, developers are continuously improving execution-layer efficiency and developer experience. These foundational upgrades will pave the way for modular scaling, rollup optimizations, and innovations in the application layer,” the firm wrote. The comment underscores how closely infrastructure investors are tracking Ethereum’s low-level development, viewing these upgrades not as isolated patches, but as coordinated steps toward long-term scalability. What It Means for the Ecosystem The Fusaka and Glamsterdam phases are designed to prepare Ethereum for the next stage of Rollup-centric scaling. Blob parameter tuning will make Layer 2 data submissions cheaper and more efficient. BALs and gas precision updates will smooth execution logic and cut redundant costs. Deduplication incentives will reward developers building on efficient contract design patterns. Each step strengthens Ethereum’s execution layer, the part of the network responsible for processing smart contracts and transactions, setting a stronger foundation for long-term Layer 2 interoperability. For builders, this means faster feedback cycles, lower deployment costs, and more predictable performance across networks. For users, it means cheaper transactions, fewer network spikes, and a smoother experience on dapps built atop Ethereum. Ethereum Market Context At the time of writing, ETH trades at around $3,925, with a market cap of $473 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Price volatility around these updates remains minimal, reflecting how technical upgrades have become normalized within Ethereum’s predictable development cadence. However, as testnet launches begin in late October and November, community attention will likely return to performance metrics and upgrade testing outcomes. With the Glamsterdam proposal deadline set for October 30 and final scope locked by November 27, Ethereum’s developers are entering a crucial execution window. The Fusaka mainnet release on December 3 will act as both a closing chapter for 2025 and a stepping stone into 2026’s upgrade path. Each stage continues Ethereum’s multi-year transition from a monolithic blockchain into a modular, rollup-first network, balancing decentralization with execution speed. For now, all eyes are on Hoodi testnet’s activation on October 28, marking the last rehearsal before Ethereum’s next live performance. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Pump.fun, Solana’s dominant memecoin launchpad, has officially acquired Padre App , an advanced, multi-chain trading terminal for professional traders. we're excited to announce that pump fun has acquired @PadreApp Padre is an industry leading trading terminal which provides a seamless, high-speed trading experience with next level analytics for professional traders on Solana, BNB Chain, Base, and Ethereum L1 read more pic.twitter.com/Oq3EPuGjTk — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) October 24, 2025 But not everyone’s celebrating. Padre token holders got nothing from the deal. Within hours of the announcement, $PADRE crashed over 70%, according to CoinMarketCap. The token, which once symbolized the project’s growing trading ecosystem, has now plunged a great deal following the announcement. The Acquisition Pump.fun announced the deal on X, calling Padre “one of the most advanced trading terminals in Web3.” “We’re thrilled to welcome the Padre team. Their experience, speed, and deep focus on user experience align perfectly with our mission to tokenize the world’s highest-potential opportunities,” Pump.fun wrote. Today is a reminder of exactly why I’m building Soar. Padre was just acquired by Pumpfun, and Padre token holders got absolutely nothing from it. The token is down 70% today and is going lower. This is what’s broken about ICM and crypto right now. Tokens have no legal… https://t.co/mw4udLodoo — Captain Beef (@imtomcurry) October 24, 2025 The acquisition marks Pump.fun’s first expansion beyond its meme-launchpad roots, a move that signals its ambition to dominate the broader DeFi trading stack. What Padre Brings Padre wasn’t just another crypto dashboard. In less than a year, it established itself as an industry-leading pro trading terminal, supporting high-speed, on-chain trading across Solana, BNB Chain, Base, and Ethereum L1. Its growth was driven by four things: Clean and intuitive user experience Rewarding cashback and competitive fees Responsive trader support Strong technical backbone built by crypto veterans The Padre team had earned a loyal user base among professional traders seeking fast execution and real-time analytics. Pump.fun’s acquisition now places that talent and technology directly under its expanding umbrella. Pump.fun’s Vision According to Pump.fun, the acquisition isn’t just about bringing in tech, it’s about bridging retail and professional trading. “For the past year, trading terminals have captured most of the ecosystem’s volume. They’ve done what any good crypto product does: make users money. But to go further, we need to build for retail, while staying connected to our most loyal traders.” That’s where Padre comes in. By merging its infrastructure with Pump.fun’s network and liquidity reach, the company plans to unlock a new edge for both retail and pro traders. What Changes for Padre Users Pump.fun confirmed that Padre’s operations will continue as usual. The terminal will keep supporting trading on all major launchpads and decentralized exchanges across supported chains. Ongoing improvements are also on the roadmap: Faster shipping cycles and UI upgrades Enhanced speed, analytics, and trader insights More responsive feedback loops for core users However, the Padre token ($PADRE) is no longer part of that future. “The $PADRE token will no longer have utility on the platform, with no further plans moving forward,” the official statement read. That decision triggered widespread frustration among token holders, especially those who had backed the project early. Padre’s community channels were flooded with complaints within hours of the announcement. Many holders expressed disappointment over being excluded from the deal, while others criticized the lack of a token swap or compensation plan. Despite the backlash, sentiment around Padre’s product remains strong. Even critics acknowledge that the trading terminal itself is among the best in the space, praised for its responsiveness, analytics, and integration depth. The challenge now is narrative: how Pump.fun manages community trust while pivoting toward an integrated ecosystem strategy. Pump.fun’s Growing Influence Pump.fun has grown from a memecoin launchpad into a crypto ecosystem heavyweight. Since early 2024, it has dominated on-chain token launches, processing millions of trades and generating record user activity. Its acquisition of Padre represents a shift from launching tokens to enabling trading infrastructure. Industry observers see it as a natural evolution. Launchpads capture initial liquidity, but trading terminals capture recurring volume. By owning both layers, Pump.fun strengthens its grip on the entire token lifecycle: launch, trade, and liquidity management. Strategic Fit and Future Outlook Padre’s integration will likely improve Pump.fun’s backend efficiency and data handling. It also positions Pump.fun to expand into more professional trading tools, an area currently dominated by platforms like Hyperliquid and Jupiter Terminal. With Pump.fun’s large retail audience and Padre’s professional-grade interface, the combined platform could blur the lines between memecoin trading and institutional-grade DeFi tools. For users, that could mean faster trades, richer analytics, and stronger incentives. For the ecosystem, it could mean tighter liquidity loops and more sustainable market depth across Solana and beyond. The acquisition underscores a growing trend in DeFi: vertical consolidation. Projects are no longer content with specializing in one niche, they’re merging across layers to control user experience end-to-end.. Padre’s fall might sting investors, but its technology lives on in a bigger ecosystem. Pump.fun now holds both the memecoin market’s energy and the infrastructure to sustain it. For traders, the message is clear, Pump.fun is building far beyond its meme roots. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

53609966,https://nulltx.com/?p=152467,1761371395,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,ASTER Reclaims $1 as It Launches Strategic Buyback Program,https://nulltx.com/aster-reclaims-1-as-it-launches-strategic-buyback-program/,"The Binance-backed ASTER has made a strong comeback, reclaiming the $1 mark after announcing a new strategic token buyback program. The move comes as the decentralized perpetual exchange positions itself to rival Hyperliquid, signaling a long-term commitment to sustainable liquidity growth and tokenholder value. A Comeback Fueled by Confidence The announcement hit X earlier today, and it’s already showing results. $ASTER, the native token of the ASTER DEX, is trading just above $1, according to CoinMarketCap. The renewed momentum reflects investor confidence following a recent drop below the $1 zone. Now, ASTER’s message is clear: it’s building for the long term. The project plans to allocate 70–80% of its Season 3 (S3) fee revenue toward buybacks of $ASTER, a major show of commitment to both users and tokenholders. The Buyback Breakdown According to the official statement, ASTER is “targeting 70–80% of S3 fees for $ASTER buybacks.” However, the team notes that the final allocation will depend on market conditions, with the results expected to be disclosed after Season 3 concludes. In simple terms, ASTER is using its platform revenue to buy back its own token from the open market, effectively reducing circulating supply. This kind of buyback strategy, common among major exchanges and trading protocols, serves two major purposes: 1. It strengthens token price support. 2. It redistributes value directly back into the ecosystem. For a DeFi project competing with giants like Hyperliquid and Aevo, this kind of move stands out. ASTER Market Impact Shortly after the announcement, trading volume on ASTER surged across integrated exchanges. The $ASTER token climbed back above $1, marking a double-digit rebound within hours. Market analysts attributed the quick response to the clear revenue-backed utility behind the buyback plan. At press time, $ASTER holds a market cap of around $2.16B, with trading activity concentrated on Binance, OKX, and Jupiter. The project’s latest update adds to its growing reputation as one of the few perps exchanges with consistent on-chain traction. Buybacks aren’t new in crypto, but the timing and structure of ASTER’s move are what make it interesting. In a period where liquidity is fragmented and DEX trading volumes fluctuate week to week, ASTER’s buyback injects stability into its ecosystem. By committing up to 80% of its S3 fees, ASTER signals that it’s not just chasing short-term hype, it’s building sustainable token economics. This is especially key in a DeFi cycle where user incentives often fade quickly after farming seasons. Buybacks create consistent value flow, and that’s something both traders and long-term holders can get behind. ASTER’s Message to the Market In the team’s words: “As a growing project, and in these uncertain market conditions, it’s important to maintain operational flexibility. Subsequent season airdrops and buybacks will be announced as details are confirmed.” This tone, measured but confident, reflects ASTER’s current strategy. While many projects scale back during volatile conditions, ASTER is doing the opposite: reinvesting into its own token economy. It’s a signal of maturity from a project still considered “young” in the DeFi landscape. A Rival to Hyperliquid ASTER’s positioning has been clear from the start, it’s a Binance-backed DEX aiming to be the next-generation alternative to Hyperliquid. Both platforms focus on perpetual trading and on-chain orderbooks, but ASTER differentiates itself through its fee-sharing model and season-based structure. The team’s approach is designed to balance liquidity incentives with protocol sustainability. And with the introduction of buybacks, ASTER is now adding a direct feedback loop between platform success and token performance. For traders, this means more than just trading rewards, it means the DEX’s growth directly benefits tokenholders. The buyback news has drawn strong reactions across X (formerly Twitter). From traders to DeFi analysts, many praised ASTER’s move as a “bullish commitment” in a market where most projects remain cautious. Here’s the official announcement from ASTER’s team. Buyback Announcement: ASTER is currently targeting 70-80% of S3 fees for $ASTER buybacks, exact allocation will depend on market conditions and final results will be released following conclusion of S3. As a growing project, and in these uncertain market conditions, it’s… — Aster (@Aster_DEX) October 24, 2025 Aster’s followers highlighted that this is the first structured buyback since its launch, an event that could set a precedent for future seasons. Some analysts also speculated that ASTER might use part of the remaining 20–30% of its fee revenue for airdrops or incentive pools, further rewarding early supporters. Looking Ahead: Season 3 and Beyond Season 3 is shaping up to be a defining period for ASTER. The buyback initiative could tighten token supply while enhancing liquidity depth, both crucial for a trading protocol’s growth. And while exact figures will be shared after S3 concludes, the 70–80% commitment range already sends a strong message. ASTER’s approach is pragmatic, flexible in execution, but firm in direction. If the market momentum holds, the project could soon position itself among the top-performing DEX tokens in the Solana and Binance-linked ecosystems. ASTER’s $1 reclaim isn’t just another price move. It’s the result of a calculated, transparent, and community-aligned strategy, a tokenomics blueprint that balances growth and sustainability. By tying its buyback directly to protocol fees, ASTER ensures that every trade contributes to tokenholder value. It’s a model that many DeFi projects talk about, but few actually implement. As the Season 3 cycle unfolds, all eyes will be on how ASTER’s buyback impacts liquidity, volume, and token performance. But one thing’s already clear, this isn’t a short-term stunt. It’s the foundation of a long-term DeFi narrative. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

There are currently seven applications for XRP ETFs pending with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, though filings have been paused amid the US government shutdown. For many large investors, buying shares in a regulated fund or a company with an XRP treasury avoids the need to run custody systems in-house. Evernorth has become a focal point in that discussion. The venture, backed in part by Ripple, plans to build what it calls an institutional XRP treasury. Evernorth aims to purchase $1 billion worth of XRP and will start with over 560 million XRP after it secures $1.1 billion in committed capital from participants that include Ripple and SBI Holdings. Reports say the firm is pursuing a merger that is expected to close in Q1 2026, and the XRP purchases are planned to take place within 10 days of funding. 🚨 JUST IN: A Hyperliquid whale has opened a MASSIVE $1M XRP long position with 10x leverage at $2.40 😳 Looks like someone’s betting BIG on #XRP making a move soon! 👀🔥 pic.twitter.com/RnhyNJhOFE — Xaif Crypto🇮🇳|🇺🇸 (@Xaif_Crypto) October 23, 2025 Related Reading: ‘Unthinkable Scenario’ Required For Bitcoin To Hit $250K, CEO Says Market Bets And Margin Positions Market activity indicates that certain traders are making considerable wagers on the near-term trajectory of XRP.

Trump’s statement has triggered a global conversation about the role of digital assets, especially Bitcoin (BTC), in addressing the US’s debt crisis. Can Bitcoin Be Used To Clear The US’ National Debt? Speaking at a private conference, Trump said that crypto “has got a great future.” He hinted that maybe the US could pay off the $35 trillion debt in crypto. The president said: I’ll write on a little piece of paper, $35 trillion in crypto – we have no debt. That’s what I like. It should be noted that this is not the first time that Trump has alluded to the idea of using digital assets to wipe out the inflating American debt. In fact, Trump has been on record multiple times saying that his administration could use BTC to “save America.” This begs the question, how high will Bitcoin actually need to be to pay off the US’ national debt. Asset manager Fidelity has performed some calculations to arrive at an approximate BTC price that could, theoretically, do the trick. According to calculations based on Treasury data and blockchain supply metrics, BTC’s circulating supply of 19.93 million BTC would need to increase significantly in value to pay off the massive $38 trillion debt. Mathematically speaking, by dividing the US’s $38 billion in national debt by 19.93 million supply, one Bitcoin will surge to $1.9 million. At such a high price, BTC’s market cap would be roughly equal to the US’s total debt. However, the US doesn’t own all the 19.93 million BTC. According to the latest data, the US only owns about 326,373 BTC, almost 1.6% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply, most of it acquired through seizures from criminal investigations. If the US tried to pay off its debt only using the amount of BTC it currently holds, then the digital asset’s price could increase exponentially. Specifically, BTC could surge as high as $116.5 million, almost 1000-times more than its current trading price. At such a price level, BTC’s total market cap would be around $230 trillion – a figure that is even higher than the world’s total GDP as of today. Any attempt to sell BTC at such a price would collapse its thin liquidity, resulting in a massive crash for the flagship cryptocurrency. Are Institutions Aware Of BTC’s Potential? While Bitcoin reaching a price tag of $116.5 million might sound impossible currently, recent BTC accumulation trends show that institutions are confident that the digital asset may still have a lot more room to grow. Recent trading data from the US suggests that crypto transactions have witnessed a sharp uptick since Trump assumed the Presidency. At press time, BTC trades at $110,052, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Donald Trump|MARA|National debt|US,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 06:00:28

SMQKE’s post emphasized that “Hidden Road plans to migrate its post-trade clearing onto XRPL, showcasing the blockchain’s ability to handle high-volume institutional flows.” This statement points to a significant development for XRP, as the integration of post-trade clearing could mark one of the most substantial use cases of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in institutional markets to date. With Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road finalized, it’s finally time to “SUPERCHARGE XRP’S UTILITY.” “Hidden Road plans to migrate its post-trade clearing onto XRPL, showcasing the blockchain's ability to handle high-volume institutional flows.” Documented. https://t.co/dBZk7dYa7H pic.twitter.com/FstGAkPvyL — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 24, 2025 Ripple’s Strategic Position in Institutional Finance The document describes Ripple’s motivation for the acquisition as a “bold move” that gives the company a new position in the financial ecosystem. Ripple now gains a platform capable of offering prime brokerage services such as trading, custody, financing, and clearing “to hedge funds and financial institutions.” This signals an expansion well beyond retail or transactional crypto services toward serving institutional clients at scale . Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, called the acquisition a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” that allows crypto firms access to traditional markets and vice versa. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hidden Road’s existing infrastructure and relationships with large financial entities provide Ripple with immediate access to institutional capital markets. Through this network, Ripple aims to connect traditional asset markets with digital liquidity using the XRP Ledger as the operational foundation. Enhancing XRP’s Real-World Utility A key excerpt from the document notes that this integration “could supercharge XRP’s utility as well.” By linking Hidden Road’s trade settlement processes to XRPL, Ripple demonstrates how its blockchain can be used for institutional-grade efficiency. The ability to process post-trade clearing on XRPL positions the network as a potential standard for large-scale financial operations where reliability and speed are critical. The announcement suggests that Ripple is entering a new competitive tier in the fintech landscape. While XRP has long been associated with cross-border payment efficiency, its use in post-trade clearing could establish its relevance in the broader settlement infrastructure that underpins institutional trading. The document also indicates that Ripple’s stablecoin strategy and collateral systems will align with this institutional push, further embedding XRP within its financial framework. The focus on expanding XRP’s practical use , rather than speculative value, reinforces Ripple’s intent to strengthen its foothold among global financial institutions.

According to the company’s press statement published Friday, Ripple first announced its plan to acquire the global credit network in early April. The firm believes Hidden Road is one of the fastest-growing non-bank prime brokers serving institutional investors in foreign exchange, digital assets, derivatives, swaps, and fixed income markets. The acquisition was reportedly finalized this month, making Hidden Road officially part of Ripple’s ecosystem under the new name Ripple Prime. Ripple opens new brokerage chapter with Hidden Road acquisition Ripple said the transaction is a “new chapter” for the company as it extends its reach beyond payments into institutional brokerage and clearing services. According to Ripple, Ripple Prime’s business has tripled in size since the deal was first announced. The XRP parent company’s infrastructure, including its payments network, crypto custody capabilities, and RLUSD stablecoin, will now be embedded into services offered through Ripple Prime. Moreover, the firm plans to use blockchain technology within its prime brokerage operations to streamline processes, improve transparency, and reduce costs for institutional users. Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD is already being used as collateral for several prime brokerage products under Ripple Prime. Certain derivatives clients have also opted to hold their balances in RLUSD, and the firm expects more entities to pick up on the trend in the coming months. Hidden Road Founder and CEO Marc Asch will be working alongside Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the company’s executive team throughout the integration process . “We are at an inflection point for the next phase of digital asset adoption,” Garlinghouse said when the deal was first announced. “The US market is effectively open for the first time due to the regulatory overhang of the former SEC coming to an end.” A year of company acquisitions to expand its reach The Hidden Road deal is one of five major acquisitions Ripple has made in the past two years, in what can be deemed as an aggressive expansion strategy to solidify its base. In May 2023, Ripple acquired digital asset custody firm Metaco, followed by the purchase of Standard Custody in June 2024. The company expanded its operations further in August with the acquisition of Rail, a stablecoin-powered payments platform. Just last week, Ripple announced plans to acquire treasury management system provider GTreasury. “We have focused on providing the most compliant and feature-rich solutions to corporations around the globe. Now, by joining Ripple, we are accelerating our vision from managing capital to activating it,” remarked GTreasury CEO Renaat Ver Eecke. As of the time of this publication, Ripple USD had reached a market cap of $898.5 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of more than $70 million, according to Coingecko data. The stablecoin was rated the number one digital dollar for “stability, governance, and asset backing” by the analytics firm Bluechip in July, earning an ‘A’ rating. Ripple appointed The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY Mellon) as its primary reserve custodian for RLUSD. Evernorth goes public via SPAC Merger In other related news this week, a company holding the cryptocurrency associated with the Ripple payment network XRP, revealed it could soon go public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Evernorth plans to merge with Armada Acquisition Corp II in a deal expected to raise more than $1 billion in proceeds. According to a statement released Monday, Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings Inc. contributed $200 million to the deal, while Ripple Labs made an unspecified investment. The firm founded after the SPAC Merger will trade on Nasdaq under the ticker “XRPN,” pending regulatory and listing approvals yet to be confirmed. XRP has started the weekend on a positive note, changing hands at a 5.2% 24-hour price increase to reach $2.56 Saturday morning. The Ripple native token closed Friday at $2.405, recording an intraday high of $2.57 and a low of $2.401. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This week, the SEC has been facing a decision deadline for three different XRP ETF applications and Grayscale's Cardano ETF, but has not released any statements. Due to the ongoing US federal government shutdown since October 1st, the SEC is operating at limited capacity, and ETF approval processes have been temporarily halted. Andrew Jacobson, a legal advisor for Halliday and former global head of legal at 21Shares, said in a statement that he expects the approval process to move quickly once the government reopens. “Autumn is typically the busiest time for ETFs. Things will move very quickly once the government reopens.” Related News: Ripple Officially Announces New Initiative: CEO Sends Bullish Message for XRP The current shutdown is the second-longest government shutdown in US history. According to a new poll on cryptocurrency prediction platform Polymarket, only 7% of investors believe the government will reopen by October 31st. This raises the possibility of surpassing the record 35-day shutdown set during Donald Trump's first term. However, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett indicated this week that the shutdown could end soon. The US Senate is set to hold its 11th vote to refinance the government. Despite all the uncertainty, expectations for a Cardano ETF remain strong. According to Polymarket data, users rate a 77% chance of a Cardano ETF being approved by 2025. These expectations were further reinforced by the SEC's significant changes to the crypto ETF approval process in September. The new regulations reduced the spot crypto ETF approval timeframe from 240 days to 75 days and simplified the process for cryptocurrencies that meet certain requirements. *This is not investment advice.

The ETF is being credited as a major driver of institutional adoption of XRP. Additionally, CME Group has launched new XRP options, bolstering its derivatives offerings following the successful performance of its XRP futures. REX-Osprey has credited its success to investor interest and regulatory direction The REX-Osprey XRP ETF has now surpassed $100 million in assets under management, marking a significant milestone for the institutional adoption of XRP. REX Shares highlighted the ETF’s performance on X, noting an increasing interest in regulated exposure to digital assets. The investment manager cited increased investor interest and improved regulatory clarity as among the reasons behind the fund’s momentum. Months earlier, REX Shares also noted strong demand for XRP exposure due to a more formal and regulated market environment. Around the same time, it launched the T-REX 2X Long Galaxy Digital Daily Target ETF, ticker GLXU. Meanwhile, CME Group has broadened XRP’s institutional offering, introducing options on XRP futures to complement existing ETF-like products. Meanwhile, CME Group has also broadened XRP’s institutional offering, introducing options on XRP futures to commemorate five months of active futures trading. The exchange noted that the product has maintained solid demand since its May rollout, recording over 567,000 trades to date. The figure translates to $26.9 billion in notional volume, about 9 billion XRP, which CME cited as a sign of sustained institutional optimism toward the asset. Market participants now have access to a range of regulated tools, including ETFs, spot, futures, and options, to diversify their exposure. The company announced : “Five months for XRP futures! Since launching in May, we’ve seen incredible demand for this regulated product. Ready for more control? Options on XRP futures are officially LIVE! “ XRP is gaining momentum due to increased institutional participation and buying pressure Ripple’s latest acquisition news has further energized the market. CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the completion of Ripple’s purchase of Hidden Road, now rebranded as Ripple Prime, pushing XRP above the $2.50 mark. John Deaton, an American attorney and a prominent advocate for cryptocurrency investors, even commented, saying, “ Between late December 2020 and 2023, we witnessed people’s Ripple’s Obituary. Today, those same people admit Ripple has become a major player in the industry.” The price of XRP has increased by 3.49% over the last 24 hours, reaching around $2.56. Over the past week, the token’s price gained 6.46%. Analysts attribute the momentum to heightened institutional participation and steady buying pressure. Data from CoinGlass indicates that XRP futures trading volume increased by 8.66% to $5.98 billion. XRP futures open interest has increased by 5.20% to $3.88 billion, a sign of growing confidence among leveraged traders and continued institutional accumulation. Although the token had tumbled around October 10, now, analysts are hoping the asset will break resistance at $2.80, which could propel the token to $3.05 or even $3.40 in the near term. So far, indicators suggest a continued recovery, with the RSI at a neutral 52 and the MACD on the verge of a bullish crossover, indicating that upward momentum is building. But a loss of momentum would likely push XRP below $2.20, especially if the overall market mood turns cautious. The institutional demand for regulated XRP products has increased and evolved over the last five months, with futures contracts now offered on the CME Group. According to the exchange claims, the notional trading volume of XRP and micro futures has reached $27 billion since their launch.

This highly anticipated move is set to open new avenues for traders looking to engage with the COMMON token. Starting October 27 at 12:30 p.m. UTC, traders will have the opportunity to delve into this new offering, which will support significant leverage, potentially amplifying trading outcomes. What Are COMMON Perpetual Futures and Why Are They Important? For those new to derivatives, understanding COMMON perpetual futures is crucial. A perpetual futures contract allows traders to speculate on an asset’s future price without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, they mimic the spot market price through a funding rate mechanism. No Expiry Date: Traders can hold positions indefinitely, provided they meet margin requirements. Leverage: Binance’s new COMMON/USDT contract offers up to 50x leverage. This enables traders to control large positions with relatively small capital, leading to substantial gains or significant losses. Price Discovery: The listing on a major exchange like Binance can boost price discovery and increase liquidity for the COMMON token itself. The addition of COMMON to Binance Alpha further highlights its growing importance. This listing signals confidence in the token’s potential and provides a robust platform for advanced trading strategies. How Does Trading COMMON Perpetual Futures Work? Engaging with COMMON perpetual futures involves understanding several key mechanics, particularly regarding leverage and risk management. When you trade with leverage, you are essentially borrowing funds from the exchange to increase your position size. While this can magnify profits, it also escalates the risk of liquidation. Consider this: High Leverage: 50x leverage means that for every dollar you invest, you can control $50 worth of COMMON. A small price movement against your position can quickly deplete your margin. Margin Requirements: Traders must maintain a specific margin level to keep their positions open. If the market moves unfavorably and your margin falls below the maintenance level, your position may be automatically liquidated. Funding Rates: These are exchanged between long and short positions, typically every eight hours. This mechanism helps keep the perpetual contract price anchored to the spot price. Understanding funding rates is vital as they impact your overall trading costs or gains. It is important for traders to approach COMMON perpetual futures with a well-defined strategy and a clear understanding of the associated risks. Educating yourself on how leverage and margin work is the first step towards responsible trading. Navigating the Market: Tips for COMMON Perpetual Futures Traders Trading COMMON perpetual futures can be exhilarating, but it demands a disciplined approach. To navigate this dynamic market effectively, here are some actionable insights and best practices: Start Small: Especially if you are new to futures trading, begin with a small portion of your capital. This allows you to gain experience without exposing yourself to excessive risk. Risk Management is Key: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Define your maximum acceptable loss per trade and stick to it. Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Understand Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets, especially for newer tokens, can be highly volatile. Price swings can be rapid and unpredictable. Be prepared for this and adjust your position sizes accordingly. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical analysis, and any announcements related to the COMMON token or the broader crypto market. Information is power in trading. Don’t Over-Leverage: While 50x leverage is available, it doesn’t mean you should always use it. Higher leverage increases risk exponentially. Many experienced traders use lower leverage to manage risk more effectively. Binance’s decision to list COMMON perpetual futures is a significant development, offering both opportunities and challenges. By approaching this new trading instrument with caution, education, and a robust risk management plan, traders can position themselves to potentially benefit from its introduction. Summary: Unlocking New Opportunities with COMMON Perpetual Futures The upcoming listing of the COMMON perpetual futures contract on Binance marks an exciting milestone for the cryptocurrency community. This new offering, with its 50x leverage capability, provides an advanced trading tool for speculating on the COMMON token’s price movements. While the potential for amplified returns is appealing, it comes hand-in-hand with amplified risks. Successful engagement with these contracts will hinge on a thorough understanding of their mechanics, diligent risk management, and continuous market awareness. As COMMON joins the ranks of tokens available for perpetual futures trading, it signals a maturing market and expanding options for savvy traders.

According to market tracking data, roughly $1.75 billion worth of player-held digital assets vanished from value post-update. Bloomberg News reported that the market slump began on October 22, when Valve released an update to change the in-game economy of Counter-Strike 2 . According to the patch notes shared on CS2’s subreddit, it modified the way players could exchange and acquire cosmetic weapon skins like knives and gloves, among the game’s rarest and most expensive items. At around 7 PM in New York on Wednesday, Valve adjusted the item exchange rate between various skin categories. Prices for top-tier collectibles plunged within hours of the update, wiping nearly $2 billion in total market value by Friday morning, according to data from Pricempire. This analytics firm monitors Counter-Strike’s trading ecosystem across 46 marketplaces. “This was a complete shock to the community,” said Ethan MacDonald, marketing manager at Pricempire. “This completely changes the supply of Counter-Strike’s most sought-after and expensive tier of items.” CS2 is the world’s most active digital gaming item market Bloomberg had reported in March, citing Pricempire data, that the market for CS2 in-game skins set a new record to surpass $4.3 billion for the first time. As of June, a single Counter-Strike 2 weapon skin sold for $1 million, the highest transaction ever recorded for an in-game cosmetic. Pricempire’s valuation model aggregates public inventory data and pricing from dozens of trading hubs, producing an estimate of the total market capitalization for all tradable Counter-Strike items. The sudden market crash hit individual traders like Oscar Stapleton, a 20-year-old player in London, who said his digital inventory was valued at over $1 million before the update. Within 24 hours, he lost nearly $270,000 in market value. “I’ve had a good past few months, so this is a shock,” Stapleton reckoned. However, Streamer psp1g saw his fortunes reverse after the October update, after the value of his previously overlooked inventory surged. Items he had once considered “worthless red skins” that couldn’t be used in trade contracts became part of the most sought-after assets in the game, pushing his total holdings to more than $4.4 million. Valve resonates update to ‘trade protection’ The October 22 patch came after Valve made several changes to how Counter-Strike 2 items move between players. In mid-2025, the company behind Steam added a “Trade Protection system” that restricts newly traded items for seven days. CS2 Skins labeled as “Trade Protected” cannot be retraded, modified, or consumed during that lock period, but they are still usable in-game. The update also included fixes to the reversal mechanism protecting victims of fraud, allowing Valve to undo unapproved trades within a week and restore stolen items to their rightful owners. Players can also combine five high-tier “Covert” skins to create a rare knife or glove. Pricempire’s data showed the most prized knives and gloves, previously selling for tens of thousands of dollars, have dropped by more than half in value since Wednesday. “Many investors, traders, and players have been selling off a lot of items out of fear that the ‘bubble’ has finally popped,” said MacDonald. Valve earns a commission on sales made through its official Steam marketplace, but does not directly profit from the majority of third-party transactions. One Counter-Strike 2 developer speaking in a 2023 interview said: “We generally only look at market prices when we’re thinking about shipping new stuff and want to understand players’ preferences. Players’ interest in items fluctuates over time for many reasons, so outside of that context, we try not to read too much into temporal changes.” According to some Redditors, Valve’s updates are motivated by gameplay balance and system integrity. “When you think about it, this kind of market ain’t healthy at all and is riddled with legal issues for Valve and harms the average customers the most.

The platform has officially announced the highly anticipated addition of Binance perpetual futures for the 42/USDT trading pair. This significant development is set to go live at 10:30 a.m. UTC on October 27, introducing fresh and dynamic opportunities for traders looking to engage with the market. What Are Binance Perpetual Futures and Why Are They a Game-Changer? Perpetual futures contracts stand as a cornerstone of the modern crypto derivatives market. Unlike traditional futures that come with a fixed expiry date, perpetual futures allow traders to maintain their positions indefinitely. This inherent flexibility makes them exceptionally popular for speculative trading, enabling participants to capitalize on both rising and falling markets without the pressure of a looming settlement date. Binance’s strategic move to list 42/USDT perpetual futures not only diversifies its product suite but also provides its vast user base with another powerful instrument to navigate cryptocurrency price movements. Essentially, these contracts offer a sophisticated way to gain exposure to an asset’s price dynamics without the necessity of direct ownership. Understanding the Power of 50x Leverage on Binance Perpetual Futures A standout feature of the new 42/USDT contract is the availability of up to 50x leverage. Leverage is a financial tool that allows traders to control a significantly larger position with a relatively small amount of initial capital. For instance, with 50x leverage, a trader can manage a position worth $50 for every $1 of their own funds. This amplification can dramatically enhance potential profits from favorable price movements. However, it is absolutely critical to grasp that leverage is a double-edged sword; it equally magnifies potential losses. Therefore, robust risk management strategies are not just recommended but essential when dealing with such high leverage. Binance consistently provides comprehensive educational materials and advanced tools designed to help users understand and responsibly manage the inherent risks associated with these powerful trading instruments. What Does 42’s Inclusion in Binance Alpha Mean for Savvy Traders? Beyond the direct listing of the Binance perpetual futures contract, Binance has also confirmed that the 42 asset will be integrated into Binance Alpha. While the specific functionalities and benefits of Binance Alpha can vary, inclusion typically signals enhanced visibility and access to more in-depth analytical support for the asset. This could translate into users gaining access to richer data sets, more granular market insights, or even specialized trading strategies specifically tailored for 42. For informed traders, this integration offers a potential edge, providing a deeper understanding of 42’s market behavior and potential future trajectory. Such resources can be invaluable for making well-researched decisions when trading the new Binance perpetual futures contract. Navigating Opportunities and Mitigating Risks with Binance Perpetual Futures The launch of any new Binance perpetual futures contract invariably presents a blend of exciting opportunities and inherent challenges. Successful engagement requires a balanced approach. Key Opportunities: Enhanced Liquidity: Listings on a top-tier exchange like Binance typically lead to increased trading volumes and improved market liquidity for the underlying asset. Efficient Price Discovery: Active futures markets often contribute to a more efficient and accurate price discovery mechanism for the associated spot asset. Advanced Hedging Strategies: Traders can strategically utilize perpetual futures to hedge existing spot positions, effectively protecting against potential adverse price movements in the market. Accessibility: Derivatives allow participation in asset price movements even if direct ownership is complex or undesirable. Inherent Risks: Extreme Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Leverage amplifies these rapid price swings, demanding constant vigilance. Significant Liquidation Risk: High leverage means even minor price movements against an open position can trigger an automatic liquidation, resulting in the total loss of the collateral invested. Funding Rate Dynamics: Perpetual futures involve periodic funding rates, which can either be a cost or a revenue stream, influenced by the difference between futures and spot prices. Understanding these rates is crucial. Emotional Trading: The fast-paced nature and high stakes of leveraged trading can lead to emotional decisions, which often result in suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, approaching these new contracts with a well-defined strategy, disciplined risk management, and continuous learning is crucial. Always begin with manageable position sizes and gradually increase your exposure as your experience and confidence grow. Conclusion: Binance’s upcoming listing of 42/USDT Binance perpetual futures , complete with up to 50x leverage and its integration into Binance Alpha, marks a significant expansion of its derivatives ecosystem. This development offers traders innovative avenues for speculation and sophisticated hedging strategies, all supported by Binance’s robust and secure trading infrastructure. While the allure of substantial gains is undeniable, it is paramount to prioritize stringent risk management and cultivate a deep understanding of both perpetual futures mechanics and the intricacies of leverage. As 42 gains enhanced visibility through Binance Alpha, traders will likely have access to even more comprehensive insights, empowering them to make highly informed decisions within this ever-evolving and dynamic cryptocurrency market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Binance perpetual futures? Binance perpetual futures are cryptocurrency derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date. This means positions can be held indefinitely, offering flexibility for various trading strategies. When will the 42/USDT perpetual futures contract be available? The 42/USDT perpetual futures contract is scheduled to be listed and available for trading on Binance at 10:30 a.m. UTC on October 27. What does 50x leverage mean for traders? 50x leverage allows traders to control a position worth 50 times their initial investment. While this can amplify potential profits significantly, it also dramatically increases the risk of losses and liquidation if the market moves against the position. How can I manage risk when trading Binance perpetual futures? Effective risk management includes starting with small position sizes, setting stop-loss orders, understanding funding rates, and never risking more capital than you can afford to lose. Continuous education and a clear trading strategy are also vital. What is Binance Alpha and how does 42’s inclusion benefit traders? Binance Alpha is typically a program or platform within Binance that offers enhanced features, data, or analytical insights for specific assets. 42’s inclusion means traders may gain access to more in-depth information and resources to better understand its market dynamics and potential for the new Binance perpetual futures contract.

Related Reading: Shiba Inu Might Be ‘Dead And Sleeping’, But Not For Long, Crypto Expert Says While the current environment is dominated by selling pressure and low institutional interest, some chart patterns deserve a closer look. From Crash to Compression: Dogecoin Under Pressure Dogecoin’s price tumbled from around $0.3066 to approximately $0.198, marking a dramatic 30 % decline that has shaken short-term holders. On the technical front, DOGE broke below a consolidating upward wedge, and a “death cross” is looming as the 50-day EMA approaches a crossover beneath the 200-day. DOGE's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Analysts warn this structure has historically signaled deeper losses. Support at $0.1515 is under watch (about 22 % below current levels), while a breakdown under $0.0570 could open the door to an extreme risk scenario (-90 %) riding on a bearish flag on the weekly chart. Adding to the pressure, the recently-launched DOGE ETF saw only around $30.7 million in assets, far below rival products and suggesting weak institutional demand. The steep 1.5 % expense ratio further dampens its appeal. Technical Setup: Danger Ahead, But Also Hope Despite the gloom, Dogecoin exhibits some intriguing longer-term patterns that hint at the possibility of reversal. On one hand, momentum indicators, like MACD and MFI, point to weakening buying strength and growing dominance of sellers. This supports the near-term bearish case. On the other hand, a long-term ascending channel since 2021 shows DOGE trading near its lower boundary, with the Stochastic RSI at historically low levels, similar to prior pre-rallies. Analysts highlight that if DOGE can hold key support around $0.19 and break above resistance near $0.30, the path toward $0.50–$1 becomes more plausible. A key resistance point lies near $0.21, often referred to as a “supply wall” due to heavy prior accumulation. Each time DOGE approaches the resistance level, selling pressure typically increases, causing repeated rejections. Thus, for DOGE to flip the narrative, a clean breakout above $0.21 coupled with volume would be critical. What Comes Next? Cautiously Optimistic Outlook In the short term, Dogecoin faces more likely downside or sideways action unless fresh buyer momentum emerges. But if support holds and a breakout occurs, the long-term technical structure suggests upside potential toward the $1 mark.

Bull Run Predictions Catch Attention The scenario isn’t guaranteed, it requires a confirmed reversal, rising volume, and a shift in sentiment.

Absent that, caution remains justified.

The success of its underlying technology directly influences its market perception and, consequently, its price. Current Market Standing: A Snapshot of VIRTUAL Token Performance To perform an accurate crypto price analysis , we must first assess the current market standing of the VIRTUAL token . Like all cryptocurrencies, VIRTUAL’s price is subject to high volatility, influenced by broader market trends, project developments, and investor sentiment. While specific real-time data fluctuates constantly, we can examine general patterns. Historically, new protocols often experience significant price movements during their initial phases, followed by periods of consolidation or rapid growth based on adoption and utility. Key metrics to watch include: Market Capitalization: The total value of all VIRTUAL tokens in circulation, indicating its overall size in the crypto market. Trading Volume: The amount of VIRTUAL traded over a specific period, reflecting liquidity and investor interest. Circulating Supply: The number of VIRTUAL tokens currently available to the public. These figures provide a baseline for our VIRTUAL price prediction . A healthy trading volume and growing market cap often signal increasing investor confidence and potential for future appreciation. Conversely, low liquidity or declining interest can pose challenges. Key Factors Influencing VIRTUAL Price Trajectory Predicting the trajectory of any digital asset, including Virtuals Protocol , involves analyzing a multitude of factors.

Virtuals Protocol Price Prediction 2025: What Does the Near Future Hold? Looking ahead to 2025, the VIRTUAL price prediction is subject to a blend of optimism and cautious realism. Assuming the broader crypto market continues its recovery and Virtuals Protocol hits key development milestones, we could see steady growth. The year 2025 is often viewed as a crucial period for projects to demonstrate tangible utility and expand their ecosystems. If Virtuals Protocol successfully launches significant upgrades, attracts new developers, and fosters a vibrant community, the demand for the VIRTUAL token could increase. Early adoption phases often lead to price appreciation as more users discover the project’s value proposition. Based on our crypto price analysis and considering market cycles, a conservative yet optimistic forecast for 2025 might place VIRTUAL in a range of $0.50 to $1.20 . This range accounts for potential market volatility but also reflects the growth potential if the protocol executes its roadmap effectively. Sustained positive news, increased partnerships, and a growing user base will be key drivers for reaching the higher end of this projection. Virtuals Protocol Price Prediction 2026-2027: Mid-Term Projections and Growth As we move into 2026 and 2027, the mid-term outlook for Virtuals Protocol becomes clearer, assuming the project continues its development and adoption trajectory. This period is critical for cementing its position in the competitive blockchain landscape. If Virtuals Protocol can establish itself as a go-to platform for specific use cases or a significant player in the broader decentralized ecosystem, its value proposition will strengthen considerably. The success of the protocol in attracting institutional interest and real-world applications will be pivotal. As the project matures, the VIRTUAL token ‘s utility could expand beyond basic transactions, potentially including enhanced staking rewards, exclusive access to features, or governance power. Such developments would naturally increase demand and reduce selling pressure. For the VIRTUAL price prediction between 2026 and 2027, a potential range could be from $1.00 to $2.50 . This projection hinges on: Consistent execution of the development roadmap. Significant growth in its user and developer base. Positive overall sentiment in the future crypto market. Successful integration with other major blockchain networks. This period will be a test of Virtuals Protocol’s ability to scale and maintain relevance amidst evolving technological trends and increasing competition. Virtuals Protocol Price Prediction 2028-2030: Will VIRTUAL Price Hit $5? The long-term vision for Virtuals Protocol , extending to 2028, 2029, and 2030, presents the most intriguing prospects and the biggest question: Will VIRTUAL price hit $5? Achieving such a milestone requires not just sustained growth but also significant market penetration and widespread recognition. For a long-term VIRTUAL price prediction , we must consider a scenario where Virtuals Protocol becomes a dominant or highly influential player in its target market. To reach $5, Virtuals Protocol would likely need to: Achieve Mass Adoption: Become a fundamental layer for a multitude of popular dApps, attracting millions of users and thousands of developers.

53611472,613837,1761375632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53611472.jpeg,Crypto.com Pursues National Trust Bank Charter Application With OCC,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-com-pursues-national-trust-bank-charter/,"Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com (CRO) announced on Friday its intention to apply for a national trust bank charter with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). This move aligns Crypto.com with other major firms in the industry, including Coinbase (COIN), Ripple Labs, stablecoin issuer Paxos, and Sony Bank, who are also pursuing similar charters in the country. What A National Trust Bank Charter Means For Crypto.com According to the exchange’s official statement on the matter, the application aims to enhance Crypto.com’s custody technology and expand its customer offerings, which include asset custody and staking across various blockchains and digital asset protocols, such as Cronos. A National Trust Bank Charter would establish Crypto.com as a preferred destination for custody services, particularly for Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), Exchange Traded-Funds (ETFs), and other corporate and institutional investors. Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder and CEO of Crypto.com, stated: We are excited to take this next step by filing for a National Trust Bank Charter and look forward to continuing to pursue opportunities to provide customers with the trusted services they require. It’s important to note that a national trust bank charter also allows companies to act as fiduciaries, manage assets, and settle transactions, but it does not permit them to accept deposits or extend loans like traditional banks. This special-purpose charter is particularly appealing to companies aiming to manage stablecoin reserves or other digital assets under a single federal regulator, the OCC, thereby avoiding the complexities of state-by-state licensing. A New Era For Crypto Banking In a related development, Erebor, a firm backed by Peter Thiel, has received partial regulatory approval from the OCC to launch, aimed at addressing the gap left by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). A source close to Erebor shared with the Financial Times that the bank aims to be a stable and reliable institution, stating, “We want to be a stable, low-risk, reliable bank doing normal banking things without screwing everyone over with undue risk.” Erebor will be headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, with an additional office in New York, offering digital-only customer service through a smartphone app and website. Furthermore, Erebor plans to incorporate stablecoins into its operations, aligning with the recent reversal of regulations by the Trump administration that limited banks from engaging in stablecoin transactions. The source mentioned that the bank’s swift approval reflects its “extremely conservative business plan,” emphasizing that it would not operate as a “wacky, techno crypto bank.” As the industry navigates this landscape under a pro-crypto administration, it remains to be seen whether applicants, including Crypto.com, will experience the same level of support as Erebor. However, it is evident that the crypto sector is in need of new banking services following the collapses of Silvergate and Signature Bank.

Pepeusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000635, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000461. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price faced strong selling around recent highs. This pushed the price of PEPE toward the intra day low of $0.00000713. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.000008 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A significant regulatory development occurred with PEPE’s inclusion in Indonesia’s approved cryptocurrency list on September 1, 2025. PT Central Finansial X (CFX), Indonesia’s first crypto exchange licensed by the Financial Services Authority (OJK), officially designated 1,444 crypto assets as legally tradable in Indonesia, including popular meme coins like PEPE, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Floki (FLOKI). PEPE Price Prediction October 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000008 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000011. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) October 2025 0.000008 0.000011 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses.

Today, we turn our attention to Virtuals Protocol, a project that’s been generating considerable buzz in the blockchain space. Investors and enthusiasts alike are eager to understand the potential trajectory of this digital asset. Our comprehensive guide delves deep into the Virtuals Protocol price prediction for the coming years, exploring whether the VIRTUAL token can truly reach the ambitious $5 mark. Let’s uncover the factors that could drive its value and what the future might hold for this intriguing crypto. Understanding Virtuals Protocol: The Core of VIRTUAL Crypto Before we dive into price forecasts, it’s essential to grasp what Virtuals Protocol is and the problem it aims to solve. At its heart, Virtuals Protocol is designed to be a foundational layer for the next generation of virtual worlds, metaverse applications, and decentralized gaming. It seeks to empower creators and users by providing robust infrastructure for digital asset ownership, interoperability, and true economic participation within virtual environments. This innovative approach positions VIRTUAL crypto not just as another digital token, but as a utility essential for a burgeoning digital economy. Decentralized Ownership: Virtuals Protocol emphasizes user ownership of digital assets, ensuring that items, land, and experiences within virtual worlds are truly owned by individuals, not centralized entities. Interoperability: A key challenge in the metaverse is the lack of seamless interaction between different virtual platforms. Virtuals Protocol aims to bridge these gaps, allowing assets and identities to move freely across various virtual spaces. Creator Economy: It provides tools and incentives for creators to build, monetize, and distribute their content within the protocol’s ecosystem, fostering a vibrant and self-sustaining community. The vision behind Virtuals Protocol is ambitious, aiming to lay the groundwork for a truly open and decentralized metaverse. Its success hinges on its ability to attract developers, users, and partnerships, all of which will play a crucial role in its adoption and, consequently, its market value. VIRTUAL Coin Price: A Historical Overview and Current Standing To make informed predictions, we must first examine the past performance and current market standing of the VIRTUAL coin price . Like many emerging cryptocurrencies, VIRTUAL has experienced periods of significant volatility since its inception. Its price movements are often influenced by broader market sentiment, project developments, partnership announcements, and overall interest in the metaverse and Web3 gaming sectors. Initially, tokens often see price surges driven by speculative interest and early adoption, followed by corrections as the market matures or new information emerges. Understanding these cycles is vital for any investor. Factors such as its initial listing price, all-time high, all-time low, trading volume, and market capitalization provide a snapshot of its journey. A healthy trading volume indicates liquidity and active market participation, while market capitalization reflects its total value in the crypto ecosystem. Analyzing historical data helps identify support and resistance levels, which are critical technical indicators. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, it offers valuable context for understanding the coin’s behavior under different market conditions. The current standing of VIRTUAL coin price reflects both the project’s ongoing development and the prevailing sentiment across the broader crypto landscape. Virtuals Protocol Price Prediction 2025: What’s on the Horizon? As we look towards 2025, several factors will likely influence the Virtuals Protocol price prediction . The crypto market is dynamic, but projections for the near future can be made by considering technological advancements, market adoption rates, and macro-economic trends. For Virtuals Protocol, 2025 could be a pivotal year. Technological Milestones: If Virtuals Protocol successfully rolls out key features, mainnet upgrades, or new developer tools, it could significantly boost confidence and attract more users and projects to its ecosystem. Partnerships and Integrations: Strategic collaborations with major gaming studios, metaverse platforms, or other blockchain projects would expand its reach and validate its utility, positively impacting its price. Broader Market Recovery: A general bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market, often influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and regulatory clarity, would likely lift altcoins like VIRTUAL. Conservative estimates might place VIRTUAL in a range reflecting steady growth, while more optimistic scenarios could see it making significant gains if the project hits critical development targets and market conditions are favorable. Many analysts suggest that if the metaverse and Web3 gaming sectors continue their expansion, projects with strong fundamentals like Virtuals Protocol are well-positioned for growth. While a precise number is difficult, a gradual ascent towards higher price points, possibly approaching the $1-$2 range, could be a realistic outlook for 2025 under favorable conditions. VIRTUAL Price Forecast 2026-2030: The Road to $5? Projecting the VIRTUAL price forecast out to 2030 involves a greater degree of speculation, but it allows us to consider the long-term potential of Virtuals Protocol. The question of whether VIRTUAL can hit $5 is a significant one, and it depends on a confluence of factors evolving over several years. For VIRTUAL to reach or surpass the $5 mark, it would likely require: Mass Adoption of the Metaverse: The widespread acceptance and integration of virtual worlds into daily life, similar to how the internet became ubiquitous. Virtuals Protocol as a Dominant Player: The protocol establishing itself as a leading infrastructure provider for metaverse development, attracting a large ecosystem of creators and users. Strong Tokenomics and Utility: The VIRTUAL token must maintain strong utility within the ecosystem, with increasing demand driven by network usage, staking, and governance. Sustained Bull Market: A prolonged period of growth across the entire crypto market, with significant capital flowing into innovative blockchain projects. If these conditions materialize, the growth potential for VIRTUAL could be substantial. By 2026, we might see VIRTUAL consolidating its position, potentially reaching targets between $2 and $3. Looking further to 2030, if Virtuals Protocol achieves its ambitious roadmap and becomes a cornerstone of the decentralized metaverse, the $5 target could indeed be within reach, or even surpassed. This long-term outlook is predicated on continuous innovation, effective community engagement, and a supportive market environment. However, it is crucial to remember that such long-term forecasts carry inherent risks and uncertainties. Comprehensive VIRTUAL Coin Analysis: What Drives the Value? A thorough VIRTUAL coin analysis goes beyond simple price charts and delves into the underlying factors that contribute to its value proposition. Understanding these drivers is key to forming a holistic view of its investment potential. Key Value Drivers: Technology and Innovation: The strength of Virtuals Protocol’s underlying blockchain technology, its scalability, security, and unique features for metaverse development. Team and Advisors: The experience and track record of the development team, their ability to execute the roadmap, and the support from influential advisors. Community and Ecosystem Growth: A thriving community of developers, users, and content creators is vital. A growing ecosystem translates to increased demand for the VIRTUAL token. Partnerships and Integrations: Collaborations with established companies, gaming platforms, or other blockchain projects can significantly boost adoption and visibility. Tokenomics: The design of the VIRTUAL token’s economic model, including its supply, distribution, utility (e.g., staking, governance, transaction fees), and inflation/deflation mechanisms. Market Trends: The overall sentiment and growth of the broader cryptocurrency market, especially the metaverse, Web3 gaming, and NFT sectors. Regulatory Environment: Evolving regulations can impact crypto projects. A favorable or clear regulatory landscape can foster growth, while restrictive policies can hinder it. Each of these elements plays a role in shaping the perceived and actual value of the VIRTUAL token. A strong performance across most of these categories would significantly enhance its potential for long-term appreciation. Navigating VIRTUAL Market Trends: Opportunities and Challenges Understanding VIRTUAL market trends is crucial for any investor considering this asset. The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its volatility, and VIRTUAL is no exception. However, within these trends lie both significant opportunities and considerable challenges. Opportunities: Emerging Metaverse Economy: The metaverse is still in its nascent stages, offering immense growth potential. Virtuals Protocol, as a foundational layer, stands to benefit significantly from this expansion. Decentralization Demand: Increasing demand for true digital ownership and decentralized experiences aligns perfectly with Virtuals Protocol’s core offerings. Innovation in Web3 Gaming: The shift towards play-to-earn and blockchain-integrated gaming provides a fertile ground for VIRTUAL’s utility and adoption. Strategic Partnerships: Future collaborations could unlock new user bases and use cases, driving demand for the token. Challenges: Competition: The metaverse and Web3 space are becoming increasingly crowded with numerous projects vying for market share. Technological Hurdles: Scaling blockchain technology to support complex virtual worlds without compromising decentralization or security remains a significant challenge. Market Volatility: Broad crypto market downturns can negatively impact even strong projects, leading to price corrections. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets could introduce unforeseen challenges or restrictions. User Adoption: Educating and onboarding mainstream users into complex decentralized ecosystems can be a slow process. Investors must weigh these factors carefully. While the opportunities are compelling, the challenges are real and require continuous innovation and strategic execution from the Virtuals Protocol team. Is VIRTUAL a Smart Investment? Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio Considering all the factors discussed, is VIRTUAL a smart investment for your portfolio? The answer, as with most crypto assets, depends on your individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. However, we can offer some actionable insights to help you make an informed decision. Actionable Insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on predictions. Deep dive into Virtuals Protocol’s whitepaper, team, roadmap, and community activity. Understand the Metaverse Landscape: Familiarize yourself with the broader trends in the metaverse and Web3 gaming. This context is crucial for assessing VIRTUAL’s long-term viability. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given crypto volatility, investing a fixed amount regularly can help mitigate risk by averaging out your purchase price over time. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one asset. Spread your investments across various cryptocurrencies and asset classes to manage risk. Monitor Development and News: Stay updated on Virtuals Protocol’s progress, partnership announcements, and any significant market news that could impact its price. Set Realistic Expectations: While a $5 target is exciting, remember that crypto investments are highly speculative. Prepare for potential volatility and only invest what you can afford to lose. Virtuals Protocol presents an intriguing proposition for those bullish on the future of decentralized virtual worlds. Its foundational role could position it for substantial growth, but the journey will undoubtedly involve market fluctuations and competitive pressures. A disciplined approach, combined with continuous learning, is your best strategy. Conclusion: The Astounding Potential of Virtuals Protocol Our deep dive into the Virtuals Protocol price prediction reveals a project with considerable potential within the rapidly evolving landscape of the metaverse and Web3. From its innovative approach to decentralized ownership and interoperability to its ambitious roadmap, VIRTUAL aims to be a cornerstone of future virtual economies.

Recently, a notable change has been observed concerning Bitcoin selling pressure , offering a fresh perspective for investors and traders alike. This development suggests a potential turning point, moving away from a period dominated by profit-taking and market corrections. Is Bitcoin Selling Pressure Truly Easing? An Analyst’s Perspective According to crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., there’s compelling evidence that the Bitcoin selling pressure is indeed slowing down. His analysis highlights a significant trend: the proportion of addresses selling BTC at a profit has visibly declined. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it points to a deeper shift in how market participants are currently viewing Bitcoin’s value and its future trajectory. What does this reduction in profitable selling actually signify? Traders see dips as opportunities: Many investors are now interpreting recent price drops not as a signal to exit, but as an attractive entry point to accumulate more Bitcoin. This indicates a bullish underlying sentiment among a segment of the market. Slowing rate of losses: The pace at which profitable addresses are slipping into a loss-making position is decelerating. This stability suggests a stronger holding conviction. Re-entering profitability: Addresses that were previously underwater are now finding themselves back in the green, often fueled by renewed buying interest. These combined factors paint a clear picture: the negative momentum that might have been weighing on Bitcoin has eased considerably. This shift is crucial for understanding the market’s immediate future. What Does Easing Bitcoin Selling Pressure Mean for Traders? The implications of reduced Bitcoin selling pressure are substantial for anyone involved in the crypto space. When fewer holders are rushing to sell at a profit, it removes a significant hurdle for price appreciation. Essentially, the market is absorbing available supply more readily, which can lead to more stable price action and potentially upward movement. For traders, this development often signals a transition from a seller’s market to one where buyers have more influence. It suggests that: Market confidence may be returning: A decrease in profit-taking can indicate that investors expect higher prices in the future, choosing to hold onto their assets rather than cash out immediately. Potential for accumulation phases: Periods of easing selling pressure often precede phases of accumulation, where smart money and long-term investors build their positions. Reduced volatility: With less aggressive selling, the market tends to experience less drastic price swings, making it a potentially calmer environment for trading decisions. However, it is important to remember that the crypto market remains inherently volatile. While these signs are optimistic, external factors and broader economic conditions can always influence Bitcoin’s price movements. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from Reduced Selling Pressure Understanding the dynamics of Bitcoin selling pressure provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making. For those looking to capitalize on this evolving market sentiment, here are some actionable considerations: Monitor on-chain data: Keep an eye on metrics like ‘SOPR’ (Spent Output Profit Ratio) and ‘Net Unrealized Profit/Loss’ (NUPL), which can offer further confirmation of investor behavior. Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA): If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, an easing of selling pressure might present opportune moments to gradually increase your holdings without trying to perfectly time the market bottom. Diversify your portfolio: While Bitcoin’s outlook seems brighter, a well-diversified portfolio is always a prudent approach in the crypto space. Stay informed: Continuously follow reputable analyst insights and market news to adapt your strategy as conditions evolve. This period of reduced selling pressure could represent a crucial juncture for Bitcoin. It suggests a growing resilience among holders and a renewed belief in the asset’s intrinsic value, moving past immediate profit-taking impulses. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Bitcoin’s Future The analysis indicating easing Bitcoin selling pressure offers a significant glimmer of hope for the crypto market. It signals a shift in investor psychology, where price dips are increasingly viewed as buying opportunities rather than reasons for panic selling. While no single indicator guarantees future price action, this reduction in negative momentum is a powerful sign of growing stability and potentially renewed bullish sentiment for Bitcoin. Traders and investors should observe these trends closely, as they could herald a more positive phase for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is Bitcoin selling pressure? Bitcoin selling pressure refers to the collective force of market participants looking to sell their Bitcoin holdings. High selling pressure typically leads to price declines, as there are more sellers than buyers. Conversely, easing selling pressure means fewer people are eager to sell, often indicating stronger buying interest or holding conviction. Who is Axel Adler Jr. and why is his analysis important? Axel Adler Jr. is a recognized crypto analyst known for his on-chain data analysis. His insights are important because they provide a deeper look into the fundamental behaviors of Bitcoin holders, moving beyond simple price charts to understand underlying market dynamics and sentiment. What does ‘addresses selling BTC at a profit’ mean? This metric refers to the percentage of unique Bitcoin addresses that are moving their BTC when the price is higher than when they acquired it. A decline in this proportion suggests that fewer holders are taking profits, indicating they either expect higher prices or are not being forced to sell. Does easing Bitcoin selling pressure guarantee a price increase? While easing Bitcoin selling pressure is a positive indicator and often precedes periods of price stability or growth, it does not guarantee an immediate or sustained price increase. The crypto market is influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment. It’s one strong signal among many. How can investors use this information? Investors can use this information to inform their strategies. It suggests a potentially more favorable environment for long-term accumulation or for considering new entry points. However, it should always be combined with other forms of analysis and a clear understanding of personal risk tolerance. Did you find this analysis helpful?

And history is set to repeat itself as analysts and AI models such as ChatGPT posit Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an upcoming token that is emulating Ethereum’s early days in innovation, adoption potential, and upside potential. That endeavor is an upstart DeFi giant going at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale. The phase is already more than 75% sold out and investors have less than a couple of days left before it sells out. Mutuum Finance is rapidly becoming the leading top crypto with the capability to provide 1000x long-term returns, a modern-day equal of Ethereum’s legendary meteoric increase. Investors who are searching for the best crypto to buy now are closely monitoring MUTM’s progress and potential. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis: Bears Tighten Their Grasp Below $4K Ethereum (ETH) is presently exhibiting weakness as bears tighten their grasp below the pivotal $4,000 level. The token was unable to hold above the 20-day EMA ($4,062), showing that there are Sellers at work even on minor rallies. ETH is being tested now close to its channel support, where bulls must stand firm to prevent further dips. A breakdown below here might witness the price drop into a steeper move towards $3,350, or a retest of the $3,200 zone before buyers can take another stab at trying to regain control. Conversely, if ETH can recover the $4,060–$4,250 range, a relief rally to $4,400+ could ensue that could be a short-term reversal indicator. Though Ethereum is a stronghold of the crypto scene, investors are growing curious to look out to newer plays with comparable long-term prospects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been likened to the early growth story of ETH, further solidifying its position as the top crypto to watch. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Phase 6 Almost Sold Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is attracting serious money, so MUTM is the best crypto to buy now in 2025. Stage 6 is where the token is priced at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from Stage 5 and the lowest that it will ever be. Reaching the end of Stage 6 will usher in Stage 7 at $0.04. This is a 14.28% jump, so getting in as early as possible is incredibly important. Investor demand is still high, with more than 17,400 investors purchasing in excess of $17.85 million to this date. Since 70% of Phase 6 has sold, investor demand is high as investors scramble for access to this growth DeFi platform and secure a position in the top crypto opportunities available today. Secure Architecture and Incentive-Based Community Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a robust security design to safeguard its protocol and users. It has a Loan-to-Value architecture, asset-backed collateral levels, and risk-based lending and transfer liquidation levels according to the risk classification of all assets. It also has a reserve factor as an insurance component against potential future defaults and market extremity, where riskier assets have larger reserves in place to offer greater protection to the platform and users. While that’s on, Mutuum Finance is creating a vibrant and busy community via a $100,000 giveaway contest. Ten users stand to win $10,000 each in MUTM tokens courtesy of this promotion, with the rewards distributed based on new investments into the project. The Next Ethereum Ethereum turned its early adopters into millionaires, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can do the same. Having raised more than $17.85 million from over 17,400 investors already, its Phase 6 presale is 75% sold through at only $0.035 per token. With the demand pushing up ahead of the Stage 7 price hike to $0.04, investors are able to obtain early positions. AI models and analysts predict MUTM to be the next Ethereum-level growth story with long-term returns of 1000x potential, making it the best crypto to buy now.

The report noted that the ETH price is still correcting within the falling trend channel (red lines) and is struggling to hold above the $3,727 support level. Buyers have stepped in at this level several times. According to the analytics firm: In the short-term outlook, the $3,600 level is central. According to MakroVision, this area, along with the lower boundary of the channel, is key support. A break below this level could send the price towards the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, which is around $3,174. Meanwhile, it was noted that a break above $4,290 is needed for an upward move. Analysts believe that breaking this level could spark new upward momentum, targeting $4,780 and above.

The precious metal breached $4,000 per ounce for the first time in history on October 10, before shedding more than 6% of its value earlier this week after trade tensions cooled. The surge in bullion prices culminated in a record $4,300 per troy ounce before the market experienced its steepest one-day drop in over ten years on October 21, Cryptopolitan reported . Despite the correction, gold is one of 2025’s strongest performing assets, up roughly 50% year to date. Central banks take up Gold to counter market uncertainty According to data compiled by Bloomberg, October saw a surge in gold-backed exchange-traded fund holdings, which hit their highest levels in more than three years. Central banks have been net buyers of gold for 15 consecutive years, but their pace ticked upwards after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Western sanctions froze a large portion of Russia’s foreign reserves in geopolitical retaliation, prompting other central banks to diversify away from the US dollar and expand their gold reserves. The World Gold Council reported that global central banks purchased more than 1,000 tons of bullion for a third straight year in 2024, holding roughly one-fifth of all the gold ever mined. Central Banks gold accumulation chart. Source: Apollo Academy. Many of the most aggressive buyers are countries that were not part of the post-World War II Bretton Woods system, which established the dollar as the global reserve currency and underpinned by gold. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has been adding to its holdings for 11 consecutive months through September. China’s central bank is also seeking to become a custodian for foreign sovereign gold reserves, Bloomberg reported . “China is playing a key role in the ongoing rise in gold prices because of central bank buying, arbitrage trading, and increased speculative and safe-haven demand among Chinese households,” wrote Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, in a research note published last Tuesday. Most of the world’s official gold is traditionally stored in the Bank of England’s vaults, which currently hold more than 5,000 tons of the global total. Morgan Stanley Research recently revised its 2026 price forecast upward to $4,400 per ounce, from a previous estimate of $3,313. The new projection implies an additional 10% gain from early October levels. “We see further upside in gold, driven by a falling US dollar, strong ETF buying, continued central bank purchases and a backdrop of uncertainty supporting demand for this safe-haven asset,” said Amy Gower, Metals and Mining Commodity Strategist at Morgan Stanley. The metal has a long history of performing bullishly during periods of market turmoil, having crossed psychological thresholds in each major crisis over the past two decades. It accelerated past $1,000 an ounce during the 2008 financial crisis, clocked $2,000 during the Covid-19 pandemic, and surged to $3,000 after President Trump’s Liberation Day tariff escalations in April this year. Tariffs, inflation, and Fed rates cut optimism According to the World Gold Council, tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have increased import costs and raised the risk of higher consumer prices in the global economy. The POTUS’s public criticism of the Federal Reserve and his persistent calls for more relaxed rate decisions have shaken confidence in the central bank’s independence. Investors expect the Federal Reserve to continue cutting rates this year as economic uncertainty mounts. Historically, gold prices have risen by about 6% on average within two months of the start of a Fed rate-cutting cycle. “With all these factors, it probably comes as no surprise that gold is right up at the top of our order of preference among commodities,” Gower added. The US dollar’s slide has been another factor behind gold’s ascent, because bullion is priced in dollars, and a weaker greenback makes gold more affordable to foreign investors. In mid-September, the dollar fell to its weakest level in more than three years against major global currencies. Get seen where it counts.

This occurred as BTC continued to trade below the 99-day Moving Average (MA), located around $112,086. Bitcoin Liquidity Dries Up Amid High Demand According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Bitcoin’s sell-side liquidity is drying up at a rapid pace, recently hitting a seven-year low at 3.12 million BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Score Turns Negative With Trend Below $106,780 – When Will The Correction End? As BTC’s supply tumbles sharply, the cryptocurrency is trading in the low $110,000 range, indicating a delicate balance between falling active circulating supply and growing institutional demand. Latest on-chain data shows that demand for BTC from long-term holders’ addresses has been steadily rising. Over the past 30 days, long-term investors have accumulated 373,700 BTC. Long-term investors accumulating BTC during the latest dip shows that there is sufficient market demand for the flagship cryptocurrency despite a volatile crypto market. Arab Chain remarked that the market is currently in a “quiet accumulation” phase ahead of a potential breakout. The CryptoQuant analyst emphasized that the Liquidity Inventory Ratio (LIR) has crashed to around 8.3 months, suggesting that current market liquidity covers less than nine months’ worth of demand – confirming the rapid depletion in BTC’s sellable supply. For the uninitiated, the LIR measures the balance between available liquidity and active trading demand in the market, showing whether market makers are providing sufficient depth relative to recent trade volume. A high LIR suggests ample liquidity and stable price movement, while a low LIR indicates thinner order books and higher vulnerability to volatility or slippage. The medium-term outlook for BTC looks bullish, due to a combination of declining liquidity and growing demand from institutional and long-term investors. Arab Chain added: If this trend continues through the end of the fourth quarter, Bitcoin’s price could surpass $115,000, especially if accompanied by rising buying flows from US investment funds and ETFs, supporting the continuation of the current bullish trend. BTC Top Not In Yet While some analysts predict that BTC may have already peaked this market cycle, others are confident that the top cryptocurrency is yet to hit its cycle high. Recent on-chain data indicates that BTC NVT Golden Cross is yet to enter the territory that marked previous cycle tops.

JPMorgan To Allow Bitcoin, Ether As Collateral On Friday, Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to let its institutional clients use the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether, as collateral for loans by the end of 2025. This follows the bank’s move to allow crypto-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) as collateral. In June, the bank began allowing both institutional and retail clients globally to use spot crypto-linked ETFs, like BlackRock’s IBIT, to pledge the investment products. Previously, clients could only do it on a case-by-case basis. According to people familiar with the matter, the new program will be offered globally, allowing JPMorgan’s clients to pledge their Bitcoin and Ether holdings as security for loans, expanding Wall Street’s crypto integration. The program is set to rely on a third-party custodian to safeguard the pledged assets. Bloomberg sources affirmed that the largest US bank first began exploring the idea of lending against Bitcoin in 2022. However, the project was reportedly shelved due to regulatory challenges. Since then, there have been significant developments in the US crypto landscape, including a massive surge in institutional adoption and the government’s regulatory shift to make America the “Crypto Capital of the World.” In July, some reports suggested that the banking giant was once again exploring the idea of expanding its lending operations to include crypto-collateralized loans, as the bank’s earlier rigid stance on digital assets seemingly alienated some prospective clients. JPMorgan’s Crypto Shift It’s worth noting that JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been a long-time crypto skeptic. In January, the CEO called the flagship crypto a “Ponzi scheme” and dismissed it as “useless as a pet rock.” Nonetheless, he announced a change in the bank’s policy in May to allow clients to purchase Bitcoin. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients,” Dimon stated, explaining that the decision came despite his personal stance on digital assets. Since then, JPMorgan has shared plans to embrace stablecoins and crypto trading. In July, the bank announced its intention to launch a limited version of a stablecoin for its clients, arguing that they “can’t afford to stay on the sidelines” as other major institutions start to offer crypto-linked products. Last week, JPMorgan also announced its plans to allow clients to trade crypto assets. As reported by Bitcoinist, senior executives affirmed that JPMorgan is developing services that will enable its clients to trade cryptocurrencies directly through the bank. Notably, US Bancorp previously announced that it has relaunched its offering of crypto custody services after more than three years, following the removal of a Biden-era guidance that prevented financial institutions from providing these services. Meanwhile, Citigroup was also exploring plans to offer crypto custody, payment services, and custody offerings for spot crypto ETFs. However, JPMorgan’s global head of markets and digital assets, Scott Lucas, noted that custody is “not on the horizon near-term.” The executive explained last week that risk rules and regulatory developments will determine how far the bank expands in the future.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Collateralized loans|Crypto Custody|Crypto Trading|ETH|Ether|Ethereum|Jamie Dimon|JPMorgan|JPMorgan Bitcoin|JPMorgan crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 08:00:32

In 2027, it will range between $2.47 and $2.80, with an average price of $2.54. In 2030, it will range between $7.94 and $9.64, with an average price of $8.17. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will its price be in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031.

The coin is down 13.63% in the last 30 days. Its market recorded less trading interest as trading volumes dropped by 0.68% to $340.5M. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView APE fell below $1 in January and $0.5 in April. This month, it trades at the $0.4 mark after a sharp decline over the last two weeks. The MACD histogram shows its positive momentum rose in the last three days. Its volatility dropped over the same period. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s break above $0.42 resistance. Unlike the daily chart, its volatility is rising as the positive market momentum wanes. The break pushed APE into overbought territory, but it has corrected with the RSI at 63.43.

Over the short term, APE price analysis shows that APE is attempting a recovery; however, its momentum remains low. The general market remains bearish, with the Fear and Greed Index showing a fear sentiment among traders. Low trading volumes confirm less conviction in the current market trend. Why is APE down? APE’s rally reflects NFT sector tailwinds as the BAYC market cap surged, event-driven speculation, and technical momentum. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. driven by the APE bridge to ApeChain and growing utility and applications, such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news While Solana’s low fees attracted new users, the dissolution of ApeCoin DAO (99.66% approval) alienated decentralization advocates. ApeCo’s 10M APE treasury allocation ($3.72M) added inflationary pressure. APE price prediction October 2025 The APE October price prediction ranges between $0.35 and $0.70, with an average of $0.59.

However, a fascinating trend is emerging in the market, particularly concerning Bitcoin volatility . Despite trading near its all-time high, Bitcoin is currently exhibiting remarkably low volatility, a phenomenon that has captured the attention of market analysts. This unusual stability could be signaling something significant for the future of the leading digital asset. What’s Behind Bitcoin’s Surprisingly Low Volatility? Joe Consorti, the head of growth at the prominent Bitcoin custody firm Theya, has brought this intriguing observation to light. He notes that Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading within a surprisingly tight 15% range of its all-time high for an extended period – specifically, eight months this year. This prolonged period of calm at such elevated price levels is quite unusual for an asset known for its dramatic price action. Consorti explains that this current behavior, characterized by low Bitcoin volatility , paradoxically resembles a price bottom rather than a market top. Typically, when Bitcoin reaches new record highs, it’s often accompanied by increased speculation and heightened price fluctuations. However, the market is showing a different face this time. Key characteristics of this unique phase include: Tight Trading Range: Bitcoin has maintained a narrow price corridor despite its proximity to historical peaks. Extended Duration: Eight months of consolidation is a significant period for any asset, let alone one as dynamic as Bitcoin. Proximity to All-Time High: This stability is occurring precisely when one might expect more turbulence. Why Is This Bitcoin Volatility Pattern So Unprecedented? Historically, Bitcoin’s journey to new all-time highs has rarely been this smooth. Consorti emphasizes that Bitcoin has “never consolidated in this manner near an all-time high.” This makes the current period particularly noteworthy for anyone tracking market trends. Consolidation, in financial terms, refers to a period where an asset’s price moves within a limited range, often building a base of support or absorbing selling pressure before its next major move. The significance of this calm period cannot be overstated. It suggests a potential shift in market dynamics. Perhaps it reflects a growing maturity of the asset, with a more stable investor base. Moreover, increased institutional interest might be contributing to this newfound stability, as larger players tend to have longer investment horizons and less reactive trading strategies. Consequently, the reduced speculative frenzy, compared to previous bull cycles, could be a key factor in the sustained low Bitcoin volatility we are witnessing. Are Explosive Bitcoin Gains on the Horizon? Given this unusual and extended period of consolidation, Consorti finds it “difficult not to anticipate a further rise.” This sentiment resonates with many analysts who view such calm before a storm as a powerful bullish signal. When an asset consolidates tightly after a significant upward move, it often indicates that it’s gathering momentum for its next major leg up. In Bitcoin’s case, with its historical tendency for rapid price appreciation, this period of low Bitcoin volatility could indeed be setting the stage for an explosive rally. What does this mean for investors? The potential benefits are clear: significant price appreciation without the extreme, stomach-churning swings that often accompany Bitcoin’s rallies. This suggests that patient investors holding through this consolidation period might be rewarded handsomely. An actionable insight here is to consider a long-term perspective, recognizing that these periods of calm can be crucial precursors to substantial growth. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the unique nature of this current market phase provides a compelling argument for optimism. Navigating the Future: Potential Challenges and Considerations While the analyst’s insights paint a promising picture, it’s important to remember that no investment is without risk. The cryptocurrency market remains influenced by various external factors, including global macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and unforeseen market events. Therefore, while the low Bitcoin volatility is a strong signal, it doesn’t guarantee future gains. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance. However, the core message from Consorti’s analysis is about the strength of the underlying signal. The market is behaving in a way it never has before at these price levels, suggesting a robust foundation for potential future growth. This unprecedented period of stability at the top could truly be the quiet before a significant wave of upward price action for Bitcoin. The current low Bitcoin volatility near its all-time high presents a compelling and unusual market signal. As highlighted by analyst Joe Consorti, this unprecedented consolidation suggests that rather than a typical market top, Bitcoin may be preparing for substantial further gains. While the crypto market always holds an element of unpredictability, the current stability at such high levels offers a unique perspective for those anticipating Bitcoin’s next major move. This unique phase could define Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming months, making it a critical period for observation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitcoin volatility? Bitcoin volatility refers to how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates over a given period. High volatility means rapid and significant price changes, while low volatility indicates more stable and gradual price movements. Why is low volatility near an all-time high unusual for Bitcoin? Historically, when Bitcoin approaches or sets new all-time highs, it’s typically accompanied by increased buying and selling pressure, leading to significant price swings and higher volatility. The current stability is a departure from this pattern. Who is Joe Consorti? Joe Consorti is the head of growth at Theya, a Bitcoin custody firm. He is an analyst known for his observations on Bitcoin market trends. Does low volatility guarantee future Bitcoin gains? While low volatility near an all-time high can be a strong bullish signal, no market indicator guarantees future gains. The analysis suggests a high probability of further increases, but investors should always be aware of market risks. How long has Bitcoin been consolidating near its all-time high? According to Joe Consorti’s analysis, Bitcoin has been trading within a 15% range of its all-time high for eight months this year, indicating a prolonged period of consolidation.

The sector’s total market cap has plunged from over $20 billion in mid-September to around $14 billion today, weighed down by weak demand, slowed development, and investor fatigue. New projects keep launching, but few retain users or deliver meaningful gameplay. The hype-driven “play-to-earn” era is clearly behind us. What’s missing is real engagement — and real businesses. TRUE World can change the game. This Web3 progression layer within the TRUE LABS ecosystem is preparing to list the $TRUE token — and it’s doing so from a position of strength, not speculation. TRUE World Playbook: $TRUE to Power a Vast Web3 Gaming Ecosystem Founded in 2019, TRUE LABS has built a global presence as a game developer that has delivered over 60 high-performing titles. With 4.5 million paying players and €7 million+ in monthly gross revenue, it stands among the few game studios entering Web3 backed by a proven business model. Now, TRUE LABS plans to list its native $TRUE token that fuels a full-scale ecosystem — connecting TRUE LABS, TRUE World, and TRUE Wallet into one unified economy. “The blockchain finally allows us to bring our founding principles of transparency and fairness on-chain,” said Dan Andrianov , CEO of TRUE LABS. “With $TRUE, we’re not just launching a token. We’re giving players a real stake in the world they already love to play in.” TRUE World Evolves into Web3 Gaming Ecosystem TRUE LABS’ rebrand under the slogan “Play Like a Legend. Live Like a Legend. Be TRUE.” marks its transformation from a Web2 game developer into a multi-layered Web3 ecosystem. The company now operates through three core pillars: TRUE LABS — Over 60 live titles across 1,700+ operators, generating €7M+ in monthly GGR and reaching millions of paying users. TRUE World — A progression-based loyalty layer that turns every play into a quest, level, or tournament. $TRUE Token — The economic engine that powers the ecosystem, enabling rewards, staking, and cross-game progression. $TRUE Lies at the Heart of TRUE World The $TRUE token acts as the core utility asset across TRUE World, unlocking: Player progression and achievements across games Access to tournaments, NFT utilities, and marketplace features Unified loyalty and governance mechanisms for the TRUE community Its design goes beyond typical “play-to-earn” logic. Every element of the TRUE LABS economy feeds back into the $TRUE framework, creating a deflationary system powered by actual gaming activity. Burns occur each time players craft or upgrade in-game assets. Meanwhile, buybacks are funded by TRUE LABS’ real-world revenue, repurchasing $TRUE from the open market and burning it. This model ties token scarcity directly to business performance — an approach the broader GameFi space has largely failed to implement. The token is scheduled to be listed on Tier-1 CEX and DEX platforms in Q4 2025, marking a milestone for Web3 integration within the gaming industry. Why Watch the $TRUE Token Listing? TRUE LABS’ entry into Web3 is a structural expansion. In an industry where most projects struggle to retain even a few thousand users, the studio’s established footprint and consistent revenue create a rare foundation for sustainable GameFi growth. If the listing succeeds, it could reignite momentum across the GameFi market, proving that blockchain integration can enhance mainstream gaming. The highly-anticipated launch of $TRUE represents a real-world bridge between web2 gaming and transparent, player-owned economies. The Takeaway GameFi’s downturn has been defined by hype fatigue and broken token models. In contrast, TRUE LABS is entering that landscape with a functioning economy and an established audience. Its $TRUE token may not single-handedly revive the GameFi market, but it could become the first credible example of how a traditional gaming business with real revenue and regulation can thrive on-chain. For crypto investors watching for signs of life in GameFi, this may be the alpha call worth paying attention to.

Whether you trade daily or hold long term, keeping your digital assets safe is essential. In 2025, wallet technology has evolved — offering stronger encryption, institutional-grade custody, and even regulatory compliance. This review looks at the top five secured crypto wallets that combine ease of use with advanced protection — featuring Clapp, a licensed European platform offering an integrated wallet with institutional security. 1. Clapp — Regulated Wallet With Institutional-Grade Security Highlights: Licensed crypto platform (VASP, EU-regulated) Fireblocks security infrastructure used by major financial institutions Integrated trading and fiat bridge (EUR on/off ramp) Portfolio management and credit lines Cross-asset liquidity aggregation for optimized execution Review: Clapp.finance offers more than a wallet — it’s a complete crypto hub. Users can store, send, and receive assets securely while also trading and managing portfolios in one interface. Clapp takes a custodial-plus-compliance approach, relying on Fireblocks’ institutional technology to safeguard assets. This makes it particularly appealing to users who prefer regulated environments and fiat accessibility over full self-custody. Its European VASP license (Czech Republic) reinforces Clapp’s focus on compliance and trust. 2. MetaMask — Leading Non-Custodial Wallet for DeFi Users Highlights: Browser and mobile wallet supporting multiple blockchains Full self-custody: you control your keys Integrated swap, staking, and portfolio features Open-source, widely adopted Review:MetaMask remains the go-to wallet for decentralized finance. It allows users to connect directly with dApps, store NFTs, and manage tokens across EVM-compatible networks. The trade-off for control is responsibility: users must protect their private keys and beware of phishing attempts. In 2025, MetaMask continues improving user safety through clearer transaction prompts and scam detection — but vigilance is still required. 3. Trust Wallet — Multi-Chain Mobile Wallet With Simple Interface Best for: Everyday crypto users who want simplicity and control. Highlights: Supports 100+ blockchains and millions of tokens Built-in swaps, staking, and NFT storage Non-custodial (you hold the keys) Backed by Binance, yet remains independent Review:Trust Wallet is one of the most popular mobile wallets, known for its broad asset support and clean user experience. It strikes a good balance between security and accessibility, offering encrypted key storage on your device and local backups. While mobile wallets can be less secure than cold storage, Trust Wallet’s multi-layer protection and active development make it one of the safest soft wallets available in 2025. 4. Coinbase Wallet — Secure Ecosystem With Exchange Integration Highlights: Separate from Coinbase exchange account Private keys stored locally Access to DeFi apps and NFTs Cloud backup option for recovery Review:Coinbase Wallet bridges the gap between regulated exchange users and DeFi explorers. It’s ideal for those transitioning from custodial exchange accounts to self-custody. Security is backed by Coinbase’s established reputation, and the optional encrypted cloud backup ensures recovery in case of device loss — though users should verify privacy settings. 5. Crypto.com DeFi Wallet — Multi-Layer Protection With App Ecosystem Highlights: Supports 1,000+ tokens across multiple chains Biometric security and encrypted backups Direct link to Crypto.com exchange and card services Option to earn rewards via staking Review:Crypto.com’s DeFi Wallet complements its exchange, offering user-controlled keys and multi-factor security. The wallet uses local encryption, biometric access, and an intuitive interface for both beginners and advanced users. It’s particularly useful for those who already use Crypto.com’s products and want to keep all services under one brand. Final Thoughts Each of these wallets serves a different user profile: Clapp prioritizes compliance, offering integrated trading and fiat ramps. MetaMask and Trust Wallet provide full self-custody for decentralized users. Coinbase Wallet and Crypto.com DeFi Wallet balance convenience with strong in-app security. The right choice depends on your priorities — whether that’s full control, regulatory oversight, fiat integration, or DeFi access.

MSTR and Bitcoin are positioned for a potential rally, driven by macro tailwinds, dovish Fed signals, and bearish sentiment. Technically, MSTR is in an accumulation range with significant upside if Bitcoin rallies, and the NAV premium is historically low. Risks remain if Bitcoin fails to hold key support, but the risk/reward setup favors substantial upside for MSTR if crypto markets rebound. Thesis Summary MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has been sliding down for the last 3 months. But after the recent crypto flush out, and given the nice bounce from the recent lows, I believe there’s a good setup for MSTR and potentially Bitcoin (BTC-USD) going forward. MSTR’s dip looks buyable, both in terms of technicals and fundamentals. A Quick Recap My last MSTR post was almost six months ago. Back then, I made the case that MSTR was reaching a buyable breakout. While the stock did go on to rally over the next month or so, we have been in a steady slide since mid-July. More recently, I spoke about Bitcoin looking toppy , but with room for a final rally into the $150,00 zone. Following the latest flush out in crypto, which saw $20 billion in capital wiped out, I believe we now have the right set-up in Bitcoin and Strategy to see a meaningful bounce, perhaps even new all-time highs. The Fundamentals The fundamentals still look supportive of higher Bitcoin prices. The “debasement trade”, which I covered recently in this post, is very much still in play. The current administration wants to outgrow the deficit and do so with the help of a dovish Fed. With inflation data coming out today weaker than expected , the road may now be clear for more cuts, and Powell has even talked about ending QT in the near future. Plus, as I highlighted in my last gold article, the spectacular rally we have seen in gold could soon be followed by a similar rally in Bitcoin, if history is to repeat itself. Crypto Fear And Greed (CMC) All this at a time when Crypto sentiment is still quite bearish. This is when you buy, not when you sell. All in all, there’s a good confluence of macro tailwinds, bearish sentiment, and positioning that tells me we could be in for another fast and furious rally. The Technicals From a technical perspective, this seems like a good risk/reward setup. Let’s start by looking at the underlying asset, Bitcoin. BTC TA (Trendspider) For the time being, Bitcoin has bounced beautifully off the 200-day EMA, for now, and this could set the low. Ideally, I would love to see a quick double bottom form, much like we saw back in March, with a quick dip below the 200 EMA, finding support at $97K and potentially forming a larger bullish divergence with the RSI. Now, let’s look at MSTR. MSTR 1 Day chart (Trendspider) Like Bitcoin, MSTR looks like it could be close to a bottom. The RSI has trended higher over the last few weeks, though arguably we are still below the key EMAs, so the chart looks a bit worse. MSTR 1 week chart (Trendspider) Zooming out to the weekly, we can see that MSTR is within an accumulation range that has been going on for months. We saw this happen back in March 2024 before the big rally, and this could be a repeat. Like Bitcoin, there’s room for a slight retest of lower lows, but either way, this price today seems quite good if we are indeed expecting a significant rally. A simple retest of recent highs would imply a 60% rally from today’s price, which is nothing to scoff at. MSTR over Bitcoin? I would defend owning both, but I would expect MSTR to outperform Bitcoin if it rallies to new highs. The current NAV premium for MSTR is historically low, close to 1.2, and I’d expect this to increase as Bitcoin rallies. Why? Firstly, because MSTR already has Bitcoin in its balance sheet, this increases its leverage potential. The whole strategy behind Strategy works when Bitcoin is rising, and that is a reason there’s a premium. On the other hand, FOMO and sentiment should also make retail names in crypto catch a bid. With short interest near 10%, this also gives MSTR some short squeeze potential. Risks There’s also the chance that the Bitcoin cycle has ended, and we don’t actually see new highs for some time. This is a distinct possibility investors should not ignore. We are nearing what would be the end of the Bitcoin 4-year cycle, and we are near important levels of support after the recent sell-off. If Bitcoin breaks below $90K, this would be a big hit to my bull thesis. Final Thoughts All in all, I like the setup right now for MSTR and Bitcoin. This could be risky, of course, but there’s plenty of upside potential. If Bitcoin breaks towards new all-time highs, there’s room for MSTR to even double from here.",BTC-USD|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-25 08:15:20
53613808,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/top-5-crypto-loan-providers-offering-low-rates-and-high-flexibility,1761380542,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/53613808.jpeg,Top 5 Crypto Loan Providers Offering Low Rates and High Flexibility,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/top-5-crypto-loan-providers-offering-low-rates-and-high-flexibility,"The ability to unlock liquidity without selling crypto is one of the most useful innovations in digital finance. Whether you need funds for trading, investing, or everyday use, crypto loans let you access cash while keeping your long-term holdings intact. Below are the top five crypto loan providers that combine low rates, flexible terms, and strong security. At the top of the list is Clapp, a licensed platform reshaping how users borrow against crypto. 1. Clapp — Regulated Crypto Exchange With Built-In Credit Lines Highlights: Licensed crypto exchange (VASP-certified in the EU) Fiat-to-crypto bridge for buying or cashing out in EUR Crypto-backed credit lines using single assets or whole portfolios Built-in portfolio management with auto-rebalancing and backtesting Fireblocks custody for institutional-grade security Review: Clapp.finance stands out for combining crypto-to-fiat trading, portfolio management, and credit lines within a single regulated environment. Its crypto-backed loans let users borrow instantly without selling their assets, using either individual tokens or diversified portfolios as collateral. Because Clapp operates under an EU license and uses Fireblocks for custody, users benefit from both regulatory clarity and institutional-level security. The platform’s fiat bridge makes it especially attractive for European users who want to move between crypto and EUR seamlessly. 2. Nexo — Established Centralized Lender With Competitive Rates Highlights: Instant crypto-backed loans with up to 50% LTV Option to borrow in fiat, stablecoins, or NEXO tokens Interest discounts for loyalty-tier users Regulated entity with audited reserves Review:Nexo is one of the most recognized names in CeFi lending. It offers flexible borrowing options and supports a wide range of crypto assets. The interface is beginner-friendly, and users can enjoy lower rates if they hold NEXO tokens. However, since it’s a centralized provider, borrowers must trust Nexo with custody of their collateral — a point to weigh if you prefer self-custody or DeFi transparency. 3. Aave — Decentralized Option for Smart Contract-Based Lending Highlights: Fully decentralized; no intermediaries Borrow stablecoins or other tokens using crypto collateral Transparent interest rates set by the protocol Advanced users can supply liquidity and earn yield Review:For users who prefer on-chain solutions, Aave offers an open, permissionless lending environment. Loans are managed through smart contracts rather than a company, and all transactions are verifiable on Ethereum or other supported chains. The downside? You need to understand DeFi mechanics — from gas fees to liquidation thresholds. But for experienced users, Aave remains the gold standard of decentralized lending. 4. YouHodler — High LTV Ratios and Multi-Asset Collateral Support Highlights: Up to 90% LTV for certain assets Borrow in stablecoins or fiat Supports multiple crypto collaterals Easy web and mobile access Review:YouHodler is popular for its generous LTV options, allowing users to borrow more against their holdings. The platform caters to active traders and those who want to squeeze maximum liquidity from their portfolios. The trade-off is that higher leverage increases liquidation risk if markets drop, so it suits users who monitor positions closely. 5. Binance Loans — Trusted Exchange With Deep Liquidity Highlights: Crypto-backed loans from the world’s largest exchange Wide selection of collateral and borrowing assets Flexible terms with daily interest Option to reinvest borrowed funds in the Binance ecosystem Review:Binance brings its exchange liquidity and brand strength into the lending space. Its crypto-loan product is straightforward and integrates well with its trading platform. The main advantage is convenience — users can move collateral and borrowed assets within the Binance ecosystem instantly. However, regional restrictions and identity verification requirements apply. Final Thoughts Crypto lending has evolved into a competitive market offering a wide range of options — from regulated CeFi platforms like Clapp and Nexo to on-chain solutions like Aave. Clapp stands out for its integrated ecosystem and EU licensing, while others like Nexo and Aave offer maturity and user familiarity. Ultimately, the right platform depends on your priorities — whether it’s regulation, decentralization, high LTV, or convenience. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Zhao visited the Central Asian nation for two days to have meetings with government officials, tour national landmarks, and discuss expanding the country’s digital economy. During his stay, Zhao held an informal meeting with Kyrgyzstan’s President, Sadyr Japarov, where the two discussed opportunities to strengthen cooperation in blockchain technology and attract international investment. Zhao talked about the visit positively on social media platform X, stating he “had a great time in Kyrgyzstan” in the past two days. “I encourage more crypto companies to explore the country too,” the former Binance CEO wrote on X early Saturday morning. Zhao and President Japarov also visited Ala-Archa National Park, an excursion shared by Presidential press secretary Askat Alagozov on Facebook. Kyrgyzstan opens doors to cryptocurrencies, working on regulatory clarity Kyrgyzstan is actively developing a national strategy for digital assets, introducing concepts like “state cryptocurrency reserve” and “state mining,” according to Farhat Iminov, head of the Secretariat of the National Council for the development of virtual assets and blockchain technologies under the President. During a National Council meeting on virtual assets, Iminov told policymakers in attendance the progress made since the council’s first meeting on May 3, local news outlet Kabar reported . He reiterated that the Secretariat is focused on improving the legal and institutional environment for blockchain and virtual asset development in Kyrgyzstan with innovation-friendly policies. The Secretariat is reportedly in talks with the Ministry of Economy and Commerce to draft amendments to the Kyrgyz Republic’s law on Virtual Assets. The changes include a legal definition of stablecoins and asset-backed tokens, commonly referred to as RWA tokens. Additionally, the amendments envision a “regulatory sandbox” to allow the testing of innovative financial solutions in a controlled environment. As covered by Cryptopolitan in early September, Kyrgyzstan’s parliament passed the “On Virtual Assets” bill, regulating the crypto market by clarifying the responsibilities of regulatory authorities. The law specifies that one agency will issue licenses to virtual asset service providers, while another will monitor compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing standards. Moreover, the legislation will govern miner registration, set requirements for mining equipment, and licensing procedures for virtual asset services providers (VASPs). CZ joins Kyrgyz national council Speaking to the press late Friday, the Secretariat confirmed that as part of a protocol decision, CZ has been included in the National Council alongside Binance regional representative Kirill Khomyakov and an advisor to the President. Farhat Iminov said their inclusion is a significant boost to the Council’s expertise, adding that their involvement would help legislators make practical decisions, in tandem with the needs of the digital economy. “Participation by leading global figures in blockchain will significantly strengthen the Council’s expert potential and ensure a practical focus in the decision-making process,” Iminov said. CZ has been meeting with several international leaders to extend his influence and help Binance form more partnerships in several jurisdictions. After his release from legal proceedings in the United States in September 2024, he resumed high-profile meetings with government leaders and advisory councils worldwide. This year alone, Zhao met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, joined blockchain advisory councils in Pakistan, and advocated for crypto adoption in Dubai and Islamabad. As reported by Cryptopolitan on Friday, he received a pardon from US President Donald Trump almost two years after pleading guilty to failing to prevent money laundering and stepping down as CEO of Binance. Zhao wrote a message of gratitude on X mid-flight to Kyrgyzstan, saying: “Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice. Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide.” Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates his net worth at $58 billion, accumulated through his ownership in Binance and investments through his family office, YZi Labs. Although he lost his top seat at the exchange, CZ still has a massive influence over the Binance blockchain ecosystem, hosting roughly $8.7 billion in assets. Don’t just read crypto news.

Our PENGU price prediction expects a maximum of $0.0791 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the PENGU price to achieve $0.2. Pudgy Penguins is a set of 8,888 flightless bird NFTs that launched in July 2021 for about $90 each. It sold out quickly and gained attention, even appearing on the cover of the New York Times a month later. Within a few months, the cheapest penguin on the market was selling for over $6,000. However, prices dropped to around $1,000 in early 2022 as the NFT hype faded and issues arose within the community. Many were unhappy with the founder, Cole Villemain (aka ColeThereum), due to accusations of poor management. This led to a community vote to remove Cole. In January 2022, investor Luca Netz offered to buy the project for about $2.5 million. The deal went through a few months later. After Netz took over, the project’s value bounced back—floor prices doubled in just a few days. With new leadership and a fresh roadmap, Pudgy Penguins started rebuilding its reputation as a top NFT project. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Pudgy Penguins price prediction from 2025-2031. In this article, we’ll find out “Will Pengu reach $1?” and explore the factors behind PENGU token price prediction, providing insights into the role and utility of the PENGU token.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the PENGU price from an immediate surge. However, if the PENGU price successfully breaks above $0.023, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.027. PENGU/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, PENGU price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.019, resulting in a correction to $0.012. Is PENGU a good investment? Whether PENGU is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. The coin has support from the popular Pudgy Penguins brand, which has grown through NFTs, merchandise, and big deals like selling toys at Walmart—these could help increase interest in the coin. But the price is still very unpredictable and can change quickly. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the PENGU price down today? PENGU’s price gained strong selling pressure around recent highs, resulting in a strong decline. This created a push below $0.02. Will Pudgy Penguins price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.025 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will PENGU reach $0.2? Pengu price might reach the $0.2 mark in 2031 if buying demand surges and Pengu attracts altcoin investors. Will Pengu reach $1? The $1 mark is a distant dream for Pengu token. This price level is achievable in the long run if Pengu continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Pudgy Penguins a good long-term investment? Pengu token has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

With more than 50 million people holding digital assets and some of the world’s most engaged Web3 communities, the region’s media landscape has evolved into a crucial battleground for brand visibility. But visibility here doesn’t follow the same rules as in the U.S. or Europe. Crypto news cycles in LATAM move fast, driven by grassroots adoption, local influencers, and market sentiment that often shifts overnight. Brands that once relied on sheer coverage volume now face a tougher challenge – proving measurable impact across fragmented media ecosystems. That’s where data-driven communication is redefining the rules. According to Outset PR’s recent LATAM Data Briefs – many crypto teams lose visibility not because their ideas are weak, but because they rely on intuition and “black-box” media buys instead of verifiable data . And as Outset PR’s engagement analysis shows , traffic alone is misleading – measuring real visibility requires looking at engagement quality and durable recognition, not just volume. The rise of data-first approaches is changing that. Below are the top crypto PR firms in LATAM — those shaping how brands grow, engage, and sustain attention across the region. What Makes a Great Crypto PR Agency in LATAM The LATAM crypto market rewards adaptability, local fluency, and analytical discipline. It’s not enough to “get press” – success depends on understanding how narratives travel through languages, media types, and community channels. A truly effective crypto PR agency in Latin America combines three capabilities: Cultural & Linguistic Context LATAM isn’t a single market. Brazil alone accounts for 62% of the region’s crypto media audience , while Spanish-speaking markets like Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia each have distinct ecosystems and tone. Agencies that thrive here understand how culture shapes attention – tailoring messages that feel native rather than translated. Multi-Channel Credibility Visibility in LATAM means playing across different layers – traditional finance outlets, crypto-native portals, and community-driven platforms. The strongest agencies bridge these spaces, ensuring consistency between official statements, thought-leadership content, and influencer narratives. Data-Driven Visibility As Outset PR’s research shows, visibility without verification is noise. The agency’s methodology focuses on verifiable impact – analyzing syndication depth, engagement strength, and machine visibility across LLMs. In markets where hype often outpaces substance, data becomes the only reliable way to prove authority. In other words, great crypto PR in LATAM isn’t just about reach – it’s about resonance, reliability, and recognition. Top Crypto PR Agencies in LATAM (2025 Ranking) Outset PR – Data-Driven Communication for the Web3 Era Outset PR stands at the forefront of crypto communications in Latin America, combining deep analytical insight with editorial precision. While most agencies still measure visibility through surface-level impressions, Outset PR built its methodology around verifiable data. The agency regularly publishes independent media performance reports that have become a reference point for the industry. In its Q1 and Q2 2025 LATAM reports, Outset PR revealed structural shifts in the region’s crypto media landscape – showing that 73% of outlets lost traffic in Q1 and that Brazil alone drives 62% of all crypto-native media audiences. This research-backed approach allows brands to move beyond intuition and plan campaigns based on measurable visibility, authority signals, and engagement depth. With teams experienced in both Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking markets, Outset PR has positioned itself as the go-to partner for data-driven storytelling in a region where credibility increasingly depends on evidence, not hype. Sherlock Communications – Brazil’s Bridge Between Crypto and Public Trust Based in São Paulo, Sherlock Communications has built a reputation as one of Brazil’s most effective PR firms for fintech and blockchain projects. Its strength lies in local relationships and a nuanced understanding of Brazil’s regulatory and cultural landscape. The agency’s campaigns often emphasize public trust and education – a key need in a market where crypto adoption is rising fast but institutional skepticism remains. Sherlock’s bilingual teams work across Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and more, helping projects bridge the gap between technical innovation and mainstream audiences. With Brazil accounting for most of the region’s crypto media traffic, its localized expertise is a major strategic advantage. LatAm Intersect PR – Regional Coverage and Cultural Precision Operating across multiple Latin American countries, LatAm Intersect PR offers a rare combination of regional scale and local fluency. The agency is known for its ability to tailor messaging to different linguistic and cultural contexts – from Mexico’s entrepreneurial fintech scene to Argentina’s fast-maturing DeFi ecosystem. While its portfolio spans technology, finance, and consumer sectors, LatAm Intersect has become increasingly active in crypto communications, supporting blockchain initiatives that require multilingual outreach. Its distributed model allows for agile adaptation to national media ecosystems, which is essential in a region as diverse – and volatile – as LATAM. AWISEE – Content and SEO Powerhouse for Crypto Brands AWISEE operates at the intersection of performance marketing and blockchain communications. With teams in Mexico and Europe, it delivers link-building, localized content strategy, and KOL partnerships for crypto and Web3 clients expanding into Latin America. Unlike traditional agencies that rely on generic placements, AWISEE focuses on measurable outcomes: domain authority, keyword ranking, and referral growth from high-relevance publications. For early-stage projects entering the LATAM market, this SEO approach provides a cost-efficient alternative to classic media buying – turning technical visibility into brand credibility. Crowdcreate — Global Influence Meets Local Engagement Crowdcreate is an internationally recognized marketing and PR agency that has managed campaigns for major blockchain projects while maintaining a strong presence in Latin America. Known for combining investor outreach, influencer marketing, and earned media, Crowdcreate helps global crypto brands localize their message to regional audiences. Its LATAM operations focus on building community trust – from AMAs and event activations to cross-regional collaborations with Spanish- and Portuguese-language publishers. For international clients seeking to connect with LATAM’s fast-growing retail audience, Crowdcreate offers a scalable solution that balances global reach with regional authenticity. Top Crypto PR Agencies in LATAM (2025 Overview) Agency Headquarters / Focus Markets Core Strengths Notable Attributes Outset PR Global agency with LATAM focus (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina) Data-driven PR, analytics-based visibility tracking, LLM integration Publishes quarterly LATAM media performance reports; pioneers measurable PR strategies Sherlock Communications São Paulo, Brazil Localized crypto & fintech communications Deep understanding of Brazilian regulation and media; bilingual execution LatAm Intersect PR Regional (Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia) Regional scalability with cultural precision Multilingual team and local partner network across key LATAM markets AWISEE Mexico / Europe SEO-driven PR, KOL partnerships, link-building Focuses on measurable growth through search visibility and domain authority Crowdcreate Global with LATAM operations Influencer-led and investor-focused PR Combines community marketing with traditional media outreach Emerging Trends in LATAM Crypto PR Latin America’s crypto PR landscape is evolving at a remarkable pace – shaped by rising adoption, AI-driven content discovery, and a generational shift toward data transparency. The region’s communications dynamics in 2025 differ sharply from those of even a year ago. Based on Outset PR’s continuous media monitoring and recent reports, several key trends are defining the next chapter of crypto visibility in LATAM. From Hype to Accountability The days of headline-chasing are ending. With over 73% of crypto outlets losing traffic in Q1 2025, visibility is no longer about how often a project is mentioned but how deeply those mentions resonate. PR agencies are being forced to move beyond volume metrics toward credibility indicators – such as citation quality, domain authority, and sustained syndication reach. This shift favors data-driven firms that can quantify attention rather than just generate noise. Brazil Becomes the Visibility Engine Brazil remains the region’s powerhouse, accounting for over 60% of all crypto-native media traffic. As Outset PR’s data shows, the Brazilian market sets the tone for how narratives move through the continent – from regulation and stablecoin adoption to institutional sentiment. Agencies operating in Brazil now act as regional amplifiers, exporting stories and setting benchmarks for crypto communication across LATAM. AI Is Reshaping Discovery As readers migrate from Google search to AI-powered platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude, publishers are witnessing a redistribution of traffic. Crypto publishers across LATAM have seen visible drops in Google-driven traffic as audiences increasingly turn to AI tools for quick answers – yet referrals from AI sources still make up less than 1% of total visits, according to Outset PR’s Q2 2025 report . Mid-Tier Media Gains Strategic Importance Outset PR’s engagement data indicates that audience loyalty now clusters in mid-tier publications, where session depth and intent match outperform raw traffic numbers. These outlets often operate in Spanish or Portuguese, focusing on analytical storytelling rather than newswire content. As top-tier reach contracts, partnerships with mid-tier media are becoming critical for building authentic, sustained visibility. Data as Infrastructure Finally, the most forward-thinking agencies are reframing PR as infrastructure – not marketing. Data, once treated as a reporting afterthought, now forms the foundation of strategy itself. Measurement tools such as visibility indexes, syndication maps, and AI recall tracking are redefining what it means to “own your narrative” in crypto. In this new paradigm, PR no longer sells exposure; it engineers understanding. Conclusion – LATAM’s Communication Frontier Latin America’s crypto PR landscape is entering a new maturity phase. Once driven by speculation and hype, it’s now shaped by credibility, data, and sustained visibility. Agencies like Sherlock Communications, LatAm Intersect PR, AWISEE, and Crowdcreate are helping projects localize, educate, and connect with audiences across Brazil, Mexico, and beyond. But when it comes to redefining how visibility is measured, Outset PR stands apart. By turning data into strategy – from mapping regional media dynamics to tracking how AI systems perceive brands – the agency has moved crypto PR from guesswork to verifiable impact. As adoption continues to accelerate and discovery becomes increasingly algorithmic, the next wave of LATAM communications will belong to those who can quantify trust. And in that transformation, Outset PR isn’t just participating – it’s setting the standard. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This article explores what could be in store for Solana. This content is delivered by Outset PR , where crypto-native communication meets data-driven intelligence. Outset PR equips leaders with the tools to shape conversations, seize moments of opportunity, and drive sustained market relevance. Solana Eyes Growth After Recent Price Swings Source: tradingview Solana's price is currently fluctuating between one hundred seventy-one to two hundred eight dollars. The coin is riding a wave, showing promising growth in the past six months, with an increase of about twenty-seven percent. Though it dipped over the past month, dropping thirteen percent, it's now positioned to challenge the next resistance level around two hundred twenty-eight dollars. With strong buying momentum, evidenced by the Relative Strength Index at seventy-two, Solana has the potential to climb significantly. If it manages to surpass the two hundred sixty-five dollar mark, this would represent a sizeable rise of nearly twenty-eight percent from its current high in the range.

Signs of recovery are keenly watched as key tokens grapple with recent setbacks. Will Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) manage to rebound, or are further declines on the horizon? The upcoming analysis delves into the potential paths for these digital assets. Just as traders analyze resistance and support zones to predict market movements, Outset PR monitors media outlet performance metrics . This allows them to align campaigns with current market momentum, ensuring their narratives resonate — much like investors seeking breakout assets in a cautious market. Ethereum Holds Steady, Setting Sights on New Highs Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently trading within the upper $3,679 to $4,293 range. Despite recent dips, it's seen a significant six-month increase of over 115%. This suggests solid upward potential. The next hurdle is around $4,600, with a more distant target at $5,214. For ETH to break through these levels, continued investor interest and market momentum are key. If Ethereum can push past that initial resistance, it might rise by over 20% towards the $5,214 mark. With its historical resilience and growth, Ethereum remains an attractive option for those watching the crypto space closely.

Cardano Shows Signs of a Possible Rebound Despite Recent Dip Source: tradingview Cardano's price currently sits between $0.5853 and $0.7283. Despite a recent dip, losing over 4% in a week and more than 22% in a month, the cryptocurrency hints at potential growth. The price hovers near the 10-day moving average of $0.6382, slightly below the 100-day average. If it breaks the nearest resistance at around $0.8037, Cardano could aim for the second resistance level at $0.9467. This climb would represent an increase of over 30% from its current low range. The RSI of 57.23 suggests some room for growth, and the stochastic at 83.17 points to ongoing bullish interest. Conclusion ETH and ADA have experienced recent declines. ETH shows potential for recovery due to its strong network updates and developer activity. ADA, with its focus on innovation, also has room to bounce back. Both coins need to regain investor confidence. Market conditions will play a key role in their recovery prospects. Monitoring these factors can offer insights into their future performance.

The illicit funds were reportedly used to support the country’s illegal development of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs. The monitoring team noted that the total included $1.4 billion stolen from the crypto exchange Bybit in February, as well as $1.2 billion obtained through other illicit cryptocurrency activities in 2024. North Korea uses IT workers to launder funds North Korea has found ways to circumvent UN sanctions , including using cryptocurrency to trade raw materials and military weapons. The country has also deployed numerous IT workers abroad to launder funds and generate income for Pyongyang, according to a report by an international sanctions monitoring group. This revelation has prompted analysts to conduct research, which showed that North Korea has intensified its cyber activities in recent years under the leadership of Kim Jong Un. According to their discovery, hacking has become a primary method applied for them to earn foreign currency amid severe measures put in place due to their nuclear and weapons initiatives. They also realized that officials in the country used stablecoins for transactions related to purchasing military equipment and raw materials, such as copper, which is essential for the production of weapons. To further evade UN sanctions, North Korea sent its IT workers to at least eight different nations, including China, which had the highest number of workers, as well as Russia, Laos, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Nigeria, and Tanzania. Additionally, since the UN sanctions restrict individuals from earning funds outside their country, the MSMT revealed the country’s intention to send 40,000 laborers to Russia, including several groups of IT workers. Meanwhile, North Korea has received strong backing from Russia after providing weapons and sending many of its soldiers to assist Moscow’s troops in the battle against Ukraine. North Korea’s intensified cyber activities spark security concerns The MSMT discussed a 2024 report from 38 North, an analysis program operated by the Stimson Centre think tank. The report highlighted that North Korean IT workers, who concealed their nationalities, acquired contracts for animation projects managed by Japanese and US companies like Amazon and HBO Max. When reports requested that Amazon comment on the claims, a spokesperson from the tech giant alleged that the company had never directly hired these workers. “We previously collaborated with an animation studio that employed subcontractors allegedly involved in this situation. However, those individuals were not Amazon employees and did not have access to our internal systems,” the spokesperson stated. HBO did not reply to a request for comments from a reporter. In the meantime, the report also pointed out that, apart from Amazon and HBO Max, North Korean animators have also worked with firms such as the state-run animation studio in Pyongyang, SEK. This company is well-known for assisting with Western projects, including the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie. Additionally, Seoul’s intelligence agency reported last year that North Korean agents posing as recruiters used LinkedIn to target victims with job offers. To achieve this, they asked South Koreans who worked at defense firms for information on their technologies. Launched last October, the MSMT monitors and reports violations of UN Security Council sanctions on North Korea. However, it operates independently from the UN, with its members including: the UK, Canada, Italy, South Korea, the Netherlands, the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, and Germany.

53614758,613843,1761382807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53614758.jpeg,Ripple Launches ‘Prime Time’ After Hidden Road Acquisition: How This Could Boost RLUSD?,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-prime-time-after-hidden-road-acquisition/,"On Friday, Ripple Labs announced the launch of “Prime Time,” following its acquisition of Hidden Road. The company will now be rebranded as Ripple Prime. The company confirmed the completion of the acquisition, making Ripple Labs the first blockchain payment company to operate as a global, multi-asset prime broker. How Ripple Prime Is Expected To Enhance RLUSD’s Utility The acquisition was deemed a logical step, driven by the synergies between Ripple and Hidden Road, to facilitate the institutional adoption of digital assets which has been on the rise throughout the year in a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. Ripple’s digital asset infrastructure, which includes payment solutions, crypto custody, and stablecoin services , will increase the offerings within Ripple Prime. Looking ahead, Ripple Prime plans to harness blockchain technology to streamline operations and optimize costs. Notably, the launch of Ripple Prime is expected to significantly boost the utility and reach of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Currently, RLUSD is being utilized as collateral for various prime brokerage products, with certain derivatives clients opting to hold their balances in RLUSD, a trend anticipated to grow in the coming months. RLUSD’s regulatory compliance under the new stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, already signed by President Donald Trump, is said to have earned it the trust of institutions, providing further integration into traditional financial operations. In July, RLUSD was recognized as the top stablecoin for stability, governance, and asset backing by Bluechip, which awarded it an ‘A’ rating. Additionally, Ripple announced that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY) will serve as the primary reserve custodian for RLUSD. Five Major Acquisitions Over Two Years This acquisition is one of five major strategic purchases by the blockchain payment company in the past two years, including recent acquisitions of treasury management system provider GTreasury, stablecoin-based payment platform Rail, Standard Custody, and Metaco. In addition, the company is currently pursuing approval for its national bank charter license in the United States. It joins other firms, including, Circle (CRCL), Coinbase (COIN), Sony Bank, Paxos, and Crypto.com, which recently announced its intent to seek approval for this application with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). As of this writing, XRP has capitalized on these developments, surging toward $2.70 — a 3% intraday increase.

Related Reading: BNB Reclaims $1,100 As Binance Founder Receives Presidential Pardon – New Rally Coming? Pump.fun Acquires Padre On Friday, Solana’s leading launchpad, Pump.fun, announced it had acquired multichain trading terminal Padre for an undisclosed amount as part of its “mission to tokenize the world’s highest-potential opportunities.” The platform explained that trading terminals have “captured most trading volumes in the ecosystem” for the past year. Therefore, the acquisition of Padre, which supports trading across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Base, “was a no-brainer,” Pump.fun’s co-founder Alon Cohen affirmed. “Today marks another historic day for the PUMP ecosystem. What we’re known for is innovating, growing the market as a whole and creating the most retail-friendly products,” Cohen wrote on X. “But we have always wanted to find more ways to support and reward our existing, loyal user base, most of which uses pro trading terminals,” he continued, adding that “the Padre team has shown the most grit, execution capability and integrity out of any crypto team I have gotten to know.” According to the official announcement, Padre will function as usual, but users will experience significant upgrades in user experience, especially for tokens launched on Pump.fun. Additionally, the integration will improve data and speed, and offer better trading incentives. PUMP Breaks Out Of Bearish Structure Following the news, Pump.fun’s token, PUMP, became one of the best-performing tokens in the past 24 hours, jumping 11.6% to a one-week high of $0.0043. The cryptocurrency has been trading within the $0.0036-$0.0046 price range since the early October correction. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted that yesterday, PUMP was “in a bit of trouble” after retesting the range lows, needing to break out of a bearish structure to prevent a breakdown to lower levels. After today’s rally, PUMP “finally broke that structure,” suggesting that the range high should be the next target for the cryptocurrency’s price. A potential breakout from this range could set the stage for a retest of the $0.005 mark, a key support and resistance level during the Q3 rally that was lost during the October 10 pullback. PADRE Crash Drives Community Backlash Despite the PUMP rally, Pump.fun received some backlash after the acquisition. Padre’s users slammed the memecoin launchpad for one of the key changes listed in the announcement. According to the official X post, trading terminal’s token, PADRE, “will no longer have utility on the platform with no further plans for the future.” As a result, the cryptocurrency dropped 76% in an hour to a multi-month low of $0.009 before stabilizing at around $0.0139.

According to reports, the two suspects were arraigned and convicted in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York. The duo was convicted by a jury on all charges of an indictment charging them with conspiring and attempting to provide material relief to the terrorist organization . In addition, Hashimi and At Taqi were also charged with money laundering. DOJ convicts two for aiding ISIS According to the DOJ, Hashimi had already pleaded guilty to all the counts of indictment on October 6, the day the jury selection was scheduled to begin. The DOJ claimed that At Taqi sent Bitcoin in 15 separate transactions to a certain Osama Obeida, a self-proclaimed ISIS member, over the course of a year. In a conversation with a confidential source online, At Taqi claimed that he used digital assets to send money “unnoticed” through a “brother,” which typically meant another ISIS follower. In later conversations, At Taqi told the confidential source, through an encrypted communications platform, that the brother, who had been sending cryptocurrency, had gotten back in touch. In other conversations, the DOJ claims that he assured the confidential source that he was sure the brother was from Dawlah, referring to ISIS. The agency mentioned that the brother who was being used in this conversation was Obeida. In a later conversation, he introduced Obeida to the confidential source, vouching for him. After Obeida got in touch with the confidential source, he mentioned that he had known At Taqi for about two years, and in that time, he had been sending him money regularly. Obeida also sent the confidential source a photograph of an ISIS flag and weapons, showing the other party at the end of the line that the money Obeida got from the defendant was used to purchase weapons for ISIS fighters. He added a time stamp to the photograph to prove that it was taken in real time. Suspects used BTC, PayPal, and GoFundMe The other defendant, Hashimi, was part of a group chat for ISIS supporters on an encrypted platform. In April 2021, members of the group chat discussed posting links that would be used to raise funds for humanitarian efforts, but noted that the money would be diverted to help ISIS. The DOJ claimed a co-conspirator posted a Bitcoin address, and another posted a PayPal link, both of which were under the control of Obeida. In response, Hashimi warned the members of the group to be careful as they could be detected by law enforcement. According to the DOJ, Obeida was sent thousands of dollars, with the funds coming from their campaigns across platforms, including Bitcoin, PayPal, and GoFundMe. Aside from Obeida, other co-conspirators identified were Hashimi, At Taqi, a third defendant named Seema Rahman, and another one named Khalilullah Yousuf. The group contributed more than $24,000 to Obeida’s Bitcoin address, with Yousuf responsible for $20,347 of the entire funds. Others contributed between $2,000 and $900 to the wallet. The defendants also sent funds into the PayPal account operated by Obeida, creating several charitable campaigns on GoFundMe, where they raised $10,000 and sent the funds to individuals connected to Obeida using Western Union. At sentencing, each individual is expected to face a maximum penalty of 60 years in prison. Rahman had also pleaded guilty earlier this year to charges of providing material to support a terrorist organization and was awaiting sentencing. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Several altcoins have posted more impressive gains over the past days, including JUP, ZEC, CRO, BCH, and XRP. BTC Recovers All Losses The primary cryptocurrency experienced massive turbulence at the end of the previous business week when it dumped from $112,000 to under $104,000 in the span of just a day. However, it bounced off during the weekend and went on the offensive at the beginning of the new business week. The bulls initiated an impressive leg up on Tuesday that resulted in a $6,500 surge. It pushed BTC from $107,500 to a multi-day peak of $114,000. However, it turned out to be a fakeout, and bitcoin quickly lost all gains and dipped even further below $106,500. The following few days were more positive but less eventful as the markets awaited the Friday release of the US CPI numbers. BTC had calmed at around $111,000 and surged immediately with a grand after the inflation for September turned out to be lower than expected. However, its progress was quickly halted, and the bears drove it south by over two grand in the following hours to just under $110,000. Nevertheless, BTC has bounced off and now sits close to $112,000. Its market cap has risen to $2.230 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is at 58%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView CRO, XRP on the Rise Most larger-cap alts have failed to post any significant moves in the past 24 hours. ETH and BNB are slightly in the red, while SOL, ADA, DOGE, HYPE, LINK, and XLM have produced minor gains. More volatility comes from the likes of XRP, CRO, BCH, and ZEC, all of which have increased by somewhere between 3.5% and 5.3%. In contrast, TRX has dumped by over 5% and now sits inches below $0.30. The total crypto market cap has remained sideways since yesterday at around $3.850 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview Daily.

Currently trading at just $0.0022 in stage 13 of its presale, this token is gaining unstoppable momentum. Early investors have already poured in over $27.1 million, and now even a Ripple (XRP) millionaire believes Little Pepe could surge all the way to $3 in the coming bull run. With such predictions surfacing, many investors are rushing to secure their bags before the presale sells out completely. The World’s First Layer 2 for Meme Projects Unlike the countless meme coins that rely solely on hype, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) combines humor, community, and advanced blockchain innovation to redefine what a meme token can be. One of the biggest reasons behind the excitement is Little Pepe’s revolutionary approach to scalability. The project is building the world’s first dedicated Layer 2 blockchain for meme tokens, a first of its kind in the crypto space. Traditional meme tokens, such as Shiba Inu or Pepe, rely heavily on networks like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, which often struggle with congestion and high fees. Little Pepe’s Layer 2 aims to address these issues with lightning-fast speeds and minimal transaction costs, creating a blockchain environment specifically designed for the meme economy. This makes Little Pepe the first true meme network, as meme tokens, NFTs, and dApps can be launched faster than on any other chain. It is built as a Layer 2, which makes it interoperable with other major networks, all while keeping the ecosystem current with its meme nature. Certik Audit: Boosting Investor Confidence Security remains a top concern for investors, especially in an era of rug pulls and scam projects. Little Pepe has already passed a full security audit by Certik, one of the most respected blockchain security firms. This successful audit confirms that Little Pepe’s smart contracts are robust, transparent, and secure, providing investors with additional confidence to participate in the presale. The Certik stamp is often seen as a green flag for long-term credibility, a major reason why analysts and experienced traders are taking this project seriously. Fair Play Through Anti-Sniper Bot Technology Another major technical feature is the anti-sniper bot mechanism. Sniper bots pose a significant issue in crypto presales, as large investors use them to buy tokens at the start of the sale, effectively excluding smaller investors. Little Pepe's blockchain will eliminate the bots entirely. With the bots gone, no one will have the unfair advantage of buying the project during presales or launches anymore. Everyone will have the same opportunity to buy the project. The next stage in the evolution of the meme coin is the Little Pepe blockchain. With founding members knowledgeable in the industry, tokenomics, community building, and the mechanism behind meme coins, Little Pepe is an ideal candidate for future development and advancing beyond the current meme coin hype phase. Little Pepe has experience and markets with a unique strategy. Therefore, Little Pepe has already gone viral on social media and is poised to make a significant impact in the industry. How to Join the Presale Joining the Little Pepe presale is easy, safe, and fast, as all you need to do is download a crypto wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. You can buy ETH or USDT via the ERC-20 network method, then go to littlepepe.com to get started. You can connect your wallet and purchase Little Pepe tokens according to your requirements. After the presale ends, investors can claim their tokens from the same website. Conclusion Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is one of the most exciting presales in the cryptocurrency space, offering a low presale price of only $0.0022. It combines the best of meme coins with practical applications, new and breakthrough blockchain technology, and a Certik-certified package of investor protection. If this turns out to be the case, Little Pepe will go down as one of the most profitable meme coins of all time. For investors seeking the next 500x opportunity, Little Pepe is the frog that jumps the highest.

Little Pepe has addressed this by completing a rigorous security audit by Certik, a top blockchain security firm.

The fresh accumulation signals a potential shift in investors’ sentiment as Ether prices managed to surge marginally over the last 7 days after a heavy dump. The global digital assets market saw mixed indexes as Bitcoin hovered above $111K, cluelessly. The cumulative crypto market cap surged marginally to stand at $3.76 trillion. The biggest altcoin, Ether, tried to regain the $4,000 mark in order to score a breakthrough. Smart money reloads on Ethereum According to the data shared by Santiment, addresses holding between 100 and 10,000 ETH have begun accumulating again. This comes after these whales and sharks unloaded roughly 1.36 million ETH between October 5 and 16. Since then, they’ve bought back nearly one-sixth of those coins. It is seen as a modest but encouraging sign for Ethereum. 🐳🦈 Ethereum whales and sharks holding between 100 to 10,000 $ETH are finally showing some signs of confidence. After -1.36M was dumped by this group between October 5th and 16th, they have added back close to 1/6th of it since. Positive sign for crypto’s #2 market cap. pic.twitter.com/tg1BWu60Lq — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 24, 2025 Wallet data adds weight to the trend. A whale wallet “0x395” withdrew 12,000 ETH (approx. worth $46.3 million) from Binance on Oct 23 at an average price of $3,854 per coin. The whale now holds 67,981 ETH (approx. worth $264 million). Historical data shows that this same wallet added ETH at an average of $3,027 between June and mid-August. However, it then sold into strength between mid-September and early October at an average of $4,218. Another whale wallet “0x86E” bought 8,491 ETH (approx. worth $32.5 million) from OKX on October 23. This move contributed to the uptick in whale accumulation activity. Elsewhere on the network, blockchain sleuths tracked the RadiantCapital exploiter swapping 9.7 million DAI for 2,550 WETH. The swap was done at an average price of $3,803. The funds were funneled through Tornado Cash, which suggests an ongoing laundering effort. Ethereum price has dipped by more than 11% over the past 60 days, briefly testing support near $3,738. It is still running up by 18% on the year-to-date (YTD) basis. ETH is trading at an average price of $3,930 at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume stood around $29 billion. ETH ETFs see outflows Beyond whale moves, stablecoin activity on Ethereum has exploded. Token Terminal data shows a 400% jump in stablecoin transfer volume over the past 30 days. It is totaling $581 billion across more than 12.5 million transactions. The total stablecoin market cap on Ethereum now stands at $163 billion. It emerges as a sign of the network’s continued dominance in digital dollar settlements. Investor preference still remains in a split between Bitcoin and Ethereum in the ETF arena. On October 24, Ethereum spot ETFs recorded $93.6 million in net outflows while Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $90.6 million. This was the third straight day of redemptions for ETH ETFs. On October 23, Bitcoin funds ended the day with $20.3 million in net inflows. It was majorly driven by $107.8 million to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). It was then followed by smaller gains across Bitwise, Fidelity, and Grayscale’s mini trust. Outflows from GBTC of $60.5 million and Ark 21Shares’ ARKB’s $55 million nearly offset those gains but failed to drag the total into the red.

The report published by the bank stated that the Base token could be a new revenue stream for Coinbase and that the company would complement its on-chain trading strategies with USDC returns. The report noted that the Base network, built on Ethereum and launched in August 2023, has reached over $5 billion in assets locked (TVL) and over 9 million daily transactions. JPMorgan analysts stated that the Base token could “translate the network’s success into equity.” Related News: U.S. Inflation Data, Published Uninterrupted for 100 Years, May Not Be Released Next Month Given current network data and “high token economics,” JPMorgan estimated Coinbase's long-term market value at between $12 billion and $34 billion. It added that Coinbase could hold approximately 40% of the supply, which would translate to an equity value between $4 billion and $12 billion. Coinbase executives have also raised the possibility of a native token for Base in recent weeks. At the BaseCamp conference in Vermont, project leader Jesse Pollak said that issuing a token could accelerate the network's decentralization process and open up new opportunities for developers. CEO Brian Armstrong, speaking on X, said the idea was “in the exploratory phase” but that “there are no definitive plans yet.” *This is not investment advice.

That explosive growth, from pennies to a multitrillion-dollar universe, is still the gold standard for crypto success. Now, a new generation of tokens can take the same path. The leading cryptocurrencies that are on the rise are Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and a new DeFi newcomer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Each project has a value proposition, but Mutuum Finance is making waves with its new dual-lending economy and solid presale traction. At just $0.035 during Phase 6, with more than 75% sold out and $17.85 million raised so far, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming among the top cryptocurrencies this year, with analysts speculating that it might offer the type of explosive growth that Bitcoin experienced during its first few years. Investors looking for the best cryptos to buy now are keeping a close eye on MUTM, recognizing its early-stage potential. Cardano (ADA) at Its Moment of Truth as Bulls Run Out of Steam Cardano (ADA) is at a crossroads and the price is not even getting near $0.70 EMA, demonstrating losing power among buyers. The market confusion is becoming louder, if $0.59 is broken, ADA can drop suddenly into $0.50 or even $0.40, demonstrating weakness in what was deemed to be one of the strongest of the altcoins. On the flip side, a firm drop below $0.75 can reignite bullish fervor again and restore faith among the ADA soldiers. In the meantime, however, traders watch closely as Cardano teases hard support, and while some investors look for new frontiers, attention is directed towards budding DeFi upstart Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is building momentum going into the next cycle. For those asking what crypto to buy now, MUTM is appearing as a clear choice. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Outlook: Dominance Strengthens After Long-Term Breakout Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing new strength as its dominance remains strong, following the completion of a crucial multi-year market structure shift. Having endured a 3.5-year downtrend that began in 2021, DOGE finally broke above this declining channel in November 2024, suggesting a long-term reversal may be underway. The pivot was then reversed later in June 2025 and again with the wider crypto collapse on October 10, thus affirming the breakout as final. Having this technical background now established, DOGE can quite well be setting the stage for an extended phase of recovery in the subsequent bull cycle. As the market starts exploring new sources of growth, investors are also focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as its popularity surges as the next huge high-upside investment in 2025. MUTM is increasingly recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy now by early-stage enthusiasts. Mutuum Finance’s Growth Surpasses Expectations Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly turning out to be one of the best new cryptocurrencies to watch out for in 2025. Its presale is repeatedly attracting increasingly large investments from investors from all over the world, with more than 17,400 joining and investing a combined total of over $17.85 million so far. At Phase 6 at $0.035, an all-time historical low, MUTM is a good early bird investment buy before the token explodes to $0.04 in the next phase, and is a favorite crypto in 2025. The ongoing phase has seen huge buy activity which has pushed it past the 75% mark in no time. Investors believe in the long-term success of the project ranking MUTM among the top cryptocurrencies to buy now. There’s immense potential for passive income earners via Mutuum Finance. Clients can gain APY based on market demand by investing their assets in the platform liquidity pool. For example, an investor who invests $55,000 USDT in the platform can gain $5,500 a year at a 10% APY, just by letting their assets do the work for them. The rise of bitcoin from cents to more than $125,000 is a prime example of early adopter advantages. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating the same velocity with $17.85 million raised by 17,400 investors so far. With Phase 6 at $0.035 and more than 75% sold through. Go to the official Mutuum Finance website and get into position before the next phase starts to secure one of the best cryptos to buy now and join the new cryptocurrency wave.

The analyst emphasized that ETH ETFs are now experiencing significant inflows, and major banks are accepting ETH as collateral for loans. Friedman said Ethereum’s role in real-world finance has continued to strengthen, thanks to the surge in Layer 2 (L2) expansions, the growth of stablecoins, and tokenization. He added that these trends could set the stage for skyrocketing ETH prices into 2026, with supply remaining deflationary and yields from staking encouraging long-term holding. Cryptopolitan reported earlier this month that ETH is rapidly attracting institutional investments. Major minting events, such as the recent $2 billion USDT minted on Ethereum, typically precede price movements as retail and institutional investors inject new liquidity. Friedman says fringe digital assets are becoming mainstream The analyst believes that ETH is rising because cryptocurrencies, once viewed as fringe assets, are now becoming more mainstream. He also stressed that crypto, which was driven by retail investor, is now benefiting from steadily increasing institutional interest. Cyprien Grau, lead at zkEVM rollup Status Network, previously said ETH’s institutional adoption is a net positive because it carries the cryptocurrency’s value out of the crypto-native bubble and into the real-world economy. He explained that what institutions want aligns with Ethereum’s endgame, which includes credible neutrality, faster settlements, privacy, lower fees, decentralization, and scale. “They do not want to settle on each other’s private ledgers. They want a credibly neutral ground where everyone can transact under the same rules. Trying to steer core protocol governance would put those properties at risk, so the dominant strategy is cooperation, not capture.” – Cyprien Grau , head at the Status Network Crypto analyst and YouTuber Wendy O also contributed her opinion, saying that the most positive aspect of ETH is that spot and future ETFs have been approved. However, she pointed out that this did not seem to move Ethereum as the market had expected, as sentiment remained down. Brian Huang, the co-founder of Glider, also claimed that the crypto investor mindset has taken a hit lately, especially after many speculators suffered losses due to the closure of leverage positions on October 10. Wendy O believes that crypto has been in a “crab market” since the crypto liquidation occurred. However, SoSoValue data show that U.S. spot Ethereum ETPs (exchange-traded products) have notably increased in value since their debut last year. The data further reveal that ETH ETFs have doubled in value since the beginning of this year, reaching over $26.5 billion, primarily due to growing interest from institutional investors. Tychey says Ethereum is the biggest economic playground Jerome de Tychey, president of Ethereum France and CEO of Cometh, claims Ethereum is the biggest economic playground, and investors should not be worried when institutions join the fun. He also believes that Ethereum has been consistent on the neutral transport narrative, and institutions not choosing ETH directly are only delaying the inevitable. The Ethereum France President emphasized that such institutions will eventually pick on ETH due to the network’s censorship resistance and radical neutrality. The co-founder and Ceo of SSV Labs, Alon Muroch, also says fears that institutions could pose a threat to Ethereum are unfounded. He pointed out that even the largest consortia would be unable to influence ETH’s future because they would pose no threat to either Ethereum or its decentralization. Murdoch added that big-name L2s, such as Robinhood, will still be built and settled on the Ethereum network, which is ultimately beneficial for the ecosystem. Strategic ETH Reserve data shows that the total amount of ETH held on corporate balance sheets exceeds 5.9 million. Tom Lee-backed BitMine Immersion leads with over 3 million ETH in its stockpile, while Sharplink, chaired by Joseph Lubin, is second with more than 840,000 ETH. Meanwhile, staking on the Ethereum network keeps hitting ATHs with over 35.7 million ETH (~$138B) currently locked in staking contracts. However, another analyst at Seal 911 Pcaversaccio believes institutional adoption is Ethereum’s biggest threat. The analyst warns that TradiFi could tame the network’s open, cypherpunk spirit. Meanwhile, Grau believes institutions should build on L2s if they want more control and customization. He explains that L2s retain EVM composability and tooling, inherit Ethereum’s liquidity and security, and allow institutions to design their policy and execution rules.

Then you’ve likely heard of Jupiter (JUP), a pivotal aggregation layer that has quickly become a cornerstone of the ecosystem. Investors and enthusiasts alike are constantly asking: What does the future hold for this promising asset? Our comprehensive Jupiter price prediction aims to answer that burning question, exploring whether the JUP price can truly reach the ambitious $2 mark in the coming years. What is Jupiter (JUP) and Why Does This Jupiter Crypto Matter? Jupiter is more than just another token; it’s a critical infrastructure project on the Solana blockchain. At its core, Jupiter functions as a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, designed to provide users with the best possible swap rates by scanning multiple DEXs across Solana. This means when you want to trade tokens, Jupiter finds the optimal path, minimizing slippage and maximizing efficiency. This utility is not just convenient; it’s essential for a healthy and liquid DeFi ecosystem. Beyond swaps, Jupiter offers a suite of advanced features: Limit Orders: Allowing users to set specific prices for their trades. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Enabling automated, recurring investments over time. Perpetual Swaps: Offering leveraged trading opportunities for advanced users. Bridge Aggregation: Facilitating seamless asset transfers between different blockchains. The JUP token itself serves as the governance token for the Jupiter DAO, empowering holders to participate in key decisions regarding the platform’s future development, fee structures, and treasury management. This strong community involvement is a significant factor in the long-term viability and growth of the Jupiter crypto ecosystem. Understanding Jupiter’s Market Dynamics: Key Factors Influencing JUP Price Predicting cryptocurrency prices is inherently complex, and JUP is no exception. Several factors constantly interact to influence its market value. A thorough crypto price prediction for Jupiter requires looking at both internal and external forces. Fundamental Factors: Solana Ecosystem Growth: As Jupiter is built on Solana, the health and expansion of the Solana network directly impact JUP. More users, developers, and projects on Solana mean more potential activity on Jupiter. Platform Utility and Innovation: Jupiter’s continuous development of new features (like its recent launch of a launchpad for new Solana projects) enhances its value proposition and attracts more users, driving demand for the JUP token. Trading Volume and Liquidity: Higher trading volumes on Jupiter’s aggregated DEXs translate to more fees generated (some of which can be used for buybacks or staking rewards), benefiting JUP holders. Community Governance: An active and engaged DAO can lead to effective decision-making, improving the platform’s resilience and adaptability. Technical Factors: Technical analysis involves studying past price movements and trading volumes to predict future trends. Key indicators for JUP include: Support and Resistance Levels: Identifying price points where JUP has historically found buying interest (support) or selling pressure (resistance). Moving Averages: These smooth out price data to identify trend direction. A JUP price above key moving averages often signals bullish sentiment. Relative Strength Index (RSI): This momentum oscillator indicates whether JUP is overbought or oversold, potentially signaling a reversal. Volume Trends: High trading volume accompanying price movements adds conviction to the trend. Broader Market Sentiment: The overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, often driven by Bitcoin’s performance, regulatory news, and macroeconomic conditions, plays a significant role. A bull market tends to lift most altcoins, including JUP, while a bear market can suppress prices across the board. Jupiter Price Prediction 2025: Navigating the Next Bull Cycle As we look towards 2025, many analysts anticipate a potential resurgence in the broader crypto market, often referred to as a bull cycle. This optimism stems from several factors, including the upcoming Bitcoin halving events and increasing institutional adoption. For Jupiter, 2025 could be a pivotal year. Our Jupiter price prediction for 2025 is largely contingent on Jupiter’s continued dominance as a liquidity aggregator on Solana and the overall growth of the Solana ecosystem. If Solana maintains its position as a high-performance blockchain attracting new projects and users, Jupiter stands to benefit immensely. Increased transaction volumes and DeFi activity directly translate to higher utility for Jupiter’s services. Considering a bullish market scenario, with sustained development and strategic partnerships, we could see JUP’s value appreciate significantly. Potential price targets for 2025 might range: Minimum Price: Around $0.80 – $1.00, assuming a more conservative growth trajectory or minor market corrections. Average Price: Between $1.20 – $1.50, reflecting steady adoption and a moderately bullish market. Maximum Price: Potentially reaching $1.80 – $2.20, especially if a strong bull run materializes and Jupiter introduces groundbreaking new features or achieves significant market share expansion. The $2 mark becomes a tangible possibility under these optimal conditions. The platform’s ability to innovate and stay ahead of competitors will be crucial. If Jupiter successfully launches and integrates new features that attract even more users, its market position will strengthen, directly impacting its token’s value. JUP Price Target 2026: Sustaining Growth or Facing Headwinds? Moving into 2026, the market landscape might shift, presenting both opportunities and challenges for the JUP price . After a potential bull run in 2025, 2026 could see a period of consolidation or even a slight pullback, which is typical in crypto market cycles. However, the underlying fundamentals of Jupiter will play an even greater role in sustaining its value. For a strong JUP price target in 2026, Jupiter needs to demonstrate long-term resilience and continued relevance. This means: Continued Innovation: Jupiter must keep developing its product suite to maintain its competitive edge. Ecosystem Integration: Deeper integration with new and existing Solana projects will solidify its position. Community Engagement: An active and supportive DAO is vital for decentralized governance and continuous improvement. Assuming Jupiter continues its trajectory of innovation and adoption, even during a potential market cooldown, its value should remain robust. Our projections for 2026 are: Minimum Price: $1.00 – $1.30, accounting for potential market corrections after a 2025 peak. Average Price: $1.40 – $1.70, reflecting a stable and growing user base. Maximum Price: $2.00 – $2.50, if Jupiter solidifies its market dominance and the overall crypto market experiences a prolonged period of stability or renewed growth after consolidation. The ability of Jupiter to navigate regulatory changes and competitive pressures will be key to hitting these higher targets. Long-Term Jupiter Crypto Forecast 2027-2030: Is a $2 JUP Price Achievable? Forecasting several years into the future for any cryptocurrency is highly speculative, but we can analyze potential scenarios for the Jupiter crypto . The period from 2027 to 2030 will likely be characterized by further maturation of the crypto industry, increased institutional participation, and potentially clearer regulatory frameworks. For Jupiter to not only survive but thrive, it must continue to be an indispensable part of the Solana DeFi ecosystem. Its long-term value will depend on: Scalability and Performance: Solana’s ability to scale further will directly benefit Jupiter’s capacity. Cross-Chain Capabilities: As the crypto world becomes increasingly multi-chain, Jupiter’s ability to aggregate liquidity across different networks could be a massive growth driver. Real-World Utility: If DeFi integrates more with traditional finance or real-world assets, Jupiter’s role as an efficient exchange aggregator could expand significantly. Considering these factors, and assuming Jupiter maintains its innovation and market relevance, the long-term outlook appears positive. The $2 mark, which might seem ambitious in the short term, becomes increasingly achievable and even sustainable in this timeframe. Here’s a potential long-term crypto price prediction range for JUP: Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2027 $1.50 $2.00 $2.80 2028 $1.80 $2.50 $3.50 2029 $2.20 $3.00 $4.50 2030 $2.80 $3.80 $6.00+ These projections are based on strong market growth, continued development by Jupiter, and increased adoption of Solana DeFi. Achieving the higher end of these ranges would depend on Jupiter becoming a dominant force in the broader DeFi landscape, potentially beyond just Solana. Challenges and Opportunities for Jupiter’s Future Growth No project is without its hurdles, and Jupiter faces a few that could impact its Jupiter price prediction . Challenges: Competition: The DEX aggregator space is competitive, with other platforms constantly vying for market share. Jupiter must continue to innovate to stay ahead. Solana Network Issues: While Solana has made strides in stability, any significant network outages or performance issues could negatively impact user trust and, by extension, Jupiter’s activity. Regulatory Scrutiny: The broader DeFi space faces increasing regulatory attention. Unfavorable regulations could impact Jupiter’s operations and user base. Tokenomics and Inflation: While JUP’s tokenomics include a governance model, careful management of token supply and distribution will be essential to prevent excessive inflation. Opportunities: Expanding Ecosystem: Solana’s rapid growth presents a vast opportunity for Jupiter to integrate with new projects and capture more liquidity. New Product Development: Continuing to build out its suite of DeFi tools, such as advanced trading options or new launchpad initiatives, can attract new user segments. Cross-Chain Expansion: While currently focused on Solana, future expansion into other blockchain ecosystems could dramatically increase Jupiter’s total addressable market. Institutional Adoption: As institutions become more comfortable with DeFi, Jupiter’s robust infrastructure could attract significant institutional liquidity. Actionable Insights for Potential JUP Investors For those considering an investment in JUP, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always thoroughly research Jupiter’s technology, team, and roadmap before investing. Understand the risks involved in cryptocurrency investments. Monitor Solana’s Health: Since Jupiter is deeply intertwined with Solana, keep a close eye on Solana’s network performance, development, and overall ecosystem growth. Track Jupiter’s Development: Follow Jupiter’s official announcements, community forums, and social media channels to stay informed about new features, partnerships, and governance proposals. Understand Market Cycles: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. Consider a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy to mitigate risk rather than trying to time the market. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio and do not put all your funds into a single asset. A smart investment strategy involves continuous learning and adaptation to market changes. The potential for the JUP price to reach significant milestones is there, but it comes with inherent risks. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Jupiter (JUP) Jupiter stands as a powerful and indispensable component of the Solana DeFi landscape. Our in-depth Jupiter price prediction for 2025, 2026, and up to 2030 suggests a compelling growth trajectory, with the ambitious $2 JUP price target appearing increasingly achievable under favorable market conditions and sustained platform development. Its robust aggregation services, innovative features, and strong community governance position it well for future success. While the path to these price levels will undoubtedly be marked by market volatility and competitive challenges, Jupiter’s fundamental utility and ongoing innovation provide a strong foundation. As the broader crypto price prediction for the market remains optimistic for the coming years, Jupiter’s role in facilitating efficient, secure, and user-friendly decentralized trading on Solana is likely to become even more critical. Investors should remain informed and consider the long-term potential alongside short-term fluctuations.

Specifically, whales collectively sold around 70 million XRP, worth approximately $178 million, over the past 48 hours, according to on-chain data from Santiment shared by Ali Martinez in an X post on October 25. XRP whale transaction chart. Source: Santiment The sell-off, led by wallets holding between 100,000 and 10 million XRP, comes as the token trades at $2.54, clinging to fragile support amid market uncertainty. Historically, such whale liquidations have preceded short-term declines, and if selling persists, XRP could retest the key $2.00 support zone. Meanwhile, technical indicators suggest that while a short-term correction remains possible, the long-term outlook for XRP looks promising. XRP’s imminent breakout In this regard, analysis shared by ChartNerd in an October 25 X post indicated that XRP has been consolidating within a vertical accumulation range since January 2025, with technical signals pointing to a potentially major breakout. https://twitter.com/ChartNerdTA/status/1981990650548568083 According to the market structure, XRP has been trading between accumulation support and resistance zones, forming a prolonged sideways pattern that often precedes sharp directional moves. The analyst noted that clearing resistance around the $2.60 range could trigger a breakout targeting the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, projecting potential upside toward $5 to $6. The weekly 55-day exponential moving average (EMA) continues to serve as a crucial support level, helping maintain XRP’s bullish structure. Beyond market sentiment, XRP’s trajectory will likely depend on broader fundamental factors, such as anticipation surrounding the possible approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). The approval was initially expected in late October but has reportedly been delayed due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. At the same time, Ripple’s plan to raise $1 billion to establish an XRP treasury is viewed as another key bullish signal to watch. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.54, up over 3% in the past 24 hours, showing minimal impact from whale activity. Over the past week, the asset has rallied by nearly 8%.

In a recent post on X, he said he went down the “rabbit hole of XRP” and decided to invest a “significant portion” of over $25,000 into the asset. I’ve spent the last 24hrs going down the rabbit hole of $XRP . I have decided to invest a SIGNIFICANT portion into XRP. ($25..+) I believe it could revolutionize the banking systems. It’s a gamble, as all investments are. Whether you are Team XRP or not. I want everyone to… — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) October 25, 2025 Wynn said the potential for Ripple and its native token is substantial as it could “revolutionize the banking systems.” However, the meme coin trader admitted that XRP still remains a gamble, just like all other investments. His backing comes in a rather peculiar timing as the company behind the asset just announced that it has renamed Hidden Road – the prime broker it acquired earlier this year for $1.25 billion – to Ripple Prime. This means that Ripple is now the first and only crypto company to “own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker – bringing the promise of digital assets to institutional customers at scale.” Wynn also asked the community to outline the pros and cons of investing in Ripple’s cross-border token. The XRP Army, which is among the most vocal parts of the crypto community, was quick to highlight some pros, such as Ripple being the 2nd oldest chain in the Top 10 and its fast and cheap layer 1 network. Others were a bit more skeptical. One user asked how much Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, paid Wynn for this post on Friday. In a separate post, Wynn said he is done with meme coins and perpetual trading after “completing” both ventures and will now focus on building in the crypto industry. However, it doesn’t become clear if his new plans are somehow connected to Ripple.

The protocol’s presale has raised $17,850,000 since inception, drawing 17,400 holders who eye its lending mechanics. Phase 6, now 75% filled at $0.035 per token, has climbed 250% from Phase 1’s $0.01 entry. This surge underscores why experts flag MUTM among the best cryptos to buy now, especially with V1 launching on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Over the next decade, adoption in dual lending could propel values, mirroring resilient altcoins that weathered volatility. Yet urgency mounts: Phase 6 sells out fast, vanishing the $0.035 grab before Phase 7 hikes 14.3% to $0.04. Launch at $0.06 promises 425% ROI for current buyers, tying into broader crypto news today on sustainable yields. Presale Surge Fuels Investor Drive Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has accelerated its presale, blending transparency with incentives that hook early backers. Phase 6 allocation nears exhaustion, pressuring participants to secure tokens before the inevitable jump. Holders now top 17,400, a figure that reflects calculated bets on DeFi’s rebound. The team recently unveiled a dashboard spotlighting the top 50 holders, sharpening community rivalry. A 24-hour leaderboard update adds daily thrill: the peak depositor claims $500 in MUTM, contingent on one transaction in that span. It resets at 00:00 UTC, spurring consistent action. Leading buys from the last cycle hit $8,601.92, $7,000.00, $500.00, and $256.83, showcasing diverse stakes. Moreover, a $100,000 giveaway distributes $10,000 in MUTM to each of 10 winners. Entry demands a wallet submission, quest completion, and $50 presale minimum—simple steps that amplify engagement. Such moves have positioned MUTM as the best crypto to invest in, per ongoing crypto news. Dual Lending Unlocks Passive Gains Borrowers and lenders alike have tested Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s framework, revealing yields that outpace traditional savings. Users deposit ETH into peer-to-contract pools, earning APYs around 8-12% as demand fluctuates. One holder supplied $5,000 in USDT last week, pulling 9.5% yield over seven days without liquidation risks. Peer-to-peer lanes handle niche assets, like borrowing $3,000 against rare tokens at 75% loan-to-value, fostering direct deals. MtTokens accrue interest, redeemable for principal plus gains, turning idle crypto into steady income. The platform launches with the token per roadmap, eyeing top-tier exchange listings that could spike liquidity. These features cement MUTM’s role in the best cryptocurrency to invest today, blending utility with growth. Transitions to Layer-2 scaling will slash fees, inviting broader participation over years. Such rigor has drawn institutional eyes, aligning with DeFi’s maturing standards. Meanwhile, an over-collateralized stablecoin anchors operations, pegged 1:1 to the dollar via lending reserves. Borrowers mint it against ETH, repaying to burn supply, stabilizing trades amid swings. Investors thus view MUTM as a top cryptocurrency, its safeguards paving a decade of reliability. Fresh audits and bounties underscore why it ranks among altcoins primed for endurance. Long-Term Price Outlook Merges Resilience and Surge Analysts have projected Mutuum Finance (MUTM) trajectories, rooting estimates in adoption metrics and fee redistribution. By 2035, dual markets could capture 5% of DeFi volume, driving token demand through buybacks for stakers. Logic hinges on oracle-backed pricing via Chainlink, minimizing errors that plague rivals. Picture AVAX in 2020-2021: it dipped to $2.80 lows amid bearish sentiment, then rocketed to $144.96 peaks over 14 months, delivering 5,175% ROI as subnet scaling ignited ecosystems. MUTM echoes this path, starting from $0.035 presale depths, but with lending yields that AVAX lacked, potentially amplifying gains. Expect MUTM to hit $11.20 by 2030 via listings and stablecoin uptake, then $25.50 by 2035 as multi-chain expands, yielding 15,614% from now. This outstrips AVAX’s run, given MUTM’s passive income edge over mere infrastructure. Yet AVAX’s volatility exposed gaps; MUTM’s P2P flexibility dodges those, ensuring steadier climbs. As the best crypto to buy, it promises compounded returns for patient holders. Projections for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) intertwine with its core yields, recapping why it endures as a top crypto. Over 10 years, listings and scaling will elevate values, rewarding early moves like Phase 6 entries. Secure your stake now—join the presale before prices ascend further.

An analyst now projects a strong rebound that could drive the token back toward a crucial daily exponential moving average (EMA), signaling potential recovery after recent consolidation. Shiba Inu Maintains Key Support Amid Market Uncertainty Shiba Inu has been fluctuating between $0.000010 and $0.0000099, reflecting the broader market’s indecision. This mirrors the trend seen in Bitcoin and other major altcoins. Despite the stagnant price action, the asset maintains a vital support level, which analysts view as the foundation for a possible upward move. According to market analyst SwallowAcademy, SHIB’s ability to hold this critical demand zone indicates potential strength. The analyst noted that the recent dip formed a visible gap that prices could soon fill. A chart shared by SwallowAcademy highlighted that SHIB dropped below the former support range between $0.00001145 and $0.00001264. This green-marked zone had provided consistent support throughout the token’s multi-month consolidation. Shiba Inu and the 200-day EMA, Source: TradingView Now, with Shiba Inu trading near $0.000010, analysts believe it could bounce back toward that area, which has become resistance. SwallowAcademy previously identified the 200-day EMA as a persistent resistance barrier for SHIB. Since May, this indicator has rejected upward momentum on multiple occasions, halting rallies before they could extend. 200-Day EMA Holds the Key to Next Price Direction Historical price data shows that the 200-day EMA has repeatedly capped bullish runs. Shiba Inu faced rejection near this level during price peaks at $0.00001765 in May, $0.00001597 in July, and $0.00001484 in September. Each of these rejections occurred close to the EMA, reinforcing its role as a decisive technical level. SwallowAcademy emphasized that a retest of this resistance would not only fill previous market gaps but also define SHIB’s next trajectory. If the token manages to break above the EMA, it could trigger a significant bullish shift. However, another rejection might extend the current consolidation phase. At the time of writing, the 200-day EMA trends around $0.00001299. A move from the current price of $0.000010 toward this level represents an estimated 30% price increase. Adding to the optimistic outlook, ForexDreamVantage echoed similar sentiments, suggesting that Shiba Inu “is still alive.” The analyst argued that holding the present support could open the door for a rebound toward the “trend reversal zone” near $0.00001765. Reclaiming this area would likely transform market sentiment from bearish to bullish, potentially setting the stage for a broader rally.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-25 11:16:18
53618507,https://cryptonews.com/?p=443367,1761391074,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53618507.jpeg,XRP Price Prediction: Why Softer U.S. Inflation Data Could Accelerate Run to $2.80,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-why-softer-u-s-inflation-data-could-accelerate-run-to-2-80/,"XRP extended its rally above $2.55 in early Asian trading, gaining 4.3% in 24 hours as softer U.S. inflation data boosted investor confidence. With markets now betting on a Federal Reserve rate cut later this month, XRP’s bullish momentum is building. The token trades near $2.54, supported by strong volume and growing optimism that a breakout toward $2.80 may be on the horizon. Softer Inflation Boosts Rate Cut Expectations The latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed prices rose 0.3% in September, below expectations of 0.4%, while annual inflation eased to 3.0%. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, increased just 0.2%, another sign of cooling price pressure. US CPI YoY% breakdown from ECAN: pic.twitter.com/jUU5w90j90 — Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) October 24, 2025 This softer data strengthened market expectations for a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut later this month. Lower borrowing costs typically weaken the dollar and redirect capital toward higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. As traders anticipate a more accommodative monetary stance, XRP and other altcoins have gained fresh tailwinds, extending their short-term recovery. Mixed U.S. Data Keeps Markets Cautious Recent U.S. economic indicators presented a mixed picture. The S&P Global Flash PMI rose to 54.8 in October, the strongest private-sector expansion in three months, signaling resilience in business activity. However, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index slipped from 55.1 to 53.6, highlighting growing household uncertainty amid persistent inflation concerns. This combination, stronger business output but weaker consumer mood, reinforces the view that the Fed may soon pivot toward easing to support economic stability. For crypto traders, that prospect has revived interest in speculative assets like XRP, which often benefits from looser monetary policy and risk-on sentiment. Weaker Dollar Outlook and XRP’s Path to $2.80 A softer inflation outlook has pressured the U.S. dollar, encouraging traders to reallocate capital into crypto markets. As expectations of a slower tightening cycle grow, Bitcoin and XRP have both attracted renewed institutional and retail interest. For XRP specifically, sustained momentum above $2.55 could pave the way for a test of $2.80, a key resistance level that previously capped rallies in September. A successful breakout above that threshold would shift near-term sentiment firmly bullish. However, ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ripple’s SEC case may still temper aggressive upside in the short run. XRP Price Prediction – Bears Eye $2.02 as Descending Triangle Tightens On the daily chart, XRP trades within a descending triangle pattern, a formation that often signals potential downside if support gives way. The price faces stiff resistance near $2.70 – $2.72, where both the 50-day EMA and upper trendline converge. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A failure to close above this zone could trigger another correction toward $2.26, with deeper support near $2.02 and $1.77, levels where buying previously re-emerged. A confirmed breakdown below $2.26 would validate the bearish setup and potentially accelerate losses toward the $1.95 – $2.00 zone. Short-term traders may look for rejection candles or a bearish engulfing pattern around $2.70 for short entries, targeting $2.26 initially. Conversely, only a daily close above $2.72 would negate the bearish bias and signal a potential trend reversal toward $2.84 – $3.15. Outlook – Consolidation Before the Next Move Despite short-term volatility, XRP’s broader outlook remains constructive. Softer inflation, potential rate cuts, and rising institutional engagement continue to provide fundamental support for crypto assets. If buyers reclaim $2.70 – $2.72, XRP could extend its recovery toward $2.80 and even $3.00. But until that breakout materializes, traders should expect consolidation within the $2.25 – $2.70 range. In short, XRP’s technical setup shows a market at a crossroads – steady macro tailwinds point higher, but chart resistance remains the final gate to the next leg of its rally.

Francois Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, told lawmakers that capping the budget shortfall at that level is the only way to stay on track toward a 3% deficit target by 2029. “It is absolutely necessary to get within 3% between now and 2029 and this means a maximum deficit of 4.8% next year to cover a quarter of the path,” Villeroy said in an interview with La Croix, warning that anything more risks pushing France into “gradual suffocation.” The National Assembly is still grinding through the 2026 draft budget. It currently sets a deficit of 4.7%. But Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu, whose survival depends on opposition support, has publicly floated flexibility. He says the real aim is to stay “within 5%,” if that’s what it takes to avoid another political bloodbath. “It is no longer possible to govern by the discipline of one camp alone,” Lecornu told lawmakers, “but by the cultivation of a rigorous debate between lawmakers who start with different beliefs.” Credit outlook slashed as Macron’s pension freeze fuels backlash Moody’s Ratings didn’t waste time reacting. The agency slashed France’s credit outlook from stable to negative, citing political gridlock and legislative chaos. “The decision to change the outlook to negative reflects the increased risk that the fragmentation of the country’s political landscape will continue to impair the functioning of France’s legislative institutions,” it said Friday. France still holds a Aa3 rating, seven levels above junk, on par with the UK and Czech Republic. But that gap is shrinking fast. This downgrade followed earlier hits from S&P, Fitch, and DBRS, as investors began questioning how long France could delay difficult decisions. One of those delays?President Emmanuel Macron’s pension reform, which would have raised the retirement age from 62 to 64. Lecornu suspended it under pressure from left-leaning opposition lawmakers. But Moody’s warned that leaving the reform on ice for too long would damage growth and worsen long-term budget risks. Even that hasn’t calmed tensions. The Socialists, who Lecornu needs to keep his job, are threatening no-confidence votes unless the budget includes fewer cuts and new taxes on rich households and big corporations. Lecornu is trying to keep them at bay without triggering another collapse. He also backed off using Article 49.3, a constitutional tool that allows governments to bypass votes, saying this battle would have to be fought “the hard way,” through direct negotiation. Market pressure builds as spread with Germany widens The government’s proposed draft trims the deficit from 5.4% in 2025 to 4.7% in 2026, but there’s no guarantee it survives the Assembly floor intact. Lecornu has said lawmakers are free to adjust it, so long as the number stays below 5% and doesn’t derail the longer-term 3% goal. Finance Minister Roland Lescure responded to Moody’s cut by insisting France remains committed to a “ambitious” deficit reduction. But he admitted the outlook downgrade shows there’s an “absolute necessity” for a budget deal. Moody’s was clear about what happens if the stalemate continues: “If persistent, the inability to pass legislation that effectively addresses such policy challenges would mark a weakening of the country’s institutions.” That warning hit the market immediately. French asset sell-offs have picked up steam since Macron’s June 2024 snap elections, which left the National Assembly in deadlock. The yield spread between 10-year French and German bonds, a key market risk gauge, hit 89 basis points, nearly double what it was before the election. On Friday, it settled at 81, still the highest in 11 days. Then came S&P’s unscheduled downgrade, wiping out France’s average double‑A rating across all major credit agencies. That triggered forced selling among investment funds with tight rating criteria. Others scrambled to rewrite their investment rules just to keep holding French bonds.

This initiative also comes with preparations for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), setting a dual path for digital financial innovation. What Makes Kyrgyzstan’s National Stablecoin So Significant? The introduction of the Kyrgyzstan national stablecoin is more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a strategic national decision. This stablecoin, built on the robust BNB Chain, aims to bring stability and efficiency to the country’s financial infrastructure. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, a stablecoin is designed to maintain a pegged value, often to a fiat currency like the US dollar, making it ideal for everyday transactions and government use. Here’s why this development is drawing global attention: Stability : Pegged to a national fiat currency, it offers predictable value. Efficiency : Transactions on a blockchain like BNB Chain are typically faster and cheaper than traditional banking methods. Transparency : Blockchain technology provides an immutable and transparent ledger for all transactions. Accessibility : It can potentially reach a wider population, including those underserved by traditional banking. Moreover, the inclusion of BNB in Kyrgyzstan’s national cryptocurrency reserve assets highlights a deep commitment to the broader blockchain ecosystem, not just the stablecoin itself. This integration suggests a forward-thinking approach to managing national digital wealth. How Will the Kyrgyzstan National Stablecoin Transform Public Services? One of the primary goals for the Kyrgyzstan national stablecoin is its application within the public sector. Imagine a world where government payments are instant, secure, and transparent. This is the vision Kyrgyzstan is working towards. The stablecoin is expected to streamline various governmental functions, including: Government Payments : Efficient disbursement of salaries, pensions, and social benefits. Tax Collection : Simplified and transparent collection of taxes. Public Procurement : Enhanced accountability and reduced fraud in government tenders. Cross-Border Transactions : Facilitating international payments with greater ease and lower costs. This digital infrastructure could significantly reduce bureaucratic hurdles and enhance the overall efficiency of public administration. The move towards a CBDC further complements this, suggesting a comprehensive national strategy for digital finance. Binance’s Pivotal Role in Kyrgyzstan’s Digital Future The involvement of Binance , even through its former CEO Changpeng Zhao ‘s announcement, underscores the collaborative effort behind this initiative. Binance is not just a technology provider; it’s actively investing in building a robust local ecosystem in Kyrgyzstan . This commitment extends beyond the technical implementation of the stablecoin, focusing on long-term sustainability and growth. Key aspects of Binance’s ecosystem expansion include: Law Enforcement Training : Educating local agencies on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency forensics to ensure security and compliance. Blockchain Education : Partnering with 10 major universities to foster a new generation of blockchain experts and innovators. This collaboration is crucial for developing local talent and driving future technological advancements within the country. These initiatives are vital for ensuring that the adoption of the Kyrgyzstan national stablecoin is supported by a well-informed public and a secure regulatory environment. It’s a holistic approach to integrating digital assets into the national fabric. What Are the Broader Implications of This Bold Move? Kyrgyzstan’s decision to embrace a Kyrgyzstan national stablecoin on BNB Chain, alongside CBDC preparations, sends a powerful signal to the global financial community. It positions the country as a pioneer in digital currency adoption, potentially attracting further investment and innovation. This bold step could inspire other nations, especially those in emerging markets, to explore similar pathways for modernizing their financial systems. While the benefits are substantial, challenges such as regulatory frameworks, cybersecurity, and public adoption will need careful navigation. However, the proactive steps taken by Kyrgyzstan, supported by entities like Binance, demonstrate a strong commitment to overcoming these hurdles and reaping the rewards of digital transformation. In conclusion, Kyrgyzstan’s launch of a national stablecoin on BNB Chain is a truly transformative event. From streamlining government payments to fostering blockchain education and integrating BNB into national reserves, this initiative represents a forward-looking strategy for digital finance. It highlights a nation’s commitment to innovation, efficiency, and a digitally empowered future, setting a remarkable precedent for the global adoption of blockchain technology.

As ADA’s price stabilizes and future growth seems more incremental in nature, the focus is now on new crypto ventures with more potential and genuine innovation. Caught in the middle of this shift is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fresh DeFi platform in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035 per token. The phase is just days to closure with less than 25% of its allocated tokens remaining to be sold. Over $17.85 million has been raised and over 17,400 investors have signed up. For ADA billionaires seeking to diversify into high-potential early-stage projects before prices go through the roof, Mutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the shiniest new cryptos to buy in 2025. Traders who are asking what crypto to buy now are closely watching MUTM. Cardano (ADA) Experiences Massive Bullish Turnaround as Market Power Grows Cardano (ADA) is on the cusp of a trend turn in favor of a bullish trend after a protracted multi-year consolidation, since price activity is beginning to demonstrate newfound vigor. Support level of $0.64, which was a key area that previously had served as resistance, has become supportive now, lending support to ADA’s breakout potential. If momentum keeps accelerating, analysts view $2.32 as the first level of interest, to be followed by $5.43 and $7.00 as key resistance levels that will start coming into play in the next bull cycle. Above this key support level will be crucial in making the reversal, with volume and momentum being the key indicators of further bullish continuation. While ADA has its sights set on the next major move, traders also widen their radar to include upcoming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is picking up serious traction as it moves into 2025’s expected market surge. For investors still asking what crypto to buy, MUTM is becoming an obvious choice. Mutuum Finance Breaks Market Projections Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast turning into one of the best new crypto initiatives. Platform adoption has been far in excess of initial estimates, with over 17,400 investors participating in the presale and raising over $17.85 million.

Elina Valtonen, the Foreign Minister, said the latest steps taken jointly by the United States and the European Union were meaningful but not sufficient to change the situation. She said the objective now is to affect Russia’s cost calculations because its political goals remain unchanged. Valtonen spoke in Malaysia at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, where Finland is signing on to the group’s main treaty. She described how the recent US sanctions targeted Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC, the two largest Russian oil producers, while the EU moved to block imports of Russian liquefied natural gas. “The step that the United States took the other day in lockstep with Europe to strengthen the sanctions against Russia is so important,” Valtonen said.“However, we simply have to increase the pressure.” She added that “we seem to be unable to change Russia’s imperialistic goals, but we should be able to change their calculus,” and noted that “a war costs a lot of money” and Russia’s economy is still carrying that cost. White House and regional diplomacy move at the same time The tightening of sanctions came during a broader diplomatic sequence. Donald Trump, on his first trip to the region since returning to the White House earlier this year, is expected to meet ASEAN officials on Sunday. Later, he is scheduled to meet Xi Jinping in South Korea, where Trump has said he will raise China’s role in applying pressure on Vladimir Putin. This discussion comes after Chinese state-owned Sinopec canceled purchases of seaborne Russian crude following the US blacklisting of Rosneft and Lukoil. Russia has increased its military strikes in Ukraine and has shown no interest in stopping the conflict. Trump also postponed a planned meeting with Putin in Budapest, saying he did not want “a wasted meeting” without clear prospects for progress. According to Bloomberg, Finland views energy trade as one of the last remaining major leverage points in the conflict, arguing that sanctions need to remain targeted, continuous, and hard to evade. European coalition presses military and economic measures Meanwhile, over in the UK, Keir Starmer led a meeting of the so-called coalition of the willing, bringing together thirty governments working to support Ukraine and defeat Putin. Starmer called for providing long-range missiles, removing more Russian oil and gas from global markets, using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine’s defense budget, expanding air defense capabilities, and maintaining military pressure on Russian positions. The UK Prime Minister said:- “I think it’s important when we say we want to take oil and gas off the market, that we’re describing an end of a process, not the beginning of a process. I think it is really important that we continue to bear down. There are some countries which, in my view, should be moving a lot more quickly in relation to this.” Dozens of governments joined virtually, including Emmanuel Macron, who co-chairs the coalition. After the meeting, Starmer said Putin’s “ludicrous demands for Ukrainian land which he could not and has not taken by force” show he is not negotiating in good faith. “So we have been clear today that we must respond,” Starmer said. “Working with the US this coalition is determined to go further than ever to ratchet up the pressure on Putin – from the battlefield to his war economy – because that is the only way to change his mind and push him back to the table.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Economy|EUR|GBP|RUB|UAH|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|COMMODITY|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-25 11:30:36

Launched in May, this milestone underscores the accelerating appetite for regulated XRP exposure among sophisticated traders, particularly institutions stepping deeper into the digital asset market. CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives marketplace, has already transformed institutional crypto access with regulated Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, driving liquidity, price discovery, and confidence. Now, with XRP joining that elite lineup, professional investors gain a compliant, capital-efficient tool to hedge risk and capture directional exposure to one of the most adopted digital assets in the market. Therefore, the strong early response signals demand far beyond initial expectations. As XRP’s role in cross-border settlement accelerates and Ripple scales institutional adoption, market interest is surging. CME’s regulated XRP futures deliver what offshore platforms often can’t: transparent leverage, efficient hedging, and institutional-grade risk controls, empowering traders to manage exposure with confidence. Notably, futures markets aren’t just a venue for speculation, they’re a signal of trust in an asset’s long-term value. As liquidity grows and institutional participation expands, XRP benefits from more efficient price discovery, tighter spreads, and increased credibility among regulated financial players. XRP’s Bullish Momentum Builds as Key Moving Average Crossover Signals Upside Potential Toward $2.70 XRP’s bullish momentum is accelerating, fueled by a key technical breakout. Market analyst Kaan Kaya notes the 20-day SMA has crossed above the 50-day SMA, a classic bullish crossover signaling growing upward strength and the potential for the rally to extend further. Moving averages help traders quickly assess market momentum. When a short-term average breaks above a longer-term one, it confirms a shift toward bullish strength. For XRP, this crossover underscores rising confidence, increasing demand, and mounting expectations of a sustained breakout. What’s next? Well, the immediate level to watch is $2.50, which has emerged as a critical resistance zone. XRP has tested this price area multiple times, demonstrating that sellers are actively defending the level. However, recent strength suggests the bulls may finally be preparing to push through. According to Kaya, a decisive daily close above $2.50 could open the doors for the next major leg upward, with a price target near $2.70. This potential move would not only confirm the bullish crossover but also signal reclaiming a key psychological zone that could energize market sentiment even further. XRP is currently trading near $2.55, supported by growing optimism around its expanding role in institutional finance and rising participation from both retail and professional traders. Strengthening fundamentals and improving technicals are reinforcing the view that XRP may be entering a new phase of price discovery. Conclusion As XRP’s real-world utility expands and institutional adoption accelerates, CME’s regulated futures have emerged as a key access point for professional traders seeking capital-efficient exposure. Nearly $27B in notional volume within just five months underscores the trend: demand is rising, confidence is strengthening, and XRP is joining the ranks of crypto’s most established institutional assets. Meanwhile, XRP is nearing a pivotal breakout zone as the 20-day SMA crosses above the 50-day SMA, a clear signal of strengthening bullish momentum. A sustained close above $2.50 could trigger the next leg higher toward $2.70, reinforcing a broader trend reversal.

Price Breaks From Downtrend The recent move marks a clean break above a downward trendline that had acted as resistance for several weeks. Multiple failed attempts to break above the line added weight to the breakout when it finally occurred. The price now trades above that level, with a large green candle confirming the shift. Crypto analyst Batman commented , “$HYPE has finally broken out of its short-term bearish trend after months of staying under.” They added, “Once something strong gets broken, it often flips and acts as support.” The zone between $39 and $40 is now seen as an area to watch for potential support on any retest. Source: Batman/X However, views remain mixed on where the price goes from here. Analyst Crypto Patel offered a more cautious view, suggesting a possible move back toward $32. “We just broke down from the channel support and honestly? It’s looking bearish,” they wrote. “I’m expecting a retest and then a move down to the $32 support zone.” They added that if $32 fails, the next zone to watch is between $22 and $20. Still, the analyst described that area as a long-term buying opportunity. Despite the near-term uncertainty, their long-term outlook remains bullish, with price targets of $50, $100, $200, and even $500 over time. Indicators Back Uptrend The chart also shows strength in key indicators. The MACD has printed a bullish crossover, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line.

Malaysia’s Investment, Trade and Industry Minister Zafrul Aziz said, “It’s zero for now and I hope it continues to be so,” adding that the U.S. remains “an important market for Malaysia.” Malaysia is already facing a 19% levy on exports to the U.S., which has raised concerns among its major electronics producers. The trade talks come as President Donald Trump considers sweeping new tariffs on semiconductors that could go as high as 300%, a potential blow to the world’s sixth-largest chip exporter. Trump plans trade and minerals deal at ASEAN Trump is expected to visit Kuala Lumpur during the ASEAN summit, and Zafrul said it is “a possibility” that Malaysia will sign a critical minerals agreement with Trump. It is unclear whether Trump actually wants a stronger foothold in Malaysia’s rare-earth and mineral-processing sectors, areas now seemingly attracting investors from China, Japan, and both Koreas. According to Bloomberg, Malaysia has been trying to expand rare-earth mining and processing to meet global demand for materials that power electric vehicles, batteries, and renewable technologies. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced earlier this month that the country’s sovereign wealth fund, Khazanah Nasional, would collaborate with global companies to build downstream processing plants. The government’s plan is to make Malaysia dominant in the supply chains for clean energy and electronics, so they can reduce reliance on Chinese imports. The discussions are expected to take place alongside the ASEAN Summit scheduled from October 26 to 28, hosted by Malaysia under the theme “Inclusivity and Sustainability.” The summit will gather leaders from the U.S., China, Japan, and all ten ASEAN nations for a series of talks on trade, regional stability, and industrial cooperation. Japan to deepen semiconductor and AI collaboration with Malaysia Japan is preparing to strengthen cooperation with Malaysia and ASEAN in semiconductors and artificial intelligence, said Japan’s Ambassador to Malaysia, Noriyuki Shikata. Speaking to Bernama, Shikata explained that Tokyo’s renewed push is because of newly-elected Prime Minister Takaichi Sanae’s focus on economic security and high-value technology investment. “We will be very interested in upgrading our industrial cooperation in strategic sectors like semiconductors, AI and rare earths,” he said. Takaichi is traveling to Kuala Lumpur to meet Anwar and attend the ASEAN meetings. Her administration has already introduced new economic-security laws that it claims will protect the country’s critical technologies and intellectual property. Malaysia’s Shikata pointed out that Japanese companies have supported Malaysia’s industrial growth for over four decades, from Mitsubishi Motors’ role in Proton’s development to Daihatsu’s joint venture with Perodua, which created thousands of skilled jobs. He added that many Malaysians trained in Japan are now working in universities and industries across the country. Malaysia’s Shikata described green transition and energy security as the next stage of Japan-Malaysia cooperation under the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC).

Both firms have announced endeavors towards fostering the inclusion of the technology in their operations. Electronic Arts announced a strategic partnership with Stability AI. According to its statement, both firms will work on co-developing generative AI models, tools, and workflows that will transform game creation. Electronic Arts is currently one of the biggest third-party game publishers, driving popular franchises like EA Sports FC, Battlefield, and Madden NFL. On the other hand, Stability AI is best known for its popular Stable Diffusion model. Electronic Arts and Krafton are embracing AI technology In the statement, Stability AI mentioned that the partnership will focus on practical applications that will be used to improve creative workflows. Some of the projects that would be undertaken include the creation of physically based rendering (PBR) materials through artist-driven workflows, such as generating 2D textures with precise colors and light accuracy. The firms are also developing AI systems that will be used to pre-visualize entire 3D environments from prompts. The partnership will also look to enable rapid prototyping and visual storytelling, while allowing artists to maintain their creative control and quality standards. “Creativity has always been at the heart of everything our teams do,” said Electronic Arts VP of Creative Innovation Kallol Mitra, in a statement. “Together with Stability AI, we’re amplifying that creativity. Giving artists, designers, and developers the power to dream bigger and build more.” Electronic Arts’ announcement comes weeks after the firm released a statement saying it had agreed to be acquired by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in a $55 billion deal. The planned sale faced criticism from several angles of the gaming community, as gamers and industry analysts criticized the amount of potential debt Electronic Arts would be saddled with. Senators also voiced out their criticisms over the potential for foreign influence and national security risks. Krafton set to finalize its AI push in 2026 Krafton, on the other hand, announced a comprehensive transformation into an AI-first company. According to the PUBG and Subnautica publisher, the company wants to center its operations around agentic AI to automate workflows and enable employees to focus on creative activities and solve complex problems. The company is also making several investments in line with this, including spending $70 billion for GPU cluster infrastructure to support sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning tasks. In addition, Krafton is expected to allocate nearly $21 billion annually starting in 2026 for employee AI tool utilization, a support level that is more than 10 times its current level. The transformation is expected to happen in three stages, which include establishing an AI-first culture through learning platforms and a hackathon, innovating work methods by restructuring organizational management, and providing new growth opportunities through expanded employee mobility and role expansion. “We will leap forward as a company that promotes the growth of members and expands the organization’s areas of challenge through AI,” said Krafton CEO Kim Chang-han, in a statement. Krafton aims to finalize its AI platform and data integration foundation by the second half of next year, establishing a company-wide AI operation infrastructure in an attempt to strengthen its competitive position in the global gaming market. Krafton and Electronic Arts join other game publishers that have embraced the use of AI. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The second-largest asset in the world digitally is consolidating around $3,850 following weeks of lateral movement. Traders are looking at a possible recovery to $4,200 should the momentum continue to improve. As institutional flows re-enter the market and whales accumulate, optimism is slowly rebounding throughout the market. Early-stage tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are being eyed by investors as the next big thing. Wyckoff Pattern Hints at Renewed Accumulation According to market analysts, Ethereum develops a Wyckoff-style re-accumulation pattern. Crypto analyst Ash Crypto reported that ‘’ETH is moving toward the markup phase.’’ In the three-day chart, Ethereum has developed structural bases around $3,700 and $3,800, just like previous breakout patterns. The Wyckoff model postulates that large traders are gearing towards a rise in prices during low volatility. Source: X This narrative is backed by institutional data. Recent on-chain activity indicated an 8,491 ETH withdrawal (=$32 million) of OKX by a whale wallet, which is usually viewed as accumulation. The drop in exchange reserves would reduce supply pressure, which would provide a good chance of a rise above $4,000 and potentially $4,200 in the short term. Technical Setup and ETF Flows Support Upside Outlook The price structure of Ethereum resists the weak pullbacks. A possible triple bottom pattern of between $3,700 and $3,800 enhances the recovery technical argument. An established breakout of the price above $4,000 would open the next resistance zone at $4,200. In the meantime, institutional exposure is growing with the ETH ETFs. BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale recorded mixed flows this week, but cumulative inflows remained positive. According to Fundstrat Tom Lee, “Ethereum is among the best-placed digital assets for the next leg of the cycle.” There is additional support from post-merge dynamics. As issuance is approaching zero and staking participation is growing, the circulating supply of Ethereum continues to shrink. These basics, along with risk appetite returning as the Fear Index improves, provide support on the ability of a sustained recovery. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Investor Momentum Ethereum trades near the $4,200 level as early-stage investors shift their attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE. The token, built on the Ethereum network, has already raised more than $16.5 million from over 16, 500 investors worldwide. Both presale stages are progressing faster than expected, driven by retail demand and a 5 0% PATRIOT50X bonus. MAGACOIN FINANCE is unique as it is dual-audited by CertiK and HashEx and has 100% verification of smart-contract security. Such openness has enhanced investor confidence when new players are seeking authenticated opportunities. It has a valuation of less than 1$, and a coming exchange listing, analysts predict it will be in the 1,200% range as soon as it lists. The roadmap of the project, government-based governance, and tokenomics based on scarcity have made it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy in 2025. Exchange talks are already progressing, meaning wider access may be coming in the near future,- often the stage where first buyers get the greatest returns. Conclusion The technical and on-chain design of Ethereum is a good indicator of a potential recovery to $4,2000 when fear in the market declines. Bullish sentiment is still supported by institutional inflows and decreased supply. However, in addition to recognized properties, some projects promise quicker growth to investors, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is among the best crypto to buy before the next rally. Having passed 100% audits, community traction, and future exchange listings, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining more investors looking to establish themselves early in the 2026 bull market. With increasing momentum, timing is now of the essence – early entry today could make all the difference tomorrow.

American Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng and trade negotiator Li Chenggang at the Merdeka 118 tower, the world’s second-highest building in Kuala Lumpur. The discussions come at a tense moment. President Donald Trump has warned he might slap 100% tariffs on Chinese products starting November 1. This threat came after China put tough new limits on selling rare earth magnets and minerals to other countries. These materials are critical for many industries. The dispute has damaged a careful agreement that Bessent, Greer, and He had worked out over four earlier meetings since May. Recently, Washington added thousands more Chinese companies to a list that blocks them from buying American products. Beijing responded by announcing worldwide restrictions on rare earth exports on October 10. Neither the Malaysian hosts nor the American and Chinese teams shared much information about what they would discuss or whether they planned to tell reporters about any results. Getting ready for the big meeting The three officials are trying to clear the path for Trump and Xi Jinping to sit down next Thursday. That meeting is scheduled for an economic summit in South Korea, where leaders from countries around the Pacific Ocean will gather. The conversation between the two presidents could touch on giving some temporary breaks on tariffs, easing technology restrictions, and getting China to buy American soybeans again. Right before the Saturday talks began, Trump left Washington to start his trip through Asia. He told reporters what he wants to discuss with Xi. Farmers dealing with China’s decision to stop buying U.S. soybeans will be one topic, Trump said. Taiwan , the self-ruled island that China says belongs to it, will also come up. Trump made clear he has no intention of visiting Taiwan himself. Trying to avoid worse damage The world’s two biggest economies want to prevent their tariff war from returning to extremely high levels on both sides. When Bessent and Greer first met with Chinese counterparts in Geneva in May, they agreed to a 90-day pause in the fight. This brought tariffs down sharply to about 55% on the American side and 30% on the Chinese side. It also got rare-earth magnets moving again. They extended this agreement in later talks in London and Stockholm. It was set to end on November 10. But things started falling apart at the end of September. America’s Commerce Department greatly expanded a list that automatically includes companies more than 50% owned by firms already on that list. This blocked American exports to thousands more Chinese businesses. China hit back with new rare earth export controls on October 10, trying to stop these materials from being used in military equipment. Bessent and Greer called China’s action a “global supply chain power grab” and promised America and its friends would not accept these limits. News reports say the Trump team is thinking about restricting even more exports to China, including items like laptops and jet engines. Washington added more tension on Friday by starting a new investigation into whether China failed to keep promises made in a 2020 trade deal called the “Phase One” agreement. That deal had stopped their trade war during Trump’s first term as president. Get seen where it counts.

Bitcoin ETFs didn’t record any outflows among the twelve BTC funds. On-chain data revealed that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded net single-day inflows of $32.68 million. IBIT also saw a historical net inflow of $65.306 billion. Bitcoin ETFs surge after recent 1011 crypto crash Fidelity’s BTC ETF recorded total inflows of $57.92 million. FBTC also saw its total net inflows reach a historical high of $12.597 billion. The increase in inflows in Bitcoin ETFs corresponds with BTC’s price regaining strength. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at around $111,600, up more than 4.5% in the past seven days. Bitcoin ETFs saw a staggering $1.23 billion of outflows within just four days, from October 13 to October 17. The rapid outflows stemmed from the October 11 crypto market crash that saw BTC’s price drop from a high of $121,000 to approximately $103,000. Ethereum ETFs have struggled, recording a total net outflow of $93.6 million. As of October 24, ETH funds have seen cumulative total net inflows of $14.35 billion. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF saw total outflows of nearly $101 million on Friday. No Ethereum-based ETFs recorded inflows, marking three consecutive days of outflows. Ethereum’s price has also struggled to regain the $4,000 psychological level over the past three days. At the time of publication, ETH is trading around $3,950, up more than 1.7% in the past seven days. SEC timeline for Cardano ETFs stalled by U.S. government shutdown As BTC ETFs recorded inflows, the deadline for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision on three XRP ETFs and Grayscale’s Cardano ETF was set for this week. However, the SEC didn’t make any announcement about the funds despite the deadline passing this week. Andrew Jacobson, general counsel at Halliday, explained that the SEC has been operating at reduced capacity ever since the U.S. Federal Government shutdown on October 1. The former global head of legal at 21Shares also believes that ETF approvals have been paused for the time being, but he expects a flurry of approvals once the shutdown ends. Jacobson explained that fall is often the hottest season for ETFs, so things might move fast once the government is back up and running. According to the odds on the crypto betting platform Polymarket, bettors don’t expect the shutdown to end this month. Bettors on Polymarket give a 7% chance that the shutdown will end by October 31. Cryptopolitan reported on Monday that Kevin Hassett, Director of the U.S. National Economic Council, stated that the shutdown could end this week. He revealed that the U.S. Senate was planning to hold its 11th vote to fund the government and end the shutdown. The crypto market is still expecting a Cardano ETF this year, with Polymarket users pegging the odds of a Cardano ETF happening in 2025 at 77%. Cardano and other altcoin ETFs gained interest among the crypto community in September after the SEC significantly revamped its approval rules for crypto ETFs. The initiative reduced the approval threshold for spot crypto ETF approvals to 75 days from the usual 240 days. The SEC also streamlined and simplified the path forward for crypto ETFs, provided that the underlying digital assets already trade futures on regulated U.S. exchanges. The changes prompted Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart to predict the approval of over 100 crypto ETFs in the next six to 12 months.

Data shared by crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) shows that XRP’s holder net position change fell from -18.5 million to -59.5 million XRP in just 4 days. The move represents a 220% increase in outflows, marking one of the steepest short-term declines in recent weeks. The accompanying chart tracks the daily net position change among XRP holders over 2 weeks. Early in the period, data reflected steady accumulation, with multiple green bars showing over 100 million XRP inflows. However, this pattern reversed sharply, and the final bars on the chart turned red, indicating sizable net selling by existing holders. The last data point on October 21 recorded the largest outflow, with nearly 60 million XRP leaving long-term wallets as the price hovered around $2.43. Although the chart presents a clear exit pattern from long-term investors, it also provides useful insight into potential phases of consolidation that often accompany such transitions. BREAKING: LONG-TERM $XRP HOLDERS ARE CASHING OUT. NET POSITION CHANGE DROPPED FROM –18.5M TO –59.5M XRP IN JUST FOUR DAYS — A 220% INCREASE IN OUTFLOWS. pic.twitter.com/n1blX0JKWD — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 23, 2025 Short-Term Pressure, Long-Term Opportunity Despite the intensity of recent selling , the data may not solely signal weakness. Similar shifts have historically followed major rallies or preceded fresh accumulation cycles. Holder position changes of this magnitude often occur when traders rebalance portfolios after significant price movements or in anticipation of volatility. While the drop in net positions highlights temporary pressure, XRP’s underlying market structure remains relatively firm. The price holding above the $2.4 level even amid the sell-off indicates that short-term exits have not translated into a broad loss of confidence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical patterns also suggest the market could absorb current selling without severe disruption. Notable pullbacks in XRP’s history have tended to resolve into renewed buying interest once distribution phases subside. If this behavior repeats, the ongoing reduction in long-term holdings may clear the path for stronger hands to reenter the market at adjusted levels. Market Outlook as XRP Holds Key Levels The next several trading sessions will likely determine whether XRP stabilizes above $2.40 or revisits earlier support zones. A sustained recovery in holder positions could serve as an early indicator of renewed investor confidence. Steph’s chart highlights an important transition point. As sentiment oscillates, XRP’s resilience near the current range may reflect quiet accumulation under the surface. If that pattern holds, the latest outflows could ultimately precede a stronger base for the next upward phase .

The project’s price has been revised upward to about $300 million, and the administration says no taxpayer funds will be used. Private Money Funds Massive Ballroom Reports have listed a long roster of backers from several industries who are funneling money through a nonprofit charity. The Trust for the National Mall is being used as the conduit, and White House officials and outside reporting say donations will cover construction costs rather than federal appropriations. The Trust has longstanding ties to park projects, but critics have flagged the scale and speed of this fundraising drive. Major corporate names appear on the donor list. Based on reports, tech firms including Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta Platforms and Microsoft are among the contributors. Crypto companies such as Coinbase, Ripple and Tether are also listed, alongside tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American, and defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin. “I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom… The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly.” – President Trump pic.twitter.com/GibeLevvFP — The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 20, 2025 The list also includes wealthy individuals and some political allies. Exact donation amounts for most contributors remain undisclosed. Donor Roles Include Tech, Crypto And Tobacco Officials have said the ballroom will provide space for large events, with one estimate noting it could hold up to around a thousand guests. The East Wing demolition work has already moved forward while fundraising continues. That demolition and the project’s quick pace have raised questions from preservation groups and some federal overseers about whether required approvals were fully in place before work began. Based on watchdog reporting, the nonprofit handling donations may charge fees for administering gifts. One public interest group reported that the Trust would take about a 2.5% cut on donations, a figure that could translate into millions in fees as money flows in. Critics say the fee arrangement and the absence of full disclosure on donor sums make it hard to assess who might gain influence from their contributions. Transparency Questions And Recognition Reports show donors may receive forms of recognition tied to the project, and draft pledge documents discussed publicly mention options such as having names associated with the ballroom. That detail has fed concerns from lawmakers and watchdogs about whether private funding will create expectations of access or favors. At least some members of Congress have asked for more information and for clearer accounting of how gifts are handled.

According to executive remarks, the deal makes Ripple the first crypto company to own and run a global, multi-asset prime broker. Related Reading: 16,000 Ancient Bitcoins Just Moved—And It’s Costing Whales Billions Ripple President Monica Long said on X that the “future ahead is mighty bright,” and reports show the company is already moving to use XRP in new ways inside the prime brokerage business. Ripple Completes Hidden Road Deal Based on reports, Ripple Prime began life on Hidden Road’s backbone, a platform known for fast growth among non-bank prime brokers. Since Ripple announced the acquisition in April, business at the unit has tripled in size. Ripple Prime will offer services such as clearing, financing, and prime brokerage across asset classes, including FX, derivatives, swaps, and digital assets. Hidden Road’s founder, Marc Asch, will remain involved and work with CEO Brad Garlinghouse and other leaders as integration continues. The opportunities now available to Ripple Prime (fka Hidden Road) are expansive. With $RLUSD already being used as collateral for a number of prime brokerage products, and Ripple Prime looking at a variety of ways to utilize XRP, the future ahead is mighty bright. https://t.co/YFSUQlyeOO — Monica Long (@MonicaLongSF) October 24, 2025 RLUSD Gains Institutional Footing RLUSD, Ripple’s institutional stablecoin, is already being used as collateral across several prime brokerage products. According to company statements, some derivatives clients have chosen to hold balances in RLUSD rather than other currencies. Reports also note that BNY Mellon acts as the primary reserve custodian for RLUSD. Blockchain analytics firm Bluechip gave RLUSD an A rating for stability, governance, and asset backing, a ranking Ripple cites as evidence of institutional trust. Ripple’s Acquisition Push Strengthens Infrastructure Ripple has completed five major acquisitions in roughly two years, adding Metaco, Standard Custody, Rail, and GTreasury to its growing list of companies now working under its umbrella. The moves aim to expand custody, payments, liquidity, and treasury capabilities. Based on company comments, Ripple sees these buys as steps toward offering institutions a broader set of services tied to digital assets and traditional markets.

Reports show Ripple Prime’s expansion and RLUSD’s institutional traction could make XRP more useful to banks and asset managers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has repeatedly emphasized the company’s commitment to XRP, and Ripple’s latest steps put the token inside a wider set of services aimed at professional users. XRP Price Update Analysts and market watchers will be watching how quickly institutions adopt these new tools and whether XRP finds a steady, functional place in that ecosystem. XRP has been moving quietly within a tight range lately, holding between $2.30 and $2.50. The broader crypto market has stayed calm, and the token continues to trade comfortably above $2.20, showing resilience despite muted activity. According to crypto analysts, XRP’s quiet phase might not last long, pointing to a potential setup for a massive rally that could lift the coin far beyond its current zone — possibly reaching above $27 in the long run.

The effects of the recent major liquidation due to global trade tensions have faded and the market is poised for recovery, according to Tom Lee. Lee believes a crypto rally will occur towards the end of the year. The main reasons for this optimism are as follows: Technical Indicators: Open interest levels for both Ethereum and Bitcoin have fallen to “record lows,” but technical indicators are starting to “turn positive.” Institutional Support: He said that JPMorgan's statement that it was open to the idea of using cryptocurrencies as collateral was a positive catalyst. Crisis Resilience: Lee argued that even during the recent massive deleveraging event, which was “many times larger than what happened during FTX,” Bitcoin only fell 3-4%, proving it to be a “pretty good store of value.” Ethereum Fundamentals: He said that fundamental activity on Ethereum (especially from the L1 and L2 space and stablecoins) has increased significantly, but that this has not yet been reflected in the price and that there should be a “fairly large movement” towards the end of the year. Related News: U.S. Inflation Data, Published Uninterrupted for 100 Years, May Not Be Released Next Month Lee also reminded that cryptocurrencies tend to be an early indicator of overall market liquidity and the direction of stocks, adding that the current crypto movements are “sending a pretty bullish signal” to the market. *This is not investment advice.

XRP, in particular, has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. Traders are torn between optimism and caution as seasoned analysts issue warnings that the euphoric phase may soon give way to a brutal correction. One voice resonating strongly amid the noise is that of JD, a respected market analyst whose previous predictions about XRP’s price movements have proven remarkably accurate. His latest post on X has captured widespread attention, urging traders to prepare for what he describes as an imminent and potentially “biblical” top. JD’s Growing Reputation Among XRP Analysts JD’s credibility within the XRP community stems from his consistent record of calling market swings with precision. Earlier this year, his warnings of an impending drop in XRP materialized when the token plunged sharply after a period of overextension, validating his technical outlook at the time. Top is coming VERY soon (it's going to be BIBLICAL ) … Make sure you have a Take Profit strategy Or be my EXIT LIQUIDITY that will retire my whole family bloodline when Smart Money does the HISTORICAL RUG PULL that will CRASH the entire market! … — JD (@jaydee_757) October 24, 2025 That successful call cemented JD’s status as a trusted voice in crypto circles, particularly among XRP traders who rely on detailed chart analysis and smart money behavior patterns to anticipate turning points. Now, JD has issued another statement that carries the same intensity and conviction. While he stops short of naming a precise price level or date, his message implies that XRP and the broader market could soon experience an inflection point that separates disciplined traders from speculative dreamers. Risk Management and Profit Discipline Although wrapped in vivid language, JD’s post carries a serious undertone, a call for traders to have a clear take-profit strategy . His use of the term “smart money” points to the market’s cyclical nature, where institutional players often offload positions at euphoric highs, leaving retail traders holding depreciating assets after the reversal. This isn’t merely a forecast; it’s a behavioral insight. JD’s warning underscores that while optimism fuels rallies, a lack of preparation fuels losses. Traders who fail to define their exit points risk becoming what he describes as “exit liquidity,” providing the liquidity needed for larger players to lock in profits before the downturn. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Understanding the Technical Backdrop Recent XRP price data shows why JD’s caution resonates. Following its multi-month rally past $2.40, XRP entered a volatile consolidation phase amid declining volume, a pattern often preceding a decisive breakout or collapse. Analysts monitoring the XRP/USD pair note similarities to previous macro tops, where distribution phases emerged quietly before sharp corrections. JD’s post aligns with this technical framework, suggesting that the market’s exuberance may be nearing exhaustion. His emphasis on timing and caution reflects broader concerns that the current rally, while powerful, could soon give way to a liquidity-driven retracement. A Final Word: Preparation Over Prediction JD’s statement is not a proclamation of doom but a disciplined reminder of trading fundamentals. Markets reward those who plan, not those who react. Whether or not a “historical rug pull” unfolds, the core lesson remains timeless: profits are only real when they are secured. As traders debate the next big move, JD’s warning serves as a timely reminder that even in bullish times, caution remains the smartest strategy. The market’s top may not be predictable, but preparedness, as JD insists, is non-negotiable. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

That’s the take from Charlene Barshefsky, former U.S. Trade Representative under Bill Clinton, who told the Bund Summit in Shanghai on Saturday that a temporary fix is all the world should expect right now. “A US-China deal, whatever it is,” she said, “will be at best setting a tactical floor for the moment.” She added bluntly, “Strategically, it will not impact, I don’t believe, either the direction that China is going in or the direction the US is going in.” Barshefsky, who led China’s entry into the World Trade Organization over two decades ago, said she no longer sees a united global trading system. Instead, she expects the world to divide into three major economic blocs: the U.S. and its allies, China alongside the Global South, Russia, and possibly the Middle East, and a third cluster of non-aligned economies like India. The fragmentation, she warned, won’t be undone by any handshake deal between Washington and Beijing. Officials hold new talks but deepen mistrust Talks resumed Saturday in Kuala Lumpur, where top U.S. and Chinese economic officials began another round of negotiations . A U.S. Treasury spokesperson allegedly described the discussions as “very constructive.” But behind that diplomat-speak is real anxiety: both sides are desperate to avoid a repeat of the tariff war that once pushed duties above 100% on some goods. A planned meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping next week is driving urgency. But the tone of the talks remains fragile. Back in May, Bessent and Greer met with He in Geneva to set up a 90-day tariff truce, lowering duties to about 55% on U.S. goods and 30% on Chinese exports, which also allowed magnet trade to resume. That pause was extended in London and Stockholm, but it’s now running out; the clock hits zero on November 10. Things got worse at the end of September. That’s when the U.S. Commerce Department added a massive batch of Chinese firms to its export blacklist, targeting any company over 50% owned by blacklisted entities. This new rule instantly cut off U.S. exports to thousands of Chinese companies. China hits back with rare earth curbs and defends its position China retaliated on October 10 by tightening its rare earth export controls , aiming to stop their use in foreign military systems. That response triggered harsh reactions from U.S. negotiators. Bessent and Greer called it a “global supply chain power grab” and promised the U.S. and its allies would fight back. Now, Reuters reports that the Trump administration may hit back with restrictions on a massive list of software-driven U.S. exports to China, including laptops, smartphones, and even jet engines. On top of that, Washington just opened a new tariff probe into China’s failure to meet its obligations under the 2020 “Phase One” trade deal that paused the original trade war during Trump’s first term. The tensions were also visible at the Bund Summit, where multiple speakers took swipes at both sides. Some demanded that China scale back its export-driven economy to reduce its ballooning trade surplus. One of them, Yu Yongding, a former adviser to China’s central bank, pushed back hard. He said the U.S. should “take responsibility” for failing to spread globalization’s gains across its own population, instead of blaming China. Yu also argued that China has been shifting its growth model toward domestic demand, and he stood firm on the rare earth restrictions, calling them a direct answer to U.S. sanctions. When asked whether the move could damage Europe, Yu said it wasn’t aimed at them and suggested there could be a technical fix to minimize any collateral damage.

That loss didn’t show up as one clean figure, but came from multiple line items, including platform changes, restructuring, and rising tariffs. The numbers were buried in its nine-month results, where the damage spread wide. Sales revenue for the first three quarters came in at €26.86 billion ($31.22 billion), which is 6% lower than last year. Operating profit cratered to just €40 million ($46.5 million), a 99% collapse from last year. That meant return on sales (ROS), a key profitability gauge, dropped from 14.1% to a near-zero 0.2%. “This result fell clearly short of our expectations,” said finance chief Dr. Jochen Breckner during the earnings presentation. Porsche slashes full-year forecast and margins Porsche cut its full-year sales forecast, now expecting €37 to €38 billion, down from €40.1 billion earlier. Breckner said the company is now aiming for a return on sales between 0% and 2%, slashed from a previous 5%. Automotive EBITDA margin guidance also dropped, now expected between 10.5% to 12.5%, down from the prior 14.5% to 16.5%. The biggest impact came from changes in the company’s vehicle strategy . Last month, Porsche confirmed it’s extending internal combustion engine production for its Panamera and Cayenne models well into the 2030s. It’s also shifting powertrain plans for an upcoming three-row SUV. Those decisions come at a price. The company expects the combined hit from lineup changes and other costs to total €3.2 billion ($3.72 billion) this year. Out of that, €1.8 billion ($2.09 billion) is tied to the rework of its new EV platform. Tariffs added more pain. Porsche revealed it had already absorbed €500 million ($581.3 million) in tariff-related costs through Q3. That number could rise to €700 million ($813.67 million) by the end of the year, according to Breckner. This follows a 15% tariff deal signed by the EU earlier this summer. The new rate began applying to exports starting August 1, and it hit Porsche’s margins hard. North America slows, China cuts deepen, leadership changes loom North American sales also dipped, but the company blamed it on lower imports after the summer break and bloated inventories from late Q2. Meanwhile, in China, the situation looks worse. Porsche described market conditions there as “challenging,” pointing to tighter luxury demand and heavier pricing pressure. The company is responding by trimming dealerships, staff, and stakeholder costs to stop the bleeding. Leadership changes are also on the way. CEO Oliver Blume, who currently holds the top seat at both Volkswagen and Porsche, will step down as Porsche CEO. Former McLaren boss Michael Leiters will take over starting January 1, 2026. As of now, Porsche’s stock is down nearly 20% year-to-date. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?
