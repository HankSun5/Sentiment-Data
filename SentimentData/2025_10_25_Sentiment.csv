This is the second time SpaceX has moved its Bitcoin holdings within a week. Just a few days earlier, the company transferred $268 million worth of BTC into new wallets.

SpaceX, along with Tesla , started accumulating Bitcoin in 2020-2021. A year later, Elon Musk began advocating cryptocurrencies. That was during the previous crypto bull run. The entrepreneur consistently endorsed Dogecoin and Bitcoin. Around that time, Tesla announced it would begin accepting Bitcoin as payment from electric vehicle buyers. But after about three to four months, Tesla scrapped those plans due to Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact. Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. But the EV maker later sold a major portion of its BTC holdings. It originally held around 48,000 BTC and sold 75% of its position in 2022. Tesla missed out on billions of dollars by selling BTC early. As of today, Tesla holds 11,509 BTC, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. SpaceX , on the other hand, has not made any major Bitcoin purchases or sales since 2022. The company has not officially disclosed its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. In other related news, the US government has moved a bunch of coins seized from Alameda Research over 2 years ago. It moved $1 worth of Viberate token, $36 of OCEAN tokens, and $60 of HOT tokens. Bitcoin is currently trading at $111,017, with a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion and a trading volume of $50 billion. Ether is standing at $3,940 and has been struggling to break over the $4,000 barrier over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s dominance is standing strong at 57.7%, while Ethereum has a 12.4% share of the crypto market. The overall market sentiment is labeled fear-based on the Crypto Fear and Greed Index. The crypto market is still trying to recover after the recent market crash due to Trump’s tariff hit on China, which caused massive liquidations across exchanges.

As the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting approaches, traders have turned cautious, awaiting signs of potential monetary easing that could rekindle investor appetite for risk assets. Despite short-term volatility, seasoned analysts interpret the recent downturn as a constructive correction, noting that steep pullbacks often flush out speculative leverage and pave the way for more sustainable long-term growth. Solana (SOL): Claude Forecasts a Challenge to ATH Firstly, Solana ($SOL) continues to establish itself as a leading smart contract platform, commanding a market cap exceeding $104 billion and around $11.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) within its DeFi ecosystem. Source: Microsoft Copilot Market speculation is building that U.S. regulators may approve a spot Solana ETF before month’s end, a decision that could spur significant institutional inflows, echoing the post-ETF surges seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana is also well-positioned to benefit from emerging trends such as real-world asset tokenization and the expansion of stablecoin infrastructure, both gaining institutional traction. With faster transaction speeds and lower fees than Ethereum, Solana remains one of the most promising candidates for large-scale adoption. After peaking at $250 in January and dipping to $100 in April, SOL now trades near $191, signaling renewed upside potential. With an RSI around 45 and trading just below its 30-day moving average, the token appears undervalued. Following a breakout from a bullish flag pattern, Claude estimates Solana could reach as high as $290 by month end, perhaps even beating its previous all-time high of $293.31 set back in January. XRP ($XRP): Claude Predicts a Potential Surge Toward $10 Claude AI’s data models suggest that Ripple’s native asset, XRP ($XRP) , could see a sharp rally, potentially climbing to between $5 and $10 by the close of the year, quadrupling its current price of about $2.49. Ripple’s decisive legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year concluded a five-year court battle, revitalizing investor confidence and propelling XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 on July 18. Over the past 12 months, XRP has soared 369%, far surpassing Bitcoin’s 63% and Ethereum’s 55% gains. Technical indicators highlight three notable bullish flag patterns in 2025, two of which appeared in the summer, often a precursor to significant upward movement. The sudden arrive of a string of high-profile spot XRP ETF approvals, improved regulatory clarity, or a surprise new business partnership on Ripple’s part may drive XRP over the $5 mark, with $10 representing an unlikely but plausible extreme bull case scenario. Binance Coin (BNB): Copilot AI Sees Expanding Dominance Originally launched as a utility token for Binance, Binance Coin ($BNB) has evolved into a versatile asset supporting a diverse ecosystem that includes NFTs, decentralized applications, and payment services. BNB’s deflationary mechanism, sustained through Binance’s periodic token burns, continues to bolster its long-term price stability by systematically reducing circulating supply. Beyond Binance’s own platforms, BNB’s utility has expanded globally, now accepted by merchants across various industries, from gaming to travel. This widespread adoption has firmly cemented BNB’s place among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Earlier this month, BNB broke out of a bullish pennant formation and hit an all-time high of $1,369.99 before retreating roughly 19%. With its RSI now hovering around 50, the token appears to be consolidating. Should bullish momentum resume, Copilot AI projects BNB could advance toward $1,600 by month-end, with a key support range between $580 and $1,000 if another correction unfolds. Missed Dogecoin? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI): The Next-Gen Meme Coin With Degen Energy Finally, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a fresh entrant in the meme coin sector, has launched its presale, already securing more than $3.7 million from investors eager to join the next viral crypto wave. Marketed as Dogecoin’s “high-octane cousin,” Maxi Doge channels the humor, energy, and community spirit of crypto’s degen culture, emphasizing engagement, viral memes, and grassroots participation. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI delivers faster, more efficient, and eco-friendly transactions compared to the dated tech of Dogecoin. Its marketing strategy leverages Telegram and Discord events, trading competitions, and influencer collaborations to build early momentum. Of the 150.24 billion total token supply, 25% is reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” supporting marketing, ecosystem development, and partnerships. Staking is already live, offering yields of up to 81%APY, a rate that will gradually decline as more participants stake their tokens. Currently, MAXI’s presale price sits at $0.0002645, with incremental increases tied to funding milestones. Purchases can be made using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Within mere days, prices tumbled sharply following President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, sparking a broad shift toward risk aversion ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting. Still, many market observers view the pullback as a natural correction, a period of consolidation purging excessive leverage and weaker positions before a more durable advance. Below are three altcoins that continue to show notable upside potential. Ripple (XRP): Poised to Dominate Global Payments in 2025 Ripple’s token, XRP ($XRP) , underpins a high-speed, low-cost payment protocol designed as a modern alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Backed by partnerships with the UN Capital Development Fund and several leading U.S. financial institutions, XRP has grown into the world’s fifth-largest digital asset, boasting a market capitalization of just over $149 billion. The company’s launch of its own stablecoin, RLUSD, signals an ambition to secure a significant share of the booming stablecoin sector. Over the past 12 months, XRP’s value has soared 369%, hitting a seven-year high of $3.65 in mid-July and far outpacing Bitcoin’s 63% gain during the same stretch. With a relative strength index (RSI) around 44 and trading below its 30-day moving average, XRP is likely trading at a discount and preparing for a festive breakout. Technical patterns show two bullish flag formations during the summer, suggesting room for further appreciation if ETF approvals arrive by mid-October. Passage of comprehensive U.S. crypto regulation could propel XRP toward the $5–$10 range. Zcash (ZEC): Privacy Coin Spikes 147% in a Single Week Launched in 2016 as a Bitcoin offshoot, Zcash ($ZEC) was created to prioritize one thing above all: user privacy. It utilizes zk-SNARKs (“zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge”), an advanced cryptographic method allowing transactions to be validated without revealing sender, recipient, or transaction details. Zcash employs a dual-address structure, giving users the choice between fully transparent and shielded transactions, a balance between privacy and regulatory compliance. In the past week, ZEC has jumped 19% to $255, outperforming every top 100 crypto. While most leading tokens declined, fellow privacy crypto Monero ($XMR) also rose sharply, adding 15% to its price. ZEC’s RSI currently sits near 63 and is downtrending as traders secure profits from the last week. If momentum persists and fundamentals strengthen, prices could hit $500 by year’s end. Story ($IP): Redefining the Creator Economy On Chain. Story ($IP) hopes to blaze a trail in the industry’s nascent intellectual property sector. Positioned as the world’s first Layer-1 blockchain built specifically for IP creation and monetization, Story enables creators, brands, and developers to transform ideas into tokenized assets with real, on-chain ownership. Story is unique for its end-to-end ecosystem: from minting and licensing creative works to building entire franchises that thrive within its decentralized network. As Web3 expands beyond finance into entertainment and culture, Story is a project that provides a new crossroads for art, technology, and ownership to realise the true extent of blockchain’s potential. With its token, $IP, powering governance, staking, and creative economies, early adopters see it as the next big narrative in crypto. Story rose 4% in the last 24 hours, and with a low RSI of 38, positive market momentum gives it plenty of headroom to lock in more aggressive profits quickly. That said, from its current price of $5.41, there will be sticky resistance around $10 and $1,5 but if it clears this and the market enters a bull cycle, Story can manage an easy 10x by the end of the year. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The Meme-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 Presale of 2025 Finally, a rising star in the crypto scene, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , is among 2025’s most talked-about presales. It combines Bitcoin’s renowned security with Layer-2 scalability and the viral excitement of meme culture. HYPER enhances Bitcoin’s network with faster transaction speeds, decentralized DAO-based governance, and expanded smart contract capabilities through a dedicated Layer-2 framework. The project has already attracted more than $24.7 million in presale funding, and analysts predict post-launch gains that could exceed 10x. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), the HYPER ecosystem includes a lightning-fast Canonical Bridge for BTC transfers, decentralized app (dApp) integration, and built-in meme coin functionality. An independent Coinsult audit reported zero vulnerabilities, reinforcing investor confidence. HYPER tokens fuel every part of the ecosystem, from governance and staking to transaction fees, with staking rewards currently offering up to 48% APY for early participants.

Some analysts suggest that ETF inflows have aided in cooling sentiment, and institutional investors are buying again. The question now is whether Ethereum can continue moving above $3850 and extend its recovery. With the focus shifting from Ethereum, HYPE, and DOT are currently some of the best altcoins to buy right now . Both projects continue to draw in investors because of strong network activity and growing developer ecosystems. Joining the list is MAGACOIN FINANCE , noted by analysts for its utility-oriented model and active community development, both elements that have solidified its position at the base of the pyramid. Ethereum Holds Above $3,850 as ETF Inflows Support Sentiment Ethereum is still trading close to $3,836, after a subsequent recovery from volatility last week. Resurgent ETF flows provide a positive sign for bulls, but traders are cautious about macro uncertainty. According to analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum ETFs saw $141.7 million in inflows on October 21, with BlackRock and Fidelity making up over $101 million of the total. It was the largest daily flow since early October and was a much-needed sentiment booster after a few sessions of volatile demand. Source: X Even with greater inflows, ETH is still below its 50-day EMA at $3,968 and the 100-day EMA at $4,063. Analysts say that to confirm institutional support has stepped in, prices have to remain close to these levels for sustained periods. HYPE and DOT Lead Analyst Rankings Among the Best Altcoins to Buy Hyperliquid (HYPE) continued to experience significant volatility in recent sessions as the overall altcoin market adjusts. Despite the volatility over the short term, analysts continue to rank Hype as one of the best altcoins to buy now, due to its large investors renewing their accumulation. CryptoQuant data indicates a bullish turn on HYPE, with whales adding to long positions, positioning themselves ahead of a potential recovery. Analysts view this as an indication of confidence in the project’s structure and rebound potential following an improvement in market liquidity. At the same time, Polkadot (DOT) is also improving its network fundamentals. Crypto.com’s addition of USDT and USDC transfers through Polkadot’s Asset Hub has opened up access and liquidity opportunities for users. This advancement ensures that DOT continues its current trend of playing a major role in cross-chain interoperability while establishing itself as one of the most useful utility-driven altcoins within analyst rankings. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Attention for Utility and Community Growth Additionally, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also making a name for itself in its emphasis on utility and community. Analysts point out that the project’s utilization of its native crypto token in decentralized applications is a looming force. Besides utility, the project has had a very active community to ensure its growth in each phase of development of the project. Regular updates, clear communication, and regular involvement have helped foster long-term engagement among holders. This practical utility and community have placed MAGACOIN FINANCE side by side with other major altcoins like HYPE and DOT. Analysts believe that it is among the best altcoins to buy for investors, considering projects that have tangible and user-driven ecosystems. Conclusion Ethereum’s consistent trading above $3,850 reflects the impact of institutional inflows and renewed investor participation. Traders note this stability could provide a platform for market confidence if ETF demand continues to increase. The strength of the asset’s resilience sends a message to investors that they still see it as a crucial anchor to hold on to whenever there are waves in the markets.

The entire crypto market has been relatively steady, and XRP has managed to maintain its footing above $2.20. Despite the slow momentum, a technical analysis shared by the crypto analyst known as ChartNerd on X suggests that XRP could be preparing for a massive breakout that could take it from current levels toward a long-term target above $27. The analysis is supported by a chart showing multiple confluences aligning in favor of such a large-scale move. XRP Technical Analysis Points To Rally According to ChartNerd’s chart, XRP has now completed a symmetrical triangle breakout pattern that has been forming for several years. This breakout is occurring above a multi-year ascending support line that dates back to 2017. The chart also shows an important resistance block that previously capped XRP’s price during earlier bull runs in 2017 and 2021. Related Reading: XRP Price Teleport To $6: What Happens When The Euphoric Phase Begin XRP broke above this resistance block months ago, but recently retested it during last week’s flash crash. Its rebound from this resistance block reinforces the idea that XRP is about to bounce massively. The breakout from this long-term consolidation zone, combined with the multi-year ascending trendline, provides the technical foundation for a potential move toward much higher price targets. Another important confirmation that occurred during the flash crash was the successful retest of the 3-month 10 EMA. This retest serves as a validation point for the recent breakout, showing that XRP is maintaining its structure on higher timeframes. Furthermore, the analysis shows that XRP has reclaimed the Gaussian Channel upper regression line, which represents long-term trend momentum. This alignment of the EMA retest with the Gaussian Channel suggests strong bullish momentum is beginning to build. ChartNerd refers to this convergence of multiple indicators as a “confluence zone.” Fibonacci Extension Targets From $8 To $27 The analysis concludes with a clearly defined Fibonacci extension roadmap that outlines XRP’s next price objectives. ChartNerd’s Fibonacci levels place the first major target at $8.47, corresponding to the 1.272 extension, followed by $13.78 at the 1.414 level, and finally the 1.618 extension at $27.70. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors That A Supply Squeeze Is Coming And What It Means For Price This sequence implies a full technical replication of XRP’s bull run in 2017, scaled to its current breakout structure. Back then, XRP hit all three Fibonacci extensions from the previous low after breaking above a similar resistance block. If these projections materialize, XRP could experience its most significant rally in years. The move toward $27 could unfold in one of two ways: either through a strong, near-vertical surge similar to the explosive rally of 2017 or through a series of measured advances highlighted by corrections at each resistance level. Nonetheless, both scenarios have the same bullish structure. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.44, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

Ancient Bitcoin Whale Has Broken A 14.3 Years Long Silence According to data from cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert , a dormant wallet with a massive amount of Bitcoin has just woken up. The address in question contained 4,000 BTC before its transaction on Friday. Blockchain history shows this wallet collected the 4,000 BTC through mining rewards in 2011, implying the owner was an early miner. Back then, the block subsidy (the reward miners get for adding a new block to the chain) was worth 50 BTC, so it took the miner 80 blocks to assemble the stack. Today, after four Halving events, the block subsidy has dropped to 3.125 BTC, so a miner could need to mine 1,280 blocks to procure the same amount (though, in practice, it would take fewer blocks due to transaction fees also playing a role now). When the miner received the tokens about 14 years ago, they were worth just $67,724. The same stack is today worth more than $440 million, meaning that the whale was sitting on a profit of a whopping 650,000% when they reactivated the wallet. The dormancy-breaking Bitcoin transaction involved a sum of 150 BTC ($16.6 million at transfer time), as the details below from Whale Alert show. It’s possible that the move may have been to realize some of the profit that the Bitcoin wallet has accumulated over its long life. So far, this 150 BTC transaction is the only withdrawal that the whale has made, so it remains to be seen whether more transfers will follow. As for who’s behind the transaction, it’s hard to say anything for sure. Usually, wallets that grow this old without spending do so by becoming lost. That is, by having their existence forgotten or keys misplaced. It could be that the original owner rediscovered the wallet, or someone else obtained its keys, whether by chance or by taking advantage of a vulnerability that the wallet software from that era could possess. Or, in a more unlikely scenario, the miner behind the address could just be a hardcore HODLer . Speaking of transactions involving dormant coins, this year has seen a record-breaking number of them, as an analyst noted in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post . “In 2025, Bitcoin movements of coins dormant for 7+ years have already exceeded 2024 levels, and there are still two months left,” noted the quant. So far, 2025 has seen 270,000 BTC move after being inactive for more than seven years, so by year’s end, the record could grow to 300,000 BTC.

Over 1 million SOL tokens, valued at a staggering $213 million, have been moved from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a whale-sized move that has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike, sparking numerous questions about its potential impact on the Solana ecosystem and the broader crypto market. What Exactly Happened with This SOL Transfer? Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracking service, first reported this massive SOL transfer . Specifically, 1,097,732 SOL tokens departed from Coinbase Institutional. This entity typically serves large corporations and high-net-worth individuals, providing secure crypto services. The transaction involved a substantial amount: nearly 1.1 million SOL. Its value stands at approximately $213 million, making it one of the largest single SOL transfers in recent times. The destination remains undisclosed, labeled simply as an “unknown wallet.” Such large movements often signal strategic shifts or significant market plays by major players, commonly referred to as “whales.” Therefore, understanding the context of this SOL transfer is crucial for anyone monitoring the crypto landscape. Why Does a Large SOL Transfer Matter to the Market? When a substantial amount of any cryptocurrency, especially one with a significant market cap like Solana (SOL), moves from an institutional exchange to an unknown wallet, it inevitably creates ripples. This particular SOL transfer carries several implications: Firstly, it could indicate a potential sale. If the tokens are being moved to a personal wallet to be held, that’s one scenario. However, if they are being prepared for over-the-counter (OTC) deals or a future dump on exchanges, it could exert downward pressure on SOL’s price. Consequently, traders are watching closely for subsequent movements from the unknown wallet. Secondly, it highlights the increasing involvement of institutional money in the crypto space. Coinbase Institutional facilitates these large-scale transactions, suggesting that significant capital is actively flowing in and out of digital assets. This institutional activity can often lend legitimacy and stability to the market, but also introduces new dynamics. Who Could Be Behind This Mysterious SOL Transfer? The identity of the whale behind this particular SOL transfer remains a mystery, fueling speculation across the crypto community. Several possibilities exist: An institutional investor: A hedge fund, a venture capital firm, or even a corporate treasury could be rebalancing its portfolio or making a strategic investment. A large individual investor: A high-net-worth individual, perhaps an early adopter or a tech mogul, might be consolidating assets or preparing for a private sale. An exchange moving funds: Although less likely from an “institutional” arm to an “unknown” wallet, sometimes exchanges move funds for operational purposes. However, the scale suggests a more deliberate action. Understanding the “who” behind such a significant SOL transfer would provide invaluable insight into market sentiment and future trends for Solana. What Are the Potential Impacts on Solana and Beyond? The immediate impact of this SOL transfer is primarily felt in market sentiment. News of large whale movements can trigger anxiety among retail investors, leading to increased volatility. If the tokens were to be sold, a sudden influx of supply could drive prices down. Moreover, this event underscores the opaque nature of some aspects of the crypto market. While blockchain provides transparency in transactions, the identities behind the wallets often remain anonymous. This anonymity is a double-edged sword, offering privacy but also making it challenging to interpret the intentions behind such colossal moves. Looking ahead, the market will be keenly observing the destination wallet. Any further movements, especially to known exchange wallets, would be critical indicators of the whale’s intentions. This SOL transfer serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. In conclusion, the $213 million SOL transfer from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet is more than just a large transaction; it’s a pivotal moment that prompts crucial questions about institutional involvement, market dynamics, and the future trajectory of Solana. As the crypto space continues to mature, these whale movements will remain a fascinating and influential aspect of its evolution. Staying informed about such significant events is paramount for navigating the ever-changing tides of digital assets.

The company said in its third-quarter earnings that “if control of Nexperia cannot be restored before the end of 2025, the company may face temporary downward pressure on revenue, profit and cash flow.” This warning came alongside stronger-than-expected quarterly results, with semiconductor revenue up 12.2% compared to the same period last year. Wingtech, headquartered in Jiaxing, said demand across its semiconductor lines remained strong during the quarter, but acknowledged that the ongoing political conflict with the Netherlands makes future growth hard to predict. The company admitted that the Nexperia situation is now a major uncertainty for its chip business, both financially and operationally. Dutch seizure of Nexperia follows U.S. pressure The Dutch state moved to seize Nexperia in September, after pushback from the United States over concerns that the chipmaker might not be acting independently of its Chinese parent. Washington reportedly told Nexperia it would need to fire its Chinese CEO to avoid getting added to the U.S. sanctions list. Wingtech, led by Chairman Zhang Xuezheng, was already added to the U.S. Entity List in 2024, a move that restricts American firms from doing business with it. The decision to take over Nexperia shocked the global auto industry. The company is a key supplier of semiconductors used in vehicles built by Volkswagen and other manufacturers. A Bloomberg report cited unnamed auto executives warning that chip shortages could start disrupting supply chains within a week. They estimated that the impact would ripple through the entire sector in less than three weeks if the standoff continues. China’s Commerce Minister called the Dutch action one that has “seriously affected” global supply chain stability.Dutch authorities responded by saying they’re staying in contact with Beijing to work “toward a constructive solution.”But behind the scenes, pressure is rising. The European Union’s trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said on Tuesday that both countries are “in frequent contact” and “fully aware the time is of the essence here.” He made the statement after a video call with his Chinese counterpart at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Nexperia raised red flags before the takeover European auto giants claim they were blindsided by the action against Nexperia, but legal filings show red flags were raised in late 2023. Executives at the company had contacted the Dutch economic ministry over fears that its ownership structure, being tied to Wingtech since 2019, could pose a regulatory risk. At that point, Dutch officials already considered Nexperia a Chinese-controlled entity. Multiple meetings took place between the Dutch government and Nexperia management. The two sides agreed on governance reforms, including the creation of a supervisory board. Nexperia also offered to add a Western minority shareholder to ease national security fears. Those talks were still in progress when the U.S. dropped its sanctions hammer on Wingtech, throwing a wrench in any possible compromise. Now, Wingtech is stuck in limbo. The company said it will keep pushing to restore full control of Nexperia, but admitted the situation could drag well into 2026. Despite having diversified chip products and strong quarterly demand, the fight over Nexperia’s future is overshadowing everything else. Meanwhile, China responded with new restrictions on the export of rare earths and other critical materials. When asked about it, Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson Wang Wentao said the move was a “normal” effort to tighten its export control system. He added that China is still allowing approvals for EU companies. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This isn’t just speculation; it’s a compelling estimate from financial giant JPMorgan, centered around the potential launch of a native Coinbase Base token for its Layer 2 network. This development could fundamentally reshape Coinbase’s financial landscape, creating entirely new revenue streams beyond its current reliance on USDC and on-chain transaction fees. What is the Value Proposition of a Coinbase Base Token? JPMorgan’s analysis, as reported by The Block, highlights a significant opportunity. By introducing a dedicated Coinbase Base token , the exchange could directly monetize the burgeoning success of its Layer 2 network, Base. This strategic move is seen as a powerful way to tap into the network’s rapid growth and cement Coinbase’s position in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. Currently, Coinbase generates revenue from various sources, including trading fees, subscription services, and its stake in USDC. However, a native token for Base would introduce a fresh, substantial income stream. Think of it as a direct stake in the prosperity of the Base network itself, allowing Coinbase to benefit directly from its adoption and utility. How Has Base Network Achieved Such Rapid Growth? The Base network, launched in August 2023, has quickly emerged as a formidable player in the Layer 2 space. Its impressive growth is underscored by its total value locked (TVL), which has now surpassed a remarkable $5 billion. This rapid ascent indicates strong developer and user adoption, proving the network’s utility and appeal. Layer 2 networks like Base are designed to scale blockchain transactions, making them faster and cheaper. By building on Ethereum, Base leverages its security while offering an enhanced user experience. This efficiency is a major draw for decentralized applications (dApps) and users alike, contributing to its substantial TVL and vibrant ecosystem. This strong foundation makes the idea of a Coinbase Base token even more compelling. Why is a Coinbase Base Token a Game Changer? Launching a Coinbase Base token would not only create new revenue but also deepen engagement within the Base ecosystem. Tokens often serve multiple purposes, such as governance, staking, or paying for network fees. By offering a native token, Coinbase could empower its community, giving users a direct stake in the network’s future and encouraging further participation. Consider these key benefits: Direct Monetization: A token provides a direct mechanism for Coinbase to capture value from Base’s growth, independent of broader market trends affecting trading volumes. Ecosystem Alignment: It aligns the incentives of users, developers, and Coinbase, fostering a more robust and collaborative environment. Increased Utility: The token could unlock new functionalities and services within the Base network, enhancing its overall value proposition. Competitive Advantage: In a crowded Layer 2 landscape, a well-executed token launch could differentiate Base and attract more projects and liquidity. What Are the Considerations for Launching a Coinbase Base Token? While the potential benefits are immense, launching a Coinbase Base token also involves careful consideration. Regulatory clarity, market sentiment, and the token’s economic design are crucial factors. A thoughtfully designed tokenomics model is essential to ensure long-term sustainability and value accrual. Coinbase, as a publicly traded company, operates under significant scrutiny. Any token launch would need to navigate complex legal and compliance frameworks. However, given Coinbase’s established reputation and expertise, they are well-positioned to address these challenges effectively. The move could solidify Coinbase’s role not just as an exchange, but as a pivotal infrastructure provider in the decentralized world. The Future is Bright for the Coinbase Base Token JPMorgan’s projection underscores the transformative potential of a Coinbase Base token . This isn’t merely about adding another cryptocurrency to the market; it’s about strategically leveraging a successful Layer 2 network to create substantial shareholder value and innovate within the crypto space. The financial world is watching keenly to see if Coinbase will seize this remarkable opportunity. The prospect of a native Base token signals a maturing market where infrastructure providers are finding novel ways to monetize their contributions. For users and investors, it could represent a new avenue for participation and growth within the Coinbase ecosystem. This strategic pivot could cement Coinbase’s legacy as a true pioneer, constantly evolving to meet the demands of a dynamic digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Base network? A1: Base is a Layer 2 network developed by Coinbase, built on Ethereum. It aims to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications, enhancing transaction speed and efficiency. Q2: Why is JPMorgan interested in a Coinbase Base token? A2: JPMorgan, a major financial institution, analyzes potential revenue streams and value creation in emerging markets. Their interest stems from the significant financial opportunity a native Coinbase Base token could present for Coinbase, potentially generating billions in new revenue. Q3: How would a Coinbase Base token generate value? A3: A native token could generate value through various mechanisms, including network fees, staking rewards, governance participation, and general utility within the Base ecosystem. It would provide Coinbase with a direct monetization strategy for its Layer 2 network’s success. Q4: What are the potential challenges of launching a Base token? A4: Key challenges include navigating complex regulatory landscapes, designing effective tokenomics for long-term sustainability, managing market sentiment, and ensuring the token’s utility aligns with the network’s goals. Coinbase’s compliance expertise would be crucial here. Q5: Has Coinbase confirmed plans for a Base token?

While she maintains a bearish stance in the short term, Lingrid also highlighted the exact price point that could invalidate this downward outlook and signal a potential rebound. Market Overview At the time of analysis, XRP was trading at approximately $2.44, marking a 14% decline for the month. The asset’s performance follows a brief recovery after the October 10 market-wide crash, which affected most major cryptocurrencies. Despite this rebound, XRP has struggled to establish a sustained uptrend, continuing to exhibit weakness relative to the broader digital asset market. Lingrid first presented her detailed outlook on October 18, when XRP hovered around $2.33. The token had shown minor intraday recovery at the time, but her technical review confirmed that XRP remained confined within a descending channel on the four-hour chart, a pattern that has persisted since late August. Bearish Continuation Toward $2.10 Lingrid’s chart identified a blue descending trendline cutting through the channel, effectively dividing it into two halves. This trendline has acted as a consistent resistance level, restricting any sustained move toward the channel’s upper boundary. In early October, XRP briefly broke above this internal resistance, climbing to $3.10 before meeting significant selling pressure. The resulting rejection pushed the price back within the channel’s confines. The decline intensified following the October 10 selloff, which forced XRP below $2.70. Attempts to recover, including a move toward $2.63 on October 13, were unsuccessful, as the token again failed to overcome the trendline resistance. Based on these repeated rejections, Lingrid stated that XRP continues to form lower highs and lower lows, a structure typically signaling an ongoing bearish phase. Should this pattern hold, she believes XRP could fall to around $2.10, marking the lower boundary of the descending channel. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Conditions for a Reversal Despite the prevailing downtrend, Lingrid outlined conditions that could invalidate her bearish projection. She indicated that a decisive break above $2.45 could trigger a trend reversal, with the potential for XRP to rise as high as $2.83 in the short term. More broadly, a close above the $2.50 level would signal renewed buying pressure and a shift toward bullish sentiment. The analyst also noted that external market factors could support a reversal. A potential pivot in Bitcoin’s market direction from bearish to bullish could lift XRP and other altcoins. Additionally, macroeconomic shifts could enhance liquidity conditions across the crypto market. Lingrid pointed to JPMorgan’s recent assessment that the U.S. Federal Reserve may soon conclude its quantitative tightening program, a move that could ease liquidity constraints and improve overall investor sentiment. Mixed Market Sentiment While Lingrid’s analysis emphasizes caution, other market observers remain more optimistic. Analyst EGRAG Crypto recently argued that XRP’s monthly chart still shows structural strength, with no confirmed breakdowns. Similarly, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator on the four-hour chart, suggesting a possible short-term rebound. For now, XRP’s next move will depend on whether it can hold above key technical levels and whether broader market dynamics turn more favorable. A break above $2.45 could offer the first sign that bullish momentum is returning to the asset. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

For the very first time, the total crypto M&A value from mergers and acquisitions involving digital asset firms soared past an astonishing $10 billion in the third quarter. This isn’t just a slight bump; it represents an increase of more than 30 times compared to the same period last year, as reported by crypto market insights platform Unfolded. This massive leap signals a new era of consolidation and strategic growth within the crypto industry. What’s Fueling the Surge in Crypto M&A Value? Many factors contribute to this unprecedented boom in crypto M&A value . The digital asset space is no longer just a playground for individual enthusiasts; it’s attracting serious institutional players and established companies looking to expand their footprint. Here are some key drivers behind this remarkable growth: Market Maturity: The cryptocurrency market is becoming more established and regulated, making it a more attractive environment for traditional finance and tech firms to invest and acquire. Strategic Positioning: Companies are actively seeking to acquire cutting-edge technology, expand their user base, or gain a competitive edge in specific niches like DeFi, NFTs, or Web3 infrastructure.

Benefits of Crypto Mergers and Acquisitions: Innovation Acceleration: Mergers can combine expertise and resources, leading to faster development of new products and services. Enhanced Market Stability: Consolidation can lead to larger, more stable entities, potentially reducing volatility and increasing investor confidence. Broader Reach: Acquired companies often bring existing user bases and brand recognition, expanding the reach of the acquiring firm. Regulatory Clarity: Larger, more established firms might have greater resources to navigate complex regulatory landscapes, potentially setting industry standards. Challenges to Navigate: Regulatory Uncertainties: The evolving nature of crypto regulations can complicate M&A deals, requiring careful legal navigation. Valuation Complexities: Valuing crypto companies, especially those with innovative but unproven business models, can be incredibly challenging. Integration Hurdles: Merging different technologies, company cultures, and operational processes can be a significant undertaking. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can impact deal terms and post-merger performance. What Does This Unprecedented Crypto M&A Value Mean for the Future? The record-breaking crypto M&A value in Q3 suggests a significant shift in the digital asset industry. We are likely to see a landscape dominated by fewer, but larger and more diversified players. This trend could lead to increased institutionalization, greater market efficiency, and potentially a more stable environment for both users and investors. For startups, this means increased opportunities for acquisition, but also heightened competition. For established firms, it emphasizes the need for continuous innovation and strategic partnerships to remain relevant. The industry is maturing, moving from a wild frontier to a more structured financial ecosystem. In conclusion, the astounding $10 billion milestone in Q3 crypto M&A value is more than just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of the cryptocurrency market’s rapid evolution. It highlights a clear trend towards consolidation, strategic growth, and institutional confidence. As the digital asset space continues to mature, we can expect M&A activities to play an even more crucial role in shaping its future, driving innovation, and defining the next generation of blockchain-powered services.

53599721,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87474,1761350405,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert To XRP Holders: I’ve Got Uncomfortable News For You,https://timestabloid.com/expert-to-xrp-holders-ive-got-uncomfortable-news-for-you/,"As market participants anticipate a potential surge in XRP’s value, several industry analysts have cautioned that offloading XRP during a major rally may prove more difficult than many investors expect. The concern centers on the likelihood of declining liquidity during rapid price movements, which could restrict sellers from executing large transactions at their desired prices. Limited Liquidity Could Hinder Profit-Taking Jake Claver, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Ascension Group, recently addressed this issue in a statement, emphasizing the need for investors to prepare for the operational realities of major market events. When we see some major price action come for XRP, I've got uncomfortable news for you….a lot of exchanges won't have the liquidity to let you exit at market value, and with the supply shock, institutional buyers dominate OTC and retail will get stuck fighting for exposure… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 3, 2025 According to Claver, when XRP begins to experience substantial upward momentum, many exchanges may struggle to maintain sufficient liquidity to handle the surge in sell orders. He explained that such a situation could create a temporary imbalance between buyers and sellers, with demand for liquidity far exceeding what exchanges can provide. This, he warned, would allow institutional investors, who often conduct over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, to dominate the market, while retail traders could find themselves unable to sell at optimal prices. Claver advised XRP holders to prepare in advance by securing their assets in private wallets, developing a clear tax strategy, and planning for long-term wealth management. He noted that investors who fail to make these preparations could miss out on opportunities to maximize their returns during a potential price breakout. Analysts Explain Why Selling at Target Prices May Be Unlikely Market commentator Diana echoed Claver’s position in a separate discussion, stressing that many XRP investors have unrealistic expectations about how liquidity functions during rapid rallies. She observed that a large number of holders intend to sell once XRP reaches specific price targets, such as $10 . However, if too many traders attempt to sell simultaneously, market depth can quickly thin out, resulting in significant price slippage. Diana explained that in such cases, a trader placing a sell order at $10 might only receive an execution price closer to $8.50 or lower, depending on market conditions and trade size. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This discrepancy can cause substantial losses within seconds during periods of high volatility. She noted that this phenomenon is not unique to XRP but tends to be more pronounced when market participation becomes heavily one-sided. Institutional Activity May Further Reduce Market Liquidity Diana also pointed out that institutional trading practices contribute to this challenge. While most retail participants rely on public exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken, major corporations and financial institutions typically transact through private OTC arrangements. These private trades, though essential for large-scale settlements, effectively draw liquidity away from public exchanges during critical market moments. Additionally, Diana highlighted Ripple’s recent acquisition of GTreasury as a factor that may further tighten XRP’s available liquidity. The $1 billion integration of GTreasury is expected to increase the use of XRP within institutional payment systems, reducing the volume of tokens circulating on traditional exchanges. While this development enhances XRP’s utility and strengthens its role in global payments, it could also limit retail investors’ ability to exit positions efficiently when prices rise sharply. Both Claver and Diana urged investors to prepare before any significant rally begins. Their recommendations include moving assets from centralized exchanges to private wallets, establishing pre-set sell targets, and using limit orders rather than market orders to mitigate potential slippage. Analysts agree that although optimism around XRP’s long-term prospects remains strong, traders must be proactive in managing liquidity risks. Without proper planning, retail investors could face significant challenges in realizing profits when market conditions become highly volatile.

53599695,613384,1761350421,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53599695.jpeg,Analyst Says Understanding This Bitcoin Structure Is Like Having A Superpower,https://bitcoinist.com/understanding-this-bitcoin-structure/,"Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has shared a confident view of Bitcoin’s current market setup, describing the ability to read high-timeframe (HTF) structures as a superpower. His comments came at a time when Bitcoin had experienced notable volatility, fluctuating between $106,000 and $111,000 in recent days. According to the analyst, those panicking over short-term dips are overlooking what is a very healthy long-term structure that still supports a bullish trajectory to new Bitcoin price highs. The Superpower Of Reading Market Structure CrediBULL Crypto explained that understanding HTF inflection points and market structures separates confident traders from those who react emotionally to every correction. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s current setup is still structurally bullish, and its broader uptrend is intact, even if the price were to dip below $100,000. This outlook is in response to many crypto traders who are starting to turn bearish due to Bitcoin’s lack of strong bullish momentum in recent weeks. In his view, many market participants rely too heavily on external factors such as macroeconomic data or political events instead of focusing on what the charts are showing. He noted that chart literacy gives traders the clarity to stay calm during uncertainty. “Our HTF trend is intact and very healthy at current levels,” he wrote, stating that this is visible to anyone who understands how to properly identify market structure. To him, this ability is like a superpower, one that allows traders to see beyond noise and panic, focusing instead on trend integrity and higher-timeframe setups. The Path To Higher Highs CrediBULL Crypto’s comments were an extension of another post where he drew comparisons between Bitcoin’s current market behavior and its structure when it was trading around $58,000 in 2024. Back then, the invalidation level was set at $38,000, and even though Bitcoin dipped briefly, it never broke below that level before rallying above $100,000. He noted that the $74,000 level now holds the same importance that $38,000 did then, serving as a crucial line that confirms the continuation of the macro uptrend. The analyst added that traders often misinterpret large invalidation ranges as weakness. However, he maintained that such levels are a normal part of high-timeframe analysis. Whether the gap between spot price and invalidation is 5% or 20%, the important thing is to stay consistent with the structure and not allow emotions to override logic. CrediBULL Crypto’s chart projection outlines a continuation of Bitcoin’s larger-impulse fifth Elliott Wave. This large impulse wave is subdivided into smaller subwaves. The first subwave has played out successfully with a $37,500 move. The model implies that Bitcoin’s price could climb significantly higher once the current consolidation forms a confirmed higher low. The analyst projected the larger-impulse fifth wave at a peak price target of $200,000 . He also marked $74,445 as the HTF invalidation zone, meaning any sustained move below that would negate the current bullish count. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,120, up by 1.5% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CrediBULL Crypto|High-TimeFrame|HTF,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 00:00:21

Despite the ongoing consolidation, one crucial support zone is beginning to show signs of strength, hinting that a potential reversal could be on the horizon if buyers step in at the right moment. Momentum Hinges On RSI and BTC Dominance Levels Umair Crypto, in his latest update on Dogecoin, noted that the meme coin is currently consolidating just beneath the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), forming what appears to be a clear bearish setup. According to Umair, the structure suggests that the price could soon face rejection from this critical moving average, a move that may trigger a decline toward the $0.15 region, or potentially even lower if selling pressure intensifies. Related Reading: Dogecoin Awaits Risk-On Ignition As 2021 Pattern Repeats Despite the bearish tone, Umair highlighted that the $0.15 zone remains a crucial area of interest for buyers. He explained that this region could act as a strong bounce zone if the expected rejection occurs, offering the bulls a chance to defend the key support and potentially ignite a recovery from oversold conditions. On a more optimistic note, Umair pointed out that a recovery above the daily RSI trendline could change the short-term outlook for DOGE and fuel a move above the 200-day SMA, opening the door for renewed bullish momentum. However, Umair maintained a cautious stance for now until there’s a confirmed decline in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) below 59%. This shift would likely mark the beginning of a more sustainable upward phase, including Dogecoin. Dogecoin Regains Stability After Recent Correction In a more recent market update, BitGuru highlighted that Dogecoin is starting to display early signs of a potential recovery following its recent correction phase. After facing sustained downward pressure, the popular meme coin seems to be regaining some stability as its price action begins to level out. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Eyes Major Breakout, Is A Rally To $0.7 All-Time Highs Possible? BitGuru pointed out that DOGE has managed to hold firmly near a key support level despite recent volatility. This steady price action near the base suggests that buyers are gradually stepping back in, showing confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. The chart structure is beginning to curve upward, which often precedes a breakout or a notable shift in market sentiment He further explained that if this early momentum continues to develop, Dogecoin could be preparing for a breakout toward the $0.22–$0.25 range. A successful move in that direction would mark a meaningful recovery from its previous decline and could spark renewed interest from traders.

This matters because Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) use CPI data to calculate how much interest investors are owed. Without those numbers, payments cannot be calculated normally. TIPS work by paying lower base interest than regular government bonds, while the principal amount adjusts with the CPI. The CPI data is used with a two-month delay, which is why the late release of September numbers has not yet triggered any backup rules. But if the October CPI is not published by the end of November, fallback procedures will start for the first time. Fallback procedures create uncertainty Jonathan Hill, head of US inflation strategy at Barclays Capital, said this situation is similar to past moments when the national debt limit created concern about delayed Treasury payments. Jonathan said, “I’ve been saying this is the debt-limit equivalent for the TIPS market, something we all need to pay attention to and hopefully doesn’t come to pass.” But if the October data is still missing by late November, the fallback will apply not only to TIPS, but also to inflation swaps, which are contracts where a floating rate is exchanged for a CPI-based payment. Even if the CPI numbers are eventually released, their accuracy may be questioned. The White House said the government funding lapse has prevented price survey teams from gathering data, which means the CPI may not truly reflect conditions, and that uncertainty alone will definitely cause volatility. Investor demand reacts to data quality concerns Interest-rate strategists at Morgan Stanley, led by Aryaman Singh and Matthew Hornbach, said there are “concerns over deteriorating CPI data quality” due to weaker data collection during the shutdown. The strategists think this may be reducing investor demand for the roughly $2 trillion TIPS market, and may also explain why some exchange-traded funds that hold TIPS have recently seen outflows, while regular Treasury bonds have performed better. Aryaman and Matthew wrote , “As the data quality of CPI deteriorates, the demand for TIPS decreases as investors believe that they aren’t getting hedged against true inflation.” They added that weaker data could force TIPS to require a higher term premium than normal Treasuries. TIPS have already underperformed regular Treasuries since mid-July. One contributing factor has been a drop in oil prices, which pushed gasoline to its lowest level since December. Since gasoline makes up around 3% of the CPI, lower fuel prices reduce demand for inflation protection. At the same time, larger TIPS exchange-traded funds have not yet seen significant shrinkage. Investors who rely on these products for liquidity are not expected to exit suddenly. Jonathan said the disruption does not represent a major threat to the market unless it becomes long-lasting.Gang Hu, managing partner at Winshore Capital Partners and a specialist in inflation products, agreed, saying that as long as the CPI remains free from political interference, the situation should remain manageable. Gang said, “I don’t think it moves the needle here.” He added that if political interference were to occur, “we might be dealing with bigger problems before we deal with ‘Do people buy TIPS?’” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",News|U.S Treasury,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-25 00:05:23

A new study has discovered that the technology tends to “sycophantically” affirm users’ actions and beliefs, even when they are harmful, socially inappropriate or misleading. The scientists have warned that this “social sycophancy” raises urgent concerns over the power of AI to distort users’ self-perception and make them less willing to resolve conflicts. Researchers call on AI chatbots developers to address the risk This comes as chatbots are increasingly being used as a source of advice on relationships and other personal issues. With this, the AI tech however could “reshape social interactions at scale” according to the researchers, calling on developers to address the risk. According a Guardian article , the study, which was led by a computer scientist at Stanford University, Myra Cheng warns that turning to AI for personal, emotional or rational advice poses some serious insidious risks. The researchers found that common chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama, and the Chinese DeepSeek endorsed user behavior 50% more often than human respondents in similar situations. “Our key concern is that if models are always affirming people, then this may distort people’s judgments of themselves, their relationships, and the world around them.” Cheng. “It can be hard to even realise that models are subtly, or not-so-subtly, reinforcing existing beliefs and assumptions,” added Cheng. According to the Guardian, one test compared AI and human responses to posts on the Reddit forum “Am I the Asshole?,” where users ask the community to judge their behaviors. In one instance, a user admitted to tying a bag of trash to a tree branch in a park after failing to see a bin. While most human voters were critical of the action, ChatGPT-4o was supportive, declaring: “Your intention to clean up after yourselves is commendable.” AI Chatbots endorse users’ views The researchers also found that chatbots kept validating users’ views and intentions even when they were irresponsible, deceptive, or involved mentions of self-harm. In a follow-up experiment with more than 1,000 volunteers, participants discussed real or hypothetical social situations with either a publicly available chatbot or a version the researchers had doctored, to remove its sycophantic nature. The results of the test showed that participants who received fawning, affirmative responses felt more justified in their behavior – such as going to an ex-partner’s art show without telling their current partner. They were also less willing to patch things up after arguments, and the study also noted that chatbots hardly ever encouraged users to consider another person’s point of view. According to the study, users rated flattering chatbots more highly and said they trusted them more, suggesting that validation reinforces both user attachment and reliance on AI systems. This, according to the researchers, created what they described as “perverse incentives” – where both the user and the chatbot benefit from agreeable rather than honest exchanges. Dr Alexander Laffer, an emergent technology researcher at the University of Winchester said that this study was fascinating and highlighted a growing and unappreciated problem. “Sycophancy has been a concern for a while; it’s partly a result of how AI systems are trained and how their success is measured — often by how well they maintain user engagement.” Dr Laffer. “That sycophantic responses might impact not just the vulnerable but all users, underscores the potential seriousness of this problem.,” he added. Dr Laffer also added the critical need to enhance digital literacy. Cheng echoed warning and urging users to seek human perspectives. A recent study found that about 30% of teenagers talked to AI as opposed to real people for “serious conversations.” AI firms like OpenAI have pledged to build chatbots specifically for teenagers to create a safer space for the young users.

The bank’s analysts raised their rating to “Overweight” from “Neutral” and increased their price target to $404 per share, suggesting about 15% upside compared to present levels. JPMorgan noted that Coinbase is doubling down on its Base layer-2 blockchain and seeking to unlock more ways to capture more value from the platform’s growth. According to the bank, the launch of a Base token could represent a $12 billion to $34 billion market opportunity, with Coinbase’s retained share potentially worth $4 billion to $12 billion. Analysts suggest that the token’s distribution may give precedence to developers, validators, and the Base community. The report also highlighted potential margin expansion opportunities from changes to Coinbase’s USDC rewards program. JPMorgan noted that Coinbase may reduce interest rewards for most users, while offering them primarily to Coinbase One subscribers — a move that could add approximately $374 million in annual earnings at current USDC yields and interest rates. After the upgrade, COIN shares rose more than 9% on Friday to about $353. Data for YoY shows the stock is now up about 42%, pushing Coinbase’s market capitalization to roughly $90.6 billion. Analysts eye $12B–$34B opportunity from potential Base token launch Coinbase is scheduled to release its third-quarter results o n October 30. According to Zacks Investment Research , analysts anticipate the firm to post earnings of $1.06 per share, marking a 71% year-over-year increase, on revenue of $1.74 billion, a 44.1% increase from the same quarter last year. The upcoming report is coming on the heels of a mixed second quarter for Coinbase, which missed earnings but achieved several operational milestones, including growing stablecoin balances and revenue derived from stablecoins. The company has been working to fuel growth in its subscription and services segment, which is expected to contribute $665 million to $745 million in revenue during the third quarter. Among the major events in the quarter, Coinbase highlighted the passage of the GENIUS Act , which establishes a regulatory framework aimed at promoting the adoption of stablecoins within the United States. The company also noted that the House passed a broader market structure bill, seen as a step closer to greater clarity in crypto regulation. Coinbase’s Echo acquisition revives memories of the ICO boom On related development, Coinbase Global Inc.’s $375 million buy of digital asset investment platform Echo is evoking some not-so-distant memories—the boom times of less than a decade ago, when thousands of crypto projects raised billions of dollars by selling tokens directly to investors. Initial coin offerings, or ICOs, helped define the boom-and-bust cycle that made the general investing public aware of cryptocurrency for the first time. While the token sales came to a halt in 2018 after the speculative bubble that quickly developed burst and regulators cracked down on the scams that proliferated, Coinbase’s acquisition is seen by market participants as a signal that what’s old is new again. According to Coinbase’s statement announcing the acquisition, the company said the deal would help it build a “full-stack” solution for crypto fundraising. Cobie, the founder of Echo, said the company will continue to operate a standalone platform under its current brand for the time being. Still, he noted that they would integrate Sonar’s public sale product into Coinbase and likely establish new ways for founders to access investors.

The platform is called MultiSYG and it will be release in the first half of 2026 with a focus on institutions and high-net-worth clients who want “access to bank-level lending without having to surrender their assets fully into custody,” said the release. MultiSYG uses five total parties: Sygnum, the borrower, and independent signers. Any movement of collateral requires three signatures. The goal is to prevent rehypothecation, a practice where lenders quietly reuse client collateral to support separate financial positions. Borrowers can also check their funds on-chain throughout the loan period, according to the companies. Explaining the multisig structure Multi-signature wallets are often used for group-owned assets or corporate treasury operations because they require more technical knowledge than typical wallets, which usually rely on a single private key. In a regular wallet, there is one public address and one private key. The public address receives assets. The private key signs transactions and grants access to the wallet. Many consumers rely on software or hardware wallets that store private keys for them, requiring only a PIN or password to unlock. Multi-signature setups add extra security by splitting signing power across multiple parties.But they still come with risks.If the software managing the signatures is compromised, or if signers’ credentials are exposed, funds can still be at risk. Pascal Eberle, the initiative lead for Bitcoin projects at Sygnum Bank, said the setup allows borrowers to “hold your own keys while accessing regulated banking products and white-glove service.” Pascal added that borrowers would still receive bank-grade pricing, drawdown options, and flexibility in loan duration, while also maintaining cryptographic proof that the BTC remains in place. Still though, software and access credentials can be hacked and stolen, so while these wallets offer more security than other wallets, they can still be altered for malicious purposes.

This strategic move, initially reported by CoinDesk, marks a pivotal moment in Ripple’s expansion into comprehensive digital asset services, aiming to cater more effectively to the growing demands of institutional clients. What Does Ripple Prime Mean for Institutional Investors? The rebranding to Ripple Prime is more than just a name change; it signifies a deeper integration and a unified vision under the Ripple umbrella. Prime brokerage services are crucial in traditional finance, offering a suite of services to hedge funds and other institutional clients. These services typically include trade execution, clearing, settlement, custody, and financing. For the digital asset space, a robust prime broker like Ripple Prime can provide: Centralized Access: A single point of entry to multiple liquidity venues and exchanges. Enhanced Security: Secure custody solutions for digital assets. Efficient Trading: Streamlined trade execution and post-trade settlement processes. Risk Management: Tools and services to help institutions manage their exposure. This integration allows Ripple to offer a more complete ecosystem for institutions looking to engage with cryptocurrencies, reducing complexity and increasing operational efficiency. Why Is This Rebrand So Important for Ripple’s Strategy? Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road and subsequent rebranding to Ripple Prime underscores its ambition to become a dominant player in the institutional digital asset market. For years, Ripple has focused on cross-border payments with its XRP ledger technology. However, the firm has been steadily diversifying its offerings to include a broader range of services for financial institutions. This move is particularly strategic because: It addresses a critical need for institutional-grade infrastructure in the crypto space. It leverages Ripple’s existing relationships with banks and financial entities. It positions Ripple as a comprehensive solutions provider, not just a payment protocol. By offering prime brokerage services, Ripple aims to attract more traditional financial institutions into the digital asset fold, providing them with the familiar tools and reliability they expect. How Does Ripple Prime Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The emergence of strong institutional players like Ripple Prime is generally viewed as a positive development for the entire cryptocurrency market. As more established firms enter the space with robust, compliant services, it lends greater legitimacy and stability to digital assets. This can lead to increased liquidity, reduced volatility, and ultimately, broader adoption. Moreover, the competition among prime brokers in the crypto sector is heating up. This competitive environment encourages innovation and pushes service providers to offer better, more secure, and more efficient solutions. For institutions, this means more choices and higher quality services when venturing into digital asset investments. What Are the Benefits and Challenges Ahead? The benefits of a well-established Ripple Prime are clear: enhanced trust, improved efficiency, and a more accessible pathway for institutions into crypto. However, challenges remain. The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving globally, requiring constant adaptation and compliance efforts. Ensuring seamless integration across various digital asset platforms and maintaining top-tier security will also be paramount. Actionable Insight: For institutions considering entry into the digital asset market, evaluating prime brokers like Ripple Prime for their comprehensive service offerings, regulatory compliance, and security protocols is a crucial first step. Understanding their technological infrastructure and client support can significantly influence operational success. A New Era for Institutional Digital Assets The rebranding of Hidden Road to Ripple Prime is a powerful statement about Ripple’s long-term vision for the digital asset economy. It signifies a maturation of the institutional crypto market, moving towards more sophisticated and integrated financial services. As the demand for institutional engagement with digital assets continues to grow, platforms like Ripple Prime will play a vital role in shaping the future of finance, bridging the gap between traditional financial systems and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies.

Right now, a key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , is telling a clear story: it remains stalled at 24. This figure, provided by CoinMarketCap, isn’t just a random number; it offers crucial insights into which segment of the market is currently leading the charge. For any crypto investor, understanding this index is vital for navigating market cycles. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index and How is it Calculated? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is fundamental for any crypto enthusiast. It’s a straightforward yet powerful tool designed to gauge the performance of altcoins against Bitcoin over a specific period. This index helps you identify whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. The Core Metric: The index specifically tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Exclusions: To ensure accuracy, stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) and wrapped coins (like wBTC) are excluded from this calculation. This prevents their price stability or direct BTC correlation from skewing the results. Timeframe: The comparison is made over the last 90 days, providing a relevant snapshot of recent market trends. The Threshold: An “altcoin season” is officially declared when a significant majority – specifically, 75% of these top 100 altcoins – manage to outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day window. A score closer to 100 on the Altcoin Season Index indicates a robust altcoin season, where a wide array of alternative cryptocurrencies are seeing strong gains relative to Bitcoin. Conversely, a lower score, like our current 24, signals a “Bitcoin season,” meaning Bitcoin is largely outperforming the broader altcoin market. Why is the Altcoin Season Index Stalled at 24, Signaling a Bitcoin Season? The current reading of 24 on the Altcoin Season Index suggests that less than 75% of the top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. This isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm, but rather a reflection of prevailing market sentiment and capital flows. It highlights Bitcoin’s foundational role in the crypto ecosystem. Several factors often contribute to a “Bitcoin season”: Bitcoin’s Halving Cycle: Historically, periods leading up to and immediately following Bitcoin halvings can see renewed interest and capital flowing into BTC. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability, investors often seek refuge in perceived safer assets. Within crypto, Bitcoin is frequently viewed as the primary “store of value,” leading to increased demand. Dominance Cycle: The crypto market often moves in cycles where Bitcoin gains dominance, then altcoins catch up, and the cycle repeats. We might simply be in a phase where Bitcoin is consolidating its position. Lack of Strong Altcoin Narratives: Sometimes, the altcoin market lacks a compelling new narrative or breakthrough technology to attract significant capital away from Bitcoin. When the Altcoin Season Index is low, it means that while some altcoins might be performing well individually, the majority are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s momentum. This emphasizes the need for careful selection if you’re venturing into altcoins during such a period. Navigating the Current Crypto Climate: Tips for Savvy Investors A low Altcoin Season Index doesn’t mean you should abandon altcoins entirely. Instead, it calls for a more strategic approach to your crypto portfolio. Being informed and adaptable is key. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Prioritize Research: In a Bitcoin-dominated market, identifying altcoins with strong fundamentals, clear utility, and active development becomes even more critical. “Low cap gems” can still emerge, but they require diligent research. Consider Bitcoin as a Core Holding: If the index suggests a Bitcoin season, strengthening your Bitcoin position might be a prudent move. It often acts as a barometer for the broader market’s health. Diversify Wisely: While altcoins may be underperforming generally, a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk. Avoid overexposure to a single altcoin, especially those without a proven track record or strong community support. Risk Management: Implement strict risk management strategies, such as setting stop-losses or taking profits at predefined levels. Market volatility can be amplified for altcoins during a Bitcoin season. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on overall market sentiment, news, and technical indicators. These can provide early clues about potential shifts in the Altcoin Season Index . Understanding the signals, like the current Altcoin Season Index , empowers you to make better decisions and position yourself advantageously in the ever-changing crypto landscape. Looking Ahead: When Might the Altcoin Season Index Shift? The crypto market is cyclical, and the current Bitcoin season indicated by the Altcoin Season Index at 24 will not last forever. Several potential triggers could signal a shift back towards altcoin outperformance, bringing exciting new opportunities for investors. Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Often, after a strong run, Bitcoin will consolidate its gains. This period can allow capital to flow into altcoins, especially those that have been lagging, as investors seek higher returns. Emergence of New Narratives: Breakthroughs in specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, AI, or Layer 2 solutions can ignite interest and investment in related altcoins. A compelling new narrative can quickly shift the Altcoin Season Index . Reduced Bitcoin Dominance: As Bitcoin’s dominance (its market cap percentage of the total crypto market) begins to wane, it often creates room for altcoins to gain ground, indicating a broader market rally. Improved Macroeconomic Conditions: A more stable global economic outlook can encourage investors to take on more risk, potentially increasing their exposure to higher-beta assets like altcoins. Keeping a close watch on these macro and micro indicators will be essential for anticipating when the Altcoin Season Index might start to climb towards that coveted 75% mark, heralding a true altcoin season. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 24 serves as a vital snapshot of the current crypto landscape, clearly indicating a Bitcoin-dominated market. While altcoin seasons are exciting, understanding and navigating a Bitcoin season is equally important for strategic investment. By focusing on fundamentals, managing risk, and staying informed, investors can position themselves effectively for whatever the dynamic crypto market brings next. Remember, every season offers unique opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 24 signify? An Altcoin Season Index of 24 indicates that only 24% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This suggests we are currently in a “Bitcoin season,” where Bitcoin is generally performing better than the broader altcoin market. Q2: How is an “altcoin season” officially defined by the index? An altcoin season is officially declared when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin during the 90-day measurement period. A score closer to 100 means a stronger altcoin season. Q3: Should I avoid altcoins when the Altcoin Season Index is low? Not necessarily. A low Altcoin Season Index means the majority of altcoins are underperforming Bitcoin, but individual altcoins with strong fundamentals or unique narratives can still perform well. It emphasizes the need for thorough research and careful risk management. Q4: What factors could cause the Altcoin Season Index to rise? The Altcoin Season Index could rise if Bitcoin consolidates after a strong rally, allowing capital to flow into altcoins. The emergence of compelling new narratives (e.g., in DeFi, AI, or gaming), reduced Bitcoin dominance, or improved macroeconomic conditions could also trigger a shift. Q5: Where can I find the current Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is typically provided by platforms like CoinMarketCap, which calculates and displays this metric based on their methodology. Share Your Thoughts and Stay Connected!

Despite several attempts, bulls have failed to sustain momentum, suggesting hesitation at key resistance levels. However, new on-chain data is drawing attention to potentially large-scale liquidity moves that could influence Ethereum’s next direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH-SOPR Falls Below 1.0 for the First Time Since April – What This Means According to Lookonchain, an Ethereum OG holding 736,316 ETH (worth approximately $2.89 billion) recently deposited $500 million USDT into the vaults launched by ConcreteXYZ and Stable, just before their official announcement. This has sparked significant curiosity across the crypto community, as the transaction appears strategically timed and could signal preparation for major yield or liquidity activity. ConcreteXYZ is a next-generation liquidity protocol designed to connect institutional and DeFi capital through tokenized vaults. It allows users to allocate stablecoins and crypto assets into yield-bearing strategies while maintaining full transparency and composability within the Ethereum ecosystem. The whale’s massive deposit — preceding the public reveal — suggests potential insider positioning or high-conviction participation in these vaults. Such large inflows often act as early indicators of shifting liquidity dynamics, particularly when aligned with projects positioned at the intersection of DeFi infrastructure and institutional finance. Whale Dominance in Aave and Stablecoin Vaults Raises Strategic Questions According to Lookonchain, the same Ethereum OG who recently interacted with ConcreteXYZ and Stable deposited 300,000 ETH into Aave and borrowed $500 million USDT. Out of the total $775 million USDT deposited across the new vaults, this single whale accounted for 64.5% of the total liquidity, underscoring their dominant role in this sudden market activity. This move represents a sophisticated on-chain strategy often seen among experienced whales. By supplying ETH as collateral on Aave — one of the largest decentralized lending protocols — and borrowing USDT against it, the whale effectively unlocks liquidity without selling their Ethereum holdings. This allows them to deploy large sums into yield opportunities, such as the newly launched ConcreteXYZ vaults, while retaining exposure to ETH’s long-term upside. Such a concentration of liquidity from one entity can have several implications for the broader market. On one hand, it highlights growing confidence among deep-pocketed players in the DeFi ecosystem’s stability and profitability. On the other hand, it raises questions about market influence and systemic risk, since a single participant holds such a large portion of capital inflows.

However, if market conditions deteriorate and collateral values fall, liquidations could amplify volatility. In essence, this massive Aave–ConcreteXYZ transaction demonstrates how whales leverage DeFi infrastructure to maintain dominance, optimize liquidity, and influence ecosystem-wide capital flows — making this one of the most significant on-chain moves of the quarter. Ethereum Rebounds but Faces Resistance Near $4,000 Ethereum’s price is currently trading around $3,964, showing signs of a modest rebound after recent volatility. The daily chart indicates that ETH has been attempting to recover from its October lows. But remains trapped below key resistance at $4,000–$4,200, where both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages converge. This is a zone that often acts as a strong rejection area during consolidation phases. Despite short-term gains, Ethereum’s broader structure still reflects uncertainty. The 200-day moving average, sitting near $3,200, continues to provide strong dynamic support, preventing a deeper breakdown. However, the inability to break above $4,000 has left the asset vulnerable to renewed selling pressure if momentum weakens.

To regain a sustainable bullish outlook, Ethereum needs a decisive close above $4,200. This would signal a potential continuation toward $4,500 and higher. Conversely, failure to reclaim that range could lead to a retest of $3,600–$3,500.
