This is the second time SpaceX has moved its Bitcoin holdings within a week. Just a few days earlier, the company transferred $268 million worth of BTC into new wallets.

SpaceX, along with Tesla , started accumulating Bitcoin in 2020-2021. A year later, Elon Musk began advocating cryptocurrencies. That was during the previous crypto bull run. The entrepreneur consistently endorsed Dogecoin and Bitcoin. Around that time, Tesla announced it would begin accepting Bitcoin as payment from electric vehicle buyers. But after about three to four months, Tesla scrapped those plans due to Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact. Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. But the EV maker later sold a major portion of its BTC holdings. It originally held around 48,000 BTC and sold 75% of its position in 2022. Tesla missed out on billions of dollars by selling BTC early. As of today, Tesla holds 11,509 BTC, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. SpaceX , on the other hand, has not made any major Bitcoin purchases or sales since 2022. The company has not officially disclosed its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. In other related news, the US government has moved a bunch of coins seized from Alameda Research over 2 years ago. It moved $1 worth of Viberate token, $36 of OCEAN tokens, and $60 of HOT tokens. Bitcoin is currently trading at $111,017, with a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion and a trading volume of $50 billion. Ether is standing at $3,940 and has been struggling to break over the $4,000 barrier over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s dominance is standing strong at 57.7%, while Ethereum has a 12.4% share of the crypto market. The overall market sentiment is labeled fear-based on the Crypto Fear and Greed Index. The crypto market is still trying to recover after the recent market crash due to Trump’s tariff hit on China, which caused massive liquidations across exchanges.

As the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting approaches, traders have turned cautious, awaiting signs of potential monetary easing that could rekindle investor appetite for risk assets. Despite short-term volatility, seasoned analysts interpret the recent downturn as a constructive correction, noting that steep pullbacks often flush out speculative leverage and pave the way for more sustainable long-term growth. Solana (SOL): Claude Forecasts a Challenge to ATH Firstly, Solana ($SOL) continues to establish itself as a leading smart contract platform, commanding a market cap exceeding $104 billion and around $11.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) within its DeFi ecosystem. Source: Microsoft Copilot Market speculation is building that U.S. regulators may approve a spot Solana ETF before month’s end, a decision that could spur significant institutional inflows, echoing the post-ETF surges seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana is also well-positioned to benefit from emerging trends such as real-world asset tokenization and the expansion of stablecoin infrastructure, both gaining institutional traction. With faster transaction speeds and lower fees than Ethereum, Solana remains one of the most promising candidates for large-scale adoption. After peaking at $250 in January and dipping to $100 in April, SOL now trades near $191, signaling renewed upside potential. With an RSI around 45 and trading just below its 30-day moving average, the token appears undervalued. Following a breakout from a bullish flag pattern, Claude estimates Solana could reach as high as $290 by month end, perhaps even beating its previous all-time high of $293.31 set back in January. XRP ($XRP): Claude Predicts a Potential Surge Toward $10 Claude AI’s data models suggest that Ripple’s native asset, XRP ($XRP) , could see a sharp rally, potentially climbing to between $5 and $10 by the close of the year, quadrupling its current price of about $2.49. Ripple’s decisive legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year concluded a five-year court battle, revitalizing investor confidence and propelling XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 on July 18. Over the past 12 months, XRP has soared 369%, far surpassing Bitcoin’s 63% and Ethereum’s 55% gains. Technical indicators highlight three notable bullish flag patterns in 2025, two of which appeared in the summer, often a precursor to significant upward movement. The sudden arrive of a string of high-profile spot XRP ETF approvals, improved regulatory clarity, or a surprise new business partnership on Ripple’s part may drive XRP over the $5 mark, with $10 representing an unlikely but plausible extreme bull case scenario. Binance Coin (BNB): Copilot AI Sees Expanding Dominance Originally launched as a utility token for Binance, Binance Coin ($BNB) has evolved into a versatile asset supporting a diverse ecosystem that includes NFTs, decentralized applications, and payment services. BNB’s deflationary mechanism, sustained through Binance’s periodic token burns, continues to bolster its long-term price stability by systematically reducing circulating supply. Beyond Binance’s own platforms, BNB’s utility has expanded globally, now accepted by merchants across various industries, from gaming to travel. This widespread adoption has firmly cemented BNB’s place among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Earlier this month, BNB broke out of a bullish pennant formation and hit an all-time high of $1,369.99 before retreating roughly 19%. With its RSI now hovering around 50, the token appears to be consolidating. Should bullish momentum resume, Copilot AI projects BNB could advance toward $1,600 by month-end, with a key support range between $580 and $1,000 if another correction unfolds. Missed Dogecoin? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI): The Next-Gen Meme Coin With Degen Energy Finally, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a fresh entrant in the meme coin sector, has launched its presale, already securing more than $3.7 million from investors eager to join the next viral crypto wave. Marketed as Dogecoin’s “high-octane cousin,” Maxi Doge channels the humor, energy, and community spirit of crypto’s degen culture, emphasizing engagement, viral memes, and grassroots participation. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI delivers faster, more efficient, and eco-friendly transactions compared to the dated tech of Dogecoin. Its marketing strategy leverages Telegram and Discord events, trading competitions, and influencer collaborations to build early momentum. Of the 150.24 billion total token supply, 25% is reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” supporting marketing, ecosystem development, and partnerships. Staking is already live, offering yields of up to 81%APY, a rate that will gradually decline as more participants stake their tokens. Currently, MAXI’s presale price sits at $0.0002645, with incremental increases tied to funding milestones. Purchases can be made using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Within mere days, prices tumbled sharply following President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, sparking a broad shift toward risk aversion ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting. Still, many market observers view the pullback as a natural correction, a period of consolidation purging excessive leverage and weaker positions before a more durable advance. Below are three altcoins that continue to show notable upside potential. Ripple (XRP): Poised to Dominate Global Payments in 2025 Ripple’s token, XRP ($XRP) , underpins a high-speed, low-cost payment protocol designed as a modern alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Backed by partnerships with the UN Capital Development Fund and several leading U.S. financial institutions, XRP has grown into the world’s fifth-largest digital asset, boasting a market capitalization of just over $149 billion. The company’s launch of its own stablecoin, RLUSD, signals an ambition to secure a significant share of the booming stablecoin sector. Over the past 12 months, XRP’s value has soared 369%, hitting a seven-year high of $3.65 in mid-July and far outpacing Bitcoin’s 63% gain during the same stretch. With a relative strength index (RSI) around 44 and trading below its 30-day moving average, XRP is likely trading at a discount and preparing for a festive breakout. Technical patterns show two bullish flag formations during the summer, suggesting room for further appreciation if ETF approvals arrive by mid-October. Passage of comprehensive U.S. crypto regulation could propel XRP toward the $5–$10 range. Zcash (ZEC): Privacy Coin Spikes 147% in a Single Week Launched in 2016 as a Bitcoin offshoot, Zcash ($ZEC) was created to prioritize one thing above all: user privacy. It utilizes zk-SNARKs (“zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge”), an advanced cryptographic method allowing transactions to be validated without revealing sender, recipient, or transaction details. Zcash employs a dual-address structure, giving users the choice between fully transparent and shielded transactions, a balance between privacy and regulatory compliance. In the past week, ZEC has jumped 19% to $255, outperforming every top 100 crypto. While most leading tokens declined, fellow privacy crypto Monero ($XMR) also rose sharply, adding 15% to its price. ZEC’s RSI currently sits near 63 and is downtrending as traders secure profits from the last week. If momentum persists and fundamentals strengthen, prices could hit $500 by year’s end. Story ($IP): Redefining the Creator Economy On Chain. Story ($IP) hopes to blaze a trail in the industry’s nascent intellectual property sector. Positioned as the world’s first Layer-1 blockchain built specifically for IP creation and monetization, Story enables creators, brands, and developers to transform ideas into tokenized assets with real, on-chain ownership. Story is unique for its end-to-end ecosystem: from minting and licensing creative works to building entire franchises that thrive within its decentralized network. As Web3 expands beyond finance into entertainment and culture, Story is a project that provides a new crossroads for art, technology, and ownership to realise the true extent of blockchain’s potential. With its token, $IP, powering governance, staking, and creative economies, early adopters see it as the next big narrative in crypto. Story rose 4% in the last 24 hours, and with a low RSI of 38, positive market momentum gives it plenty of headroom to lock in more aggressive profits quickly. That said, from its current price of $5.41, there will be sticky resistance around $10 and $1,5 but if it clears this and the market enters a bull cycle, Story can manage an easy 10x by the end of the year. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The Meme-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 Presale of 2025 Finally, a rising star in the crypto scene, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , is among 2025’s most talked-about presales. It combines Bitcoin’s renowned security with Layer-2 scalability and the viral excitement of meme culture. HYPER enhances Bitcoin’s network with faster transaction speeds, decentralized DAO-based governance, and expanded smart contract capabilities through a dedicated Layer-2 framework. The project has already attracted more than $24.7 million in presale funding, and analysts predict post-launch gains that could exceed 10x. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), the HYPER ecosystem includes a lightning-fast Canonical Bridge for BTC transfers, decentralized app (dApp) integration, and built-in meme coin functionality. An independent Coinsult audit reported zero vulnerabilities, reinforcing investor confidence. HYPER tokens fuel every part of the ecosystem, from governance and staking to transaction fees, with staking rewards currently offering up to 48% APY for early participants.

Some analysts suggest that ETF inflows have aided in cooling sentiment, and institutional investors are buying again. The question now is whether Ethereum can continue moving above $3850 and extend its recovery. With the focus shifting from Ethereum, HYPE, and DOT are currently some of the best altcoins to buy right now . Both projects continue to draw in investors because of strong network activity and growing developer ecosystems. Joining the list is MAGACOIN FINANCE , noted by analysts for its utility-oriented model and active community development, both elements that have solidified its position at the base of the pyramid. Ethereum Holds Above $3,850 as ETF Inflows Support Sentiment Ethereum is still trading close to $3,836, after a subsequent recovery from volatility last week. Resurgent ETF flows provide a positive sign for bulls, but traders are cautious about macro uncertainty. According to analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum ETFs saw $141.7 million in inflows on October 21, with BlackRock and Fidelity making up over $101 million of the total. It was the largest daily flow since early October and was a much-needed sentiment booster after a few sessions of volatile demand. Source: X Even with greater inflows, ETH is still below its 50-day EMA at $3,968 and the 100-day EMA at $4,063. Analysts say that to confirm institutional support has stepped in, prices have to remain close to these levels for sustained periods. HYPE and DOT Lead Analyst Rankings Among the Best Altcoins to Buy Hyperliquid (HYPE) continued to experience significant volatility in recent sessions as the overall altcoin market adjusts. Despite the volatility over the short term, analysts continue to rank Hype as one of the best altcoins to buy now, due to its large investors renewing their accumulation. CryptoQuant data indicates a bullish turn on HYPE, with whales adding to long positions, positioning themselves ahead of a potential recovery. Analysts view this as an indication of confidence in the project’s structure and rebound potential following an improvement in market liquidity. At the same time, Polkadot (DOT) is also improving its network fundamentals. Crypto.com’s addition of USDT and USDC transfers through Polkadot’s Asset Hub has opened up access and liquidity opportunities for users. This advancement ensures that DOT continues its current trend of playing a major role in cross-chain interoperability while establishing itself as one of the most useful utility-driven altcoins within analyst rankings. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Attention for Utility and Community Growth Additionally, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also making a name for itself in its emphasis on utility and community. Analysts point out that the project’s utilization of its native crypto token in decentralized applications is a looming force. Besides utility, the project has had a very active community to ensure its growth in each phase of development of the project. Regular updates, clear communication, and regular involvement have helped foster long-term engagement among holders. This practical utility and community have placed MAGACOIN FINANCE side by side with other major altcoins like HYPE and DOT. Analysts believe that it is among the best altcoins to buy for investors, considering projects that have tangible and user-driven ecosystems. Conclusion Ethereum’s consistent trading above $3,850 reflects the impact of institutional inflows and renewed investor participation. Traders note this stability could provide a platform for market confidence if ETF demand continues to increase. The strength of the asset’s resilience sends a message to investors that they still see it as a crucial anchor to hold on to whenever there are waves in the markets.

The entire crypto market has been relatively steady, and XRP has managed to maintain its footing above $2.20. Despite the slow momentum, a technical analysis shared by the crypto analyst known as ChartNerd on X suggests that XRP could be preparing for a massive breakout that could take it from current levels toward a long-term target above $27. The analysis is supported by a chart showing multiple confluences aligning in favor of such a large-scale move. XRP Technical Analysis Points To Rally According to ChartNerd’s chart, XRP has now completed a symmetrical triangle breakout pattern that has been forming for several years. This breakout is occurring above a multi-year ascending support line that dates back to 2017. The chart also shows an important resistance block that previously capped XRP’s price during earlier bull runs in 2017 and 2021. Related Reading: XRP Price Teleport To $6: What Happens When The Euphoric Phase Begin XRP broke above this resistance block months ago, but recently retested it during last week’s flash crash. Its rebound from this resistance block reinforces the idea that XRP is about to bounce massively. The breakout from this long-term consolidation zone, combined with the multi-year ascending trendline, provides the technical foundation for a potential move toward much higher price targets. Another important confirmation that occurred during the flash crash was the successful retest of the 3-month 10 EMA. This retest serves as a validation point for the recent breakout, showing that XRP is maintaining its structure on higher timeframes. Furthermore, the analysis shows that XRP has reclaimed the Gaussian Channel upper regression line, which represents long-term trend momentum. This alignment of the EMA retest with the Gaussian Channel suggests strong bullish momentum is beginning to build. ChartNerd refers to this convergence of multiple indicators as a “confluence zone.” Fibonacci Extension Targets From $8 To $27 The analysis concludes with a clearly defined Fibonacci extension roadmap that outlines XRP’s next price objectives. ChartNerd’s Fibonacci levels place the first major target at $8.47, corresponding to the 1.272 extension, followed by $13.78 at the 1.414 level, and finally the 1.618 extension at $27.70. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors That A Supply Squeeze Is Coming And What It Means For Price This sequence implies a full technical replication of XRP’s bull run in 2017, scaled to its current breakout structure. Back then, XRP hit all three Fibonacci extensions from the previous low after breaking above a similar resistance block. If these projections materialize, XRP could experience its most significant rally in years. The move toward $27 could unfold in one of two ways: either through a strong, near-vertical surge similar to the explosive rally of 2017 or through a series of measured advances highlighted by corrections at each resistance level. Nonetheless, both scenarios have the same bullish structure. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.44, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

Ancient Bitcoin Whale Has Broken A 14.3 Years Long Silence According to data from cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert , a dormant wallet with a massive amount of Bitcoin has just woken up. The address in question contained 4,000 BTC before its transaction on Friday. Blockchain history shows this wallet collected the 4,000 BTC through mining rewards in 2011, implying the owner was an early miner. Back then, the block subsidy (the reward miners get for adding a new block to the chain) was worth 50 BTC, so it took the miner 80 blocks to assemble the stack. Today, after four Halving events, the block subsidy has dropped to 3.125 BTC, so a miner could need to mine 1,280 blocks to procure the same amount (though, in practice, it would take fewer blocks due to transaction fees also playing a role now). When the miner received the tokens about 14 years ago, they were worth just $67,724. The same stack is today worth more than $440 million, meaning that the whale was sitting on a profit of a whopping 650,000% when they reactivated the wallet. The dormancy-breaking Bitcoin transaction involved a sum of 150 BTC ($16.6 million at transfer time), as the details below from Whale Alert show. It’s possible that the move may have been to realize some of the profit that the Bitcoin wallet has accumulated over its long life. So far, this 150 BTC transaction is the only withdrawal that the whale has made, so it remains to be seen whether more transfers will follow. As for who’s behind the transaction, it’s hard to say anything for sure. Usually, wallets that grow this old without spending do so by becoming lost. That is, by having their existence forgotten or keys misplaced. It could be that the original owner rediscovered the wallet, or someone else obtained its keys, whether by chance or by taking advantage of a vulnerability that the wallet software from that era could possess. Or, in a more unlikely scenario, the miner behind the address could just be a hardcore HODLer . Speaking of transactions involving dormant coins, this year has seen a record-breaking number of them, as an analyst noted in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post . “In 2025, Bitcoin movements of coins dormant for 7+ years have already exceeded 2024 levels, and there are still two months left,” noted the quant. So far, 2025 has seen 270,000 BTC move after being inactive for more than seven years, so by year’s end, the record could grow to 300,000 BTC.

Over 1 million SOL tokens, valued at a staggering $213 million, have been moved from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a whale-sized move that has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike, sparking numerous questions about its potential impact on the Solana ecosystem and the broader crypto market. What Exactly Happened with This SOL Transfer? Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracking service, first reported this massive SOL transfer . Specifically, 1,097,732 SOL tokens departed from Coinbase Institutional. This entity typically serves large corporations and high-net-worth individuals, providing secure crypto services. The transaction involved a substantial amount: nearly 1.1 million SOL. Its value stands at approximately $213 million, making it one of the largest single SOL transfers in recent times. The destination remains undisclosed, labeled simply as an “unknown wallet.” Such large movements often signal strategic shifts or significant market plays by major players, commonly referred to as “whales.” Therefore, understanding the context of this SOL transfer is crucial for anyone monitoring the crypto landscape. Why Does a Large SOL Transfer Matter to the Market? When a substantial amount of any cryptocurrency, especially one with a significant market cap like Solana (SOL), moves from an institutional exchange to an unknown wallet, it inevitably creates ripples. This particular SOL transfer carries several implications: Firstly, it could indicate a potential sale. If the tokens are being moved to a personal wallet to be held, that’s one scenario. However, if they are being prepared for over-the-counter (OTC) deals or a future dump on exchanges, it could exert downward pressure on SOL’s price. Consequently, traders are watching closely for subsequent movements from the unknown wallet. Secondly, it highlights the increasing involvement of institutional money in the crypto space. Coinbase Institutional facilitates these large-scale transactions, suggesting that significant capital is actively flowing in and out of digital assets. This institutional activity can often lend legitimacy and stability to the market, but also introduces new dynamics. Who Could Be Behind This Mysterious SOL Transfer? The identity of the whale behind this particular SOL transfer remains a mystery, fueling speculation across the crypto community. Several possibilities exist: An institutional investor: A hedge fund, a venture capital firm, or even a corporate treasury could be rebalancing its portfolio or making a strategic investment. A large individual investor: A high-net-worth individual, perhaps an early adopter or a tech mogul, might be consolidating assets or preparing for a private sale. An exchange moving funds: Although less likely from an “institutional” arm to an “unknown” wallet, sometimes exchanges move funds for operational purposes. However, the scale suggests a more deliberate action. Understanding the “who” behind such a significant SOL transfer would provide invaluable insight into market sentiment and future trends for Solana. What Are the Potential Impacts on Solana and Beyond? The immediate impact of this SOL transfer is primarily felt in market sentiment. News of large whale movements can trigger anxiety among retail investors, leading to increased volatility. If the tokens were to be sold, a sudden influx of supply could drive prices down. Moreover, this event underscores the opaque nature of some aspects of the crypto market. While blockchain provides transparency in transactions, the identities behind the wallets often remain anonymous. This anonymity is a double-edged sword, offering privacy but also making it challenging to interpret the intentions behind such colossal moves. Looking ahead, the market will be keenly observing the destination wallet. Any further movements, especially to known exchange wallets, would be critical indicators of the whale’s intentions. This SOL transfer serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. In conclusion, the $213 million SOL transfer from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet is more than just a large transaction; it’s a pivotal moment that prompts crucial questions about institutional involvement, market dynamics, and the future trajectory of Solana. As the crypto space continues to mature, these whale movements will remain a fascinating and influential aspect of its evolution. Staying informed about such significant events is paramount for navigating the ever-changing tides of digital assets.

The company said in its third-quarter earnings that “if control of Nexperia cannot be restored before the end of 2025, the company may face temporary downward pressure on revenue, profit and cash flow.” This warning came alongside stronger-than-expected quarterly results, with semiconductor revenue up 12.2% compared to the same period last year. Wingtech, headquartered in Jiaxing, said demand across its semiconductor lines remained strong during the quarter, but acknowledged that the ongoing political conflict with the Netherlands makes future growth hard to predict. The company admitted that the Nexperia situation is now a major uncertainty for its chip business, both financially and operationally. Dutch seizure of Nexperia follows U.S. pressure The Dutch state moved to seize Nexperia in September, after pushback from the United States over concerns that the chipmaker might not be acting independently of its Chinese parent. Washington reportedly told Nexperia it would need to fire its Chinese CEO to avoid getting added to the U.S. sanctions list. Wingtech, led by Chairman Zhang Xuezheng, was already added to the U.S. Entity List in 2024, a move that restricts American firms from doing business with it. The decision to take over Nexperia shocked the global auto industry. The company is a key supplier of semiconductors used in vehicles built by Volkswagen and other manufacturers. A Bloomberg report cited unnamed auto executives warning that chip shortages could start disrupting supply chains within a week. They estimated that the impact would ripple through the entire sector in less than three weeks if the standoff continues. China’s Commerce Minister called the Dutch action one that has “seriously affected” global supply chain stability.Dutch authorities responded by saying they’re staying in contact with Beijing to work “toward a constructive solution.”But behind the scenes, pressure is rising. The European Union’s trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said on Tuesday that both countries are “in frequent contact” and “fully aware the time is of the essence here.” He made the statement after a video call with his Chinese counterpart at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Nexperia raised red flags before the takeover European auto giants claim they were blindsided by the action against Nexperia, but legal filings show red flags were raised in late 2023. Executives at the company had contacted the Dutch economic ministry over fears that its ownership structure, being tied to Wingtech since 2019, could pose a regulatory risk. At that point, Dutch officials already considered Nexperia a Chinese-controlled entity. Multiple meetings took place between the Dutch government and Nexperia management. The two sides agreed on governance reforms, including the creation of a supervisory board. Nexperia also offered to add a Western minority shareholder to ease national security fears. Those talks were still in progress when the U.S. dropped its sanctions hammer on Wingtech, throwing a wrench in any possible compromise. Now, Wingtech is stuck in limbo. The company said it will keep pushing to restore full control of Nexperia, but admitted the situation could drag well into 2026. Despite having diversified chip products and strong quarterly demand, the fight over Nexperia’s future is overshadowing everything else. Meanwhile, China responded with new restrictions on the export of rare earths and other critical materials. When asked about it, Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson Wang Wentao said the move was a “normal” effort to tighten its export control system. He added that China is still allowing approvals for EU companies. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This isn’t just speculation; it’s a compelling estimate from financial giant JPMorgan, centered around the potential launch of a native Coinbase Base token for its Layer 2 network. This development could fundamentally reshape Coinbase’s financial landscape, creating entirely new revenue streams beyond its current reliance on USDC and on-chain transaction fees. What is the Value Proposition of a Coinbase Base Token? JPMorgan’s analysis, as reported by The Block, highlights a significant opportunity. By introducing a dedicated Coinbase Base token , the exchange could directly monetize the burgeoning success of its Layer 2 network, Base. This strategic move is seen as a powerful way to tap into the network’s rapid growth and cement Coinbase’s position in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. Currently, Coinbase generates revenue from various sources, including trading fees, subscription services, and its stake in USDC. However, a native token for Base would introduce a fresh, substantial income stream. Think of it as a direct stake in the prosperity of the Base network itself, allowing Coinbase to benefit directly from its adoption and utility. How Has Base Network Achieved Such Rapid Growth? The Base network, launched in August 2023, has quickly emerged as a formidable player in the Layer 2 space. Its impressive growth is underscored by its total value locked (TVL), which has now surpassed a remarkable $5 billion. This rapid ascent indicates strong developer and user adoption, proving the network’s utility and appeal. Layer 2 networks like Base are designed to scale blockchain transactions, making them faster and cheaper. By building on Ethereum, Base leverages its security while offering an enhanced user experience. This efficiency is a major draw for decentralized applications (dApps) and users alike, contributing to its substantial TVL and vibrant ecosystem. This strong foundation makes the idea of a Coinbase Base token even more compelling. Why is a Coinbase Base Token a Game Changer? Launching a Coinbase Base token would not only create new revenue but also deepen engagement within the Base ecosystem. Tokens often serve multiple purposes, such as governance, staking, or paying for network fees. By offering a native token, Coinbase could empower its community, giving users a direct stake in the network’s future and encouraging further participation. Consider these key benefits: Direct Monetization: A token provides a direct mechanism for Coinbase to capture value from Base’s growth, independent of broader market trends affecting trading volumes. Ecosystem Alignment: It aligns the incentives of users, developers, and Coinbase, fostering a more robust and collaborative environment. Increased Utility: The token could unlock new functionalities and services within the Base network, enhancing its overall value proposition. Competitive Advantage: In a crowded Layer 2 landscape, a well-executed token launch could differentiate Base and attract more projects and liquidity. What Are the Considerations for Launching a Coinbase Base Token? While the potential benefits are immense, launching a Coinbase Base token also involves careful consideration. Regulatory clarity, market sentiment, and the token’s economic design are crucial factors. A thoughtfully designed tokenomics model is essential to ensure long-term sustainability and value accrual. Coinbase, as a publicly traded company, operates under significant scrutiny. Any token launch would need to navigate complex legal and compliance frameworks. However, given Coinbase’s established reputation and expertise, they are well-positioned to address these challenges effectively. The move could solidify Coinbase’s role not just as an exchange, but as a pivotal infrastructure provider in the decentralized world. The Future is Bright for the Coinbase Base Token JPMorgan’s projection underscores the transformative potential of a Coinbase Base token . This isn’t merely about adding another cryptocurrency to the market; it’s about strategically leveraging a successful Layer 2 network to create substantial shareholder value and innovate within the crypto space. The financial world is watching keenly to see if Coinbase will seize this remarkable opportunity. The prospect of a native Base token signals a maturing market where infrastructure providers are finding novel ways to monetize their contributions. For users and investors, it could represent a new avenue for participation and growth within the Coinbase ecosystem. This strategic pivot could cement Coinbase’s legacy as a true pioneer, constantly evolving to meet the demands of a dynamic digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Base network? A1: Base is a Layer 2 network developed by Coinbase, built on Ethereum. It aims to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications, enhancing transaction speed and efficiency. Q2: Why is JPMorgan interested in a Coinbase Base token? A2: JPMorgan, a major financial institution, analyzes potential revenue streams and value creation in emerging markets. Their interest stems from the significant financial opportunity a native Coinbase Base token could present for Coinbase, potentially generating billions in new revenue. Q3: How would a Coinbase Base token generate value? A3: A native token could generate value through various mechanisms, including network fees, staking rewards, governance participation, and general utility within the Base ecosystem. It would provide Coinbase with a direct monetization strategy for its Layer 2 network’s success. Q4: What are the potential challenges of launching a Base token? A4: Key challenges include navigating complex regulatory landscapes, designing effective tokenomics for long-term sustainability, managing market sentiment, and ensuring the token’s utility aligns with the network’s goals. Coinbase’s compliance expertise would be crucial here. Q5: Has Coinbase confirmed plans for a Base token?

While she maintains a bearish stance in the short term, Lingrid also highlighted the exact price point that could invalidate this downward outlook and signal a potential rebound. Market Overview At the time of analysis, XRP was trading at approximately $2.44, marking a 14% decline for the month. The asset’s performance follows a brief recovery after the October 10 market-wide crash, which affected most major cryptocurrencies. Despite this rebound, XRP has struggled to establish a sustained uptrend, continuing to exhibit weakness relative to the broader digital asset market. Lingrid first presented her detailed outlook on October 18, when XRP hovered around $2.33. The token had shown minor intraday recovery at the time, but her technical review confirmed that XRP remained confined within a descending channel on the four-hour chart, a pattern that has persisted since late August. Bearish Continuation Toward $2.10 Lingrid’s chart identified a blue descending trendline cutting through the channel, effectively dividing it into two halves. This trendline has acted as a consistent resistance level, restricting any sustained move toward the channel’s upper boundary. In early October, XRP briefly broke above this internal resistance, climbing to $3.10 before meeting significant selling pressure. The resulting rejection pushed the price back within the channel’s confines. The decline intensified following the October 10 selloff, which forced XRP below $2.70. Attempts to recover, including a move toward $2.63 on October 13, were unsuccessful, as the token again failed to overcome the trendline resistance. Based on these repeated rejections, Lingrid stated that XRP continues to form lower highs and lower lows, a structure typically signaling an ongoing bearish phase. Should this pattern hold, she believes XRP could fall to around $2.10, marking the lower boundary of the descending channel. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Conditions for a Reversal Despite the prevailing downtrend, Lingrid outlined conditions that could invalidate her bearish projection. She indicated that a decisive break above $2.45 could trigger a trend reversal, with the potential for XRP to rise as high as $2.83 in the short term. More broadly, a close above the $2.50 level would signal renewed buying pressure and a shift toward bullish sentiment. The analyst also noted that external market factors could support a reversal. A potential pivot in Bitcoin’s market direction from bearish to bullish could lift XRP and other altcoins. Additionally, macroeconomic shifts could enhance liquidity conditions across the crypto market. Lingrid pointed to JPMorgan’s recent assessment that the U.S. Federal Reserve may soon conclude its quantitative tightening program, a move that could ease liquidity constraints and improve overall investor sentiment. Mixed Market Sentiment While Lingrid’s analysis emphasizes caution, other market observers remain more optimistic. Analyst EGRAG Crypto recently argued that XRP’s monthly chart still shows structural strength, with no confirmed breakdowns. Similarly, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator on the four-hour chart, suggesting a possible short-term rebound. For now, XRP’s next move will depend on whether it can hold above key technical levels and whether broader market dynamics turn more favorable. A break above $2.45 could offer the first sign that bullish momentum is returning to the asset. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

For the very first time, the total crypto M&A value from mergers and acquisitions involving digital asset firms soared past an astonishing $10 billion in the third quarter. This isn’t just a slight bump; it represents an increase of more than 30 times compared to the same period last year, as reported by crypto market insights platform Unfolded. This massive leap signals a new era of consolidation and strategic growth within the crypto industry. What’s Fueling the Surge in Crypto M&A Value? Many factors contribute to this unprecedented boom in crypto M&A value . The digital asset space is no longer just a playground for individual enthusiasts; it’s attracting serious institutional players and established companies looking to expand their footprint. Here are some key drivers behind this remarkable growth: Market Maturity: The cryptocurrency market is becoming more established and regulated, making it a more attractive environment for traditional finance and tech firms to invest and acquire. Strategic Positioning: Companies are actively seeking to acquire cutting-edge technology, expand their user base, or gain a competitive edge in specific niches like DeFi, NFTs, or Web3 infrastructure.

Benefits of Crypto Mergers and Acquisitions: Innovation Acceleration: Mergers can combine expertise and resources, leading to faster development of new products and services. Enhanced Market Stability: Consolidation can lead to larger, more stable entities, potentially reducing volatility and increasing investor confidence. Broader Reach: Acquired companies often bring existing user bases and brand recognition, expanding the reach of the acquiring firm. Regulatory Clarity: Larger, more established firms might have greater resources to navigate complex regulatory landscapes, potentially setting industry standards. Challenges to Navigate: Regulatory Uncertainties: The evolving nature of crypto regulations can complicate M&A deals, requiring careful legal navigation. Valuation Complexities: Valuing crypto companies, especially those with innovative but unproven business models, can be incredibly challenging. Integration Hurdles: Merging different technologies, company cultures, and operational processes can be a significant undertaking. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can impact deal terms and post-merger performance. What Does This Unprecedented Crypto M&A Value Mean for the Future? The record-breaking crypto M&A value in Q3 suggests a significant shift in the digital asset industry. We are likely to see a landscape dominated by fewer, but larger and more diversified players. This trend could lead to increased institutionalization, greater market efficiency, and potentially a more stable environment for both users and investors. For startups, this means increased opportunities for acquisition, but also heightened competition. For established firms, it emphasizes the need for continuous innovation and strategic partnerships to remain relevant. The industry is maturing, moving from a wild frontier to a more structured financial ecosystem. In conclusion, the astounding $10 billion milestone in Q3 crypto M&A value is more than just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of the cryptocurrency market’s rapid evolution. It highlights a clear trend towards consolidation, strategic growth, and institutional confidence. As the digital asset space continues to mature, we can expect M&A activities to play an even more crucial role in shaping its future, driving innovation, and defining the next generation of blockchain-powered services.

53599721,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87474,1761350405,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert To XRP Holders: I’ve Got Uncomfortable News For You,https://timestabloid.com/expert-to-xrp-holders-ive-got-uncomfortable-news-for-you/,"As market participants anticipate a potential surge in XRP’s value, several industry analysts have cautioned that offloading XRP during a major rally may prove more difficult than many investors expect. The concern centers on the likelihood of declining liquidity during rapid price movements, which could restrict sellers from executing large transactions at their desired prices. Limited Liquidity Could Hinder Profit-Taking Jake Claver, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Ascension Group, recently addressed this issue in a statement, emphasizing the need for investors to prepare for the operational realities of major market events. When we see some major price action come for XRP, I've got uncomfortable news for you….a lot of exchanges won't have the liquidity to let you exit at market value, and with the supply shock, institutional buyers dominate OTC and retail will get stuck fighting for exposure… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 3, 2025 According to Claver, when XRP begins to experience substantial upward momentum, many exchanges may struggle to maintain sufficient liquidity to handle the surge in sell orders. He explained that such a situation could create a temporary imbalance between buyers and sellers, with demand for liquidity far exceeding what exchanges can provide. This, he warned, would allow institutional investors, who often conduct over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, to dominate the market, while retail traders could find themselves unable to sell at optimal prices. Claver advised XRP holders to prepare in advance by securing their assets in private wallets, developing a clear tax strategy, and planning for long-term wealth management. He noted that investors who fail to make these preparations could miss out on opportunities to maximize their returns during a potential price breakout. Analysts Explain Why Selling at Target Prices May Be Unlikely Market commentator Diana echoed Claver’s position in a separate discussion, stressing that many XRP investors have unrealistic expectations about how liquidity functions during rapid rallies. She observed that a large number of holders intend to sell once XRP reaches specific price targets, such as $10 . However, if too many traders attempt to sell simultaneously, market depth can quickly thin out, resulting in significant price slippage. Diana explained that in such cases, a trader placing a sell order at $10 might only receive an execution price closer to $8.50 or lower, depending on market conditions and trade size. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This discrepancy can cause substantial losses within seconds during periods of high volatility. She noted that this phenomenon is not unique to XRP but tends to be more pronounced when market participation becomes heavily one-sided. Institutional Activity May Further Reduce Market Liquidity Diana also pointed out that institutional trading practices contribute to this challenge. While most retail participants rely on public exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken, major corporations and financial institutions typically transact through private OTC arrangements. These private trades, though essential for large-scale settlements, effectively draw liquidity away from public exchanges during critical market moments. Additionally, Diana highlighted Ripple’s recent acquisition of GTreasury as a factor that may further tighten XRP’s available liquidity. The $1 billion integration of GTreasury is expected to increase the use of XRP within institutional payment systems, reducing the volume of tokens circulating on traditional exchanges. While this development enhances XRP’s utility and strengthens its role in global payments, it could also limit retail investors’ ability to exit positions efficiently when prices rise sharply. Both Claver and Diana urged investors to prepare before any significant rally begins. Their recommendations include moving assets from centralized exchanges to private wallets, establishing pre-set sell targets, and using limit orders rather than market orders to mitigate potential slippage. Analysts agree that although optimism around XRP’s long-term prospects remains strong, traders must be proactive in managing liquidity risks. Without proper planning, retail investors could face significant challenges in realizing profits when market conditions become highly volatile.

53599695,613384,1761350421,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53599695.jpeg,Analyst Says Understanding This Bitcoin Structure Is Like Having A Superpower,https://bitcoinist.com/understanding-this-bitcoin-structure/,"Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has shared a confident view of Bitcoin’s current market setup, describing the ability to read high-timeframe (HTF) structures as a superpower. His comments came at a time when Bitcoin had experienced notable volatility, fluctuating between $106,000 and $111,000 in recent days. According to the analyst, those panicking over short-term dips are overlooking what is a very healthy long-term structure that still supports a bullish trajectory to new Bitcoin price highs. The Superpower Of Reading Market Structure CrediBULL Crypto explained that understanding HTF inflection points and market structures separates confident traders from those who react emotionally to every correction. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s current setup is still structurally bullish, and its broader uptrend is intact, even if the price were to dip below $100,000. This outlook is in response to many crypto traders who are starting to turn bearish due to Bitcoin’s lack of strong bullish momentum in recent weeks. In his view, many market participants rely too heavily on external factors such as macroeconomic data or political events instead of focusing on what the charts are showing. He noted that chart literacy gives traders the clarity to stay calm during uncertainty. “Our HTF trend is intact and very healthy at current levels,” he wrote, stating that this is visible to anyone who understands how to properly identify market structure. To him, this ability is like a superpower, one that allows traders to see beyond noise and panic, focusing instead on trend integrity and higher-timeframe setups. The Path To Higher Highs CrediBULL Crypto’s comments were an extension of another post where he drew comparisons between Bitcoin’s current market behavior and its structure when it was trading around $58,000 in 2024. Back then, the invalidation level was set at $38,000, and even though Bitcoin dipped briefly, it never broke below that level before rallying above $100,000. He noted that the $74,000 level now holds the same importance that $38,000 did then, serving as a crucial line that confirms the continuation of the macro uptrend. The analyst added that traders often misinterpret large invalidation ranges as weakness. However, he maintained that such levels are a normal part of high-timeframe analysis. Whether the gap between spot price and invalidation is 5% or 20%, the important thing is to stay consistent with the structure and not allow emotions to override logic. CrediBULL Crypto’s chart projection outlines a continuation of Bitcoin’s larger-impulse fifth Elliott Wave. This large impulse wave is subdivided into smaller subwaves. The first subwave has played out successfully with a $37,500 move. The model implies that Bitcoin’s price could climb significantly higher once the current consolidation forms a confirmed higher low. The analyst projected the larger-impulse fifth wave at a peak price target of $200,000 . He also marked $74,445 as the HTF invalidation zone, meaning any sustained move below that would negate the current bullish count. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,120, up by 1.5% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CrediBULL Crypto|High-TimeFrame|HTF,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 00:00:21

Despite the ongoing consolidation, one crucial support zone is beginning to show signs of strength, hinting that a potential reversal could be on the horizon if buyers step in at the right moment. Momentum Hinges On RSI and BTC Dominance Levels Umair Crypto, in his latest update on Dogecoin, noted that the meme coin is currently consolidating just beneath the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), forming what appears to be a clear bearish setup. According to Umair, the structure suggests that the price could soon face rejection from this critical moving average, a move that may trigger a decline toward the $0.15 region, or potentially even lower if selling pressure intensifies. Related Reading: Dogecoin Awaits Risk-On Ignition As 2021 Pattern Repeats Despite the bearish tone, Umair highlighted that the $0.15 zone remains a crucial area of interest for buyers. He explained that this region could act as a strong bounce zone if the expected rejection occurs, offering the bulls a chance to defend the key support and potentially ignite a recovery from oversold conditions. On a more optimistic note, Umair pointed out that a recovery above the daily RSI trendline could change the short-term outlook for DOGE and fuel a move above the 200-day SMA, opening the door for renewed bullish momentum. However, Umair maintained a cautious stance for now until there’s a confirmed decline in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) below 59%. This shift would likely mark the beginning of a more sustainable upward phase, including Dogecoin. Dogecoin Regains Stability After Recent Correction In a more recent market update, BitGuru highlighted that Dogecoin is starting to display early signs of a potential recovery following its recent correction phase. After facing sustained downward pressure, the popular meme coin seems to be regaining some stability as its price action begins to level out. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Eyes Major Breakout, Is A Rally To $0.7 All-Time Highs Possible? BitGuru pointed out that DOGE has managed to hold firmly near a key support level despite recent volatility. This steady price action near the base suggests that buyers are gradually stepping back in, showing confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. The chart structure is beginning to curve upward, which often precedes a breakout or a notable shift in market sentiment He further explained that if this early momentum continues to develop, Dogecoin could be preparing for a breakout toward the $0.22–$0.25 range. A successful move in that direction would mark a meaningful recovery from its previous decline and could spark renewed interest from traders.

This matters because Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) use CPI data to calculate how much interest investors are owed. Without those numbers, payments cannot be calculated normally. TIPS work by paying lower base interest than regular government bonds, while the principal amount adjusts with the CPI. The CPI data is used with a two-month delay, which is why the late release of September numbers has not yet triggered any backup rules. But if the October CPI is not published by the end of November, fallback procedures will start for the first time. Fallback procedures create uncertainty Jonathan Hill, head of US inflation strategy at Barclays Capital, said this situation is similar to past moments when the national debt limit created concern about delayed Treasury payments. Jonathan said, “I’ve been saying this is the debt-limit equivalent for the TIPS market, something we all need to pay attention to and hopefully doesn’t come to pass.” But if the October data is still missing by late November, the fallback will apply not only to TIPS, but also to inflation swaps, which are contracts where a floating rate is exchanged for a CPI-based payment. Even if the CPI numbers are eventually released, their accuracy may be questioned. The White House said the government funding lapse has prevented price survey teams from gathering data, which means the CPI may not truly reflect conditions, and that uncertainty alone will definitely cause volatility. Investor demand reacts to data quality concerns Interest-rate strategists at Morgan Stanley, led by Aryaman Singh and Matthew Hornbach, said there are “concerns over deteriorating CPI data quality” due to weaker data collection during the shutdown. The strategists think this may be reducing investor demand for the roughly $2 trillion TIPS market, and may also explain why some exchange-traded funds that hold TIPS have recently seen outflows, while regular Treasury bonds have performed better. Aryaman and Matthew wrote , “As the data quality of CPI deteriorates, the demand for TIPS decreases as investors believe that they aren’t getting hedged against true inflation.” They added that weaker data could force TIPS to require a higher term premium than normal Treasuries. TIPS have already underperformed regular Treasuries since mid-July. One contributing factor has been a drop in oil prices, which pushed gasoline to its lowest level since December. Since gasoline makes up around 3% of the CPI, lower fuel prices reduce demand for inflation protection. At the same time, larger TIPS exchange-traded funds have not yet seen significant shrinkage. Investors who rely on these products for liquidity are not expected to exit suddenly. Jonathan said the disruption does not represent a major threat to the market unless it becomes long-lasting.Gang Hu, managing partner at Winshore Capital Partners and a specialist in inflation products, agreed, saying that as long as the CPI remains free from political interference, the situation should remain manageable. Gang said, “I don’t think it moves the needle here.” He added that if political interference were to occur, “we might be dealing with bigger problems before we deal with ‘Do people buy TIPS?’” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|U.S Treasury,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-25 00:05:23

A new study has discovered that the technology tends to “sycophantically” affirm users’ actions and beliefs, even when they are harmful, socially inappropriate or misleading. The scientists have warned that this “social sycophancy” raises urgent concerns over the power of AI to distort users’ self-perception and make them less willing to resolve conflicts. Researchers call on AI chatbots developers to address the risk This comes as chatbots are increasingly being used as a source of advice on relationships and other personal issues. With this, the AI tech however could “reshape social interactions at scale” according to the researchers, calling on developers to address the risk. According a Guardian article , the study, which was led by a computer scientist at Stanford University, Myra Cheng warns that turning to AI for personal, emotional or rational advice poses some serious insidious risks. The researchers found that common chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama, and the Chinese DeepSeek endorsed user behavior 50% more often than human respondents in similar situations. “Our key concern is that if models are always affirming people, then this may distort people’s judgments of themselves, their relationships, and the world around them.” Cheng. “It can be hard to even realise that models are subtly, or not-so-subtly, reinforcing existing beliefs and assumptions,” added Cheng. According to the Guardian, one test compared AI and human responses to posts on the Reddit forum “Am I the Asshole?,” where users ask the community to judge their behaviors. In one instance, a user admitted to tying a bag of trash to a tree branch in a park after failing to see a bin. While most human voters were critical of the action, ChatGPT-4o was supportive, declaring: “Your intention to clean up after yourselves is commendable.” AI Chatbots endorse users’ views The researchers also found that chatbots kept validating users’ views and intentions even when they were irresponsible, deceptive, or involved mentions of self-harm. In a follow-up experiment with more than 1,000 volunteers, participants discussed real or hypothetical social situations with either a publicly available chatbot or a version the researchers had doctored, to remove its sycophantic nature. The results of the test showed that participants who received fawning, affirmative responses felt more justified in their behavior – such as going to an ex-partner’s art show without telling their current partner. They were also less willing to patch things up after arguments, and the study also noted that chatbots hardly ever encouraged users to consider another person’s point of view. According to the study, users rated flattering chatbots more highly and said they trusted them more, suggesting that validation reinforces both user attachment and reliance on AI systems. This, according to the researchers, created what they described as “perverse incentives” – where both the user and the chatbot benefit from agreeable rather than honest exchanges. Dr Alexander Laffer, an emergent technology researcher at the University of Winchester said that this study was fascinating and highlighted a growing and unappreciated problem. “Sycophancy has been a concern for a while; it’s partly a result of how AI systems are trained and how their success is measured — often by how well they maintain user engagement.” Dr Laffer. “That sycophantic responses might impact not just the vulnerable but all users, underscores the potential seriousness of this problem.,” he added. Dr Laffer also added the critical need to enhance digital literacy. Cheng echoed warning and urging users to seek human perspectives. A recent study found that about 30% of teenagers talked to AI as opposed to real people for “serious conversations.” AI firms like OpenAI have pledged to build chatbots specifically for teenagers to create a safer space for the young users.

The bank’s analysts raised their rating to “Overweight” from “Neutral” and increased their price target to $404 per share, suggesting about 15% upside compared to present levels. JPMorgan noted that Coinbase is doubling down on its Base layer-2 blockchain and seeking to unlock more ways to capture more value from the platform’s growth. According to the bank, the launch of a Base token could represent a $12 billion to $34 billion market opportunity, with Coinbase’s retained share potentially worth $4 billion to $12 billion. Analysts suggest that the token’s distribution may give precedence to developers, validators, and the Base community. The report also highlighted potential margin expansion opportunities from changes to Coinbase’s USDC rewards program. JPMorgan noted that Coinbase may reduce interest rewards for most users, while offering them primarily to Coinbase One subscribers — a move that could add approximately $374 million in annual earnings at current USDC yields and interest rates. After the upgrade, COIN shares rose more than 9% on Friday to about $353. Data for YoY shows the stock is now up about 42%, pushing Coinbase’s market capitalization to roughly $90.6 billion. Analysts eye $12B–$34B opportunity from potential Base token launch Coinbase is scheduled to release its third-quarter results o n October 30. According to Zacks Investment Research , analysts anticipate the firm to post earnings of $1.06 per share, marking a 71% year-over-year increase, on revenue of $1.74 billion, a 44.1% increase from the same quarter last year. The upcoming report is coming on the heels of a mixed second quarter for Coinbase, which missed earnings but achieved several operational milestones, including growing stablecoin balances and revenue derived from stablecoins. The company has been working to fuel growth in its subscription and services segment, which is expected to contribute $665 million to $745 million in revenue during the third quarter. Among the major events in the quarter, Coinbase highlighted the passage of the GENIUS Act , which establishes a regulatory framework aimed at promoting the adoption of stablecoins within the United States. The company also noted that the House passed a broader market structure bill, seen as a step closer to greater clarity in crypto regulation. Coinbase’s Echo acquisition revives memories of the ICO boom On related development, Coinbase Global Inc.’s $375 million buy of digital asset investment platform Echo is evoking some not-so-distant memories—the boom times of less than a decade ago, when thousands of crypto projects raised billions of dollars by selling tokens directly to investors. Initial coin offerings, or ICOs, helped define the boom-and-bust cycle that made the general investing public aware of cryptocurrency for the first time. While the token sales came to a halt in 2018 after the speculative bubble that quickly developed burst and regulators cracked down on the scams that proliferated, Coinbase’s acquisition is seen by market participants as a signal that what’s old is new again. According to Coinbase’s statement announcing the acquisition, the company said the deal would help it build a “full-stack” solution for crypto fundraising. Cobie, the founder of Echo, said the company will continue to operate a standalone platform under its current brand for the time being. Still, he noted that they would integrate Sonar’s public sale product into Coinbase and likely establish new ways for founders to access investors.

The platform is called MultiSYG and it will be release in the first half of 2026 with a focus on institutions and high-net-worth clients who want “access to bank-level lending without having to surrender their assets fully into custody,” said the release. MultiSYG uses five total parties: Sygnum, the borrower, and independent signers. Any movement of collateral requires three signatures. The goal is to prevent rehypothecation, a practice where lenders quietly reuse client collateral to support separate financial positions. Borrowers can also check their funds on-chain throughout the loan period, according to the companies. Explaining the multisig structure Multi-signature wallets are often used for group-owned assets or corporate treasury operations because they require more technical knowledge than typical wallets, which usually rely on a single private key. In a regular wallet, there is one public address and one private key. The public address receives assets. The private key signs transactions and grants access to the wallet. Many consumers rely on software or hardware wallets that store private keys for them, requiring only a PIN or password to unlock. Multi-signature setups add extra security by splitting signing power across multiple parties.But they still come with risks.If the software managing the signatures is compromised, or if signers’ credentials are exposed, funds can still be at risk. Pascal Eberle, the initiative lead for Bitcoin projects at Sygnum Bank, said the setup allows borrowers to “hold your own keys while accessing regulated banking products and white-glove service.” Pascal added that borrowers would still receive bank-grade pricing, drawdown options, and flexibility in loan duration, while also maintaining cryptographic proof that the BTC remains in place. Still though, software and access credentials can be hacked and stolen, so while these wallets offer more security than other wallets, they can still be altered for malicious purposes.

This strategic move, initially reported by CoinDesk, marks a pivotal moment in Ripple’s expansion into comprehensive digital asset services, aiming to cater more effectively to the growing demands of institutional clients. What Does Ripple Prime Mean for Institutional Investors? The rebranding to Ripple Prime is more than just a name change; it signifies a deeper integration and a unified vision under the Ripple umbrella. Prime brokerage services are crucial in traditional finance, offering a suite of services to hedge funds and other institutional clients. These services typically include trade execution, clearing, settlement, custody, and financing. For the digital asset space, a robust prime broker like Ripple Prime can provide: Centralized Access: A single point of entry to multiple liquidity venues and exchanges. Enhanced Security: Secure custody solutions for digital assets. Efficient Trading: Streamlined trade execution and post-trade settlement processes. Risk Management: Tools and services to help institutions manage their exposure. This integration allows Ripple to offer a more complete ecosystem for institutions looking to engage with cryptocurrencies, reducing complexity and increasing operational efficiency. Why Is This Rebrand So Important for Ripple’s Strategy? Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road and subsequent rebranding to Ripple Prime underscores its ambition to become a dominant player in the institutional digital asset market. For years, Ripple has focused on cross-border payments with its XRP ledger technology. However, the firm has been steadily diversifying its offerings to include a broader range of services for financial institutions. This move is particularly strategic because: It addresses a critical need for institutional-grade infrastructure in the crypto space. It leverages Ripple’s existing relationships with banks and financial entities. It positions Ripple as a comprehensive solutions provider, not just a payment protocol. By offering prime brokerage services, Ripple aims to attract more traditional financial institutions into the digital asset fold, providing them with the familiar tools and reliability they expect. How Does Ripple Prime Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The emergence of strong institutional players like Ripple Prime is generally viewed as a positive development for the entire cryptocurrency market. As more established firms enter the space with robust, compliant services, it lends greater legitimacy and stability to digital assets. This can lead to increased liquidity, reduced volatility, and ultimately, broader adoption. Moreover, the competition among prime brokers in the crypto sector is heating up. This competitive environment encourages innovation and pushes service providers to offer better, more secure, and more efficient solutions. For institutions, this means more choices and higher quality services when venturing into digital asset investments. What Are the Benefits and Challenges Ahead? The benefits of a well-established Ripple Prime are clear: enhanced trust, improved efficiency, and a more accessible pathway for institutions into crypto. However, challenges remain. The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving globally, requiring constant adaptation and compliance efforts. Ensuring seamless integration across various digital asset platforms and maintaining top-tier security will also be paramount. Actionable Insight: For institutions considering entry into the digital asset market, evaluating prime brokers like Ripple Prime for their comprehensive service offerings, regulatory compliance, and security protocols is a crucial first step. Understanding their technological infrastructure and client support can significantly influence operational success. A New Era for Institutional Digital Assets The rebranding of Hidden Road to Ripple Prime is a powerful statement about Ripple’s long-term vision for the digital asset economy. It signifies a maturation of the institutional crypto market, moving towards more sophisticated and integrated financial services.

The news on Thursday increased investors’ confidence in crypto mining. Jane Street shared the news in a filing with the U.S. SEC and said the investments are passive and not meant to control the companies. Jane Street discloses 5% ownership in Cipher Mining Jane Street and its related companies said they now hold about 5% of Cipher Mining’s total stock (about 19.68 million shares). Of this amount, Jane Street Capital owns 0.2%, Jane Street Options owns 2.1%, and Jane Street Global Trading holds 2.7%. Jeremy Kahn, t he official representative for all Jane Street companies, signed the filing , which was then submitted under Rule 13d-1(c). Investors follow this rule when they buy company shares solely as an investment, not to exert control or influence over the company. Cipher Mining builds modern data centers that use high-powered computers to mine Bitcoin. Following Jane Street’s announcement, the company’s stock price increased by nearly 20% on Friday, reaching approximately $4.28. Just before Jane Street made this investment, Google announced that it had acquired a 5.4% stake in Cipher Mining in late September. Because both Google and Jane Street are now involved with Cipher Mining, Investors feel confident that the mining industry will expand. Bitcoin miners extend rally as sector outperforms Bitcoin After news spread that Jane Street had bought shares in several Bitcoin mining firms, investors began buying mining stocks, and the prices increased. A few Bitcoin miners had already gained between 8% and 13% by the end of Thursday. By the end of the day on Friday, Bitfarms (BITF) rose 10.68%, Cipher Mining (CIFR) climbed 19.73%, and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) increased 17.27%. American Bitcoin Corp. also increased by 11.29%, IREN Limited gained 12.60%, and Hive Digital Technologies rose 17.77%. These numbers showed that investors were moving money into companies that build and operate Bitcoin mining facilities, rather than just buying Bitcoin itself. Over the past year, large mining companies have invested in new and more powerful Bitcoin mining machines that use less electricity. They have also built bigger and more advanced data centers and negotiated cheaper electricity contracts to increase their profits. These upgrades keep miners profitable even when the price of Bitcoin is rising too slowly. At the same time, Bitcoin prices have remained high, which has restored investor confidence in the market. Over the past 12 months, Bitfarms increased by 131%, Hut 8 rose by 211%, and Bitcoin itself gained approximately 73%. Experts say that investments by Jane Street and Google have sparked interest among traditional investors in the industry. Additionally, improvements in global energy prices and clearer government rules have allowed companies to save more money and increase their production. The U.S. government and regulators have also begun working on clearer rules that enable companies to operate more openly, rather than creating new barriers. Mining companies don’t need to be afraid of sudden regulatory changes anymore and can now attract more investments to plan for future growth. On related developments, Chris Wright, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, recently proposed a new rule that would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish fair and efficient methods for facilities requiring more than 20 megawatts to connect directly to the bulk transmission system. This is because the electricity demand has never been higher, primarily due to the proliferation of AI infrastructure and large-scale cryptocurrency mining activities. The Secretary’s letter states that these sectors, which are now among the most energy-intensive in the U.S., require explicit rulemaking to accommodate them. Under the new rules, crypto mining companies and AI data centers can have their connections reviewed within 60 days, provided they cover the costs of upgrading the network. These companies usually have to wait a long time to connect to the U.S. grid. According to analysts , this change will enable miners to get started more quickly, which will help the U.S. maintain its competitiveness globally. The plan indicates that the administration is supportive of both technology and cryptocurrency, aiming to foster economic growth by promoting innovative ideas and concepts. Get seen where it counts.

Yet despite the sell-off, XRP bulls remain active as momentum builds. While XRP attempts to regain strength, investors are exploring new opportunities with stronger upside potential, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerging as a top alternative. This DeFi crypto has recently been named the best crypto presale of 2025 following stellar performance. Stage 6 which is now live has less than 30% of its initial allocation remaining. This speaks to the massive interest buyers are showing. MUTM’s explosive growth and innovative DeFi model have positioned it as the best crypto to buy now, and possibly the next crypto to hit $1 in the upcoming market cycle. XRP Price Prediction: Bulls Eye $2.80 Breakout Amid Volatile Market Conditions XRP continues to recover from the sustained bearish conditions following its drop on October 10th. On the 4-hourly chart, the token is in a contracting parallel channel below, which gives probability of an immediate breakout to the $2.80 resistance line also at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, which is an important zone for the confirmation of a bullish reversal. A close above this level of resistance will be required to win, which would result in a rally to $3.05 or even $3.40 in the near term. The momentum indicators are backing the recovery thesis with the RSI at 52 and the MACD lines heading for a bullish crossover, which suggests buyers in charge. A collapse of the momentum surge will jeopardize XRP dipping below $2.20, should risk-off sentiment in the overall market prevail. While investors sit with their breaths held waiting to see what’s next from the XRP, other investors are looking into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), what’s the best crypto to buy and next crypto to hit $1, picking up steam ahead of 2025’s anticipated boom in the market. Mutuum Finance Presale Sizzles in Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is igniting the crypto space as investor demand shoots through the roof in its Phase 6 presale. The token is currently on sale at the price of $0.035, which is 16.17% higher than Phase 5 and the lowest price at which it will be sold, giving early investors an amazing opportunity before prices rise to $0.04 in Phase 7. More than 17,380 investors have invested more than $17.8 million, and more than 70% of Phase 6 is sold. The strong presale performance signals building trust in Mutuum Finance’s upcoming lending and borrowing protocol and turning MUTM into what could be the next crypto to hit $1 in early-stage DeFi growth. Building a Secure and Community-Oriented DeFi Platform Mutuum Finance aims not only to construct a secure and scalable DeFi platform but also an active, user-driven ecosystem. Through its presale campaigns and current campaigns, MUTM has initiated a series of reward programs for users that directly involve investors as well as promote long-term stability of the project. For the sake of security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has joined forces with CertiK to launch an official Bug Bounty Program. Security engineers, developers, and bug bounty hunters are invited to discover and submit bugs on the platform, paying them from minor bugs to critical issues. A $50,000 USDT reward will be issued to participants of this activity. Mutuum Finance has raised more than $17.8 million from more than 17,380 investors and tokens of $0.035 are selling fast with more than 70% of Phase 6 already gone. Early birds can be part of its two-lending P2C and P2P network, enjoy passive income and flexible borrowing as they get ready for massive potential growth. Mutuum Finance remains the next crypto to hit $1 and continues to position itself as the answer for investors asking what’s the best crypto to buy.

Right now, a key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , is telling a clear story: it remains stalled at 24. This figure, provided by CoinMarketCap, isn’t just a random number; it offers crucial insights into which segment of the market is currently leading the charge. For any crypto investor, understanding this index is vital for navigating market cycles. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index and How is it Calculated? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is fundamental for any crypto enthusiast. It’s a straightforward yet powerful tool designed to gauge the performance of altcoins against Bitcoin over a specific period. This index helps you identify whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. The Core Metric: The index specifically tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Exclusions: To ensure accuracy, stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) and wrapped coins (like wBTC) are excluded from this calculation. This prevents their price stability or direct BTC correlation from skewing the results. Timeframe: The comparison is made over the last 90 days, providing a relevant snapshot of recent market trends. The Threshold: An “altcoin season” is officially declared when a significant majority – specifically, 75% of these top 100 altcoins – manage to outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day window. A score closer to 100 on the Altcoin Season Index indicates a robust altcoin season, where a wide array of alternative cryptocurrencies are seeing strong gains relative to Bitcoin. Conversely, a lower score, like our current 24, signals a “Bitcoin season,” meaning Bitcoin is largely outperforming the broader altcoin market. Why is the Altcoin Season Index Stalled at 24, Signaling a Bitcoin Season? The current reading of 24 on the Altcoin Season Index suggests that less than 75% of the top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. This isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm, but rather a reflection of prevailing market sentiment and capital flows. It highlights Bitcoin’s foundational role in the crypto ecosystem. Several factors often contribute to a “Bitcoin season”: Bitcoin’s Halving Cycle: Historically, periods leading up to and immediately following Bitcoin halvings can see renewed interest and capital flowing into BTC. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability, investors often seek refuge in perceived safer assets. Within crypto, Bitcoin is frequently viewed as the primary “store of value,” leading to increased demand. Dominance Cycle: The crypto market often moves in cycles where Bitcoin gains dominance, then altcoins catch up, and the cycle repeats. We might simply be in a phase where Bitcoin is consolidating its position. Lack of Strong Altcoin Narratives: Sometimes, the altcoin market lacks a compelling new narrative or breakthrough technology to attract significant capital away from Bitcoin. When the Altcoin Season Index is low, it means that while some altcoins might be performing well individually, the majority are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s momentum. This emphasizes the need for careful selection if you’re venturing into altcoins during such a period. Navigating the Current Crypto Climate: Tips for Savvy Investors A low Altcoin Season Index doesn’t mean you should abandon altcoins entirely. Instead, it calls for a more strategic approach to your crypto portfolio. Being informed and adaptable is key. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Prioritize Research: In a Bitcoin-dominated market, identifying altcoins with strong fundamentals, clear utility, and active development becomes even more critical. “Low cap gems” can still emerge, but they require diligent research. Consider Bitcoin as a Core Holding: If the index suggests a Bitcoin season, strengthening your Bitcoin position might be a prudent move. It often acts as a barometer for the broader market’s health. Diversify Wisely: While altcoins may be underperforming generally, a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk. Avoid overexposure to a single altcoin, especially those without a proven track record or strong community support. Risk Management: Implement strict risk management strategies, such as setting stop-losses or taking profits at predefined levels. Market volatility can be amplified for altcoins during a Bitcoin season. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on overall market sentiment, news, and technical indicators. These can provide early clues about potential shifts in the Altcoin Season Index . Understanding the signals, like the current Altcoin Season Index , empowers you to make better decisions and position yourself advantageously in the ever-changing crypto landscape. Looking Ahead: When Might the Altcoin Season Index Shift? The crypto market is cyclical, and the current Bitcoin season indicated by the Altcoin Season Index at 24 will not last forever. Several potential triggers could signal a shift back towards altcoin outperformance, bringing exciting new opportunities for investors. Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Often, after a strong run, Bitcoin will consolidate its gains. This period can allow capital to flow into altcoins, especially those that have been lagging, as investors seek higher returns. Emergence of New Narratives: Breakthroughs in specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, AI, or Layer 2 solutions can ignite interest and investment in related altcoins. A compelling new narrative can quickly shift the Altcoin Season Index . Reduced Bitcoin Dominance: As Bitcoin’s dominance (its market cap percentage of the total crypto market) begins to wane, it often creates room for altcoins to gain ground, indicating a broader market rally. Improved Macroeconomic Conditions: A more stable global economic outlook can encourage investors to take on more risk, potentially increasing their exposure to higher-beta assets like altcoins. Keeping a close watch on these macro and micro indicators will be essential for anticipating when the Altcoin Season Index might start to climb towards that coveted 75% mark, heralding a true altcoin season. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 24 serves as a vital snapshot of the current crypto landscape, clearly indicating a Bitcoin-dominated market. While altcoin seasons are exciting, understanding and navigating a Bitcoin season is equally important for strategic investment. By focusing on fundamentals, managing risk, and staying informed, investors can position themselves effectively for whatever the dynamic crypto market brings next. Remember, every season offers unique opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 24 signify? An Altcoin Season Index of 24 indicates that only 24% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This suggests we are currently in a “Bitcoin season,” where Bitcoin is generally performing better than the broader altcoin market. Q2: How is an “altcoin season” officially defined by the index? An altcoin season is officially declared when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin during the 90-day measurement period. A score closer to 100 means a stronger altcoin season. Q3: Should I avoid altcoins when the Altcoin Season Index is low? Not necessarily. A low Altcoin Season Index means the majority of altcoins are underperforming Bitcoin, but individual altcoins with strong fundamentals or unique narratives can still perform well. It emphasizes the need for thorough research and careful risk management. Q4: What factors could cause the Altcoin Season Index to rise? The Altcoin Season Index could rise if Bitcoin consolidates after a strong rally, allowing capital to flow into altcoins. The emergence of compelling new narratives (e.g., in DeFi, AI, or gaming), reduced Bitcoin dominance, or improved macroeconomic conditions could also trigger a shift. Q5: Where can I find the current Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is typically provided by platforms like CoinMarketCap, which calculates and displays this metric based on their methodology. Share Your Thoughts and Stay Connected!

53601379,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=843398,1761354052,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53601379.jpeg,Ethereum OG Drives $500M Liquidity Flow Into ConcreteXYZ & Stable Vaults – Details,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-og-drives-500m-liquidity-flow-into-concretexyz-stable-vaults-details/,"Ethereum is struggling to push above the $4,000 level, as market sentiment remains uncertain and volatility keeps investors cautious. Despite several attempts, bulls have failed to sustain momentum, suggesting hesitation at key resistance levels. However, new on-chain data is drawing attention to potentially large-scale liquidity moves that could influence Ethereum’s next direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH-SOPR Falls Below 1.0 for the First Time Since April – What This Means According to Lookonchain, an Ethereum OG holding 736,316 ETH (worth approximately $2.89 billion) recently deposited $500 million USDT into the vaults launched by ConcreteXYZ and Stable, just before their official announcement. This has sparked significant curiosity across the crypto community, as the transaction appears strategically timed and could signal preparation for major yield or liquidity activity. ConcreteXYZ is a next-generation liquidity protocol designed to connect institutional and DeFi capital through tokenized vaults. It allows users to allocate stablecoins and crypto assets into yield-bearing strategies while maintaining full transparency and composability within the Ethereum ecosystem. The whale’s massive deposit — preceding the public reveal — suggests potential insider positioning or high-conviction participation in these vaults. Such large inflows often act as early indicators of shifting liquidity dynamics, particularly when aligned with projects positioned at the intersection of DeFi infrastructure and institutional finance. Whale Dominance in Aave and Stablecoin Vaults Raises Strategic Questions According to Lookonchain, the same Ethereum OG who recently interacted with ConcreteXYZ and Stable deposited 300,000 ETH into Aave and borrowed $500 million USDT. Out of the total $775 million USDT deposited across the new vaults, this single whale accounted for 64.5% of the total liquidity, underscoring their dominant role in this sudden market activity. This move represents a sophisticated on-chain strategy often seen among experienced whales. By supplying ETH as collateral on Aave — one of the largest decentralized lending protocols — and borrowing USDT against it, the whale effectively unlocks liquidity without selling their Ethereum holdings. This allows them to deploy large sums into yield opportunities, such as the newly launched ConcreteXYZ vaults, while retaining exposure to ETH’s long-term upside. Such a concentration of liquidity from one entity can have several implications for the broader market. On one hand, it highlights growing confidence among deep-pocketed players in the DeFi ecosystem’s stability and profitability. On the other hand, it raises questions about market influence and systemic risk, since a single participant holds such a large portion of capital inflows. Related Reading: Chris Larsen Cashes Out: $764M In XRP Profits Since 2018 If this borrowed liquidity is used for yield farming or strategic positioning rather than short-term speculation, it could reinforce Ethereum’s ecosystem fundamentals by increasing DeFi activity and on-chain engagement. However, if market conditions deteriorate and collateral values fall, liquidations could amplify volatility. In essence, this massive Aave–ConcreteXYZ transaction demonstrates how whales leverage DeFi infrastructure to maintain dominance, optimize liquidity, and influence ecosystem-wide capital flows — making this one of the most significant on-chain moves of the quarter. Ethereum Rebounds but Faces Resistance Near $4,000 Ethereum’s price is currently trading around $3,964, showing signs of a modest rebound after recent volatility. The daily chart indicates that ETH has been attempting to recover from its October lows. But remains trapped below key resistance at $4,000–$4,200, where both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages converge. This is a zone that often acts as a strong rejection area during consolidation phases. Despite short-term gains, Ethereum’s broader structure still reflects uncertainty. The 200-day moving average, sitting near $3,200, continues to provide strong dynamic support, preventing a deeper breakdown. However, the inability to break above $4,000 has left the asset vulnerable to renewed selling pressure if momentum weakens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trapped On Binance: The Battle Between $107K and $119K Heats Up Volume patterns suggest limited conviction among buyers, as each rally attempt has been met with fading strength. To regain a sustainable bullish outlook, Ethereum needs a decisive close above $4,200. This would signal a potential continuation toward $4,500 and higher. Conversely, failure to reclaim that range could lead to a retest of $3,600–$3,500.

53603108,613359,1761354053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53603108.jpeg,Bitcoin Volatility Starts To Cool: Market Prepares For Potential Short Squeeze Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-volatility-starts-cool-market-short-squeeze/,"Bitcoin is struggling to establish a clear bullish structure in the short term, as selling pressure continues to dominate since the October 10 market crash. The asset remains caught in a volatile range, with traders unsure whether the next major move will mark the start of a recovery or the continuation of a broader correction. According to CryptoQuant data, volatility on the daily timeframe remains elevated — reflecting the ongoing uncertainty and aggressive repositioning among traders — but the slope of volatility is beginning to decline. This cooling could indicate that Bitcoin is gradually stabilizing after weeks of erratic movement, potentially setting the stage for a massive impulse move once momentum returns. However, analysts remain cautious about declaring a bullish reversal. Many point to the fragile macroeconomic backdrop — including fluctuating US Treasury yields, geopolitical risks, and investor rotation between risk-on and risk-off assets — as key variables that could determine Bitcoin’s next direction. For now, market sentiment remains mixed, with long-term holders showing resilience while short-term traders continue to exit positions amid uncertainty. Market Awaits As Bitcoin Consolidates Before Potential Rally According to top analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s current cooling phase may be a critical setup for the next bullish impulse. Adler explains that once the volatility index begins to decline, the market could finally start to realize accumulated short positions, potentially fueling a short squeeze that drives prices higher. This process often marks the transition from uncertainty to recovery — a pattern observed in past market cycles following high-volatility events. However, Adler cautions that this scenario depends heavily on the absence of external macro shocks. Any sudden rise in US Treasury yields or renewed gold strength could shift sentiment back into Risk-off mode, prompting capital outflows from risk assets like Bitcoin. In such an environment, even minor rallies could face swift rejection as liquidity retreats toward safer instruments. For now, the volatility slope is flattening, signaling that the extreme turbulence seen since the October 10 crash may be easing. This stabilization phase often precedes a significant move, as both bulls and bears reassess positioning. Some analysts share Adler’s cautiously optimistic view, suggesting that Bitcoin could be nearing a short-term bottom. The combination of reduced volatility, potential short covering, and cooling leverage ratios hints that market structure may be resetting in preparation for a bullish reversal. If macro sentiment stabilizes and risk appetite strengthens, Bitcoin could see renewed momentum toward the $115K–$120K zone. Until then, the market appears to be in a holding pattern — waiting for volatility to subside before confirming the next decisive move. Bitcoin Tests Resistance Near Amid Market Caution Bitcoin is currently trading around $111,326, showing a modest rebound after weeks of weakness following the October 10 crash. The daily chart highlights a clear sideways consolidation pattern, with BTC struggling to gain momentum above its 50-day moving average (blue line), which now acts as immediate resistance. The structure remains fragile, as the 200-day moving average (red line) around $106,000 continues to serve as a critical support level, repeatedly holding the price from a deeper breakdown. A sustained close above $112,000–$113,000 would be the first technical confirmation that bulls are regaining strength, potentially opening the door to a retest of the $117,500 resistance zone — a key liquidity level where sellers previously rejected the price. However, the broader trend remains neutral to slightly bearish as long as BTC trades below the cluster of moving averages. The market still shows hesitation, reflecting uncertainty across macroeconomic indicators and persistent risk-off sentiment. Bitcoin appears to be in a recovery attempt, but it needs stronger volume and a clear break above $113K to confirm bullish continuation. Otherwise, failure to maintain current levels could result in another retest of $108K–$106K, where buyer support remains concentrated.

His resignation marks another exit from the billionaire’s team, sparking endless debates among individuals. Nitti, who was appointed in January 2025, played a central role in shaping X’s advertising and monetization strategy during a critical period for the platform. He was once considered a potential successor to Linda Yaccarino as CEO. However, after careful consideration, he decided to depart on Friday, October 24, according to sources close to the situation. His exit marks the latest in a growing string of high-level departures across Musk’s businesses, including Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. The increased resignation from Musk’s company X raises endless debates Advertising remains X’s largest revenue source , but it has struggled to recover since Musk’s 2022 takeover. Several advertisers paused spending amid concerns about looser content moderation and brand placement. While Musk has introduced subscription tiers and AI tools to diversify income, ad sales remain central to X’s financial health. Yaccarino served as the CEO of X from mid-2023 until her resignation in July 2025. Since her departure, various leaders, including Angela Zepeda, the global head of marketing, and Nitti, who many industry experts believed could become the next CEO, were assigned to her role. Regarding Nitti’s departure, sources familiar with the situation noted that his exit followed a series of senior resignations from the company. An example is Mike Liberatore, who served as xAI’s chief financial officer. Liberatore exited after three months during the summer. Soon after his departure, Robert Keele, the general counsel, resigned. Notably, Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI obtained this social media platform X through an all-stock deal on March 28, 2025. Still, in early October, Mahmoud Reza Banki, the chief financial officer at X, who had served for less than a year, announced his withdrawal. At this point, individuals expressed concerns about the reason behind these exits. To address these discussions, sources close to the situation suggested that the turnover illustrated the frustration of some executives regarding Musk’s sudden shifts in strategy and the challenges they faced in attaining goals due to their billionaire boss’s direct approach. Additionally, analysts pointed out that Musk’s advertising team has been under constant pressure to maximize profits. This has intensified as the billionaire invests billions in infrastructure and works to create superhuman AI to compete with rivals such as OpenAI and Google’s DeepMind. At the same time, the tech analysts also mentioned that advertisers have been discouraged by Musk’s decision to ease content moderation regulations. This promotes his “free speech” beliefs and his harsh response to marketers who disagreed with him. Several sales chiefs express concerns over Musk’s business approach As more individuals adopt AI, the tech industry has undergone significant improvements. This has persuaded some brands to return, while xAI has recently signed media deals with companies including Disney. To attract more brands, the company has also informed them that its advertising performance is improving as a result of xAI’s AI technology, as stated in an earlier email. Still, a few advertisers have privately raised concerns about being forced to spend money on X after the platform sued several brands, including Shell and Pinterest, for allegedly participating in an illegal boycott. When reporters asked the companies whether the claims were true, they denied those allegations. On the other hand, an insider said that Nitti, a former Verizon executive, was among the sales chiefs who became fed up with Musk’s approach to managing the advertising business. In the meantime, sources have identified that Musk became distracted only during the first half of the year by his involvement in Donald Trump’s administration , with whom he finally split this summer after a disagreement with the president.

The company announced the move at the Plan B Forum in Lugano, stating that it aims to help creators earn and remain independent with crypto. Tether, which has already committed a sizeable investment in Rumble, is seen as providing the crypto-infrastructure and stablecoin (USDT/USAT) linkage. At the same time, Rumble brings the creator platform, user base, and distribution channel. Creators on the video-sharing platform will be able to receive Bitcoin tips directly from viewers, thereby supplementing their existing monetization streams (ads, subscriptions) with cryptocurrency payments. Rumble aims to position itself as a more creator-friendly, crypto-native alternative to traditional platforms like YouTube. Rumble teams up with Tether to add Bitcoin tips for creators Rumble’s CEO, Chris Pavlovski, announced the new feature at the Plan B Forum in Lugano, Switzerland, alongside Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. He said Rumble will roll out the feature between early and mid-December 2025 after a few tests. The new feature will work through the native Rumble wallet, allowing fans to send tips directly to their favorite creators on the platform. In turn, creators receive instant payments and don’t have to use other payment platforms with high fees. Popular content creator Viva Frei became the first person ever to receive a Bitcoin tip on Rumble during a demonstration of how the system works. Pavlovski called it a big moment for the Rumble community and said digital currencies like Bitcoin can make the internet fairer for everyone. The partnership with Tether also has its perks in this system. Tether invested $775 million in Rumble in December 2024 to support new projects, including the Bitcoin tipping system. CEO of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, stated that the tipping system will assist creators who struggle to access traditional financial services and protect others from being “debanked.” Rumble has always fought against censoring creators, so with this new system, users can control how they earn, spend, and grow their money. Rumble grows its crypto plans with Bitcoin treasury and new wallet Allowing tip-payments in Bitcoin could significantly change how creators earn. Instead of being solely reliant on ad revenue or platform-controlled subscriptions, they can receive value directly from their audience, and in a form of payment that may offer lower friction, global reach, and potentially better economics. Rumble also aims to establish a Bitcoin treasury and introduce a digital wallet for its users. The company currently holds Bitcoin, and earlier this year, it announced plans to invest up to $20 million of its cash reserves in Bitcoin. The video platform demonstrated its seriousness about its commitment by increasing its Bitcoin holdings to approximately $25 million by the end of the second quarter. The company is also collaborating with the crypto payment company Moonpay to launch a new digital wallet, enabling users to buy, store, and send digital assets directly through the Rumble app. Once it launches, creators will receive Bitcoin tips instantly from their fans, store them safely, and choose how to use or withdraw their funds. Rumble’s active user base went down from 9 million in the first quarter to around 51 million in the second quarter. However, analysts say its growing crypto features will attract new users, especially independent creators who want to avoid traditional financial systems that may limit or censor them. The company’s new Bitcoin tipping and digital wallet could also inspire other major platforms, such as YouTube, Twitch, or X (formerly Twitter), to develop their own systems. Rambo’s shares closed at $7.14 on Friday, which was slightly higher by 0.56% for the day. However, they remain down more than 45% since the year began, which shows just how weak the tech and crypto markets are. Despite this, Rambo is confident that its new crypto initiatives will improve its brand and business over time. Get seen where it counts.

Based on reports, that share translates to an estimated slice near 145 EH/s of computing power tied to Chinese influence. The figure, according to the Fourth Quarter 2025 update of Luxor’s Global Hashrate Map , places China behind two other major contributors and marks a return to a significant role after a sharp decline following policy moves in 2021. Hardware And Supply Chains Reports have disclosed that much of the world’s mining rigs are built by Chinese firms. Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan are still named as the main manufacturers. Because miners around the globe use that gear, the country’s grip on the supply chain remains strong. Equipment origin, spare parts and technical know-how often trace back to China, and that is one reason why Chinese influence stays visible even when machines run overseas. Moves After The 2021 Ban Changed Where Rigs Run In 2021, China ordered a wide crackdown on crypto mining and exchanges. Many large operations left for places like Kazakhstan and the US. Some groups moved quickly; others split their fleets across borders. Reports say that certain operations continued in hidden forms within China or were run by owners who used overseas subsidiaries. That mix of visible relocation and obscured activity makes it harder to pin down exact shares. Ownership And Hidden Activity Based on reports, between 55% and 65% of global mining capacity can be linked back to Chinese roots when hardware origin and ownership are counted together. Early data from 2022 had placed China near 21% in some measures, showing how estimates shift with method and timing. Hashrate snapshots depend on factors such as IP allocation, pool membership and reported ownership. As a result, different groups produce different country shares, and the numbers should be seen as snapshots rather than fixed totals. Energy Patterns And Security Concerns Hydropower in Sichuan and coal in northern regions once helped make Chinese mining cheap. Those energy factors shaped the old geography of mining inside China. Now that many rigs moved, energy mixes have changed and emissions footprints vary by host country.

Some technicians have pointed to a triple bottom trading pattern around $3600, as well as the potential for a new accumulation reading from a Wycoff re-accumulation pattern which could lead to higher targets (notably $5125 at the 1.618 extension.

The investor mood is stabilizing, with an inflow of capital into the older assets, indicating that the extreme optimism is gaining ground among key tokens. Analysts believe that this early rotation may mark the beginning of a more robust crypto market recovery into November. Nevertheless, attention is also shifting towards exciting projects at the initial stages. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has come out as a presale gem with its emphasis on security, utility, and investor protection. Bitcoin (BTC) Holds $108,000 as Institutional Demand Returns Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $108,000 on Wednesday following rejection at resistance of $113,600 the day before. The mood of the investors is still skeptical, but on the positive side, with the mild inflows indicating that investors are back after selloffs. Source: TradingView In the United States, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered inflows of $477 million on Tuesday, a day after two weeks of outflows. The renewed institutional investor interest has contributed to price stabilisation and ignited initial momentum behind the wider Bitcoin market recovery. The macroeconomic news has also been a factor. The positive view of future trade talks between the two countries by President Donald Trump favored risk appetite but the presence of geopolitical uncertainty still kept upside potential in check. Technical indicators indicate that BTC stands above its major support at about $106,000, the RSI at 40, and the MACD at a wary note. Analysts believe that holding the support of more than $108,000 would draw new inflows and establish the pace of an altcoin rally, which would be positively needed in the entire industry. XRP Price Struggles Below $2.40 but Confidence Persists Ripple (XRP) is trading just below 2.40, as it remains under pressure following its failure to rise to 2.55 earlier this week. The token has experienced less involvement in derivatives, with Open Interest (OI) averaging as $3.76 billion, compared to more than $8 billion in the early months of October. Source: CoinGlass Although the momentum is weak, analysts believe XRP is a valuable indicator of investor sentiment in mid-cap altcoins. The OI weighted funding rate has become marginally negative, indicating caution rather than panic. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 40 demonstrates moderate inflows which indicate that traders are waiting to observe a potential rebound. The Death Cross signal between the 50-day and 100 day EMAs is still putting some pressure on prices, but analysts observe that the 2.50 mark would be broken and the accumulation would start again. Altogether, the performance of XRP corresponds to a skeptical yet positive projection as traders anticipate more extensive market recovery. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Verified Presale Gem in a Volatile Market Bitcoin and XRP are at the forefront of the market recovery, which preconditions a new wave of optimism among key assets. However, with volatility reminding traders of the dangers in untrusted projects, there is still one presale that shines through – MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts refer to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a presale gem due to its established emphasis on security and long-term utility. The project has just undergone an extensive HashEx audit, which ensured that its smart contract has no vulnerabilities and is immune to manipulation or unauthorized access. This external assurance has increased investor confidence and confirmed the technical design of the project. In an uncertain market, investors are moving towards projects that focus more on security and realistic functionality. As opposed to speculative presales riding on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE fosters trust by providing transparency, validated code, and having a clear roadmap with a usability focus. These attributes have made MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most admired early-stage opportunities of the year. Its audited background and practical use, according to analysts, may lead to a 100x return once the next bull cycle kicks off, making it a cannot-miss presale gem. Conclusion The fact that Bitcoin is stable at around $108,000 and XRP is gradually consolidating at under $2.40 is an indication that the market is starting to recover. The confidence is being enhanced by institutional inflows and low volatility, providing a favorable environment to both large and emerging cryptocurrencies. Simultaneously, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in the spotlight because of all the right reasons: security, utility, and proven transparency. Its audited design and investor-first style are changing how serious presales should appear. Analysts say these basics lend it the credibility to perform better in the upcoming cycle and establish its image as a legitimate presale gem before the market goes bullish once again.

This move, reported by Onchain Lens, involves a well-known Bitcoin OG (Original Gangster) who has a history of liquidating substantial holdings. For many in the crypto community, such a large deposit to an exchange is typically interpreted as a precursor to selling, potentially signaling a shift in market dynamics. What Does a Bitcoin Whale Deposit Signify for the Market? When a substantial amount of Bitcoin, particularly from an “OG” or long-term holder, moves to a centralized exchange, it often raises eyebrows. These large holders, often referred to as “whales,” possess enough capital to significantly influence market prices. Their actions are closely watched as they can indicate upcoming market trends. Intention to Sell: The primary interpretation is an intention to sell. Moving assets from cold storage or a private wallet to an exchange makes them readily available for trading. Increased Supply: A large influx of BTC onto exchanges increases the available supply, which, if met with insufficient demand, can put downward pressure on prices. Market Sentiment: Such a move can also impact broader market sentiment, leading other investors to either follow suit or exercise caution. The term “Bitcoin OG” refers to early adopters or long-term holders who have accumulated significant amounts of Bitcoin over the years. Their deep understanding of the market and often long-term perspective make their moves particularly impactful. This specific Bitcoin whale deposit adds another layer to the complex tapestry of market indicators. Analyzing the Impact of This Specific Bitcoin Whale Deposit The recent Bitcoin whale deposit of 100 BTC to Kraken is not an isolated incident for this particular entity. Onchain Lens has consistently tracked this OG’s movements, noting a pattern of liquidating holdings at various market junctures. This consistent behavior suggests a deliberate strategy rather than a random transaction. However, the timing of such a large transfer always warrants careful consideration. Historically, significant exchange deposits have often preceded periods of increased volatility. While not every deposit leads to an immediate price crash, the potential for a large sell-off introduces uncertainty. Traders and analysts frequently monitor on-chain data, like exchange inflows and outflows, to gauge potential market shifts. This specific Bitcoin whale deposit adds another layer to the complex tapestry of market indicators. Consider the broader market context. If the market is already fragile or experiencing a downturn, a large sell-off could exacerbate negative sentiment. Conversely, in a strong bull market, such a deposit might be absorbed more easily without a dramatic price impact. Therefore, understanding the current market mood is crucial when evaluating the potential effects of this transaction. This situation highlights the importance of on-chain analytics. Platforms like Onchain Lens provide invaluable insights into the movements of large holders, allowing investors to make more informed decisions. Tracking these “whales” helps to anticipate potential supply shocks and understand the convictions of long-term holders. How Should Investors React to a Major Bitcoin Whale Deposit? For everyday investors, a major Bitcoin whale deposit like this serves as a reminder to stay vigilant and informed. It’s not necessarily a signal to panic, but rather an encouragement to reassess personal investment strategies and risk exposure. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Market Reactions: Keep a close eye on Bitcoin’s price action immediately following such reports. Observe trading volumes and overall market sentiment. Review Your Portfolio: Consider whether your current portfolio allocation aligns with your risk tolerance, especially in periods of potential volatility. Understand the Source: Recognize that while exchange deposits often imply selling, there could be other reasons, such as moving funds for institutional services, rebalancing, or even preparing for derivatives trading. However, for a known liquidator, selling is the most probable intent. Practice Risk Management: Implement stop-loss orders or consider hedging strategies if you are concerned about potential downward price movements. The crypto market is inherently dynamic, and large transactions are a part of its ecosystem. While a Bitcoin whale deposit of this magnitude can certainly create ripples, the market’s overall resilience and ability to absorb such movements have grown significantly over time. It’s about understanding the implications and preparing accordingly, rather than reacting impulsively. The recent deposit of 100 BTC to Kraken by a seasoned Bitcoin OG underscores the constant interplay of supply and demand in the cryptocurrency market. This significant Bitcoin whale deposit , tracked by Onchain Lens, serves as a crucial data point for investors monitoring potential selling pressure. While the exact outcome remains to be seen, staying informed about such on-chain movements is vital for navigating the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets. Vigilance and a well-thought-out strategy are your best allies in anticipating and responding to the actions of major market players. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin OG? A Bitcoin OG, or “Original Gangster,” refers to an early adopter or long-term holder of Bitcoin who has accumulated a significant amount of the cryptocurrency, often from its nascent stages. Their actions are closely watched due to their substantial holdings and historical market insight. Why is a Bitcoin whale deposit to an exchange significant? A Bitcoin whale deposit to an exchange is significant because it typically indicates an intention to sell. Moving large amounts of Bitcoin from private wallets to an exchange makes it liquid and ready for trading, potentially increasing supply on the market and influencing price. Does this specific deposit mean Bitcoin’s price will drop? Not necessarily. While a large deposit often signals potential selling pressure, the actual impact depends on various factors, including overall market demand, current sentiment, and how the whale chooses to execute their trades. It introduces uncertainty but does not guarantee a price drop. How can I track Bitcoin whale movements? You can track Bitcoin whale movements through on-chain analytics platforms and services like Onchain Lens, Glassnode, or CryptoQuant. These platforms provide data on exchange inflows/outflows, large transactions, and wallet activity, offering insights into market trends. What is Kraken? Kraken is one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. It allows users to buy, sell, and trade various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, and is known for its robust security and range of trading features. Did you find this analysis helpful?

If so, you’ve likely noticed the exciting momentum building around Spot Bitcoin ETFs . These investment vehicles are making significant waves, recently demonstrating robust investor confidence with substantial inflows. It’s a clear signal that institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin is not just growing, but actively translating into tangible investments. What’s Driving the Latest Spot Bitcoin ETFs Inflow? The cryptocurrency world buzzed on October 24th as Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a remarkable net inflow of $90.73 million. This wasn’t a one-off event; it marked the second consecutive day of positive flows, according to data provided by TraderT. Such consistent positive movement often indicates a strengthening market sentiment and increasing comfort among investors with these regulated products. This steady stream of capital suggests a deeper, more sustained interest beyond short-term speculation. Fidelity’s Leadership: Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge, attracting a substantial $57.92 million in inflows. This highlights the firm’s growing influence in the digital asset space and its commitment to providing accessible investment avenues for its clients. Their proactive stance resonates with investors seeking reliable exposure. BlackRock’s Contribution: Not far behind, BlackRock’s IBIT saw significant interest, bringing in $32.81 million. BlackRock, a titan in traditional finance, continues to demonstrate its strategic pivot towards digital assets, reinforcing the legitimacy of Bitcoin as an investable asset class. Market Stability: While Fidelity and BlackRock dominated, other Spot Bitcoin ETFs showed no major outflows or inflows. This indicates that the positive trend is concentrated among key players, but also that the broader market for these products is stable, rather than experiencing widespread volatility. These inflows reflect a growing understanding and acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. Investors are increasingly looking for diversified portfolios, and Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a familiar, regulated pathway to achieve this diversification. Why Do These Spot Bitcoin ETFs Inflows Matter for the Market’s Future? These consistent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just numbers; they represent a critical shift in how investors are approaching Bitcoin. When large institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity see significant capital deployment, it lends immense credibility to the asset class. This institutional embrace can pave the way for broader adoption and potentially greater price stability for Bitcoin itself. It signifies a maturation of the market, moving beyond early adopters to a wider investment community. Moreover, the accessibility offered by these ETFs is a game-changer. Investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, such as setting up wallets, managing private keys, or navigating unfamiliar crypto exchanges. This simplicity lowers the barrier to entry for many, including those who are new to cryptocurrency but familiar with traditional investment vehicles like stocks and bonds. It democratizes access to Bitcoin for a broader audience. The increased liquidity provided by these ETFs is another crucial benefit. As more capital flows in, the ability to buy and sell these products efficiently improves, reducing slippage and enhancing market depth. This is particularly attractive for larger institutional investors who require robust liquidity for their substantial trades. Navigating the Landscape: Opportunities and Challenges for Spot Bitcoin ETFs The burgeoning success of Spot Bitcoin ETFs presents both exciting opportunities and notable challenges. On the opportunity side, the growing investor base can lead to increased market capitalization for Bitcoin, further solidifying its position in the global financial landscape. It also encourages innovation within the financial sector as more firms explore digital asset offerings. However, challenges persist. Regulatory scrutiny remains a constant factor, with governments worldwide grappling with how best to supervise this evolving asset class. Changes in regulatory stance could impact the operational freedom or even the existence of certain ETFs. Furthermore, market volatility, while inherent to cryptocurrencies, can still pose risks for investors in these products. Educating investors about these risks, alongside the potential rewards, is paramount for responsible growth. Another aspect to consider is the competitive landscape. As more firms enter the Spot Bitcoin ETF market, competition for investor capital will intensify. This could lead to lower fees, which benefits investors, but also pressure on profitability for providers. Ultimately, the long-term success will depend on factors like fee structures, performance, and the overall economic environment. The Broader Implications of Growing Spot Bitcoin ETFs Adoption The increasing popularity of Spot Bitcoin ETFs has several profound implications for the future of finance and cryptocurrency. Firstly, it bridges the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. As more institutions offer these products, Bitcoin becomes a more integrated part of mainstream investment portfolios. This integration can unlock trillions in institutional capital that was previously hesitant to enter the crypto space directly. Secondly, it could influence regulatory landscapes. The success and responsible management of these ETFs might encourage regulators to develop clearer frameworks for other digital assets, fostering a more secure and predictable environment for the entire crypto ecosystem. This transparency and oversight are crucial for long-term growth and investor protection, potentially leading to a more harmonized global approach to crypto regulation. Finally, these inflows often act as a barometer for investor sentiment. Sustained positive flows suggest a bullish outlook, indicating that investors believe Bitcoin has significant upside potential. This collective confidence can create a powerful feedback loop, attracting even more capital into the market, driving further innovation and infrastructure development within the crypto sphere. The recent $90.73 million net inflow into Spot Bitcoin ETFs , prominently led by Fidelity and BlackRock, underscores a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency journey. It signifies not just a passing trend, but a deepening integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial portfolios. As these investment vehicles continue to attract significant capital, they are set to redefine accessibility, foster institutional trust, and shape the future trajectory of digital asset adoption. Keep a close watch on these developments, as they hold the key to understanding the evolving landscape of global finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A: A Spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that holds actual Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning or managing the cryptocurrency itself, trading like a traditional stock on an exchange. Q2: Why are recent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs significant? A: Significant inflows, especially from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity, signal increasing institutional acceptance and investor confidence in Bitcoin. This often leads to greater market legitimacy, liquidity, and potential price stability for Bitcoin. Q3: Who were the main drivers of the $90.7 million inflow? A: Fidelity’s FBTC led the inflows with $57.92 million, closely followed by BlackRock’s IBIT, which attracted $32.81 million. These two firms accounted for the vast majority of the positive movement. Q4: How do Spot Bitcoin ETFs differ from Bitcoin futures ETFs? A: Spot Bitcoin ETFs directly hold Bitcoin, reflecting its current market price. Bitcoin futures ETFs, on the other hand, invest in futures contracts that bet on Bitcoin’s future price, which can lead to different price tracking and potential contango/backwardation issues. Q5: What are the benefits of investing in a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A: Benefits include ease of access through traditional brokerage accounts, regulatory oversight, elimination of the need for crypto wallets or exchanges, and enhanced liquidity compared to direct Bitcoin purchases for some investors.

Specifically, the latest data reveals a notable trend: spot ETH ETF outflows have been a significant talking point, particularly with BlackRock leading the charge. This pattern suggests a shift in investor sentiment that warrants a closer look. What’s Driving the Recent Spot ETH ETF Outflows? According to data compiled by TraderT, U.S. spot ETH ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $93.73 million (approximately 134.9 billion won) on October 23. This marked the third consecutive day of withdrawals, painting a clear picture of sustained selling pressure from some institutional players. Digging deeper into the specifics: BlackRock’s ETHA, a prominent player in the ETF market, saw over $100 million in net outflows, indicating a substantial divestment from this particular fund. Conversely, Grayscale’s Mini ETH managed to buck the trend, recording $7.4 million in net inflows. This highlights a divergence in strategy or investor preference among different funds. The remaining ETFs tracked reported no significant fund movement during this period, suggesting that the outflows were concentrated in specific products. These figures are crucial for understanding the immediate market sentiment surrounding Ethereum-backed exchange-traded funds. A Closer Look at Institutional Sentiment Towards Ethereum ETFs When major players like BlackRock experience substantial spot ETH ETF outflows , it often prompts questions about the underlying reasons. Is it simply profit-taking after a period of gains, or does it signal a more cautious outlook on Ethereum’s short-term prospects? Several factors could contribute to such movements: Market Rebalancing: Institutional investors frequently rebalance their portfolios to maintain desired asset allocations. This could involve selling off positions in one asset to invest in another or to reduce overall exposure to a particular sector. Macroeconomic Concerns: Broader economic indicators, such as inflation data, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical events, can influence risk appetite. Investors might shift capital from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies to more traditional safe havens. Fund-Specific Dynamics: The outflows from BlackRock’s ETHA could also be specific to that fund’s investor base or operational decisions, rather than a universal sentiment against all Ethereum ETFs. Grayscale’s inflows support this nuanced view. Understanding these potential drivers helps in interpreting the data beyond just the headline numbers. Why Do Spot ETH ETF Outflows Matter to You? While these movements are primarily institutional, they can have ripple effects across the entire crypto ecosystem. Significant spot ETH ETF outflows can sometimes lead to increased selling pressure on the underlying asset, Ethereum, potentially impacting its price. For individual investors, it is essential to: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on institutional flow data, as it provides insights into how large players are positioning themselves. Avoid Panic: Daily or short-term outflows are a normal part of market cycles. A single three-day streak does not necessarily dictate long-term trends. Consider Your Strategy: Align your investment decisions with your personal risk tolerance and long-term financial goals, rather than reacting impulsively to daily market noise. These institutional actions are a piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture. Navigating Volatility: Understanding ETF Dynamics Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) provide a convenient way for traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly owning the digital assets. However, like any investment vehicle, they are subject to market forces and investor sentiment. The recent trend of spot ETH ETF outflows highlights the inherent volatility and rapid shifts that can occur in the crypto market. It underscores the importance of a well-researched approach rather than chasing headlines. In conclusion, while the recent spot ETH ETF outflows , particularly from BlackRock, indicate a short-term cooling of institutional enthusiasm, it’s vital to consider these movements within the broader context of market dynamics and long-term Ethereum potential. The contrasting inflows into Grayscale’s Mini ETH also remind us that institutional sentiment is not monolithic. Keeping an informed and balanced perspective is key to navigating the exciting world of crypto investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot ETH ETF? A1: A spot ETH ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why are BlackRock’s ETHA outflows significant? A2: BlackRock is one of the largest asset managers globally. Significant outflows from their ETHA fund can indicate a shift in institutional sentiment or strategy, potentially influencing market perceptions of Ethereum. Q3: Do these outflows mean Ethereum’s price will drop? A3: Not necessarily. While institutional outflows can exert selling pressure, Ethereum’s price is influenced by many factors, including broader market trends, network developments, and retail investor sentiment. These outflows are one data point among many. Q4: How does Grayscale’s Mini ETH inflow compare to BlackRock’s outflow? A4: Grayscale’s Mini ETH recorded $7.4 million in net inflows, contrasting with BlackRock’s over $100 million in outflows. This shows that while some funds are experiencing withdrawals, others are attracting capital, indicating diverse institutional strategies. Q5: What should individual investors do in response to these trends? A5: Individual investors should focus on their long-term investment strategy, stay informed about market developments, and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term institutional flows. Diversification and risk management remain crucial. Enjoyed this breakdown of the latest institutional movements in the crypto market?

ETH is the only one currently demonstrating the scale, utility, and institutional acceptance to command and securely hold multi-trillion-dollar allocations, fundamentally redefining the future of global wealth preservation and growth. Why Ethereum Is The Foundational Role For Institutional Capital Ethereum has quietly become the final form of digital trust for institutions to store trillions of dollars. A market expert and entrepreneur, partnering with OKX and MEXC, Ted Pillows, has stated on the social media platform X that ETH decentralization is nearly impossible to replicate, a network that was largely community-funded, not VC-funded, and forged through proof-of-work (PoW). Related Reading: The Inevitable Convergence: How Ethereum Became The Settlement Layer For All Altcoins Furthermore, the reliability of ETH has been 100% uptime over 10 years of flawless operation and 16 successful upgrades. The ETH Layer 1 and Layer 2 architectures are designed to offer regulatory safety, where institutions can deploy compliant solutions. Meanwhile, the KYC-enabled Layer 2s do not compromise on the fundamental decentralization or security of the leading ETH blockchain. Maintaining A Buffer For Market Opportunities While Ethereum is a safe place for institutional investors to store trillions of dollars, analyst Luca has noted that the ETH price has shown strength as it bounced off the Weekly Bull Market Support Band, which has previously acted as a strong reversal over several weeks. This level also aligns with the high-timeframe support area marked in green, the same zone that served as a major resistance throughout most of 2024. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Rejection Near Resistance Zone — Risk Of Deeper Correction Rises Luca believes that due to this confluence, and as long as the price holds above this range, the broader market structure will continue to favor the upside. However, ETH still faces a critical test ahead. Until it breaks above the golden pocket between the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement Point of Interest (POIs), the same zone that triggered the last rejection, the analyst highlighted that the best approach is to stay somewhat cautious. He also added that investors should be ready for further consolidation within the high-timeframe accumulation range. As Luca has highlighted, the priority now is risk management. Avoid unnecessary leverage, don’t overexpose on short-term setups, and maintain a diversified portfolio with moderate exposure to defensive sectors. This will help ride out the volatility as ETH moves closer to the top of the cycle. While advocating for a cash buffer, the expert noted that if ETH breaks below the Weekly Bull Market Support Band, it would signal a potential deeper downside and justify hedging part of spot holdings to mitigate short-term risk.

Polymarket Odds Surge as Traders React to CZ’s Release,https://bitcoinist.com/will-trump-pardon-sam-bankman-fried-polymarket-odds/,"Speculation is heating up in crypto circles as betting markets Polymarket surged on the possibility that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) could receive a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. Following Trump’s surprise pardon of Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, odds on prediction platform Polymarket for an SBF pardon skyrocketed from 5.6% to over 12% within 12 hours, with total wagers surpassing $66,339 in Volume. Polymarket Bets on SBF Pardon Double After Trump’s CZ Clemency A Polymarket market tracking whether Bankman-Fried will be released from custody in 2025 has seen heightened activity, spiking from 4.3% to 15% before stabilizing around 12%. The renewed interest reflects growing curiosity over whether Trump’s pro-crypto stance could extend to other high-profile figures in the industry. Bankman-Fried, currently serving a 25-year prison sentence for fraud and conspiracy, is appealing his conviction, but analysts suggest no ruling is likely before the end of the year. That makes a presidential pardon his only realistic path to early release. Trump’s CZ Pardon Fuels Comparisons, and Controversy The surge in betting odds came shortly after Trump pardoned CZ, who had served four months for Anti-Money Laundering violations. Trump claimed Zhao was “persecuted by the Biden administration” and that his actions were “not even a crime.” Crypto analysts were quick to compare CZ’s relatively minor compliance breaches to Bankman-Fried’s sweeping fraud case, which involved misappropriating billions in customer deposits. “CZ’s wrongdoing was compliance-related and nowhere near the scale of SBF’s,” said crypto lawyer Sasha Hodder. Similarly, attorney Jake Chervinsky said he would be “truly shocked” if Trump granted Bankman-Fried clemency, citing his role as a “Democratic mega-donor” and the political optics surrounding FTX’s collapse. Political Ties Could Make or Break SBF’s Pardon Hopes Reports suggest that SBF and his family are quietly lobbying for leniency, with his parents reaching out to figures close to Trump. He has also made appearances on conservative media platforms, attempting to recast himself as a victim of political bias. However, unlike CZ, who has close ties to Trump’s circle through the World Liberty Financial crypto venture, Bankman-Fried lacks direct political connections. Experts believe that makes his chances of a pardon slim despite rising Polymarket odds. Nonetheless, the renewed speculation shows how Trump’s pro-crypto gestures are molding the narrative around justice and power in digital finance.

However, we decided to add a bit of positivism and asked four of the most popular AI-powered chatbots whether a rally to $1 is possible this quarter. ‘A Big Stretch’ PI currently trades at around $0.20 (per CoinGecko), representing a 30% decline on a monthly basis and a massive collapse from its all-time high of $3 registered in February this year. According to ChatGPT, rising to $1 before the end of 2025 is not entirely impossible but “a big stretch.” The chatbot estimated that reaching that milestone would require major catalysts, such as mainnet milestones and official listings on leading crypto exchanges. Perhaps a green light from Binance could trigger a significant rally. Earlier this year, the company asked its users whether they wanted to see PI available for trading on the platform. Despite the majority picking the “yes” option, it has remained silent on the matter. Grok also claimed that hitting the $1 mark during Q4 would be extremely difficult. The chatbot built into the social media platform X argued that this is only possible in the event of major partnerships between Pi Network and renowned industry players and broader market euphoria. “Realistically, expect sideways trading or modest gains to $0.30 – $0.40 if catalysts align, or dips to $0.15 – $0.18 on continued selling. PI’s strength lies in its community (biggest edge over rivals), but it needs proven utility to sustain value,” it added. Google’s AI chatbot Gemini sees little chance, too. It considers a small probability of PI soaring to almost $0.50 during Q4 and describes the $1 target as “a very optimistic case.” Gemini outlined the constant token unlocks as the primary hurdle for a price expansion. Data shows that over 120 million PI will be released in the next 30 days, giving investors the opportunity to cash out and thus potentially drag the valuation down. PI Token Unlocks, Source: piscan.io Not a Chance at All? Perplexity seems to be the biggest pessimist, predicting that PI won’t reach anywhere near $1 this quarter.

In a wide-ranging conversation on Messari’s “Fully Diluted” (Oct. 23) with host Dylan Bane and Messari researchers, Mumtaz framed Zcash as “secret Bitcoin”—a full-stack, zero-leakage design for money that Bitcoin’s earliest architects wanted but could not ship with 2010-era tooling. Zcash Proves Satoshi Right “The simplest conceptual way to understand this is that it’s a secret Bitcoin. It’s an encrypted Bitcoin,” Mumtaz said, invoking early forum posts from Satoshi and Hal Finney. “You have forum posts of Satoshi and Hal [Finney] saying things like, ‘If we knew how to add ZK proofs to Bitcoin, it would make it a better Bitcoin.’ But this is 2010 and they didn’t have the tech. And since then, the tech has been made.” In his telling, that lineage matters: Zcash inherits Bitcoin’s monetary template while replacing probabilistic obfuscation with “pure encryption.” if you want to understand why certain Bitcoin maxis are violently coping and lashing out about a small 3B coin they are threatened and have lost the plot Satoshi in 2010: if we could add ZK to Bitcoin, a much better BiTC would be possible. Sadly, I don’t know how. pic.twitter.com/2c4Y5SIhT6 — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) October 21, 2025 Mumtaz’s critique of “bolt-on” privacy was unambiguous. Privacy, he argued, is not a feature toggle; it is a system property that must be designed from the ground up to minimize information leakage across the entire stack—wallets, RPCs, mempools, validators, bridges, and application UX. “Privacy is not, in my view, something that can be bolted on,” he said. “You have to start from first principles and approach the problem from a vertically integrated full-stack solution.” He contrasted Zcash’s shielded pool with approaches like Monero and mixers that rely on decoys: “With Monero… you’re introducing probabilistic decoys… it’s that cups-and-ball game… with Zcash there is no obfuscation, it is a pure encryption—if the ball just didn’t exist at all.” The immediate catalyst behind Zcash’s rally, Mumtaz suggested, was less a single headline than a confluence: product-level UX improvements, a shifting policy backdrop, and attention—both supportive and hostile— compounding on social media . He pointed to the new Zashi wallet as a turning point: “People are actually able to use this new Zashi wallet to have some fun… sending each other private messages and shielding stuff and tipping each other.” He also argued the market had “over-indexed on extremely weird coins” while neglecting “privacy ideals,” leaving Zcash’s market cap “pathetically low” relative to its potential at the moment he began highlighting it. Regulation loomed over privacy the last few years. Mumtaz was blunt about the chilling effect of enforcement on privacy R&D: “People were scared of going to jail for even launching tokens, let alone writing privacy code. And there’s people still in jail for this.” He sees parts of the US moving in a friendlier direction under US President Donald Trump, while parts of Europe move toward surveillance and scanning of private messages. That divergence makes long-range forecasting difficult, he cautioned, but it reinforces why the industry should “guard zealously people’s right to privacy” as crypto’s legal status improves elsewhere. “There’s people in jail for writing privacy code, but not for launching scams. That seems like a pretty big problem that we need to correct.” Bitcoin, Solana And ZEC On the perennial question—why not add robust privacy to Bitcoin directly?—Mumtaz cited both governance inertia and technical realities. Bitcoin core changes are hard by design, he said, and privacy demands more than a script-level patch. “Unless you are designing with leaks minimized from the bottom up, the leaks kind of add up… It just takes one leak to compromise that privacy.” Zcash’s roadmap featured prominently. Mumtaz expects the Tachyon work spearheaded by Sean Bowe to address “state growth” and lay “foundations for scaling,” cleaning up legacy design choices that waste compute, such as brute-decoding notes. He called for pragmatic fee markets to mitigate spam and for improving mining decentralization as price action draws new hashrate. But he rejected, in its current form, the “Crosslink” hybrid PoW/PoS finality proposal: “It’s a bad idea… With a privacy system especially, the more moving pieces you introduce, the more attack surface increases… It’s unclear to me what exactly you’re gaining from this other than kind of a new finality time.” If given a token-holder vote, he said he would vote against it unless substantially revised. Mumtaz repeatedly returned to an “atomic unit” framing of privacy: information leakage. He extended that lens to bridges and cross-ecosystem liquidity. Helius helped bridge ZEC exposure into Solana via NEAR, but he stressed users give up Zcash’s privacy when they hold it on Solana. “Once that asset is on Solana, you don’t have the privacy benefits… You can bridge it back and deposit in the shielded pool… then you get the privacy back, but while you’re on Solana you’re not going to have the same privacy as the private blockchain.” The utility, for now, is market access and DeFi composability rather than end-to-end confidentiality.

The objective is to ratchet the floor higher each cycle by converting narrative into durable engineering and sensible legislation. “It’s on the builders… to use that momentum… to actually drive forward sensible legislation and harden the engineering of these systems such that they endure in scale and are usable for many people.” Asked to handicap the 2030 leaderboard, he demurred on precise ordering but volunteered a long-horizon view in which Zcash belongs in the conversation alongside Bitcoin and Solana: “If you were to tell me 20 years then I’m going to say Bitcoin, Solana, ZEC.” At press time, ZEC traded at $267.",Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|btc|Helius Labs CEO|Mert Mumtaz|ZCash|Zcash News|ZCash Price|ZEC|ZEC News|ZEC price,EN,0,0,BTC|SOL|ZEC|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 04:00:19

In a wide-ranging conversation with Real Vision’s Raoul Pal, the pair frame the current rally—and what comes next—through the lens of policy error, structural deficits, sticky inflation, and the slow-rolling migration of institutional and sovereign portfolios into digital assets. The Debasement Trade Powers The Crypto Bull Run Morehead’s starting point is blunt: “We have full employment. Inflation is debasing our assets by 3% a year… and they’re cutting rates. Like, it’s crazy.” He calls 2020–2021 “a policy error”—“there was a time where inflation was 8%, and the Fed Funds rate was zero”—and says easing into today’s backdrop “when everything’s booming” undermines the monetary check on “record fiscal deficits.” The consequence, he argues, is that price levels across real assets look high not because they are rallying independently, but because the denominator is falling: “It’s the price of paper money that’s plummeting.” Related Reading: Is The Crypto Bull Run Over? Lekker Capital CIO Warns ‘Don’t Miss The Forest’ Pal extends the frame to a single macro factor. “We use [Global Macro Investor’s] total global liquidity index as our benchmark for debasement. The Nasdaq, since 2012, has a 97.5% correlation, and Bitcoin is about 90%.” In his words, “None of it matters. It’s all one trade.” The implication is a regime where liquidity and debasement overwhelm the usual cross-asset nuance: “It’s the greatest macro trade of all time.” That regime, in Morehead’s view, also explains why adoption keeps broadening. The pair note how the “debasement trade” has migrated from crypto-native circles into bank research. “JP Morgan’s talking about it. And I got an email from Goldman today, the debasement trade,” Morehead says. “I’ve been talking about it for 12 years.” Pal adds that even large banks “openly” talk about currency debasement now, while clients are being offered wider access to crypto exposure. The wedge, they contend, remains institutional under-allocation. “How can you have a bubble nobody owns?” Morehead asks. “The median institutional investor’s exposure to crypto and blockchain ventures is literally 0.0.” Asked where steady-state allocation could land, he points to “8 or 10” percent over time, echoing Pal’s observation that many family offices that start at 2% “end up being 20% really fast” as price action mechanically increases weightings and conviction follows. Morehead also sees policy politics and geopolitics accelerating adoption. He argues the US election reset a regulatory headwind—“we went from… aggressively negative… to being extremely positive”—unlocking public pensions and sovereign funds that “got scared away in 2022” after the FTX/Luna/Celsius cascade and high-profile enforcement cases. He goes further, sketching a sovereign “arms race” for reserve Bitcoin: US holdings via seizures, “roughly the same” in China, and GCC states “aggressively getting into the blockchain space,” with room for acquisitions “tiny compared to balance sheets.” In his phrasing, if multiple blocs each target million-coin stockpiles, supply dynamics could “squeeze up like a watermelon seed.” Why This Crypto Bull Run Extends Into 2026 If liquidity and adoption anchor the bull case, both still respect crypto’s cyclicality. Morehead has modeled four-year dynamics around halvings and says Pantera’s prior cycle targets hit with eerie precision: “We forecast… Bitcoin would hit $118,542 on August 11th, 2025. And it did… one day [early].” He also notes past peaks coincided with celebratory “events”—the 2017 CME futures listing and 2021 Coinbase direct listing—followed by ~85% drawdowns. Yet he argues “this time” may be meaningfully extended by the policy and allocation backdrop: “The regulatory changes in the US, I think just trump everything… I think the next six to 12 months are still a big rally.” Pal, while acknowledging the internet’s penchant for hanging forecasters, concurs: “I think it’s going to extend.” Related Reading: Russia’s New Crypto Framework Could Redefine Global Trade Amid Sanctions Pressure The social dimension of adoption runs through the conversation. Debasement’s distributional effects have made housing and rents the stickiest CPI components—“35% of [core CPI] is shelter,” Morehead says—pushing younger cohorts toward hard assets. Meanwhile, the “virality rate of crypto is like 95%,” he claims: “you get a smart person… to think about it for an hour, they’re all like, ‘Oh yeah, I should buy some crypto.’” Evangelists matter, too: “Michael Saylor has done a great job. He has Messianic following… Tom Lee [on ETH]… We’re gonna endeavor to do that on Solana.” Visibility through ETFs, DATs, and media segments pulls newcomers into the funnel, where small initial slices tend to scale. As Pal puts it, investors who lack exposure feel “like you’re short the upside calls.” I love it when technology, crypto, and macro come together in someone’s journey… and there’s no one better than my dear friend @dan_pantera, an OG in the space! Please enjoy pic.twitter.com/ShZAd2tB3u — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) October 23, 2025 For all the optimism, the macro warning lights stay on in the background: structural US deficits “literally in the best of times,” a monetary-fiscal loop trapped between refinancing needs and price stability, and a demographic drag on productivity that leaves AI-driven gains still ahead of the curve. “Debasing your fiat currency against everybody else’s fiat currency is a race to the bottom,” Morehead cautions. In that world, gold and crypto function as life rafts: “That’s why everything’s at record prices… except for paper money.” Both men close by zooming out. The internet is “53 years old and they’re still doing cool internet companies,” Morehead says; Bitcoin turning 17 means the asset class remains a teenager. The majority of institutions “still have 0.0” exposure. If the “one trade” persists—liquidity up, fiat down, adoption rising—then the path of least resistance, in their telling, still points higher. Or as Morehead compresses the thesis into a single line: “If you hold crypto for four or five years, I think it’s like 90% that you make money… It is that simple.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.7 trillion.

The new platform enables participating banks to create tokens that represent insured deposits. This means they can transfer traditional bank money onto a blockchain while maintaining all the standard protections and complying with regulations. Analysts refer to the new platform as a solution for real-world transactions Sources have acknowledged that Custodia and Vantage’s setup ensures tokens strictly adhere to US banking rules and comply with the GENIUS Act . This crypto legislation allows specific bank-issued stablecoins to be treated as deposit instruments rather than securities. These tokens imitate the characteristics of digital dollars that can change depending on the location they are situated. For instance, in a participating bank, they act like regular tokenized deposits , completely insured by the FDIC, and follow banking rules. Nonetheless, they function like a stablecoin when they shift to another institution or wallet. During an interview, Caitlin Long, the founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, weighed in on the topic of discussion. Long pointed out that the network handles these changes using a patent-pending protocol that integrates both an on-chain oracle and off-chain operational controls. She also mentioned that the platform utilizes Infinant’s APIs and ledger infrastructure to facilitate conversions between different forms. “The crucial point is that the same token, created through the same smart contract, can change who is responsible for it and its regulatory status as it goes through its life cycle without needing to be redeemed or converted,” the CEO of Custodia Bank explained. Meanwhile, unlike the previous proof-of-concept that tested Vantage’s Avit token on Ethereum, analysts express that this new version is designed for real-world transactions. Dan Dadybayo calls for efficiency in the banking industry When questioned about the underlying infrastructure, Long stated that the platform operates on a permissionless network. She also highlighted that three different trial transactions had already been made using Ethereum in March, and work is underway for Bitcoin. According to the CEO of Custodia Bank, this model demonstrates how Custodia and Vantage are committed to eliminating obstacles rather than creating new ones. Following the CEO’s remarks, analysts stated that this approach for open access and interoperability appears to be a step in the opposite direction of what has become the norm. They observed that major stablecoin issuers and payment platforms either build their own chains or support unique systems. In the meantime, an FAQ provided by Long in response to questions from reports pointed out that, “While many stablecoin issuers rely on complex legal structures that create their own issues, we are using a legal framework that promotes interoperability within the law.” The two banks are building a compliant settlement layer that moves insured dollars at blockchain speed and offers the same level of safety, Dan Dadybayo, research and strategy lead at Unstoppable Wallet, said. Dadybayo further explained that the Fed can continue monitoring transactions through participating banks. However, he acknowledged that for the first time, smaller institutions can compete on efficiency and programmability. According to him, if more individuals adopt this approach, they could quietly transform the current network into a parallel payments network built from within the system, rather than against it.

As the top meme coin to buy now, this project merges meme culture with serious tokenomics, creating a blend that’s equal parts fun and financially fierce. Its Stage 5 presale, priced at $0.00006584, has already raised over $450K, with 1,500+ holders ready to charge. The ROI projection soars above 9,256%, giving early investors a ticket straight to the moon. Imagine this: an investor dropping $15,000 at Stage 5 would see their bag balloon to $1.4M, when the price hits $0.00616. That’s financial freedom knocking, peanuts compared to the potential payoff later. The MoonBull presale isn’t just hype; it’s a carefully planned 23-stage model that builds scarcity and excitement with every step. Voting Power: Giving the Community a Voice MoonBull’s governance kicks in at Stage 12, where 1 $MOBU equals 1 vote. This system empowers holders to decide the project’s path – from burns to campaigns. No middlemen, no gimmicks. Just pure decentralized democracy. This transparent structure enhances community trust, proving why MoonBull truly earns its place as the top meme coin to buy now. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Roaring Giant Ready to Charge BullZilla stands tall in its 7th presale stage, boasting over $960,000 raised and more than 3,200 holders. Its current price sits at $0.00018573, projected to rise to $0.0001924 in Stage 8A. For early joiners, the ROI is already 3,130%, and those who entered at Stage 7D see potential gains of 2,738% up to listing. It’s no wonder many in the crypto community are keeping their eyes glued to this bullish beast. BullZilla’s momentum mirrors the energy of meme coins during their prime – loud, confident, and untamed. Yet, compared to MoonBull’s structured scarcity and deflationary model, BullZilla runs a more traditional hype engine. Still, the community support is undeniable. Many investors view it as a promising project, but the top meme coin to buy now tag might just tip toward MoonBull given its sustainable approach and stronger presale model. La Culex ($CULEX): The Hum Before the Storm La Culex sits in Stage 2: Midnight Hum, with a current price of $0.00002104, aiming for $0.00002274 next. It’s raised around $6,000, signaling early traction. The project blends mystery and anticipation, drawing in curious investors who sense potential under the radar. Though La Culex is still small compared to the charging giants, it could surprise the market if momentum builds in later stages. However, compared to the MoonBull presale, La Culex’s pace feels more cautious. While it’s gathering steam, it lacks the structured tokenomics and staking rewards that make MoonBull the top meme coin to buy now. Still, early backers who believe in the “slow and steady” approach might find its low entry point attractive. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, BullZilla and La Culex show remarkable diversity in the meme coin landscape. BullZilla charges ahead with its high ROI and strong presale backing, while La Culex quietly builds buzz through subtle growth. Both showcase the wild spectrum of crypto – from roaring bulls to humming underdogs – but neither seems to match the calculated power of MoonBull’s tokenomics and presale strategy. For those searching for the top meme coin to buy now, the edge clearly tilts toward MoonBull. MoonBull is rewriting the playbook for meme coins. With deflationary mechanics, community-driven governance, and a 95% APY staking reward, it’s built to last beyond the hype. The MoonBull presale is more than a moment – it’s a movement. Early entrants can still secure life-changing gains before the final stages close. Join the herd before the gates lock. MoonBull isn’t just the top meme coin to buy now – it’s the bull leading the charge toward the next crypto moonshot.

But after pioneering a comprehensive legal framework for yen-pegged stablecoins, its bank-dependent structure has been called out for limiting innovation in the decentralized finance sector. In Asia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan are in the spotlight for rolling out licensing rules for stablecoin operators. While regulators celebrate Japan’s legal clarity, its inward-looking framework could leave the country lagging behind regional peers like Singapore and Hong Kong, warns Professor of Economics Sayuri Shirai at Keio University. Under Japan’s current framework , Shirai doesn’t see momentum for stablecoins taking off. She explains that Hong Kong’s regulations are much more stringent than Japan’s. But they are also more open to non-banks and international players issuing stablecoins, which is a significant difference. “Hong Kong and Singapore are open to outsiders as long as they meet regulations. Also from the beginning, they have been thinking about developing tokenized assets and cross-border transactions. But Japan from the beginning is very domestic.” Stablecoin rules prioritize domestic transactions Japan’s “pioneer” status stems from the 2023 amendment to the Payment Services Act (PSA), which restricted stablecoin eligibility to banks, trust banks and licensed wire transfer providers. Non-bank stablecoin issuers are required to partner with Japanese banks. The framework is among the most robust worldwide in terms of user protection. The amendment introduced strict safeguards such as full trust protection of reserves, redemption guarantees and periodic transparency reports. Associate Professor Tomonori Yuyama at Senshu University’s Faculty of Commerce said the framework reflects Japan’s emphasis on financial stability. “Stablecoins resemble digital deposits and involve custodial responsibility so it makes sense that only highly-regulated issuers are allowed. Given that stability is paramount and full backing is mandatory, limiting issuance to major financial institutions is a valid measure.” Yuyama also warns that Japan’s yen-backed stablecoins could disconnect it from global blockchain ecosystems. “Japan’s yen-based stablecoins circulate within closed systems and can’t connect with global DeFi or Web3 ecosystems, putting Japan’s digital economy at risk of isolation.” Japan’s regulatory framework has effectively barred major global stablecoins such as Tether and USDC. Since foreign issuers lack domestic licenses, the tokens can’t legally move through Japan’s regulated exchanges or payment networks. Yuyama said the restriction reflects Japan’s preference for consumer protection even at the cost of limiting access to global digital markets. “Major global stablecoins such as Tether and USDC are practically unusable in Japan. Ideally, a system enabling their safe use would be desirable. But, since these issuers are foreign, Japanese users might not be legally protected which poses a user-protection issue.” A lack of strong consumer demand Japan has embraced new rules to bring stablecoins under official oversight, but few people seem eager to use them. Professor Sayuri Shirai of Keio University explains that consumers already enjoy a variety of digital payment options, from PayPay to Apple Pay , that make cashless life accessible. In a country where nearly a third of citizens are over 65, Shirai said many consumers are content with existing payment options which leaves little momentum for new digital currencies to take hold. Stablecoins also lack appreciation potential and are yet to offer a compelling alternative, according to Shirai. Japan’s stablecoin issuers search for profit Stablecoin issuers in Japan face a tougher path to profitability compared to their counterparts in the United States. Associate Professor Tomonori Yuyama at Senshu University said issuers rely mainly on interest income from reserve assets, a model supported by higher U.S. yields but constrained by Japan’s less than 1% interest rates. While some stablecoin issuers may plan to earn fees from payments or remittance services, Japan’s model requires large transaction volumes. Strict rules mandating full reserve backing and investment in low-risk assets further limit returns, Yuyama said. Japan’s underdeveloped tokenized-asset market Shirai emphasizes that Japan must develop its tokenized asset market if it wants stablecoins to gain traction. She argues that, at present, there is almost no functioning market for tokenized assets in Japan unlike the United States. Japan’s asset tokenization market was valued at 500 million in 2022 but it’s projected to reach 4.1 billion in 2030. Japan has written the laws for turning property and securities into digital tokens, but the market has yet to follow. Yuyama said Japan’s legal groundwork for asset tokenization is largely complete and some sectors such as real estate tokens are already operating. What’s missing, he said, is adoption and technical integration. Investors who can already buy bonds or mutual funds online don’t yet feel any added value from tokenization itself. Yuyama said there is also a missing link between yen-backed stablecoins and real-time Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) settlement. It’s an upgrade that could unlock liquidity and scale for Japan’s token markets. Shirai said without a market where financial instruments like real estate, green bonds, or artwork can be represented on blockchain, there is no reason for consumers to use stablecoins. “If Japan’s Financial Services Agency wants people to use stablecoins they also have to develop a market for that,” since the two are interdependent.

Related Reading: HYPE Soars Beyond $40 Following Robinhood Listing: What’s Next For Hyperliquid’s Price? After months of consolidation, ADA’s price action is forming what analysts describe as a “textbook breakout setup.” The token currently trades around $0.65, below key moving averages, but with indicators pointing toward an imminent reversal. Cardano’s fundamentals continue to strengthen. The network recently surpassed 115 million transactions, signaling steady ecosystem growth despite broader market weakness. This achievement, combined with the rollout of Cardano domain names and anticipation for the Ouroboros Leios upgrade, builds more confidence. Technical Indicators Flash Buy as Bulls Regain Control Technically, ADA is nearing a decisive point. Chart analysts note a falling wedge pattern forming on the daily timeframe, a historically bullish setup that often precedes explosive moves. A break above the $0.79–$0.80 resistance could pave the way for a swift rally toward $1.10, and eventually, the projected $2.50 target. Momentum oscillators are beginning to turn upward, while futures market open interest is climbing, an indication that institutional traders are re-entering positions. Golden-cross signals between shorter and longer-term moving averages further validate the bullish bias, suggesting that accumulation is taking place at current levels.

Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Ecosystem Growth and Institutional Interest Add Momentum Beyond the charts, Cardano’s ecosystem expansion continues to attract institutional and developer attention.The RWA (Real-World Asset) initiative, valued at over $10 million, and privacy-focused Midnight sidechain airdrops are driving renewed engagement. Meanwhile, analysts argue that ADA’s low gas fees and ongoing DeFi integrations position it as a strong alternative to Ethereum for scalable applications. Experts predict that if ADA breaks through resistance levels and maintains momentum, the path toward $2.50 or even $3.00 could unfold over the next market cycle.

Will CZ Reclaim His CEO Position At Binance? Industry observers suggest that this major development for CZ and Binance as a whole could pave the way for Zhao to resume leadership roles and consolidate Binance’s US operations. According to Bloomberg, the company is exploring several options, including the possibility of integrating Binance.US into its global operations or having its global exchange enter the US market, as indicated by a source familiar with the matter. Related Reading: Binance Founder Suggests President Trump Could Be Satoshi Nakamoto In Latest Statement “This cycle is largely being driven by U.S. institutional investors and investment products, and that’s precisely where Binance can now shift its focus,” stated Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. He added that the US affiliate will likely be reintegrated into Binance’s global ecosystem, providing US investors with direct access to the platform’s “deep liquidity and comprehensive derivatives offerings.” Attention is now focused on whether Zhao will attempt to reclaim the CEO role he previously stepped away from. In recent weeks, he updated his profile on social media platform X from “ex-Binance” to simply “@Binance,” a subtle change that has fueled speculation about his intentions. However, not everyone believes Zhao is eager to return as CEO. David Namdar, who manages a BNB treasury company backed by Zhao’s family office, commented, “I think he is operating with more of a weight off his shoulders not running the exchange. I’d be surprised if he stepped back into that role.” Industry Leaders Predict Increased Involvement Patrick Horsman, chief investment officer of digital asset treasury (DAT) firm Applied DNA Sciences, which invests in Binance Coin (BNB), emphasized that Binance’s technology, liquidity, and relatively low fees could position it as a dominant player in the American crypto market. However, Bloomberg highlights that the pardon may not only enhance Zhao’s personal prospects but also unlock new opportunities for Binance’s global expansion.

Cosmo Jiang, general partner at Pantera, anticipates that Zhao will become “more involved with Binance’s operations” now that he has received a pardon. “Whenever a founder returns to a company, it’s always an invigorating moment; you typically see more growth and better execution,” he noted.

This comes in after a week of volatility that has seen BTC go below support levels. However, despite the bullish momentum, Tom Lee, chairman of BitMine, warns the flagship cryptocurrency could still endure a dramatic correction of up to 50%. Institutional Support Supports the Rise Bitcoin’s latest climb toward the $110,000-plus range is triggered by a significant uptick in institutional interest. Products such as the IBIT (iShares Bitcoin Trust) offer investors easier exposure to Bitcoin via traditional brokerage platforms. Additionally, broader regulatory clarity has enabled major banks and asset managers to deepen their crypto strategies. This shift suggests that Bitcoin is steadily transitioning from a niche speculative asset to a more mainstream investment vehicle. The rally has triggered renewed optimism around price breakout potential toward the $120,000-plus domain. Tom Lee Sounds Caution, A 50% Bitcoin (BTC) Drop Could Be Next However, Tom Lee offers a cautionary perspective that many market participants may be overlooking. Tom argues that despite institutional adoption, Bitcoin remains highly correlated with traditional equity markets. In his words: “If the S&P is down 20 %, Bitcoin could be down 40 %.” Drawing on this dynamic, Lee maintains that a full 50 % collapse remains entirely possible. The reasoning? Bitcoin has historically amplified stock-market moves. While ETFs and institutional flows may soften the narrative, they do not eliminate Bitcoin’s structural volatility. Lee also points out the breakdown of the classical four-year Bitcoin market cycle, warning that we may be entering a “longer cycle” with more extreme drawdowns. His forecast still anticipates Bitcoin reaching between $200,000 and $250,000 by year-end, yet a 50 % correction from those levels would land $100,000–$125,000. If the current $110,000 peak is already the top, a fall toward roughly $55,000 is within his scenario. What This Means for BTC Investors For investors tracking Bitcoin’s trajectory , the mix of bullish institutional signals and bearish risk warnings demands a balanced approach. On one hand, the ETF infrastructure and regulatory progress offer clear legitimacy for Bitcoin as an asset class. On the other, the risk of sharp drawdowns remains under-appreciated, suggesting that future volatility could continue to define Bitcoin’s long-term growth trajectory.

The purchase of GTreasury , in particular, positions Ripple to enter the corporate treasury market, where trillions of dollars in idle capital are managed. By linking GTreasury’s platform with Ripple Prime’s liquidity and repo market services, the company appears intent on creating more efficient pathways for managing and deploying corporate funds. Commentary from market observers has highlighted this approach as a defining shift in how crypto companies integrate with traditional finance. One X user, BTCPeakHub, noted that Ripple’s model represents cooperation rather than competition — connecting treasury systems to blockchain-powered liquidity solutions. The combination could allow enterprises to activate dormant capital while maintaining compliance and risk management standards. This direction marks a critical step toward embedding blockchain capabilities directly within the structure of global financial operations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Leadership Message and Strategic Focus In outlining Ripple’s trajectory, Garlinghouse stated that the company’s acquisitions are strategically aligned with its long-term objective of establishing an interconnected global value network. His comments underscored that Ripple’s acquisitions are not isolated business moves, but part of a coordinated effort to integrate custody, liquidity, and treasury functions into a unified ecosystem. Most notably, Garlinghouse issued a direct reminder to the XRP community and investors about the asset’s enduring relevance. He emphasized that XRP remains central to everything Ripple builds and continues to serve as the foundation of its technological and financial framework. The statement was viewed as a reaffirmation of commitment to the token’s pivotal role even as Ripple extends its reach into broader financial sectors. Outlook for Ripple and XRP Ripple’s strategic expansion into traditional finance reflects its intent to bridge institutional operations with blockchain efficiency. As these integrations evolve, the company’s technology stack could redefine how liquidity moves across corporate and financial systems. Still, Garlinghouse’s emphasis on XRP as the cornerstone of Ripple’s ecosystem remains the clearest message from this phase of growth — a signal that no matter how far Ripple expands, XRP continues to sit at the heart of its mission and development.

Recently, the world of crypto perpetual futures witnessed a staggering event: over $100 million in forced liquidations within just 24 hours. This significant sum represents a sharp reminder of the inherent volatility and risks associated with leveraged trading in digital assets. For many traders, this period was marked by rapid, unexpected losses, highlighting the delicate balance between potential gains and swift reversals in the fast-paced crypto landscape. What Triggered These Massive Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations? During the intense 24-hour period, a substantial wave of forced liquidations swept through the crypto perpetual futures market. These weren’t minor corrections but significant position closures. The figures reveal the scale of the impact across major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC): A total of $41.19 million in BTC positions were liquidated. Interestingly, short positions accounted for 60.99% of this total, indicating that many traders betting on a price decline were caught off guard by an upward movement or unexpected stability. Ethereum (ETH): Even more pronounced, Ethereum saw $49.23 million in liquidations. Here too, short positions dominated, making up 61.77% of the total, suggesting a similar market dynamic to Bitcoin. Other Altcoins (H): A category denoted as ""H"" (likely representing a basket or specific altcoins) experienced $9.81 million in liquidations. A striking 72.64% of these were short positions, underscoring a strong market move against bearish bets in this segment. These figures paint a clear picture of market movements that strongly impacted traders holding short positions, forcing them to close out their leveraged bets as prices moved against their predictions. Demystifying Crypto Perpetual Futures: A Quick Explainer To truly grasp the gravity of these liquidations, it’s essential to understand what crypto perpetual futures are. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures do not. They allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning the underlying asset. They are popular because they enable high leverage, meaning traders can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. However, this leverage is a double-edged sword. While it amplifies potential profits, it also magnifies potential losses. Traders use these instruments to bet on whether a cryptocurrency’s price will go up (long position) or down (short position). Funding rates are a unique mechanism in perpetual futures that help keep the contract price close to the spot price, adding another layer of complexity. How Do Forced Liquidations Occur in Crypto Perpetual Futures? A forced liquidation happens when a trader’s margin balance falls below the minimum requirement set by the exchange. This typically occurs when the market moves sharply against their leveraged position. For example, if a trader takes a long position on Bitcoin with 10x leverage, a relatively small price drop in BTC can wipe out their initial margin. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange. The high percentage of short liquidations in this recent event suggests a scenario where prices either stabilized unexpectedly or experienced a sudden upward bounce. Traders betting on a decline were therefore caught on the wrong side of the market, leading to these swift and significant closures. Why Should You Care About Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations? These large-scale liquidations are more than just numbers; they serve as critical indicators of market sentiment and potential future movements. Firstly, they highlight periods of extreme volatility and market instability. Such events can trigger a cascade effect, where one liquidation leads to another, further intensifying price swings. Secondly, understanding liquidation data helps traders gauge market positioning. A high number of short liquidations, as seen recently, can indicate a ""short squeeze"" where upward price pressure forces bearish traders to buy back their positions, further propelling prices higher. For investors, these events underscore the importance of risk management. While crypto perpetual futures offer exciting opportunities, the amplified risks demand a cautious and well-informed approach. It’s crucial to employ stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging, especially in such unpredictable markets. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Insights for Traders In light of recent events in the crypto perpetual futures market, traders should consider several strategies to mitigate risks. Firstly, always prioritize robust risk management. This includes setting clear stop-loss levels to limit potential losses on leveraged positions. Secondly, avoid excessive leverage. While tempting, higher leverage exponentially increases your liquidation risk. Thirdly, diversify your portfolio. Spreading investments across different assets can help cushion the impact of sudden price movements in any single cryptocurrency. Moreover, staying informed about market trends and fundamental analysis is paramount. Understanding the broader economic landscape and specific project developments can provide valuable context for your trading decisions. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider starting with smaller positions when experimenting with high-risk instruments like perpetual futures. The recent wave of over $100 million in crypto perpetual futures liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and rapid shifts within the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be daunting, they also offer invaluable lessons for traders and investors alike. Understanding the mechanics of these leveraged products and implementing sound risk management strategies are crucial for navigating this exciting yet challenging financial frontier. Staying informed and exercising caution will always be your best allies in the world of digital assets.

This initiative, linked to the Trump family, has recently made headlines with a substantial issuance that’s caught the attention of market observers and crypto enthusiasts alike. Understanding the implications of this development is crucial for anyone following the decentralized finance space. What is the Trump DeFi Project: WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI)? WorldLibertyFinancial, or WLFI, positions itself within the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. DeFi aims to replicate traditional financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, using blockchain technology, thereby removing intermediaries like banks. The involvement of a prominent family like the Trumps in this space adds a unique dimension, often drawing significant scrutiny and interest. WLFI’s entry into DeFi suggests an ambition to leverage blockchain for financial innovation. However, like any project in this rapidly evolving sector, it faces inherent complexities and regulatory considerations.

Potential Liquidity: Such a large issuance could be intended to provide substantial liquidity for various operations within the WLFI platform, facilitating trading, lending, or other financial services. Expansion Plans: It might also signal ambitious expansion plans, suggesting that WLFI is preparing for significant growth or new feature rollouts that require a robust treasury. Market Confidence: From a project perspective, a large issuance could be a statement of confidence in its underlying technology and future trajectory, aiming to attract more users and investors. However, the specifics of USD1, its backing, and its intended use cases within the WLFI ecosystem are critical details that the community will be watching closely.

For the Trump DeFi project , these challenges are amplified by its high-profile association. Key Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Projects associated with public figures often attract more attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to stricter compliance requirements. Security Risks: DeFi platforms are frequent targets for exploits and hacks. Ensuring robust security measures is non-negotiable for protecting user assets. Public Perception: The project must continuously manage public perception, addressing skepticism and building a reputation for reliability and integrity. Opportunities: Brand Recognition: The association brings immediate global recognition, potentially accelerating user adoption if the platform delivers value.

Nonetheless, its presence adds another layer of institutional and political interest to the DeFi space. This could: Increase Mainstream Awareness: Draw more traditional investors and media attention to DeFi, potentially leading to increased adoption. Influence Regulatory Debates: The project’s activities could become a talking point in ongoing discussions about crypto regulation, especially regarding stablecoins and DeFi protocols. Set Precedents: How WLFI handles compliance, security, and transparency could set precedents for future high-profile entrants into the DeFi market. The crypto community will be observing closely to see if this project can carve out a significant niche and influence the direction of decentralized finance. The Future of WLFI and the Trump DeFi Project The road ahead for WorldLibertyFinancial is undoubtedly an interesting one. The initial issuance of 300 million USD1 marks a bold step, but it is just the beginning.

Community Engagement: Can it foster a strong, engaged community that supports its vision and contributes to its governance (if applicable)? Regulatory Compliance: Will it successfully adapt to the evolving regulatory landscape, ensuring legal and operational stability? Security and Reliability: Can it maintain a secure and reliable platform, safeguarding user assets and data? The Trump DeFi project represents a fascinating intersection of traditional influence and cutting-edge financial technology. Its journey will offer valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie at the forefront of the decentralized revolution. In conclusion, the Trump DeFi project , WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI), has certainly made its mark with the issuance of 300 million USD1. This move underscores the growing interest from diverse sectors in the decentralized finance space. While offering significant opportunities for innovation and growth, WLFI also faces considerable challenges related to regulation, security, and public perception. Its trajectory will be a compelling case study for the future of high-profile entities entering the complex world of DeFi, potentially shaping how we view the convergence of traditional influence and digital finance.

Last week, Bitdeer revealed its latest operational update, offering a transparent look into its Bitdeer Bitcoin mining output and strategic asset management. This insight is crucial for anyone tracking the pulse of the digital asset space. What Did Bitdeer’s Latest Bitdeer Bitcoin Mining Report Unveil? Bitdeer, known for its significant presence in the Bitcoin mining sector, shared its weekly performance through its official X account. The company successfully mined a total of 123.4 BTC within the past week. This consistent output underscores their robust infrastructure and operational efficiency. However, the report also detailed a strategic decision: the sale of 70 BTC from their mined amount. This move provides a glimpse into how large-scale mining operations balance their treasury management with ongoing expenses. As of October 24, Bitdeer maintains a substantial holding of 2,180.2 BTC, demonstrating a strong commitment to its long-term asset strategy. For investors and enthusiasts, these numbers are more than just statistics; they represent the tangible efforts behind securing the Bitcoin network and managing a valuable digital treasury. Why Do Firms Engage in Bitdeer Bitcoin Mining Sales? It might seem counterintuitive for a Bitcoin mining company to sell its newly mined assets, especially during periods of market optimism. However, these sales are often a fundamental part of a sophisticated operational strategy. Several factors drive such decisions: Covering Operational Costs: Running a large-scale Bitdeer Bitcoin mining operation requires significant capital. This includes substantial electricity bills, maintenance of sophisticated hardware, staff salaries, and infrastructure upgrades. Selling a portion of mined Bitcoin provides the necessary liquidity to cover these ongoing expenses. Treasury Management: Companies often diversify their holdings and manage risk. Selling some BTC can help realize profits, rebalance portfolios, or prepare for future investments without solely relying on market appreciation. Market Conditions: Strategic sales can be timed to capitalize on favorable market prices, ensuring maximum return on their mining efforts. Conversely, sales might occur to build a cash reserve during uncertain times. These actions are not random; they are calculated moves designed to ensure the financial health and sustained growth of the mining enterprise. How Does Bitdeer Bitcoin Mining Impact the Broader Market? The activities of major Bitcoin mining firms like Bitdeer can have a ripple effect across the cryptocurrency market. While individual sales might not drastically shift prices, the cumulative actions of large miners contribute to overall market supply dynamics. When miners sell, it adds to the available supply, which can influence short-term price movements. Conversely, when miners choose to hold their mined Bitcoin, it signals a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and reduces the immediate selling pressure. Bitdeer’s current holding of over 2,180 BTC signifies a significant commitment to Bitcoin’s future, despite their tactical weekly sales. This balance between selling for operational needs and holding for long-term value is a delicate act that all major miners perform. Understanding these dynamics helps investors gauge market sentiment and potential supply shifts. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bitdeer Bitcoin Mining Bitdeer’s consistent transparency regarding its mining output and treasury management sets a commendable standard in the industry. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the strategic decisions made by key players like Bitdeer will remain vital. Their ability to adapt to changing market conditions, manage operational costs effectively, and maintain a robust Bitcoin treasury will be crucial for their sustained success. These weekly reports offer more than just numbers; they provide a narrative of resilience, strategic foresight, and continuous adaptation within the highly competitive Bitdeer Bitcoin mining sector. Keeping an eye on these updates can offer valuable insights into the broader health and direction of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Bitdeer? A1: Bitdeer is a leading technology company that specializes in Bitcoin cloud mining. They offer solutions for users to participate in cryptocurrency mining without needing to own or manage physical mining hardware. Q2: What is cloud mining? A2: Cloud mining allows individuals to rent computing power from a large data center, like Bitdeer, to mine cryptocurrencies. This eliminates the need for users to purchase expensive equipment, deal with high electricity costs, or manage complex technical setups. Q3: Why do Bitcoin miners sell their mined BTC? A3: Miners typically sell a portion of their mined Bitcoin to cover significant operational expenses, such as electricity costs, hardware maintenance, facility upkeep, and staff salaries. It’s a strategic financial management decision to ensure liquidity and sustain operations. Q4: How do Bitdeer’s BTC holdings compare to other mining firms? A4: While exact comparisons vary by reporting period, Bitdeer’s holding of over 2,180 BTC positions them as a significant player among publicly traded mining companies. Their holdings reflect a substantial long-term investment in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Q5: Does Bitdeer’s weekly sale impact Bitcoin’s price? A5: While individual sales from a single firm might not cause dramatic price shifts, the cumulative selling pressure from all miners can influence market supply and demand. Bitdeer’s strategic sales are generally part of broader market dynamics rather than a sole price driver.

As summarized by @christine_dkim, the 223rd All Core Devs Execution (ACDE 223) meeting brought new clarity to Ethereum’s roadmap for the final stretch of 2025. The developers confirmed the Glamsterdam upgrade proposal deadline for October 30, with final scope confirmation scheduled for November 27. This sets a concrete path toward the Fusaka mainnet upgrade in December, keeping Ethereum’s execution layer upgrades firmly on schedule. Fusaka Upgrade Timeline Finalized The headline takeaway from ACDE 223 is the Fusaka mainnet upgrade, now officially set for December 3, 2025. This release will introduce blob parameter optimizations, scheduled in two phases, December 9 and January 7, 2026. These changes fine-tune how Ethereum handles blob data introduced during the Dencun upgrade, improving efficiency for rollups and large-scale data posting. Before that, the Hoodi testnet will activate its Fusaka version on October 28, serving as the final pre-mainnet test cycle. Developers confirmed that Holesky, one of Ethereum’s largest testnets, will shut down next week as resources shift toward Glamsterdam’s testing framework. Glamsterdam Upgrade Details While Fusaka focuses on optimizing blob mechanics, Glamsterdam represents Ethereum’s next big leap in execution efficiency. The upgrade will introduce a multi-client testnet, focusing primarily on the Block Access List (BAL) proposal, an experimental feature aimed at improving how nodes access contract storage data. BALs could significantly reduce redundant reads and streamline gas usage during complex contract executions, further optimizing transaction performance. Developers described Glamsterdam as a “modular prep” upgrade, setting the stage for future Rollup integration improvements, execution-layer compression, and gas efficiency reforms. New Proposals: Gas Precision & Deduplication Discount Two new proposals stood out during ACDE 223 discussions: EIP 8058: Gas Precision Optimization – Aims to refine how gas units are calculated and rounded in specific edge cases. This would make gas consumption measurements more precise and predictable for developers, reducing the risk of mispriced transactions. Deduplication Discount for Contract Redeployment – A proposed mechanism to lower deployment costs for contracts that reuse identical bytecode. This could significantly reduce gas expenses for DeFi protocols, DAOs, and wallet infrastructures that frequently redeploy similar smart contracts. Both proposals were well received but will likely undergo testnet evaluation during the Glamsterdam phase before any mainnet inclusion. Retired Proposals: EIP 7667 and 6873 Two previously discussed proposals, EIP 7667 and EIP 6873, were officially removed from the active roadmap due to overlapping priorities and changing design goals. Developers noted that both proposals may be re-evaluated in future cycles if they align better with post-Glamsterdam objectives. The decision reflects Ethereum’s ongoing commitment to refining roadmap scope, ensuring upgrades focus on tangible improvements to performance and developer experience rather than experimental expansion. Developer Momentum and OKX Ventures’ Take Ethereum’s development pace continues to accelerate into 2026. From Dencun’s blob integration to Fusaka’s optimization phase and Glamsterdam’s structural upgrades, the network is building toward a leaner, more modular execution layer. OKX Ventures shared insight following ACDE 223, describing the next upgrade cycle as “a critical phase for Ethereum’s modular evolution.” “Ethereum’s core upgrades are accelerating into a critical phase. From Fusaka to Glamsterdam, developers are continuously improving execution-layer efficiency and developer experience. These foundational upgrades will pave the way for modular scaling, rollup optimizations, and innovations in the application layer,” the firm wrote. The comment underscores how closely infrastructure investors are tracking Ethereum’s low-level development, viewing these upgrades not as isolated patches, but as coordinated steps toward long-term scalability. What It Means for the Ecosystem The Fusaka and Glamsterdam phases are designed to prepare Ethereum for the next stage of Rollup-centric scaling. Blob parameter tuning will make Layer 2 data submissions cheaper and more efficient. BALs and gas precision updates will smooth execution logic and cut redundant costs. Deduplication incentives will reward developers building on efficient contract design patterns. Each step strengthens Ethereum’s execution layer, the part of the network responsible for processing smart contracts and transactions, setting a stronger foundation for long-term Layer 2 interoperability. For builders, this means faster feedback cycles, lower deployment costs, and more predictable performance across networks. For users, it means cheaper transactions, fewer network spikes, and a smoother experience on dapps built atop Ethereum. Ethereum Market Context At the time of writing, ETH trades at around $3,925, with a market cap of $473 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Price volatility around these updates remains minimal, reflecting how technical upgrades have become normalized within Ethereum’s predictable development cadence. However, as testnet launches begin in late October and November, community attention will likely return to performance metrics and upgrade testing outcomes. With the Glamsterdam proposal deadline set for October 30 and final scope locked by November 27, Ethereum’s developers are entering a crucial execution window. The Fusaka mainnet release on December 3 will act as both a closing chapter for 2025 and a stepping stone into 2026’s upgrade path. Each stage continues Ethereum’s multi-year transition from a monolithic blockchain into a modular, rollup-first network, balancing decentralization with execution speed. For now, all eyes are on Hoodi testnet’s activation on October 28, marking the last rehearsal before Ethereum’s next live performance. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Pump.fun, Solana’s dominant memecoin launchpad, has officially acquired Padre App , an advanced, multi-chain trading terminal for professional traders. we're excited to announce that pump fun has acquired @PadreApp Padre is an industry leading trading terminal which provides a seamless, high-speed trading experience with next level analytics for professional traders on Solana, BNB Chain, Base, and Ethereum L1 read more pic.twitter.com/Oq3EPuGjTk — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) October 24, 2025 But not everyone’s celebrating. Padre token holders got nothing from the deal. Within hours of the announcement, $PADRE crashed over 70%, according to CoinMarketCap. The token, which once symbolized the project’s growing trading ecosystem, has now plunged a great deal following the announcement. The Acquisition Pump.fun announced the deal on X, calling Padre “one of the most advanced trading terminals in Web3.” “We’re thrilled to welcome the Padre team. Their experience, speed, and deep focus on user experience align perfectly with our mission to tokenize the world’s highest-potential opportunities,” Pump.fun wrote. Today is a reminder of exactly why I’m building Soar. Padre was just acquired by Pumpfun, and Padre token holders got absolutely nothing from it. The token is down 70% today and is going lower. This is what’s broken about ICM and crypto right now. Tokens have no legal… https://t.co/mw4udLodoo — Captain Beef (@imtomcurry) October 24, 2025 The acquisition marks Pump.fun’s first expansion beyond its meme-launchpad roots, a move that signals its ambition to dominate the broader DeFi trading stack. What Padre Brings Padre wasn’t just another crypto dashboard. In less than a year, it established itself as an industry-leading pro trading terminal, supporting high-speed, on-chain trading across Solana, BNB Chain, Base, and Ethereum L1. Its growth was driven by four things: Clean and intuitive user experience Rewarding cashback and competitive fees Responsive trader support Strong technical backbone built by crypto veterans The Padre team had earned a loyal user base among professional traders seeking fast execution and real-time analytics. Pump.fun’s acquisition now places that talent and technology directly under its expanding umbrella. Pump.fun’s Vision According to Pump.fun, the acquisition isn’t just about bringing in tech, it’s about bridging retail and professional trading. “For the past year, trading terminals have captured most of the ecosystem’s volume. They’ve done what any good crypto product does: make users money. But to go further, we need to build for retail, while staying connected to our most loyal traders.” That’s where Padre comes in. By merging its infrastructure with Pump.fun’s network and liquidity reach, the company plans to unlock a new edge for both retail and pro traders. What Changes for Padre Users Pump.fun confirmed that Padre’s operations will continue as usual. The terminal will keep supporting trading on all major launchpads and decentralized exchanges across supported chains. Ongoing improvements are also on the roadmap: Faster shipping cycles and UI upgrades Enhanced speed, analytics, and trader insights More responsive feedback loops for core users However, the Padre token ($PADRE) is no longer part of that future. “The $PADRE token will no longer have utility on the platform, with no further plans moving forward,” the official statement read. That decision triggered widespread frustration among token holders, especially those who had backed the project early. Padre’s community channels were flooded with complaints within hours of the announcement. Many holders expressed disappointment over being excluded from the deal, while others criticized the lack of a token swap or compensation plan. Despite the backlash, sentiment around Padre’s product remains strong. Even critics acknowledge that the trading terminal itself is among the best in the space, praised for its responsiveness, analytics, and integration depth. The challenge now is narrative: how Pump.fun manages community trust while pivoting toward an integrated ecosystem strategy. Pump.fun’s Growing Influence Pump.fun has grown from a memecoin launchpad into a crypto ecosystem heavyweight. Since early 2024, it has dominated on-chain token launches, processing millions of trades and generating record user activity. Its acquisition of Padre represents a shift from launching tokens to enabling trading infrastructure. Industry observers see it as a natural evolution. Launchpads capture initial liquidity, but trading terminals capture recurring volume. By owning both layers, Pump.fun strengthens its grip on the entire token lifecycle: launch, trade, and liquidity management. Strategic Fit and Future Outlook Padre’s integration will likely improve Pump.fun’s backend efficiency and data handling. It also positions Pump.fun to expand into more professional trading tools, an area currently dominated by platforms like Hyperliquid and Jupiter Terminal. With Pump.fun’s large retail audience and Padre’s professional-grade interface, the combined platform could blur the lines between memecoin trading and institutional-grade DeFi tools. For users, that could mean faster trades, richer analytics, and stronger incentives. For the ecosystem, it could mean tighter liquidity loops and more sustainable market depth across Solana and beyond. The acquisition underscores a growing trend in DeFi: vertical consolidation. Projects are no longer content with specializing in one niche, they’re merging across layers to control user experience end-to-end.. Padre’s fall might sting investors, but its technology lives on in a bigger ecosystem. Pump.fun now holds both the memecoin market’s energy and the infrastructure to sustain it. For traders, the message is clear, Pump.fun is building far beyond its meme roots. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

53609966,https://nulltx.com/?p=152467,1761371395,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,ASTER Reclaims $1 as It Launches Strategic Buyback Program,https://nulltx.com/aster-reclaims-1-as-it-launches-strategic-buyback-program/,"The Binance-backed ASTER has made a strong comeback, reclaiming the $1 mark after announcing a new strategic token buyback program. The move comes as the decentralized perpetual exchange positions itself to rival Hyperliquid, signaling a long-term commitment to sustainable liquidity growth and tokenholder value. A Comeback Fueled by Confidence The announcement hit X earlier today, and it’s already showing results. $ASTER, the native token of the ASTER DEX, is trading just above $1, according to CoinMarketCap. The renewed momentum reflects investor confidence following a recent drop below the $1 zone. Now, ASTER’s message is clear: it’s building for the long term. The project plans to allocate 70–80% of its Season 3 (S3) fee revenue toward buybacks of $ASTER, a major show of commitment to both users and tokenholders. The Buyback Breakdown According to the official statement, ASTER is “targeting 70–80% of S3 fees for $ASTER buybacks.” However, the team notes that the final allocation will depend on market conditions, with the results expected to be disclosed after Season 3 concludes. In simple terms, ASTER is using its platform revenue to buy back its own token from the open market, effectively reducing circulating supply. This kind of buyback strategy, common among major exchanges and trading protocols, serves two major purposes: 1. It strengthens token price support. 2. It redistributes value directly back into the ecosystem. For a DeFi project competing with giants like Hyperliquid and Aevo, this kind of move stands out. ASTER Market Impact Shortly after the announcement, trading volume on ASTER surged across integrated exchanges. The $ASTER token climbed back above $1, marking a double-digit rebound within hours. Market analysts attributed the quick response to the clear revenue-backed utility behind the buyback plan. At press time, $ASTER holds a market cap of around $2.16B, with trading activity concentrated on Binance, OKX, and Jupiter. The project’s latest update adds to its growing reputation as one of the few perps exchanges with consistent on-chain traction. Buybacks aren’t new in crypto, but the timing and structure of ASTER’s move are what make it interesting. In a period where liquidity is fragmented and DEX trading volumes fluctuate week to week, ASTER’s buyback injects stability into its ecosystem. By committing up to 80% of its S3 fees, ASTER signals that it’s not just chasing short-term hype, it’s building sustainable token economics. This is especially key in a DeFi cycle where user incentives often fade quickly after farming seasons. Buybacks create consistent value flow, and that’s something both traders and long-term holders can get behind. ASTER’s Message to the Market In the team’s words: “As a growing project, and in these uncertain market conditions, it’s important to maintain operational flexibility. Subsequent season airdrops and buybacks will be announced as details are confirmed.” This tone, measured but confident, reflects ASTER’s current strategy. While many projects scale back during volatile conditions, ASTER is doing the opposite: reinvesting into its own token economy. It’s a signal of maturity from a project still considered “young” in the DeFi landscape. A Rival to Hyperliquid ASTER’s positioning has been clear from the start, it’s a Binance-backed DEX aiming to be the next-generation alternative to Hyperliquid. Both platforms focus on perpetual trading and on-chain orderbooks, but ASTER differentiates itself through its fee-sharing model and season-based structure. The team’s approach is designed to balance liquidity incentives with protocol sustainability. And with the introduction of buybacks, ASTER is now adding a direct feedback loop between platform success and token performance. For traders, this means more than just trading rewards, it means the DEX’s growth directly benefits tokenholders. The buyback news has drawn strong reactions across X (formerly Twitter). From traders to DeFi analysts, many praised ASTER’s move as a “bullish commitment” in a market where most projects remain cautious. Here’s the official announcement from ASTER’s team. Buyback Announcement: ASTER is currently targeting 70-80% of S3 fees for $ASTER buybacks, exact allocation will depend on market conditions and final results will be released following conclusion of S3. As a growing project, and in these uncertain market conditions, it’s… — Aster (@Aster_DEX) October 24, 2025 Aster’s followers highlighted that this is the first structured buyback since its launch, an event that could set a precedent for future seasons. Some analysts also speculated that ASTER might use part of the remaining 20–30% of its fee revenue for airdrops or incentive pools, further rewarding early supporters. Looking Ahead: Season 3 and Beyond Season 3 is shaping up to be a defining period for ASTER. The buyback initiative could tighten token supply while enhancing liquidity depth, both crucial for a trading protocol’s growth. And while exact figures will be shared after S3 concludes, the 70–80% commitment range already sends a strong message. ASTER’s approach is pragmatic, flexible in execution, but firm in direction. If the market momentum holds, the project could soon position itself among the top-performing DEX tokens in the Solana and Binance-linked ecosystems. ASTER’s $1 reclaim isn’t just another price move. It’s the result of a calculated, transparent, and community-aligned strategy, a tokenomics blueprint that balances growth and sustainability. By tying its buyback directly to protocol fees, ASTER ensures that every trade contributes to tokenholder value. It’s a model that many DeFi projects talk about, but few actually implement. As the Season 3 cycle unfolds, all eyes will be on how ASTER’s buyback impacts liquidity, volume, and token performance. But one thing’s already clear, this isn’t a short-term stunt. It’s the foundation of a long-term DeFi narrative. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

There are currently seven applications for XRP ETFs pending with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, though filings have been paused amid the US government shutdown. For many large investors, buying shares in a regulated fund or a company with an XRP treasury avoids the need to run custody systems in-house. Evernorth has become a focal point in that discussion. The venture, backed in part by Ripple, plans to build what it calls an institutional XRP treasury. Evernorth aims to purchase $1 billion worth of XRP and will start with over 560 million XRP after it secures $1.1 billion in committed capital from participants that include Ripple and SBI Holdings. Reports say the firm is pursuing a merger that is expected to close in Q1 2026, and the XRP purchases are planned to take place within 10 days of funding. 🚨 JUST IN: A Hyperliquid whale has opened a MASSIVE $1M XRP long position with 10x leverage at $2.40 😳 Looks like someone’s betting BIG on #XRP making a move soon! 👀🔥 pic.twitter.com/RnhyNJhOFE — Xaif Crypto🇮🇳|🇺🇸 (@Xaif_Crypto) October 23, 2025 Related Reading: ‘Unthinkable Scenario’ Required For Bitcoin To Hit $250K, CEO Says Market Bets And Margin Positions Market activity indicates that certain traders are making considerable wagers on the near-term trajectory of XRP.

Trump’s statement has triggered a global conversation about the role of digital assets, especially Bitcoin (BTC), in addressing the US’s debt crisis. Can Bitcoin Be Used To Clear The US’ National Debt? Speaking at a private conference, Trump said that crypto “has got a great future.” He hinted that maybe the US could pay off the $35 trillion debt in crypto. The president said: I’ll write on a little piece of paper, $35 trillion in crypto – we have no debt. That’s what I like. It should be noted that this is not the first time that Trump has alluded to the idea of using digital assets to wipe out the inflating American debt. In fact, Trump has been on record multiple times saying that his administration could use BTC to “save America.” This begs the question, how high will Bitcoin actually need to be to pay off the US’ national debt. Asset manager Fidelity has performed some calculations to arrive at an approximate BTC price that could, theoretically, do the trick. According to calculations based on Treasury data and blockchain supply metrics, BTC’s circulating supply of 19.93 million BTC would need to increase significantly in value to pay off the massive $38 trillion debt. Mathematically speaking, by dividing the US’s $38 billion in national debt by 19.93 million supply, one Bitcoin will surge to $1.9 million. At such a high price, BTC’s market cap would be roughly equal to the US’s total debt. However, the US doesn’t own all the 19.93 million BTC. According to the latest data, the US only owns about 326,373 BTC, almost 1.6% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply, most of it acquired through seizures from criminal investigations. If the US tried to pay off its debt only using the amount of BTC it currently holds, then the digital asset’s price could increase exponentially. Specifically, BTC could surge as high as $116.5 million, almost 1000-times more than its current trading price. At such a price level, BTC’s total market cap would be around $230 trillion – a figure that is even higher than the world’s total GDP as of today. Any attempt to sell BTC at such a price would collapse its thin liquidity, resulting in a massive crash for the flagship cryptocurrency. Are Institutions Aware Of BTC’s Potential? While Bitcoin reaching a price tag of $116.5 million might sound impossible currently, recent BTC accumulation trends show that institutions are confident that the digital asset may still have a lot more room to grow. Recent trading data from the US suggests that crypto transactions have witnessed a sharp uptick since Trump assumed the Presidency. At press time, BTC trades at $110,052, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Donald Trump|MARA|National debt|US,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 06:00:28

SMQKE’s post emphasized that “Hidden Road plans to migrate its post-trade clearing onto XRPL, showcasing the blockchain’s ability to handle high-volume institutional flows.” This statement points to a significant development for XRP, as the integration of post-trade clearing could mark one of the most substantial use cases of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in institutional markets to date. With Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road finalized, it’s finally time to “SUPERCHARGE XRP’S UTILITY.” “Hidden Road plans to migrate its post-trade clearing onto XRPL, showcasing the blockchain's ability to handle high-volume institutional flows.” Documented. https://t.co/dBZk7dYa7H pic.twitter.com/FstGAkPvyL — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 24, 2025 Ripple’s Strategic Position in Institutional Finance The document describes Ripple’s motivation for the acquisition as a “bold move” that gives the company a new position in the financial ecosystem. Ripple now gains a platform capable of offering prime brokerage services such as trading, custody, financing, and clearing “to hedge funds and financial institutions.” This signals an expansion well beyond retail or transactional crypto services toward serving institutional clients at scale . Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, called the acquisition a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” that allows crypto firms access to traditional markets and vice versa. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hidden Road’s existing infrastructure and relationships with large financial entities provide Ripple with immediate access to institutional capital markets. Through this network, Ripple aims to connect traditional asset markets with digital liquidity using the XRP Ledger as the operational foundation. Enhancing XRP’s Real-World Utility A key excerpt from the document notes that this integration “could supercharge XRP’s utility as well.” By linking Hidden Road’s trade settlement processes to XRPL, Ripple demonstrates how its blockchain can be used for institutional-grade efficiency. The ability to process post-trade clearing on XRPL positions the network as a potential standard for large-scale financial operations where reliability and speed are critical. The announcement suggests that Ripple is entering a new competitive tier in the fintech landscape. While XRP has long been associated with cross-border payment efficiency, its use in post-trade clearing could establish its relevance in the broader settlement infrastructure that underpins institutional trading. The document also indicates that Ripple’s stablecoin strategy and collateral systems will align with this institutional push, further embedding XRP within its financial framework. The focus on expanding XRP’s practical use , rather than speculative value, reinforces Ripple’s intent to strengthen its foothold among global financial institutions.

According to the company’s press statement published Friday, Ripple first announced its plan to acquire the global credit network in early April. The firm believes Hidden Road is one of the fastest-growing non-bank prime brokers serving institutional investors in foreign exchange, digital assets, derivatives, swaps, and fixed income markets. The acquisition was reportedly finalized this month, making Hidden Road officially part of Ripple’s ecosystem under the new name Ripple Prime. Ripple opens new brokerage chapter with Hidden Road acquisition Ripple said the transaction is a “new chapter” for the company as it extends its reach beyond payments into institutional brokerage and clearing services. According to Ripple, Ripple Prime’s business has tripled in size since the deal was first announced. The XRP parent company’s infrastructure, including its payments network, crypto custody capabilities, and RLUSD stablecoin, will now be embedded into services offered through Ripple Prime. Moreover, the firm plans to use blockchain technology within its prime brokerage operations to streamline processes, improve transparency, and reduce costs for institutional users. Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD is already being used as collateral for several prime brokerage products under Ripple Prime. Certain derivatives clients have also opted to hold their balances in RLUSD, and the firm expects more entities to pick up on the trend in the coming months. Hidden Road Founder and CEO Marc Asch will be working alongside Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the company’s executive team throughout the integration process . “We are at an inflection point for the next phase of digital asset adoption,” Garlinghouse said when the deal was first announced. “The US market is effectively open for the first time due to the regulatory overhang of the former SEC coming to an end.” A year of company acquisitions to expand its reach The Hidden Road deal is one of five major acquisitions Ripple has made in the past two years, in what can be deemed as an aggressive expansion strategy to solidify its base. In May 2023, Ripple acquired digital asset custody firm Metaco, followed by the purchase of Standard Custody in June 2024. The company expanded its operations further in August with the acquisition of Rail, a stablecoin-powered payments platform. Just last week, Ripple announced plans to acquire treasury management system provider GTreasury. “We have focused on providing the most compliant and feature-rich solutions to corporations around the globe. Now, by joining Ripple, we are accelerating our vision from managing capital to activating it,” remarked GTreasury CEO Renaat Ver Eecke. As of the time of this publication, Ripple USD had reached a market cap of $898.5 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of more than $70 million, according to Coingecko data. The stablecoin was rated the number one digital dollar for “stability, governance, and asset backing” by the analytics firm Bluechip in July, earning an ‘A’ rating. Ripple appointed The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY Mellon) as its primary reserve custodian for RLUSD. Evernorth goes public via SPAC Merger In other related news this week, a company holding the cryptocurrency associated with the Ripple payment network XRP, revealed it could soon go public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Evernorth plans to merge with Armada Acquisition Corp II in a deal expected to raise more than $1 billion in proceeds. According to a statement released Monday, Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings Inc. contributed $200 million to the deal, while Ripple Labs made an unspecified investment. The firm founded after the SPAC Merger will trade on Nasdaq under the ticker “XRPN,” pending regulatory and listing approvals yet to be confirmed. XRP has started the weekend on a positive note, changing hands at a 5.2% 24-hour price increase to reach $2.56 Saturday morning. The Ripple native token closed Friday at $2.405, recording an intraday high of $2.57 and a low of $2.401. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This week, the SEC has been facing a decision deadline for three different XRP ETF applications and Grayscale's Cardano ETF, but has not released any statements. Due to the ongoing US federal government shutdown since October 1st, the SEC is operating at limited capacity, and ETF approval processes have been temporarily halted. Andrew Jacobson, a legal advisor for Halliday and former global head of legal at 21Shares, said in a statement that he expects the approval process to move quickly once the government reopens. “Autumn is typically the busiest time for ETFs. Things will move very quickly once the government reopens.” Related News: Ripple Officially Announces New Initiative: CEO Sends Bullish Message for XRP The current shutdown is the second-longest government shutdown in US history. According to a new poll on cryptocurrency prediction platform Polymarket, only 7% of investors believe the government will reopen by October 31st. This raises the possibility of surpassing the record 35-day shutdown set during Donald Trump's first term. However, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett indicated this week that the shutdown could end soon. The US Senate is set to hold its 11th vote to refinance the government. Despite all the uncertainty, expectations for a Cardano ETF remain strong. According to Polymarket data, users rate a 77% chance of a Cardano ETF being approved by 2025. These expectations were further reinforced by the SEC's significant changes to the crypto ETF approval process in September. The new regulations reduced the spot crypto ETF approval timeframe from 240 days to 75 days and simplified the process for cryptocurrencies that meet certain requirements. *This is not investment advice.

The ETF is being credited as a major driver of institutional adoption of XRP. Additionally, CME Group has launched new XRP options, bolstering its derivatives offerings following the successful performance of its XRP futures. REX-Osprey has credited its success to investor interest and regulatory direction The REX-Osprey XRP ETF has now surpassed $100 million in assets under management, marking a significant milestone for the institutional adoption of XRP. REX Shares highlighted the ETF’s performance on X, noting an increasing interest in regulated exposure to digital assets. The investment manager cited increased investor interest and improved regulatory clarity as among the reasons behind the fund’s momentum. Months earlier, REX Shares also noted strong demand for XRP exposure due to a more formal and regulated market environment. Around the same time, it launched the T-REX 2X Long Galaxy Digital Daily Target ETF, ticker GLXU. Meanwhile, CME Group has broadened XRP’s institutional offering, introducing options on XRP futures to complement existing ETF-like products. Meanwhile, CME Group has also broadened XRP’s institutional offering, introducing options on XRP futures to commemorate five months of active futures trading. The exchange noted that the product has maintained solid demand since its May rollout, recording over 567,000 trades to date. The figure translates to $26.9 billion in notional volume, about 9 billion XRP, which CME cited as a sign of sustained institutional optimism toward the asset. Market participants now have access to a range of regulated tools, including ETFs, spot, futures, and options, to diversify their exposure. The company announced : “Five months for XRP futures! Since launching in May, we’ve seen incredible demand for this regulated product. Ready for more control? Options on XRP futures are officially LIVE! “ XRP is gaining momentum due to increased institutional participation and buying pressure Ripple’s latest acquisition news has further energized the market. CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the completion of Ripple’s purchase of Hidden Road, now rebranded as Ripple Prime, pushing XRP above the $2.50 mark. John Deaton, an American attorney and a prominent advocate for cryptocurrency investors, even commented, saying, “ Between late December 2020 and 2023, we witnessed people’s Ripple’s Obituary. Today, those same people admit Ripple has become a major player in the industry.” The price of XRP has increased by 3.49% over the last 24 hours, reaching around $2.56. Over the past week, the token’s price gained 6.46%. Analysts attribute the momentum to heightened institutional participation and steady buying pressure. Data from CoinGlass indicates that XRP futures trading volume increased by 8.66% to $5.98 billion. XRP futures open interest has increased by 5.20% to $3.88 billion, a sign of growing confidence among leveraged traders and continued institutional accumulation. Although the token had tumbled around October 10, now, analysts are hoping the asset will break resistance at $2.80, which could propel the token to $3.05 or even $3.40 in the near term. So far, indicators suggest a continued recovery, with the RSI at a neutral 52 and the MACD on the verge of a bullish crossover, indicating that upward momentum is building. But a loss of momentum would likely push XRP below $2.20, especially if the overall market mood turns cautious. The institutional demand for regulated XRP products has increased and evolved over the last five months, with futures contracts now offered on the CME Group. According to the exchange claims, the notional trading volume of XRP and micro futures has reached $27 billion since their launch.

This highly anticipated move is set to open new avenues for traders looking to engage with the COMMON token. Starting October 27 at 12:30 p.m. UTC, traders will have the opportunity to delve into this new offering, which will support significant leverage, potentially amplifying trading outcomes. What Are COMMON Perpetual Futures and Why Are They Important? For those new to derivatives, understanding COMMON perpetual futures is crucial. A perpetual futures contract allows traders to speculate on an asset’s future price without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, they mimic the spot market price through a funding rate mechanism. No Expiry Date: Traders can hold positions indefinitely, provided they meet margin requirements. Leverage: Binance’s new COMMON/USDT contract offers up to 50x leverage. This enables traders to control large positions with relatively small capital, leading to substantial gains or significant losses. Price Discovery: The listing on a major exchange like Binance can boost price discovery and increase liquidity for the COMMON token itself. The addition of COMMON to Binance Alpha further highlights its growing importance. This listing signals confidence in the token’s potential and provides a robust platform for advanced trading strategies. How Does Trading COMMON Perpetual Futures Work? Engaging with COMMON perpetual futures involves understanding several key mechanics, particularly regarding leverage and risk management. When you trade with leverage, you are essentially borrowing funds from the exchange to increase your position size. While this can magnify profits, it also escalates the risk of liquidation. Consider this: High Leverage: 50x leverage means that for every dollar you invest, you can control $50 worth of COMMON. A small price movement against your position can quickly deplete your margin. Margin Requirements: Traders must maintain a specific margin level to keep their positions open. If the market moves unfavorably and your margin falls below the maintenance level, your position may be automatically liquidated. Funding Rates: These are exchanged between long and short positions, typically every eight hours. This mechanism helps keep the perpetual contract price anchored to the spot price. Understanding funding rates is vital as they impact your overall trading costs or gains. It is important for traders to approach COMMON perpetual futures with a well-defined strategy and a clear understanding of the associated risks. Educating yourself on how leverage and margin work is the first step towards responsible trading. Navigating the Market: Tips for COMMON Perpetual Futures Traders Trading COMMON perpetual futures can be exhilarating, but it demands a disciplined approach. To navigate this dynamic market effectively, here are some actionable insights and best practices: Start Small: Especially if you are new to futures trading, begin with a small portion of your capital. This allows you to gain experience without exposing yourself to excessive risk. Risk Management is Key: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Define your maximum acceptable loss per trade and stick to it. Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Understand Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets, especially for newer tokens, can be highly volatile. Price swings can be rapid and unpredictable. Be prepared for this and adjust your position sizes accordingly. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical analysis, and any announcements related to the COMMON token or the broader crypto market. Information is power in trading. Don’t Over-Leverage: While 50x leverage is available, it doesn’t mean you should always use it. Higher leverage increases risk exponentially. Many experienced traders use lower leverage to manage risk more effectively. Binance’s decision to list COMMON perpetual futures is a significant development, offering both opportunities and challenges. By approaching this new trading instrument with caution, education, and a robust risk management plan, traders can position themselves to potentially benefit from its introduction. Summary: Unlocking New Opportunities with COMMON Perpetual Futures The upcoming listing of the COMMON perpetual futures contract on Binance marks an exciting milestone for the cryptocurrency community. This new offering, with its 50x leverage capability, provides an advanced trading tool for speculating on the COMMON token’s price movements. While the potential for amplified returns is appealing, it comes hand-in-hand with amplified risks. Successful engagement with these contracts will hinge on a thorough understanding of their mechanics, diligent risk management, and continuous market awareness. As COMMON joins the ranks of tokens available for perpetual futures trading, it signals a maturing market and expanding options for savvy traders.

According to market tracking data, roughly $1.75 billion worth of player-held digital assets vanished from value post-update. Bloomberg News reported that the market slump began on October 22, when Valve released an update to change the in-game economy of Counter-Strike 2 . According to the patch notes shared on CS2’s subreddit, it modified the way players could exchange and acquire cosmetic weapon skins like knives and gloves, among the game’s rarest and most expensive items. At around 7 PM in New York on Wednesday, Valve adjusted the item exchange rate between various skin categories. Prices for top-tier collectibles plunged within hours of the update, wiping nearly $2 billion in total market value by Friday morning, according to data from Pricempire. This analytics firm monitors Counter-Strike’s trading ecosystem across 46 marketplaces. “This was a complete shock to the community,” said Ethan MacDonald, marketing manager at Pricempire. “This completely changes the supply of Counter-Strike’s most sought-after and expensive tier of items.” CS2 is the world’s most active digital gaming item market Bloomberg had reported in March, citing Pricempire data, that the market for CS2 in-game skins set a new record to surpass $4.3 billion for the first time. As of June, a single Counter-Strike 2 weapon skin sold for $1 million, the highest transaction ever recorded for an in-game cosmetic. Pricempire’s valuation model aggregates public inventory data and pricing from dozens of trading hubs, producing an estimate of the total market capitalization for all tradable Counter-Strike items. The sudden market crash hit individual traders like Oscar Stapleton, a 20-year-old player in London, who said his digital inventory was valued at over $1 million before the update. Within 24 hours, he lost nearly $270,000 in market value. “I’ve had a good past few months, so this is a shock,” Stapleton reckoned. However, Streamer psp1g saw his fortunes reverse after the October update, after the value of his previously overlooked inventory surged. Items he had once considered “worthless red skins” that couldn’t be used in trade contracts became part of the most sought-after assets in the game, pushing his total holdings to more than $4.4 million. Valve resonates update to ‘trade protection’ The October 22 patch came after Valve made several changes to how Counter-Strike 2 items move between players. In mid-2025, the company behind Steam added a “Trade Protection system” that restricts newly traded items for seven days. CS2 Skins labeled as “Trade Protected” cannot be retraded, modified, or consumed during that lock period, but they are still usable in-game. The update also included fixes to the reversal mechanism protecting victims of fraud, allowing Valve to undo unapproved trades within a week and restore stolen items to their rightful owners. Players can also combine five high-tier “Covert” skins to create a rare knife or glove. Pricempire’s data showed the most prized knives and gloves, previously selling for tens of thousands of dollars, have dropped by more than half in value since Wednesday. “Many investors, traders, and players have been selling off a lot of items out of fear that the ‘bubble’ has finally popped,” said MacDonald. Valve earns a commission on sales made through its official Steam marketplace, but does not directly profit from the majority of third-party transactions. One Counter-Strike 2 developer speaking in a 2023 interview said: “We generally only look at market prices when we’re thinking about shipping new stuff and want to understand players’ preferences. Players’ interest in items fluctuates over time for many reasons, so outside of that context, we try not to read too much into temporal changes.” According to some Redditors, Valve’s updates are motivated by gameplay balance and system integrity. “When you think about it, this kind of market ain’t healthy at all and is riddled with legal issues for Valve and harms the average customers the most.

The platform has officially announced the highly anticipated addition of Binance perpetual futures for the 42/USDT trading pair. This significant development is set to go live at 10:30 a.m. UTC on October 27, introducing fresh and dynamic opportunities for traders looking to engage with the market. What Are Binance Perpetual Futures and Why Are They a Game-Changer? Perpetual futures contracts stand as a cornerstone of the modern crypto derivatives market. Unlike traditional futures that come with a fixed expiry date, perpetual futures allow traders to maintain their positions indefinitely. This inherent flexibility makes them exceptionally popular for speculative trading, enabling participants to capitalize on both rising and falling markets without the pressure of a looming settlement date. Binance’s strategic move to list 42/USDT perpetual futures not only diversifies its product suite but also provides its vast user base with another powerful instrument to navigate cryptocurrency price movements. Essentially, these contracts offer a sophisticated way to gain exposure to an asset’s price dynamics without the necessity of direct ownership. Understanding the Power of 50x Leverage on Binance Perpetual Futures A standout feature of the new 42/USDT contract is the availability of up to 50x leverage. Leverage is a financial tool that allows traders to control a significantly larger position with a relatively small amount of initial capital. For instance, with 50x leverage, a trader can manage a position worth $50 for every $1 of their own funds. This amplification can dramatically enhance potential profits from favorable price movements. However, it is absolutely critical to grasp that leverage is a double-edged sword; it equally magnifies potential losses. Therefore, robust risk management strategies are not just recommended but essential when dealing with such high leverage. Binance consistently provides comprehensive educational materials and advanced tools designed to help users understand and responsibly manage the inherent risks associated with these powerful trading instruments. What Does 42’s Inclusion in Binance Alpha Mean for Savvy Traders? Beyond the direct listing of the Binance perpetual futures contract, Binance has also confirmed that the 42 asset will be integrated into Binance Alpha. While the specific functionalities and benefits of Binance Alpha can vary, inclusion typically signals enhanced visibility and access to more in-depth analytical support for the asset. This could translate into users gaining access to richer data sets, more granular market insights, or even specialized trading strategies specifically tailored for 42. For informed traders, this integration offers a potential edge, providing a deeper understanding of 42’s market behavior and potential future trajectory. Such resources can be invaluable for making well-researched decisions when trading the new Binance perpetual futures contract. Navigating Opportunities and Mitigating Risks with Binance Perpetual Futures The launch of any new Binance perpetual futures contract invariably presents a blend of exciting opportunities and inherent challenges. Successful engagement requires a balanced approach. Key Opportunities: Enhanced Liquidity: Listings on a top-tier exchange like Binance typically lead to increased trading volumes and improved market liquidity for the underlying asset. Efficient Price Discovery: Active futures markets often contribute to a more efficient and accurate price discovery mechanism for the associated spot asset. Advanced Hedging Strategies: Traders can strategically utilize perpetual futures to hedge existing spot positions, effectively protecting against potential adverse price movements in the market. Accessibility: Derivatives allow participation in asset price movements even if direct ownership is complex or undesirable. Inherent Risks: Extreme Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Leverage amplifies these rapid price swings, demanding constant vigilance. Significant Liquidation Risk: High leverage means even minor price movements against an open position can trigger an automatic liquidation, resulting in the total loss of the collateral invested. Funding Rate Dynamics: Perpetual futures involve periodic funding rates, which can either be a cost or a revenue stream, influenced by the difference between futures and spot prices. Understanding these rates is crucial. Emotional Trading: The fast-paced nature and high stakes of leveraged trading can lead to emotional decisions, which often result in suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, approaching these new contracts with a well-defined strategy, disciplined risk management, and continuous learning is crucial. Always begin with manageable position sizes and gradually increase your exposure as your experience and confidence grow. Conclusion: Binance’s upcoming listing of 42/USDT Binance perpetual futures , complete with up to 50x leverage and its integration into Binance Alpha, marks a significant expansion of its derivatives ecosystem. This development offers traders innovative avenues for speculation and sophisticated hedging strategies, all supported by Binance’s robust and secure trading infrastructure. While the allure of substantial gains is undeniable, it is paramount to prioritize stringent risk management and cultivate a deep understanding of both perpetual futures mechanics and the intricacies of leverage. As 42 gains enhanced visibility through Binance Alpha, traders will likely have access to even more comprehensive insights, empowering them to make highly informed decisions within this ever-evolving and dynamic cryptocurrency market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Binance perpetual futures? Binance perpetual futures are cryptocurrency derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date. This means positions can be held indefinitely, offering flexibility for various trading strategies. When will the 42/USDT perpetual futures contract be available? The 42/USDT perpetual futures contract is scheduled to be listed and available for trading on Binance at 10:30 a.m. UTC on October 27. What does 50x leverage mean for traders? 50x leverage allows traders to control a position worth 50 times their initial investment. While this can amplify potential profits significantly, it also dramatically increases the risk of losses and liquidation if the market moves against the position. How can I manage risk when trading Binance perpetual futures? Effective risk management includes starting with small position sizes, setting stop-loss orders, understanding funding rates, and never risking more capital than you can afford to lose. Continuous education and a clear trading strategy are also vital. What is Binance Alpha and how does 42’s inclusion benefit traders? Binance Alpha is typically a program or platform within Binance that offers enhanced features, data, or analytical insights for specific assets. 42’s inclusion means traders may gain access to more in-depth information and resources to better understand its market dynamics and potential for the new Binance perpetual futures contract.

Related Reading: Shiba Inu Might Be ‘Dead And Sleeping’, But Not For Long, Crypto Expert Says While the current environment is dominated by selling pressure and low institutional interest, some chart patterns deserve a closer look. From Crash to Compression: Dogecoin Under Pressure Dogecoin’s price tumbled from around $0.3066 to approximately $0.198, marking a dramatic 30 % decline that has shaken short-term holders. On the technical front, DOGE broke below a consolidating upward wedge, and a “death cross” is looming as the 50-day EMA approaches a crossover beneath the 200-day. DOGE's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Analysts warn this structure has historically signaled deeper losses. Support at $0.1515 is under watch (about 22 % below current levels), while a breakdown under $0.0570 could open the door to an extreme risk scenario (-90 %) riding on a bearish flag on the weekly chart. Adding to the pressure, the recently-launched DOGE ETF saw only around $30.7 million in assets, far below rival products and suggesting weak institutional demand. The steep 1.5 % expense ratio further dampens its appeal. Technical Setup: Danger Ahead, But Also Hope Despite the gloom, Dogecoin exhibits some intriguing longer-term patterns that hint at the possibility of reversal. On one hand, momentum indicators, like MACD and MFI, point to weakening buying strength and growing dominance of sellers. This supports the near-term bearish case. On the other hand, a long-term ascending channel since 2021 shows DOGE trading near its lower boundary, with the Stochastic RSI at historically low levels, similar to prior pre-rallies. Analysts highlight that if DOGE can hold key support around $0.19 and break above resistance near $0.30, the path toward $0.50–$1 becomes more plausible. A key resistance point lies near $0.21, often referred to as a “supply wall” due to heavy prior accumulation. Each time DOGE approaches the resistance level, selling pressure typically increases, causing repeated rejections. Thus, for DOGE to flip the narrative, a clean breakout above $0.21 coupled with volume would be critical. What Comes Next? Cautiously Optimistic Outlook In the short term, Dogecoin faces more likely downside or sideways action unless fresh buyer momentum emerges. But if support holds and a breakout occurs, the long-term technical structure suggests upside potential toward the $1 mark.

Bull Run Predictions Catch Attention The scenario isn’t guaranteed, it requires a confirmed reversal, rising volume, and a shift in sentiment.

Absent that, caution remains justified.

The success of its underlying technology directly influences its market perception and, consequently, its price. Current Market Standing: A Snapshot of VIRTUAL Token Performance To perform an accurate crypto price analysis , we must first assess the current market standing of the VIRTUAL token . Like all cryptocurrencies, VIRTUAL’s price is subject to high volatility, influenced by broader market trends, project developments, and investor sentiment. While specific real-time data fluctuates constantly, we can examine general patterns. Historically, new protocols often experience significant price movements during their initial phases, followed by periods of consolidation or rapid growth based on adoption and utility. Key metrics to watch include: Market Capitalization: The total value of all VIRTUAL tokens in circulation, indicating its overall size in the crypto market. Trading Volume: The amount of VIRTUAL traded over a specific period, reflecting liquidity and investor interest. Circulating Supply: The number of VIRTUAL tokens currently available to the public. These figures provide a baseline for our VIRTUAL price prediction . A healthy trading volume and growing market cap often signal increasing investor confidence and potential for future appreciation. Conversely, low liquidity or declining interest can pose challenges. Key Factors Influencing VIRTUAL Price Trajectory Predicting the trajectory of any digital asset, including Virtuals Protocol , involves analyzing a multitude of factors.

Virtuals Protocol Price Prediction 2025: What Does the Near Future Hold? Looking ahead to 2025, the VIRTUAL price prediction is subject to a blend of optimism and cautious realism. Assuming the broader crypto market continues its recovery and Virtuals Protocol hits key development milestones, we could see steady growth. The year 2025 is often viewed as a crucial period for projects to demonstrate tangible utility and expand their ecosystems. If Virtuals Protocol successfully launches significant upgrades, attracts new developers, and fosters a vibrant community, the demand for the VIRTUAL token could increase. Early adoption phases often lead to price appreciation as more users discover the project’s value proposition. Based on our crypto price analysis and considering market cycles, a conservative yet optimistic forecast for 2025 might place VIRTUAL in a range of $0.50 to $1.20 . This range accounts for potential market volatility but also reflects the growth potential if the protocol executes its roadmap effectively. Sustained positive news, increased partnerships, and a growing user base will be key drivers for reaching the higher end of this projection. Virtuals Protocol Price Prediction 2026-2027: Mid-Term Projections and Growth As we move into 2026 and 2027, the mid-term outlook for Virtuals Protocol becomes clearer, assuming the project continues its development and adoption trajectory. This period is critical for cementing its position in the competitive blockchain landscape. If Virtuals Protocol can establish itself as a go-to platform for specific use cases or a significant player in the broader decentralized ecosystem, its value proposition will strengthen considerably. The success of the protocol in attracting institutional interest and real-world applications will be pivotal. As the project matures, the VIRTUAL token ‘s utility could expand beyond basic transactions, potentially including enhanced staking rewards, exclusive access to features, or governance power. Such developments would naturally increase demand and reduce selling pressure. For the VIRTUAL price prediction between 2026 and 2027, a potential range could be from $1.00 to $2.50 . This projection hinges on: Consistent execution of the development roadmap. Significant growth in its user and developer base. Positive overall sentiment in the future crypto market. Successful integration with other major blockchain networks. This period will be a test of Virtuals Protocol’s ability to scale and maintain relevance amidst evolving technological trends and increasing competition. Virtuals Protocol Price Prediction 2028-2030: Will VIRTUAL Price Hit $5? The long-term vision for Virtuals Protocol , extending to 2028, 2029, and 2030, presents the most intriguing prospects and the biggest question: Will VIRTUAL price hit $5? Achieving such a milestone requires not just sustained growth but also significant market penetration and widespread recognition. For a long-term VIRTUAL price prediction , we must consider a scenario where Virtuals Protocol becomes a dominant or highly influential player in its target market. To reach $5, Virtuals Protocol would likely need to: Achieve Mass Adoption: Become a fundamental layer for a multitude of popular dApps, attracting millions of users and thousands of developers.

53611472,613837,1761375632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53611472.jpeg,Crypto.com Pursues National Trust Bank Charter Application With OCC,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-com-pursues-national-trust-bank-charter/,"Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com (CRO) announced on Friday its intention to apply for a national trust bank charter with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). This move aligns Crypto.com with other major firms in the industry, including Coinbase (COIN), Ripple Labs, stablecoin issuer Paxos, and Sony Bank, who are also pursuing similar charters in the country. What A National Trust Bank Charter Means For Crypto.com According to the exchange’s official statement on the matter, the application aims to enhance Crypto.com’s custody technology and expand its customer offerings, which include asset custody and staking across various blockchains and digital asset protocols, such as Cronos. A National Trust Bank Charter would establish Crypto.com as a preferred destination for custody services, particularly for Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), Exchange Traded-Funds (ETFs), and other corporate and institutional investors. Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder and CEO of Crypto.com, stated: We are excited to take this next step by filing for a National Trust Bank Charter and look forward to continuing to pursue opportunities to provide customers with the trusted services they require. It’s important to note that a national trust bank charter also allows companies to act as fiduciaries, manage assets, and settle transactions, but it does not permit them to accept deposits or extend loans like traditional banks. This special-purpose charter is particularly appealing to companies aiming to manage stablecoin reserves or other digital assets under a single federal regulator, the OCC, thereby avoiding the complexities of state-by-state licensing. A New Era For Crypto Banking In a related development, Erebor, a firm backed by Peter Thiel, has received partial regulatory approval from the OCC to launch, aimed at addressing the gap left by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). A source close to Erebor shared with the Financial Times that the bank aims to be a stable and reliable institution, stating, “We want to be a stable, low-risk, reliable bank doing normal banking things without screwing everyone over with undue risk.” Erebor will be headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, with an additional office in New York, offering digital-only customer service through a smartphone app and website. Furthermore, Erebor plans to incorporate stablecoins into its operations, aligning with the recent reversal of regulations by the Trump administration that limited banks from engaging in stablecoin transactions. The source mentioned that the bank’s swift approval reflects its “extremely conservative business plan,” emphasizing that it would not operate as a “wacky, techno crypto bank.” As the industry navigates this landscape under a pro-crypto administration, it remains to be seen whether applicants, including Crypto.com, will experience the same level of support as Erebor. However, it is evident that the crypto sector is in need of new banking services following the collapses of Silvergate and Signature Bank.

Pepeusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000635, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000461. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price faced strong selling around recent highs. This pushed the price of PEPE toward the intra day low of $0.00000713. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.000008 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A significant regulatory development occurred with PEPE’s inclusion in Indonesia’s approved cryptocurrency list on September 1, 2025. PT Central Finansial X (CFX), Indonesia’s first crypto exchange licensed by the Financial Services Authority (OJK), officially designated 1,444 crypto assets as legally tradable in Indonesia, including popular meme coins like PEPE, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Floki (FLOKI). PEPE Price Prediction October 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000008 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000011. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) October 2025 0.000008 0.000011 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses.

Today, we turn our attention to Virtuals Protocol, a project that’s been generating considerable buzz in the blockchain space. Investors and enthusiasts alike are eager to understand the potential trajectory of this digital asset. Our comprehensive guide delves deep into the Virtuals Protocol price prediction for the coming years, exploring whether the VIRTUAL token can truly reach the ambitious $5 mark. Let’s uncover the factors that could drive its value and what the future might hold for this intriguing crypto. Understanding Virtuals Protocol: The Core of VIRTUAL Crypto Before we dive into price forecasts, it’s essential to grasp what Virtuals Protocol is and the problem it aims to solve. At its heart, Virtuals Protocol is designed to be a foundational layer for the next generation of virtual worlds, metaverse applications, and decentralized gaming. It seeks to empower creators and users by providing robust infrastructure for digital asset ownership, interoperability, and true economic participation within virtual environments. This innovative approach positions VIRTUAL crypto not just as another digital token, but as a utility essential for a burgeoning digital economy. Decentralized Ownership: Virtuals Protocol emphasizes user ownership of digital assets, ensuring that items, land, and experiences within virtual worlds are truly owned by individuals, not centralized entities. Interoperability: A key challenge in the metaverse is the lack of seamless interaction between different virtual platforms. Virtuals Protocol aims to bridge these gaps, allowing assets and identities to move freely across various virtual spaces. Creator Economy: It provides tools and incentives for creators to build, monetize, and distribute their content within the protocol’s ecosystem, fostering a vibrant and self-sustaining community. The vision behind Virtuals Protocol is ambitious, aiming to lay the groundwork for a truly open and decentralized metaverse. Its success hinges on its ability to attract developers, users, and partnerships, all of which will play a crucial role in its adoption and, consequently, its market value. VIRTUAL Coin Price: A Historical Overview and Current Standing To make informed predictions, we must first examine the past performance and current market standing of the VIRTUAL coin price . Like many emerging cryptocurrencies, VIRTUAL has experienced periods of significant volatility since its inception. Its price movements are often influenced by broader market sentiment, project developments, partnership announcements, and overall interest in the metaverse and Web3 gaming sectors. Initially, tokens often see price surges driven by speculative interest and early adoption, followed by corrections as the market matures or new information emerges. Understanding these cycles is vital for any investor. Factors such as its initial listing price, all-time high, all-time low, trading volume, and market capitalization provide a snapshot of its journey. A healthy trading volume indicates liquidity and active market participation, while market capitalization reflects its total value in the crypto ecosystem. Analyzing historical data helps identify support and resistance levels, which are critical technical indicators. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, it offers valuable context for understanding the coin’s behavior under different market conditions. The current standing of VIRTUAL coin price reflects both the project’s ongoing development and the prevailing sentiment across the broader crypto landscape. Virtuals Protocol Price Prediction 2025: What’s on the Horizon? As we look towards 2025, several factors will likely influence the Virtuals Protocol price prediction . The crypto market is dynamic, but projections for the near future can be made by considering technological advancements, market adoption rates, and macro-economic trends. For Virtuals Protocol, 2025 could be a pivotal year. Technological Milestones: If Virtuals Protocol successfully rolls out key features, mainnet upgrades, or new developer tools, it could significantly boost confidence and attract more users and projects to its ecosystem. Partnerships and Integrations: Strategic collaborations with major gaming studios, metaverse platforms, or other blockchain projects would expand its reach and validate its utility, positively impacting its price. Broader Market Recovery: A general bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market, often influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and regulatory clarity, would likely lift altcoins like VIRTUAL. Conservative estimates might place VIRTUAL in a range reflecting steady growth, while more optimistic scenarios could see it making significant gains if the project hits critical development targets and market conditions are favorable. Many analysts suggest that if the metaverse and Web3 gaming sectors continue their expansion, projects with strong fundamentals like Virtuals Protocol are well-positioned for growth. While a precise number is difficult, a gradual ascent towards higher price points, possibly approaching the $1-$2 range, could be a realistic outlook for 2025 under favorable conditions. VIRTUAL Price Forecast 2026-2030: The Road to $5? Projecting the VIRTUAL price forecast out to 2030 involves a greater degree of speculation, but it allows us to consider the long-term potential of Virtuals Protocol. The question of whether VIRTUAL can hit $5 is a significant one, and it depends on a confluence of factors evolving over several years. For VIRTUAL to reach or surpass the $5 mark, it would likely require: Mass Adoption of the Metaverse: The widespread acceptance and integration of virtual worlds into daily life, similar to how the internet became ubiquitous. Virtuals Protocol as a Dominant Player: The protocol establishing itself as a leading infrastructure provider for metaverse development, attracting a large ecosystem of creators and users. Strong Tokenomics and Utility: The VIRTUAL token must maintain strong utility within the ecosystem, with increasing demand driven by network usage, staking, and governance. Sustained Bull Market: A prolonged period of growth across the entire crypto market, with significant capital flowing into innovative blockchain projects. If these conditions materialize, the growth potential for VIRTUAL could be substantial. By 2026, we might see VIRTUAL consolidating its position, potentially reaching targets between $2 and $3. Looking further to 2030, if Virtuals Protocol achieves its ambitious roadmap and becomes a cornerstone of the decentralized metaverse, the $5 target could indeed be within reach, or even surpassed. This long-term outlook is predicated on continuous innovation, effective community engagement, and a supportive market environment. However, it is crucial to remember that such long-term forecasts carry inherent risks and uncertainties. Comprehensive VIRTUAL Coin Analysis: What Drives the Value? A thorough VIRTUAL coin analysis goes beyond simple price charts and delves into the underlying factors that contribute to its value proposition. Understanding these drivers is key to forming a holistic view of its investment potential. Key Value Drivers: Technology and Innovation: The strength of Virtuals Protocol’s underlying blockchain technology, its scalability, security, and unique features for metaverse development. Team and Advisors: The experience and track record of the development team, their ability to execute the roadmap, and the support from influential advisors. Community and Ecosystem Growth: A thriving community of developers, users, and content creators is vital. A growing ecosystem translates to increased demand for the VIRTUAL token. Partnerships and Integrations: Collaborations with established companies, gaming platforms, or other blockchain projects can significantly boost adoption and visibility. Tokenomics: The design of the VIRTUAL token’s economic model, including its supply, distribution, utility (e.g., staking, governance, transaction fees), and inflation/deflation mechanisms. Market Trends: The overall sentiment and growth of the broader cryptocurrency market, especially the metaverse, Web3 gaming, and NFT sectors. Regulatory Environment: Evolving regulations can impact crypto projects. A favorable or clear regulatory landscape can foster growth, while restrictive policies can hinder it. Each of these elements plays a role in shaping the perceived and actual value of the VIRTUAL token. A strong performance across most of these categories would significantly enhance its potential for long-term appreciation. Navigating VIRTUAL Market Trends: Opportunities and Challenges Understanding VIRTUAL market trends is crucial for any investor considering this asset. The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its volatility, and VIRTUAL is no exception. However, within these trends lie both significant opportunities and considerable challenges. Opportunities: Emerging Metaverse Economy: The metaverse is still in its nascent stages, offering immense growth potential. Virtuals Protocol, as a foundational layer, stands to benefit significantly from this expansion. Decentralization Demand: Increasing demand for true digital ownership and decentralized experiences aligns perfectly with Virtuals Protocol’s core offerings. Innovation in Web3 Gaming: The shift towards play-to-earn and blockchain-integrated gaming provides a fertile ground for VIRTUAL’s utility and adoption. Strategic Partnerships: Future collaborations could unlock new user bases and use cases, driving demand for the token. Challenges: Competition: The metaverse and Web3 space are becoming increasingly crowded with numerous projects vying for market share. Technological Hurdles: Scaling blockchain technology to support complex virtual worlds without compromising decentralization or security remains a significant challenge. Market Volatility: Broad crypto market downturns can negatively impact even strong projects, leading to price corrections. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets could introduce unforeseen challenges or restrictions. User Adoption: Educating and onboarding mainstream users into complex decentralized ecosystems can be a slow process. Investors must weigh these factors carefully. While the opportunities are compelling, the challenges are real and require continuous innovation and strategic execution from the Virtuals Protocol team. Is VIRTUAL a Smart Investment? Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio Considering all the factors discussed, is VIRTUAL a smart investment for your portfolio? The answer, as with most crypto assets, depends on your individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. However, we can offer some actionable insights to help you make an informed decision. Actionable Insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on predictions. Deep dive into Virtuals Protocol’s whitepaper, team, roadmap, and community activity. Understand the Metaverse Landscape: Familiarize yourself with the broader trends in the metaverse and Web3 gaming. This context is crucial for assessing VIRTUAL’s long-term viability. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given crypto volatility, investing a fixed amount regularly can help mitigate risk by averaging out your purchase price over time. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one asset. Spread your investments across various cryptocurrencies and asset classes to manage risk. Monitor Development and News: Stay updated on Virtuals Protocol’s progress, partnership announcements, and any significant market news that could impact its price. Set Realistic Expectations: While a $5 target is exciting, remember that crypto investments are highly speculative. Prepare for potential volatility and only invest what you can afford to lose. Virtuals Protocol presents an intriguing proposition for those bullish on the future of decentralized virtual worlds. Its foundational role could position it for substantial growth, but the journey will undoubtedly involve market fluctuations and competitive pressures. A disciplined approach, combined with continuous learning, is your best strategy. Conclusion: The Astounding Potential of Virtuals Protocol Our deep dive into the Virtuals Protocol price prediction reveals a project with considerable potential within the rapidly evolving landscape of the metaverse and Web3. From its innovative approach to decentralized ownership and interoperability to its ambitious roadmap, VIRTUAL aims to be a cornerstone of future virtual economies.

Recently, a notable change has been observed concerning Bitcoin selling pressure , offering a fresh perspective for investors and traders alike. This development suggests a potential turning point, moving away from a period dominated by profit-taking and market corrections. Is Bitcoin Selling Pressure Truly Easing? An Analyst’s Perspective According to crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., there’s compelling evidence that the Bitcoin selling pressure is indeed slowing down. His analysis highlights a significant trend: the proportion of addresses selling BTC at a profit has visibly declined. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it points to a deeper shift in how market participants are currently viewing Bitcoin’s value and its future trajectory. What does this reduction in profitable selling actually signify? Traders see dips as opportunities: Many investors are now interpreting recent price drops not as a signal to exit, but as an attractive entry point to accumulate more Bitcoin. This indicates a bullish underlying sentiment among a segment of the market. Slowing rate of losses: The pace at which profitable addresses are slipping into a loss-making position is decelerating. This stability suggests a stronger holding conviction. Re-entering profitability: Addresses that were previously underwater are now finding themselves back in the green, often fueled by renewed buying interest. These combined factors paint a clear picture: the negative momentum that might have been weighing on Bitcoin has eased considerably. This shift is crucial for understanding the market’s immediate future. What Does Easing Bitcoin Selling Pressure Mean for Traders? The implications of reduced Bitcoin selling pressure are substantial for anyone involved in the crypto space. When fewer holders are rushing to sell at a profit, it removes a significant hurdle for price appreciation. Essentially, the market is absorbing available supply more readily, which can lead to more stable price action and potentially upward movement. For traders, this development often signals a transition from a seller’s market to one where buyers have more influence. It suggests that: Market confidence may be returning: A decrease in profit-taking can indicate that investors expect higher prices in the future, choosing to hold onto their assets rather than cash out immediately. Potential for accumulation phases: Periods of easing selling pressure often precede phases of accumulation, where smart money and long-term investors build their positions. Reduced volatility: With less aggressive selling, the market tends to experience less drastic price swings, making it a potentially calmer environment for trading decisions. However, it is important to remember that the crypto market remains inherently volatile. While these signs are optimistic, external factors and broader economic conditions can always influence Bitcoin’s price movements. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from Reduced Selling Pressure Understanding the dynamics of Bitcoin selling pressure provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making. For those looking to capitalize on this evolving market sentiment, here are some actionable considerations: Monitor on-chain data: Keep an eye on metrics like ‘SOPR’ (Spent Output Profit Ratio) and ‘Net Unrealized Profit/Loss’ (NUPL), which can offer further confirmation of investor behavior. Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA): If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, an easing of selling pressure might present opportune moments to gradually increase your holdings without trying to perfectly time the market bottom. Diversify your portfolio: While Bitcoin’s outlook seems brighter, a well-diversified portfolio is always a prudent approach in the crypto space. Stay informed: Continuously follow reputable analyst insights and market news to adapt your strategy as conditions evolve. This period of reduced selling pressure could represent a crucial juncture for Bitcoin. It suggests a growing resilience among holders and a renewed belief in the asset’s intrinsic value, moving past immediate profit-taking impulses. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Bitcoin’s Future The analysis indicating easing Bitcoin selling pressure offers a significant glimmer of hope for the crypto market. It signals a shift in investor psychology, where price dips are increasingly viewed as buying opportunities rather than reasons for panic selling. While no single indicator guarantees future price action, this reduction in negative momentum is a powerful sign of growing stability and potentially renewed bullish sentiment for Bitcoin. Traders and investors should observe these trends closely, as they could herald a more positive phase for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is Bitcoin selling pressure? Bitcoin selling pressure refers to the collective force of market participants looking to sell their Bitcoin holdings. High selling pressure typically leads to price declines, as there are more sellers than buyers. Conversely, easing selling pressure means fewer people are eager to sell, often indicating stronger buying interest or holding conviction. Who is Axel Adler Jr. and why is his analysis important? Axel Adler Jr. is a recognized crypto analyst known for his on-chain data analysis. His insights are important because they provide a deeper look into the fundamental behaviors of Bitcoin holders, moving beyond simple price charts to understand underlying market dynamics and sentiment. What does ‘addresses selling BTC at a profit’ mean? This metric refers to the percentage of unique Bitcoin addresses that are moving their BTC when the price is higher than when they acquired it. A decline in this proportion suggests that fewer holders are taking profits, indicating they either expect higher prices or are not being forced to sell. Does easing Bitcoin selling pressure guarantee a price increase? While easing Bitcoin selling pressure is a positive indicator and often precedes periods of price stability or growth, it does not guarantee an immediate or sustained price increase. The crypto market is influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment. It’s one strong signal among many. How can investors use this information? Investors can use this information to inform their strategies. It suggests a potentially more favorable environment for long-term accumulation or for considering new entry points. However, it should always be combined with other forms of analysis and a clear understanding of personal risk tolerance. Did you find this analysis helpful?

And history is set to repeat itself as analysts and AI models such as ChatGPT posit Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an upcoming token that is emulating Ethereum’s early days in innovation, adoption potential, and upside potential. That endeavor is an upstart DeFi giant going at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale. The phase is already more than 75% sold out and investors have less than a couple of days left before it sells out. Mutuum Finance is rapidly becoming the leading top crypto with the capability to provide 1000x long-term returns, a modern-day equal of Ethereum’s legendary meteoric increase. Investors who are searching for the best crypto to buy now are closely monitoring MUTM’s progress and potential. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis: Bears Tighten Their Grasp Below $4K Ethereum (ETH) is presently exhibiting weakness as bears tighten their grasp below the pivotal $4,000 level. The token was unable to hold above the 20-day EMA ($4,062), showing that there are Sellers at work even on minor rallies. ETH is being tested now close to its channel support, where bulls must stand firm to prevent further dips. A breakdown below here might witness the price drop into a steeper move towards $3,350, or a retest of the $3,200 zone before buyers can take another stab at trying to regain control. Conversely, if ETH can recover the $4,060–$4,250 range, a relief rally to $4,400+ could ensue that could be a short-term reversal indicator. Though Ethereum is a stronghold of the crypto scene, investors are growing curious to look out to newer plays with comparable long-term prospects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been likened to the early growth story of ETH, further solidifying its position as the top crypto to watch. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Phase 6 Almost Sold Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is attracting serious money, so MUTM is the best crypto to buy now in 2025. Stage 6 is where the token is priced at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from Stage 5 and the lowest that it will ever be. Reaching the end of Stage 6 will usher in Stage 7 at $0.04. This is a 14.28% jump, so getting in as early as possible is incredibly important. Investor demand is still high, with more than 17,400 investors purchasing in excess of $17.85 million to this date. Since 70% of Phase 6 has sold, investor demand is high as investors scramble for access to this growth DeFi platform and secure a position in the top crypto opportunities available today. Secure Architecture and Incentive-Based Community Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a robust security design to safeguard its protocol and users. It has a Loan-to-Value architecture, asset-backed collateral levels, and risk-based lending and transfer liquidation levels according to the risk classification of all assets. It also has a reserve factor as an insurance component against potential future defaults and market extremity, where riskier assets have larger reserves in place to offer greater protection to the platform and users. While that’s on, Mutuum Finance is creating a vibrant and busy community via a $100,000 giveaway contest. Ten users stand to win $10,000 each in MUTM tokens courtesy of this promotion, with the rewards distributed based on new investments into the project. The Next Ethereum Ethereum turned its early adopters into millionaires, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can do the same. Having raised more than $17.85 million from over 17,400 investors already, its Phase 6 presale is 75% sold through at only $0.035 per token. With the demand pushing up ahead of the Stage 7 price hike to $0.04, investors are able to obtain early positions. AI models and analysts predict MUTM to be the next Ethereum-level growth story with long-term returns of 1000x potential, making it the best crypto to buy now.

The report noted that the ETH price is still correcting within the falling trend channel (red lines) and is struggling to hold above the $3,727 support level. Buyers have stepped in at this level several times. According to the analytics firm: In the short-term outlook, the $3,600 level is central. According to MakroVision, this area, along with the lower boundary of the channel, is key support. A break below this level could send the price towards the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, which is around $3,174. Meanwhile, it was noted that a break above $4,290 is needed for an upward move. Analysts believe that breaking this level could spark new upward momentum, targeting $4,780 and above.

The precious metal breached $4,000 per ounce for the first time in history on October 10, before shedding more than 6% of its value earlier this week after trade tensions cooled. The surge in bullion prices culminated in a record $4,300 per troy ounce before the market experienced its steepest one-day drop in over ten years on October 21, Cryptopolitan reported . Despite the correction, gold is one of 2025’s strongest performing assets, up roughly 50% year to date. Central banks take up Gold to counter market uncertainty According to data compiled by Bloomberg, October saw a surge in gold-backed exchange-traded fund holdings, which hit their highest levels in more than three years. Central banks have been net buyers of gold for 15 consecutive years, but their pace ticked upwards after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Western sanctions froze a large portion of Russia’s foreign reserves in geopolitical retaliation, prompting other central banks to diversify away from the US dollar and expand their gold reserves. The World Gold Council reported that global central banks purchased more than 1,000 tons of bullion for a third straight year in 2024, holding roughly one-fifth of all the gold ever mined. Central Banks gold accumulation chart. Source: Apollo Academy. Many of the most aggressive buyers are countries that were not part of the post-World War II Bretton Woods system, which established the dollar as the global reserve currency and underpinned by gold. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has been adding to its holdings for 11 consecutive months through September. China’s central bank is also seeking to become a custodian for foreign sovereign gold reserves, Bloomberg reported . “China is playing a key role in the ongoing rise in gold prices because of central bank buying, arbitrage trading, and increased speculative and safe-haven demand among Chinese households,” wrote Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, in a research note published last Tuesday. Most of the world’s official gold is traditionally stored in the Bank of England’s vaults, which currently hold more than 5,000 tons of the global total. Morgan Stanley Research recently revised its 2026 price forecast upward to $4,400 per ounce, from a previous estimate of $3,313. The new projection implies an additional 10% gain from early October levels. “We see further upside in gold, driven by a falling US dollar, strong ETF buying, continued central bank purchases and a backdrop of uncertainty supporting demand for this safe-haven asset,” said Amy Gower, Metals and Mining Commodity Strategist at Morgan Stanley. The metal has a long history of performing bullishly during periods of market turmoil, having crossed psychological thresholds in each major crisis over the past two decades. It accelerated past $1,000 an ounce during the 2008 financial crisis, clocked $2,000 during the Covid-19 pandemic, and surged to $3,000 after President Trump’s Liberation Day tariff escalations in April this year. Tariffs, inflation, and Fed rates cut optimism According to the World Gold Council, tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have increased import costs and raised the risk of higher consumer prices in the global economy. The POTUS’s public criticism of the Federal Reserve and his persistent calls for more relaxed rate decisions have shaken confidence in the central bank’s independence. Investors expect the Federal Reserve to continue cutting rates this year as economic uncertainty mounts. Historically, gold prices have risen by about 6% on average within two months of the start of a Fed rate-cutting cycle. “With all these factors, it probably comes as no surprise that gold is right up at the top of our order of preference among commodities,” Gower added. The US dollar’s slide has been another factor behind gold’s ascent, because bullion is priced in dollars, and a weaker greenback makes gold more affordable to foreign investors. In mid-September, the dollar fell to its weakest level in more than three years against major global currencies. Get seen where it counts.

This occurred as BTC continued to trade below the 99-day Moving Average (MA), located around $112,086. Bitcoin Liquidity Dries Up Amid High Demand According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Bitcoin’s sell-side liquidity is drying up at a rapid pace, recently hitting a seven-year low at 3.12 million BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Score Turns Negative With Trend Below $106,780 – When Will The Correction End? As BTC’s supply tumbles sharply, the cryptocurrency is trading in the low $110,000 range, indicating a delicate balance between falling active circulating supply and growing institutional demand. Latest on-chain data shows that demand for BTC from long-term holders’ addresses has been steadily rising. Over the past 30 days, long-term investors have accumulated 373,700 BTC. Long-term investors accumulating BTC during the latest dip shows that there is sufficient market demand for the flagship cryptocurrency despite a volatile crypto market. Arab Chain remarked that the market is currently in a “quiet accumulation” phase ahead of a potential breakout. The CryptoQuant analyst emphasized that the Liquidity Inventory Ratio (LIR) has crashed to around 8.3 months, suggesting that current market liquidity covers less than nine months’ worth of demand – confirming the rapid depletion in BTC’s sellable supply. For the uninitiated, the LIR measures the balance between available liquidity and active trading demand in the market, showing whether market makers are providing sufficient depth relative to recent trade volume. A high LIR suggests ample liquidity and stable price movement, while a low LIR indicates thinner order books and higher vulnerability to volatility or slippage. The medium-term outlook for BTC looks bullish, due to a combination of declining liquidity and growing demand from institutional and long-term investors. Arab Chain added: If this trend continues through the end of the fourth quarter, Bitcoin’s price could surpass $115,000, especially if accompanied by rising buying flows from US investment funds and ETFs, supporting the continuation of the current bullish trend. BTC Top Not In Yet While some analysts predict that BTC may have already peaked this market cycle, others are confident that the top cryptocurrency is yet to hit its cycle high. Recent on-chain data indicates that BTC NVT Golden Cross is yet to enter the territory that marked previous cycle tops.

JPMorgan To Allow Bitcoin, Ether As Collateral On Friday, Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to let its institutional clients use the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether, as collateral for loans by the end of 2025. This follows the bank’s move to allow crypto-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) as collateral. In June, the bank began allowing both institutional and retail clients globally to use spot crypto-linked ETFs, like BlackRock’s IBIT, to pledge the investment products. Previously, clients could only do it on a case-by-case basis. According to people familiar with the matter, the new program will be offered globally, allowing JPMorgan’s clients to pledge their Bitcoin and Ether holdings as security for loans, expanding Wall Street’s crypto integration. The program is set to rely on a third-party custodian to safeguard the pledged assets. Bloomberg sources affirmed that the largest US bank first began exploring the idea of lending against Bitcoin in 2022. However, the project was reportedly shelved due to regulatory challenges. Since then, there have been significant developments in the US crypto landscape, including a massive surge in institutional adoption and the government’s regulatory shift to make America the “Crypto Capital of the World.” In July, some reports suggested that the banking giant was once again exploring the idea of expanding its lending operations to include crypto-collateralized loans, as the bank’s earlier rigid stance on digital assets seemingly alienated some prospective clients. JPMorgan’s Crypto Shift It’s worth noting that JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been a long-time crypto skeptic. In January, the CEO called the flagship crypto a “Ponzi scheme” and dismissed it as “useless as a pet rock.” Nonetheless, he announced a change in the bank’s policy in May to allow clients to purchase Bitcoin. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients,” Dimon stated, explaining that the decision came despite his personal stance on digital assets. Since then, JPMorgan has shared plans to embrace stablecoins and crypto trading. In July, the bank announced its intention to launch a limited version of a stablecoin for its clients, arguing that they “can’t afford to stay on the sidelines” as other major institutions start to offer crypto-linked products. Last week, JPMorgan also announced its plans to allow clients to trade crypto assets. As reported by Bitcoinist, senior executives affirmed that JPMorgan is developing services that will enable its clients to trade cryptocurrencies directly through the bank. Notably, US Bancorp previously announced that it has relaunched its offering of crypto custody services after more than three years, following the removal of a Biden-era guidance that prevented financial institutions from providing these services. Meanwhile, Citigroup was also exploring plans to offer crypto custody, payment services, and custody offerings for spot crypto ETFs. However, JPMorgan’s global head of markets and digital assets, Scott Lucas, noted that custody is “not on the horizon near-term.” The executive explained last week that risk rules and regulatory developments will determine how far the bank expands in the future.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Collateralized loans|Crypto Custody|Crypto Trading|ETH|Ether|Ethereum|Jamie Dimon|JPMorgan|JPMorgan Bitcoin|JPMorgan crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 08:00:32

In 2027, it will range between $2.47 and $2.80, with an average price of $2.54. In 2030, it will range between $7.94 and $9.64, with an average price of $8.17. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will its price be in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031.

The coin is down 13.63% in the last 30 days. Its market recorded less trading interest as trading volumes dropped by 0.68% to $340.5M. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView APE fell below $1 in January and $0.5 in April. This month, it trades at the $0.4 mark after a sharp decline over the last two weeks. The MACD histogram shows its positive momentum rose in the last three days. Its volatility dropped over the same period. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s break above $0.42 resistance. Unlike the daily chart, its volatility is rising as the positive market momentum wanes. The break pushed APE into overbought territory, but it has corrected with the RSI at 63.43.

Over the short term, APE price analysis shows that APE is attempting a recovery; however, its momentum remains low. The general market remains bearish, with the Fear and Greed Index showing a fear sentiment among traders. Low trading volumes confirm less conviction in the current market trend. Why is APE down? APE’s rally reflects NFT sector tailwinds as the BAYC market cap surged, event-driven speculation, and technical momentum. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. driven by the APE bridge to ApeChain and growing utility and applications, such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news While Solana’s low fees attracted new users, the dissolution of ApeCoin DAO (99.66% approval) alienated decentralization advocates. ApeCo’s 10M APE treasury allocation ($3.72M) added inflationary pressure. APE price prediction October 2025 The APE October price prediction ranges between $0.35 and $0.70, with an average of $0.59.

However, a fascinating trend is emerging in the market, particularly concerning Bitcoin volatility . Despite trading near its all-time high, Bitcoin is currently exhibiting remarkably low volatility, a phenomenon that has captured the attention of market analysts. This unusual stability could be signaling something significant for the future of the leading digital asset. What’s Behind Bitcoin’s Surprisingly Low Volatility? Joe Consorti, the head of growth at the prominent Bitcoin custody firm Theya, has brought this intriguing observation to light. He notes that Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading within a surprisingly tight 15% range of its all-time high for an extended period – specifically, eight months this year. This prolonged period of calm at such elevated price levels is quite unusual for an asset known for its dramatic price action. Consorti explains that this current behavior, characterized by low Bitcoin volatility , paradoxically resembles a price bottom rather than a market top. Typically, when Bitcoin reaches new record highs, it’s often accompanied by increased speculation and heightened price fluctuations. However, the market is showing a different face this time. Key characteristics of this unique phase include: Tight Trading Range: Bitcoin has maintained a narrow price corridor despite its proximity to historical peaks. Extended Duration: Eight months of consolidation is a significant period for any asset, let alone one as dynamic as Bitcoin. Proximity to All-Time High: This stability is occurring precisely when one might expect more turbulence. Why Is This Bitcoin Volatility Pattern So Unprecedented? Historically, Bitcoin’s journey to new all-time highs has rarely been this smooth. Consorti emphasizes that Bitcoin has “never consolidated in this manner near an all-time high.” This makes the current period particularly noteworthy for anyone tracking market trends. Consolidation, in financial terms, refers to a period where an asset’s price moves within a limited range, often building a base of support or absorbing selling pressure before its next major move. The significance of this calm period cannot be overstated. It suggests a potential shift in market dynamics. Perhaps it reflects a growing maturity of the asset, with a more stable investor base. Moreover, increased institutional interest might be contributing to this newfound stability, as larger players tend to have longer investment horizons and less reactive trading strategies. Consequently, the reduced speculative frenzy, compared to previous bull cycles, could be a key factor in the sustained low Bitcoin volatility we are witnessing. Are Explosive Bitcoin Gains on the Horizon? Given this unusual and extended period of consolidation, Consorti finds it “difficult not to anticipate a further rise.” This sentiment resonates with many analysts who view such calm before a storm as a powerful bullish signal. When an asset consolidates tightly after a significant upward move, it often indicates that it’s gathering momentum for its next major leg up. In Bitcoin’s case, with its historical tendency for rapid price appreciation, this period of low Bitcoin volatility could indeed be setting the stage for an explosive rally. What does this mean for investors? The potential benefits are clear: significant price appreciation without the extreme, stomach-churning swings that often accompany Bitcoin’s rallies. This suggests that patient investors holding through this consolidation period might be rewarded handsomely. An actionable insight here is to consider a long-term perspective, recognizing that these periods of calm can be crucial precursors to substantial growth. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the unique nature of this current market phase provides a compelling argument for optimism. Navigating the Future: Potential Challenges and Considerations While the analyst’s insights paint a promising picture, it’s important to remember that no investment is without risk. The cryptocurrency market remains influenced by various external factors, including global macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and unforeseen market events. Therefore, while the low Bitcoin volatility is a strong signal, it doesn’t guarantee future gains. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance. However, the core message from Consorti’s analysis is about the strength of the underlying signal. The market is behaving in a way it never has before at these price levels, suggesting a robust foundation for potential future growth. This unprecedented period of stability at the top could truly be the quiet before a significant wave of upward price action for Bitcoin. The current low Bitcoin volatility near its all-time high presents a compelling and unusual market signal. As highlighted by analyst Joe Consorti, this unprecedented consolidation suggests that rather than a typical market top, Bitcoin may be preparing for substantial further gains. While the crypto market always holds an element of unpredictability, the current stability at such high levels offers a unique perspective for those anticipating Bitcoin’s next major move. This unique phase could define Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming months, making it a critical period for observation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitcoin volatility? Bitcoin volatility refers to how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates over a given period. High volatility means rapid and significant price changes, while low volatility indicates more stable and gradual price movements. Why is low volatility near an all-time high unusual for Bitcoin? Historically, when Bitcoin approaches or sets new all-time highs, it’s typically accompanied by increased buying and selling pressure, leading to significant price swings and higher volatility. The current stability is a departure from this pattern. Who is Joe Consorti? Joe Consorti is the head of growth at Theya, a Bitcoin custody firm. He is an analyst known for his observations on Bitcoin market trends. Does low volatility guarantee future Bitcoin gains? While low volatility near an all-time high can be a strong bullish signal, no market indicator guarantees future gains. The analysis suggests a high probability of further increases, but investors should always be aware of market risks. How long has Bitcoin been consolidating near its all-time high? According to Joe Consorti’s analysis, Bitcoin has been trading within a 15% range of its all-time high for eight months this year, indicating a prolonged period of consolidation.

The sector’s total market cap has plunged from over $20 billion in mid-September to around $14 billion today, weighed down by weak demand, slowed development, and investor fatigue. New projects keep launching, but few retain users or deliver meaningful gameplay. The hype-driven “play-to-earn” era is clearly behind us. What’s missing is real engagement — and real businesses. TRUE World can change the game. This Web3 progression layer within the TRUE LABS ecosystem is preparing to list the $TRUE token — and it’s doing so from a position of strength, not speculation. TRUE World Playbook: $TRUE to Power a Vast Web3 Gaming Ecosystem Founded in 2019, TRUE LABS has built a global presence as a game developer that has delivered over 60 high-performing titles. With 4.5 million paying players and €7 million+ in monthly gross revenue, it stands among the few game studios entering Web3 backed by a proven business model. Now, TRUE LABS plans to list its native $TRUE token that fuels a full-scale ecosystem — connecting TRUE LABS, TRUE World, and TRUE Wallet into one unified economy. “The blockchain finally allows us to bring our founding principles of transparency and fairness on-chain,” said Dan Andrianov , CEO of TRUE LABS. “With $TRUE, we’re not just launching a token. We’re giving players a real stake in the world they already love to play in.” TRUE World Evolves into Web3 Gaming Ecosystem TRUE LABS’ rebrand under the slogan “Play Like a Legend. Live Like a Legend. Be TRUE.” marks its transformation from a Web2 game developer into a multi-layered Web3 ecosystem. The company now operates through three core pillars: TRUE LABS — Over 60 live titles across 1,700+ operators, generating €7M+ in monthly GGR and reaching millions of paying users. TRUE World — A progression-based loyalty layer that turns every play into a quest, level, or tournament. $TRUE Token — The economic engine that powers the ecosystem, enabling rewards, staking, and cross-game progression. $TRUE Lies at the Heart of TRUE World The $TRUE token acts as the core utility asset across TRUE World, unlocking: Player progression and achievements across games Access to tournaments, NFT utilities, and marketplace features Unified loyalty and governance mechanisms for the TRUE community Its design goes beyond typical “play-to-earn” logic. Every element of the TRUE LABS economy feeds back into the $TRUE framework, creating a deflationary system powered by actual gaming activity. Burns occur each time players craft or upgrade in-game assets. Meanwhile, buybacks are funded by TRUE LABS’ real-world revenue, repurchasing $TRUE from the open market and burning it. This model ties token scarcity directly to business performance — an approach the broader GameFi space has largely failed to implement. The token is scheduled to be listed on Tier-1 CEX and DEX platforms in Q4 2025, marking a milestone for Web3 integration within the gaming industry. Why Watch the $TRUE Token Listing? TRUE LABS’ entry into Web3 is a structural expansion. In an industry where most projects struggle to retain even a few thousand users, the studio’s established footprint and consistent revenue create a rare foundation for sustainable GameFi growth. If the listing succeeds, it could reignite momentum across the GameFi market, proving that blockchain integration can enhance mainstream gaming. The highly-anticipated launch of $TRUE represents a real-world bridge between web2 gaming and transparent, player-owned economies. The Takeaway GameFi’s downturn has been defined by hype fatigue and broken token models. In contrast, TRUE LABS is entering that landscape with a functioning economy and an established audience. Its $TRUE token may not single-handedly revive the GameFi market, but it could become the first credible example of how a traditional gaming business with real revenue and regulation can thrive on-chain. For crypto investors watching for signs of life in GameFi, this may be the alpha call worth paying attention to.

Whether you trade daily or hold long term, keeping your digital assets safe is essential. In 2025, wallet technology has evolved — offering stronger encryption, institutional-grade custody, and even regulatory compliance. This review looks at the top five secured crypto wallets that combine ease of use with advanced protection — featuring Clapp, a licensed European platform offering an integrated wallet with institutional security. 1. Clapp — Regulated Wallet With Institutional-Grade Security Highlights: Licensed crypto platform (VASP, EU-regulated) Fireblocks security infrastructure used by major financial institutions Integrated trading and fiat bridge (EUR on/off ramp) Portfolio management and credit lines Cross-asset liquidity aggregation for optimized execution Review: Clapp.finance offers more than a wallet — it’s a complete crypto hub. Users can store, send, and receive assets securely while also trading and managing portfolios in one interface. Clapp takes a custodial-plus-compliance approach, relying on Fireblocks’ institutional technology to safeguard assets. This makes it particularly appealing to users who prefer regulated environments and fiat accessibility over full self-custody. Its European VASP license (Czech Republic) reinforces Clapp’s focus on compliance and trust. 2. MetaMask — Leading Non-Custodial Wallet for DeFi Users Highlights: Browser and mobile wallet supporting multiple blockchains Full self-custody: you control your keys Integrated swap, staking, and portfolio features Open-source, widely adopted Review:MetaMask remains the go-to wallet for decentralized finance. It allows users to connect directly with dApps, store NFTs, and manage tokens across EVM-compatible networks. The trade-off for control is responsibility: users must protect their private keys and beware of phishing attempts. In 2025, MetaMask continues improving user safety through clearer transaction prompts and scam detection — but vigilance is still required. 3. Trust Wallet — Multi-Chain Mobile Wallet With Simple Interface Best for: Everyday crypto users who want simplicity and control. Highlights: Supports 100+ blockchains and millions of tokens Built-in swaps, staking, and NFT storage Non-custodial (you hold the keys) Backed by Binance, yet remains independent Review:Trust Wallet is one of the most popular mobile wallets, known for its broad asset support and clean user experience. It strikes a good balance between security and accessibility, offering encrypted key storage on your device and local backups. While mobile wallets can be less secure than cold storage, Trust Wallet’s multi-layer protection and active development make it one of the safest soft wallets available in 2025. 4. Coinbase Wallet — Secure Ecosystem With Exchange Integration Highlights: Separate from Coinbase exchange account Private keys stored locally Access to DeFi apps and NFTs Cloud backup option for recovery Review:Coinbase Wallet bridges the gap between regulated exchange users and DeFi explorers. It’s ideal for those transitioning from custodial exchange accounts to self-custody. Security is backed by Coinbase’s established reputation, and the optional encrypted cloud backup ensures recovery in case of device loss — though users should verify privacy settings. 5. Crypto.com DeFi Wallet — Multi-Layer Protection With App Ecosystem Highlights: Supports 1,000+ tokens across multiple chains Biometric security and encrypted backups Direct link to Crypto.com exchange and card services Option to earn rewards via staking Review:Crypto.com’s DeFi Wallet complements its exchange, offering user-controlled keys and multi-factor security. The wallet uses local encryption, biometric access, and an intuitive interface for both beginners and advanced users. It’s particularly useful for those who already use Crypto.com’s products and want to keep all services under one brand. Final Thoughts Each of these wallets serves a different user profile: Clapp prioritizes compliance, offering integrated trading and fiat ramps. MetaMask and Trust Wallet provide full self-custody for decentralized users. Coinbase Wallet and Crypto.com DeFi Wallet balance convenience with strong in-app security. The right choice depends on your priorities — whether that’s full control, regulatory oversight, fiat integration, or DeFi access.

MSTR and Bitcoin are positioned for a potential rally, driven by macro tailwinds, dovish Fed signals, and bearish sentiment. Technically, MSTR is in an accumulation range with significant upside if Bitcoin rallies, and the NAV premium is historically low. Risks remain if Bitcoin fails to hold key support, but the risk/reward setup favors substantial upside for MSTR if crypto markets rebound. Thesis Summary MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has been sliding down for the last 3 months. But after the recent crypto flush out, and given the nice bounce from the recent lows, I believe there’s a good setup for MSTR and potentially Bitcoin (BTC-USD) going forward. MSTR’s dip looks buyable, both in terms of technicals and fundamentals. A Quick Recap My last MSTR post was almost six months ago. Back then, I made the case that MSTR was reaching a buyable breakout. While the stock did go on to rally over the next month or so, we have been in a steady slide since mid-July. More recently, I spoke about Bitcoin looking toppy , but with room for a final rally into the $150,00 zone. Following the latest flush out in crypto, which saw $20 billion in capital wiped out, I believe we now have the right set-up in Bitcoin and Strategy to see a meaningful bounce, perhaps even new all-time highs. The Fundamentals The fundamentals still look supportive of higher Bitcoin prices. The “debasement trade”, which I covered recently in this post, is very much still in play. The current administration wants to outgrow the deficit and do so with the help of a dovish Fed. With inflation data coming out today weaker than expected , the road may now be clear for more cuts, and Powell has even talked about ending QT in the near future. Plus, as I highlighted in my last gold article, the spectacular rally we have seen in gold could soon be followed by a similar rally in Bitcoin, if history is to repeat itself. Crypto Fear And Greed (CMC) All this at a time when Crypto sentiment is still quite bearish. This is when you buy, not when you sell. All in all, there’s a good confluence of macro tailwinds, bearish sentiment, and positioning that tells me we could be in for another fast and furious rally. The Technicals From a technical perspective, this seems like a good risk/reward setup. Let’s start by looking at the underlying asset, Bitcoin. BTC TA (Trendspider) For the time being, Bitcoin has bounced beautifully off the 200-day EMA, for now, and this could set the low. Ideally, I would love to see a quick double bottom form, much like we saw back in March, with a quick dip below the 200 EMA, finding support at $97K and potentially forming a larger bullish divergence with the RSI. Now, let’s look at MSTR. MSTR 1 Day chart (Trendspider) Like Bitcoin, MSTR looks like it could be close to a bottom. The RSI has trended higher over the last few weeks, though arguably we are still below the key EMAs, so the chart looks a bit worse. MSTR 1 week chart (Trendspider) Zooming out to the weekly, we can see that MSTR is within an accumulation range that has been going on for months. We saw this happen back in March 2024 before the big rally, and this could be a repeat. Like Bitcoin, there’s room for a slight retest of lower lows, but either way, this price today seems quite good if we are indeed expecting a significant rally. A simple retest of recent highs would imply a 60% rally from today’s price, which is nothing to scoff at. MSTR over Bitcoin? I would defend owning both, but I would expect MSTR to outperform Bitcoin if it rallies to new highs. The current NAV premium for MSTR is historically low, close to 1.2, and I’d expect this to increase as Bitcoin rallies. Why? Firstly, because MSTR already has Bitcoin in its balance sheet, this increases its leverage potential. The whole strategy behind Strategy works when Bitcoin is rising, and that is a reason there’s a premium. On the other hand, FOMO and sentiment should also make retail names in crypto catch a bid. With short interest near 10%, this also gives MSTR some short squeeze potential. Risks There’s also the chance that the Bitcoin cycle has ended, and we don’t actually see new highs for some time. This is a distinct possibility investors should not ignore. We are nearing what would be the end of the Bitcoin 4-year cycle, and we are near important levels of support after the recent sell-off. If Bitcoin breaks below $90K, this would be a big hit to my bull thesis. Final Thoughts All in all, I like the setup right now for MSTR and Bitcoin. This could be risky, of course, but there’s plenty of upside potential. If Bitcoin breaks towards new all-time highs, there’s room for MSTR to even double from here.",BTC-USD|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-25 08:15:20
53613808,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/top-5-crypto-loan-providers-offering-low-rates-and-high-flexibility,1761380542,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/53613808.jpeg,Top 5 Crypto Loan Providers Offering Low Rates and High Flexibility,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/top-5-crypto-loan-providers-offering-low-rates-and-high-flexibility,"The ability to unlock liquidity without selling crypto is one of the most useful innovations in digital finance. Whether you need funds for trading, investing, or everyday use, crypto loans let you access cash while keeping your long-term holdings intact. Below are the top five crypto loan providers that combine low rates, flexible terms, and strong security. At the top of the list is Clapp, a licensed platform reshaping how users borrow against crypto. 1. Clapp — Regulated Crypto Exchange With Built-In Credit Lines Highlights: Licensed crypto exchange (VASP-certified in the EU) Fiat-to-crypto bridge for buying or cashing out in EUR Crypto-backed credit lines using single assets or whole portfolios Built-in portfolio management with auto-rebalancing and backtesting Fireblocks custody for institutional-grade security Review: Clapp.finance stands out for combining crypto-to-fiat trading, portfolio management, and credit lines within a single regulated environment. Its crypto-backed loans let users borrow instantly without selling their assets, using either individual tokens or diversified portfolios as collateral. Because Clapp operates under an EU license and uses Fireblocks for custody, users benefit from both regulatory clarity and institutional-level security. The platform’s fiat bridge makes it especially attractive for European users who want to move between crypto and EUR seamlessly. 2. Nexo — Established Centralized Lender With Competitive Rates Highlights: Instant crypto-backed loans with up to 50% LTV Option to borrow in fiat, stablecoins, or NEXO tokens Interest discounts for loyalty-tier users Regulated entity with audited reserves Review:Nexo is one of the most recognized names in CeFi lending. It offers flexible borrowing options and supports a wide range of crypto assets. The interface is beginner-friendly, and users can enjoy lower rates if they hold NEXO tokens. However, since it’s a centralized provider, borrowers must trust Nexo with custody of their collateral — a point to weigh if you prefer self-custody or DeFi transparency. 3. Aave — Decentralized Option for Smart Contract-Based Lending Highlights: Fully decentralized; no intermediaries Borrow stablecoins or other tokens using crypto collateral Transparent interest rates set by the protocol Advanced users can supply liquidity and earn yield Review:For users who prefer on-chain solutions, Aave offers an open, permissionless lending environment. Loans are managed through smart contracts rather than a company, and all transactions are verifiable on Ethereum or other supported chains. The downside? You need to understand DeFi mechanics — from gas fees to liquidation thresholds. But for experienced users, Aave remains the gold standard of decentralized lending. 4. YouHodler — High LTV Ratios and Multi-Asset Collateral Support Highlights: Up to 90% LTV for certain assets Borrow in stablecoins or fiat Supports multiple crypto collaterals Easy web and mobile access Review:YouHodler is popular for its generous LTV options, allowing users to borrow more against their holdings. The platform caters to active traders and those who want to squeeze maximum liquidity from their portfolios. The trade-off is that higher leverage increases liquidation risk if markets drop, so it suits users who monitor positions closely. 5. Binance Loans — Trusted Exchange With Deep Liquidity Highlights: Crypto-backed loans from the world’s largest exchange Wide selection of collateral and borrowing assets Flexible terms with daily interest Option to reinvest borrowed funds in the Binance ecosystem Review:Binance brings its exchange liquidity and brand strength into the lending space. Its crypto-loan product is straightforward and integrates well with its trading platform. The main advantage is convenience — users can move collateral and borrowed assets within the Binance ecosystem instantly. However, regional restrictions and identity verification requirements apply. Final Thoughts Crypto lending has evolved into a competitive market offering a wide range of options — from regulated CeFi platforms like Clapp and Nexo to on-chain solutions like Aave. Clapp stands out for its integrated ecosystem and EU licensing, while others like Nexo and Aave offer maturity and user familiarity. Ultimately, the right platform depends on your priorities — whether it’s regulation, decentralization, high LTV, or convenience. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Zhao visited the Central Asian nation for two days to have meetings with government officials, tour national landmarks, and discuss expanding the country’s digital economy. During his stay, Zhao held an informal meeting with Kyrgyzstan’s President, Sadyr Japarov, where the two discussed opportunities to strengthen cooperation in blockchain technology and attract international investment. Zhao talked about the visit positively on social media platform X, stating he “had a great time in Kyrgyzstan” in the past two days. “I encourage more crypto companies to explore the country too,” the former Binance CEO wrote on X early Saturday morning. Zhao and President Japarov also visited Ala-Archa National Park, an excursion shared by Presidential press secretary Askat Alagozov on Facebook. Kyrgyzstan opens doors to cryptocurrencies, working on regulatory clarity Kyrgyzstan is actively developing a national strategy for digital assets, introducing concepts like “state cryptocurrency reserve” and “state mining,” according to Farhat Iminov, head of the Secretariat of the National Council for the development of virtual assets and blockchain technologies under the President. During a National Council meeting on virtual assets, Iminov told policymakers in attendance the progress made since the council’s first meeting on May 3, local news outlet Kabar reported . He reiterated that the Secretariat is focused on improving the legal and institutional environment for blockchain and virtual asset development in Kyrgyzstan with innovation-friendly policies. The Secretariat is reportedly in talks with the Ministry of Economy and Commerce to draft amendments to the Kyrgyz Republic’s law on Virtual Assets. The changes include a legal definition of stablecoins and asset-backed tokens, commonly referred to as RWA tokens. Additionally, the amendments envision a “regulatory sandbox” to allow the testing of innovative financial solutions in a controlled environment. As covered by Cryptopolitan in early September, Kyrgyzstan’s parliament passed the “On Virtual Assets” bill, regulating the crypto market by clarifying the responsibilities of regulatory authorities. The law specifies that one agency will issue licenses to virtual asset service providers, while another will monitor compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing standards. Moreover, the legislation will govern miner registration, set requirements for mining equipment, and licensing procedures for virtual asset services providers (VASPs). CZ joins Kyrgyz national council Speaking to the press late Friday, the Secretariat confirmed that as part of a protocol decision, CZ has been included in the National Council alongside Binance regional representative Kirill Khomyakov and an advisor to the President. Farhat Iminov said their inclusion is a significant boost to the Council’s expertise, adding that their involvement would help legislators make practical decisions, in tandem with the needs of the digital economy. “Participation by leading global figures in blockchain will significantly strengthen the Council’s expert potential and ensure a practical focus in the decision-making process,” Iminov said. CZ has been meeting with several international leaders to extend his influence and help Binance form more partnerships in several jurisdictions. After his release from legal proceedings in the United States in September 2024, he resumed high-profile meetings with government leaders and advisory councils worldwide. This year alone, Zhao met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, joined blockchain advisory councils in Pakistan, and advocated for crypto adoption in Dubai and Islamabad. As reported by Cryptopolitan on Friday, he received a pardon from US President Donald Trump almost two years after pleading guilty to failing to prevent money laundering and stepping down as CEO of Binance. Zhao wrote a message of gratitude on X mid-flight to Kyrgyzstan, saying: “Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice. Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide.” Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates his net worth at $58 billion, accumulated through his ownership in Binance and investments through his family office, YZi Labs. Although he lost his top seat at the exchange, CZ still has a massive influence over the Binance blockchain ecosystem, hosting roughly $8.7 billion in assets. Don’t just read crypto news.

Our PENGU price prediction expects a maximum of $0.0791 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the PENGU price to achieve $0.2. Pudgy Penguins is a set of 8,888 flightless bird NFTs that launched in July 2021 for about $90 each. It sold out quickly and gained attention, even appearing on the cover of the New York Times a month later. Within a few months, the cheapest penguin on the market was selling for over $6,000. However, prices dropped to around $1,000 in early 2022 as the NFT hype faded and issues arose within the community. Many were unhappy with the founder, Cole Villemain (aka ColeThereum), due to accusations of poor management. This led to a community vote to remove Cole. In January 2022, investor Luca Netz offered to buy the project for about $2.5 million. The deal went through a few months later. After Netz took over, the project’s value bounced back—floor prices doubled in just a few days. With new leadership and a fresh roadmap, Pudgy Penguins started rebuilding its reputation as a top NFT project. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Pudgy Penguins price prediction from 2025-2031. In this article, we’ll find out “Will Pengu reach $1?” and explore the factors behind PENGU token price prediction, providing insights into the role and utility of the PENGU token.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the PENGU price from an immediate surge. However, if the PENGU price successfully breaks above $0.023, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.027. PENGU/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, PENGU price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.019, resulting in a correction to $0.012. Is PENGU a good investment? Whether PENGU is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. The coin has support from the popular Pudgy Penguins brand, which has grown through NFTs, merchandise, and big deals like selling toys at Walmart—these could help increase interest in the coin. But the price is still very unpredictable and can change quickly. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the PENGU price down today? PENGU’s price gained strong selling pressure around recent highs, resulting in a strong decline. This created a push below $0.02. Will Pudgy Penguins price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.025 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will PENGU reach $0.2? Pengu price might reach the $0.2 mark in 2031 if buying demand surges and Pengu attracts altcoin investors. Will Pengu reach $1? The $1 mark is a distant dream for Pengu token. This price level is achievable in the long run if Pengu continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Pudgy Penguins a good long-term investment? Pengu token has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

With more than 50 million people holding digital assets and some of the world’s most engaged Web3 communities, the region’s media landscape has evolved into a crucial battleground for brand visibility. But visibility here doesn’t follow the same rules as in the U.S. or Europe. Crypto news cycles in LATAM move fast, driven by grassroots adoption, local influencers, and market sentiment that often shifts overnight. Brands that once relied on sheer coverage volume now face a tougher challenge – proving measurable impact across fragmented media ecosystems. That’s where data-driven communication is redefining the rules. According to Outset PR’s recent LATAM Data Briefs – many crypto teams lose visibility not because their ideas are weak, but because they rely on intuition and “black-box” media buys instead of verifiable data . And as Outset PR’s engagement analysis shows , traffic alone is misleading – measuring real visibility requires looking at engagement quality and durable recognition, not just volume. The rise of data-first approaches is changing that. Below are the top crypto PR firms in LATAM — those shaping how brands grow, engage, and sustain attention across the region. What Makes a Great Crypto PR Agency in LATAM The LATAM crypto market rewards adaptability, local fluency, and analytical discipline. It’s not enough to “get press” – success depends on understanding how narratives travel through languages, media types, and community channels. A truly effective crypto PR agency in Latin America combines three capabilities: Cultural & Linguistic Context LATAM isn’t a single market. Brazil alone accounts for 62% of the region’s crypto media audience , while Spanish-speaking markets like Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia each have distinct ecosystems and tone. Agencies that thrive here understand how culture shapes attention – tailoring messages that feel native rather than translated. Multi-Channel Credibility Visibility in LATAM means playing across different layers – traditional finance outlets, crypto-native portals, and community-driven platforms. The strongest agencies bridge these spaces, ensuring consistency between official statements, thought-leadership content, and influencer narratives. Data-Driven Visibility As Outset PR’s research shows, visibility without verification is noise. The agency’s methodology focuses on verifiable impact – analyzing syndication depth, engagement strength, and machine visibility across LLMs. In markets where hype often outpaces substance, data becomes the only reliable way to prove authority. In other words, great crypto PR in LATAM isn’t just about reach – it’s about resonance, reliability, and recognition. Top Crypto PR Agencies in LATAM (2025 Ranking) Outset PR – Data-Driven Communication for the Web3 Era Outset PR stands at the forefront of crypto communications in Latin America, combining deep analytical insight with editorial precision. While most agencies still measure visibility through surface-level impressions, Outset PR built its methodology around verifiable data. The agency regularly publishes independent media performance reports that have become a reference point for the industry. In its Q1 and Q2 2025 LATAM reports, Outset PR revealed structural shifts in the region’s crypto media landscape – showing that 73% of outlets lost traffic in Q1 and that Brazil alone drives 62% of all crypto-native media audiences. This research-backed approach allows brands to move beyond intuition and plan campaigns based on measurable visibility, authority signals, and engagement depth. With teams experienced in both Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking markets, Outset PR has positioned itself as the go-to partner for data-driven storytelling in a region where credibility increasingly depends on evidence, not hype. Sherlock Communications – Brazil’s Bridge Between Crypto and Public Trust Based in São Paulo, Sherlock Communications has built a reputation as one of Brazil’s most effective PR firms for fintech and blockchain projects. Its strength lies in local relationships and a nuanced understanding of Brazil’s regulatory and cultural landscape. The agency’s campaigns often emphasize public trust and education – a key need in a market where crypto adoption is rising fast but institutional skepticism remains. Sherlock’s bilingual teams work across Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and more, helping projects bridge the gap between technical innovation and mainstream audiences. With Brazil accounting for most of the region’s crypto media traffic, its localized expertise is a major strategic advantage. LatAm Intersect PR – Regional Coverage and Cultural Precision Operating across multiple Latin American countries, LatAm Intersect PR offers a rare combination of regional scale and local fluency. The agency is known for its ability to tailor messaging to different linguistic and cultural contexts – from Mexico’s entrepreneurial fintech scene to Argentina’s fast-maturing DeFi ecosystem. While its portfolio spans technology, finance, and consumer sectors, LatAm Intersect has become increasingly active in crypto communications, supporting blockchain initiatives that require multilingual outreach. Its distributed model allows for agile adaptation to national media ecosystems, which is essential in a region as diverse – and volatile – as LATAM. AWISEE – Content and SEO Powerhouse for Crypto Brands AWISEE operates at the intersection of performance marketing and blockchain communications. With teams in Mexico and Europe, it delivers link-building, localized content strategy, and KOL partnerships for crypto and Web3 clients expanding into Latin America. Unlike traditional agencies that rely on generic placements, AWISEE focuses on measurable outcomes: domain authority, keyword ranking, and referral growth from high-relevance publications. For early-stage projects entering the LATAM market, this SEO approach provides a cost-efficient alternative to classic media buying – turning technical visibility into brand credibility. Crowdcreate — Global Influence Meets Local Engagement Crowdcreate is an internationally recognized marketing and PR agency that has managed campaigns for major blockchain projects while maintaining a strong presence in Latin America. Known for combining investor outreach, influencer marketing, and earned media, Crowdcreate helps global crypto brands localize their message to regional audiences. Its LATAM operations focus on building community trust – from AMAs and event activations to cross-regional collaborations with Spanish- and Portuguese-language publishers. For international clients seeking to connect with LATAM’s fast-growing retail audience, Crowdcreate offers a scalable solution that balances global reach with regional authenticity. Top Crypto PR Agencies in LATAM (2025 Overview) Agency Headquarters / Focus Markets Core Strengths Notable Attributes Outset PR Global agency with LATAM focus (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina) Data-driven PR, analytics-based visibility tracking, LLM integration Publishes quarterly LATAM media performance reports; pioneers measurable PR strategies Sherlock Communications São Paulo, Brazil Localized crypto & fintech communications Deep understanding of Brazilian regulation and media; bilingual execution LatAm Intersect PR Regional (Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia) Regional scalability with cultural precision Multilingual team and local partner network across key LATAM markets AWISEE Mexico / Europe SEO-driven PR, KOL partnerships, link-building Focuses on measurable growth through search visibility and domain authority Crowdcreate Global with LATAM operations Influencer-led and investor-focused PR Combines community marketing with traditional media outreach Emerging Trends in LATAM Crypto PR Latin America’s crypto PR landscape is evolving at a remarkable pace – shaped by rising adoption, AI-driven content discovery, and a generational shift toward data transparency. The region’s communications dynamics in 2025 differ sharply from those of even a year ago. Based on Outset PR’s continuous media monitoring and recent reports, several key trends are defining the next chapter of crypto visibility in LATAM. From Hype to Accountability The days of headline-chasing are ending. With over 73% of crypto outlets losing traffic in Q1 2025, visibility is no longer about how often a project is mentioned but how deeply those mentions resonate. PR agencies are being forced to move beyond volume metrics toward credibility indicators – such as citation quality, domain authority, and sustained syndication reach. This shift favors data-driven firms that can quantify attention rather than just generate noise. Brazil Becomes the Visibility Engine Brazil remains the region’s powerhouse, accounting for over 60% of all crypto-native media traffic. As Outset PR’s data shows, the Brazilian market sets the tone for how narratives move through the continent – from regulation and stablecoin adoption to institutional sentiment. Agencies operating in Brazil now act as regional amplifiers, exporting stories and setting benchmarks for crypto communication across LATAM. AI Is Reshaping Discovery As readers migrate from Google search to AI-powered platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude, publishers are witnessing a redistribution of traffic. Crypto publishers across LATAM have seen visible drops in Google-driven traffic as audiences increasingly turn to AI tools for quick answers – yet referrals from AI sources still make up less than 1% of total visits, according to Outset PR’s Q2 2025 report . Mid-Tier Media Gains Strategic Importance Outset PR’s engagement data indicates that audience loyalty now clusters in mid-tier publications, where session depth and intent match outperform raw traffic numbers. These outlets often operate in Spanish or Portuguese, focusing on analytical storytelling rather than newswire content. As top-tier reach contracts, partnerships with mid-tier media are becoming critical for building authentic, sustained visibility. Data as Infrastructure Finally, the most forward-thinking agencies are reframing PR as infrastructure – not marketing. Data, once treated as a reporting afterthought, now forms the foundation of strategy itself. Measurement tools such as visibility indexes, syndication maps, and AI recall tracking are redefining what it means to “own your narrative” in crypto. In this new paradigm, PR no longer sells exposure; it engineers understanding. Conclusion – LATAM’s Communication Frontier Latin America’s crypto PR landscape is entering a new maturity phase. Once driven by speculation and hype, it’s now shaped by credibility, data, and sustained visibility. Agencies like Sherlock Communications, LatAm Intersect PR, AWISEE, and Crowdcreate are helping projects localize, educate, and connect with audiences across Brazil, Mexico, and beyond. But when it comes to redefining how visibility is measured, Outset PR stands apart. By turning data into strategy – from mapping regional media dynamics to tracking how AI systems perceive brands – the agency has moved crypto PR from guesswork to verifiable impact. As adoption continues to accelerate and discovery becomes increasingly algorithmic, the next wave of LATAM communications will belong to those who can quantify trust. And in that transformation, Outset PR isn’t just participating – it’s setting the standard. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This article explores what could be in store for Solana. This content is delivered by Outset PR , where crypto-native communication meets data-driven intelligence. Outset PR equips leaders with the tools to shape conversations, seize moments of opportunity, and drive sustained market relevance. Solana Eyes Growth After Recent Price Swings Source: tradingview Solana's price is currently fluctuating between one hundred seventy-one to two hundred eight dollars. The coin is riding a wave, showing promising growth in the past six months, with an increase of about twenty-seven percent. Though it dipped over the past month, dropping thirteen percent, it's now positioned to challenge the next resistance level around two hundred twenty-eight dollars. With strong buying momentum, evidenced by the Relative Strength Index at seventy-two, Solana has the potential to climb significantly. If it manages to surpass the two hundred sixty-five dollar mark, this would represent a sizeable rise of nearly twenty-eight percent from its current high in the range.

Signs of recovery are keenly watched as key tokens grapple with recent setbacks. Will Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) manage to rebound, or are further declines on the horizon? The upcoming analysis delves into the potential paths for these digital assets. Just as traders analyze resistance and support zones to predict market movements, Outset PR monitors media outlet performance metrics . This allows them to align campaigns with current market momentum, ensuring their narratives resonate — much like investors seeking breakout assets in a cautious market. Ethereum Holds Steady, Setting Sights on New Highs Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently trading within the upper $3,679 to $4,293 range. Despite recent dips, it's seen a significant six-month increase of over 115%. This suggests solid upward potential. The next hurdle is around $4,600, with a more distant target at $5,214. For ETH to break through these levels, continued investor interest and market momentum are key. If Ethereum can push past that initial resistance, it might rise by over 20% towards the $5,214 mark. With its historical resilience and growth, Ethereum remains an attractive option for those watching the crypto space closely.

Cardano Shows Signs of a Possible Rebound Despite Recent Dip Source: tradingview Cardano's price currently sits between $0.5853 and $0.7283. Despite a recent dip, losing over 4% in a week and more than 22% in a month, the cryptocurrency hints at potential growth. The price hovers near the 10-day moving average of $0.6382, slightly below the 100-day average. If it breaks the nearest resistance at around $0.8037, Cardano could aim for the second resistance level at $0.9467. This climb would represent an increase of over 30% from its current low range. The RSI of 57.23 suggests some room for growth, and the stochastic at 83.17 points to ongoing bullish interest. Conclusion ETH and ADA have experienced recent declines. ETH shows potential for recovery due to its strong network updates and developer activity. ADA, with its focus on innovation, also has room to bounce back. Both coins need to regain investor confidence. Market conditions will play a key role in their recovery prospects. Monitoring these factors can offer insights into their future performance.

The illicit funds were reportedly used to support the country’s illegal development of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs. The monitoring team noted that the total included $1.4 billion stolen from the crypto exchange Bybit in February, as well as $1.2 billion obtained through other illicit cryptocurrency activities in 2024. North Korea uses IT workers to launder funds North Korea has found ways to circumvent UN sanctions , including using cryptocurrency to trade raw materials and military weapons. The country has also deployed numerous IT workers abroad to launder funds and generate income for Pyongyang, according to a report by an international sanctions monitoring group. This revelation has prompted analysts to conduct research, which showed that North Korea has intensified its cyber activities in recent years under the leadership of Kim Jong Un. According to their discovery, hacking has become a primary method applied for them to earn foreign currency amid severe measures put in place due to their nuclear and weapons initiatives. They also realized that officials in the country used stablecoins for transactions related to purchasing military equipment and raw materials, such as copper, which is essential for the production of weapons. To further evade UN sanctions, North Korea sent its IT workers to at least eight different nations, including China, which had the highest number of workers, as well as Russia, Laos, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Nigeria, and Tanzania. Additionally, since the UN sanctions restrict individuals from earning funds outside their country, the MSMT revealed the country’s intention to send 40,000 laborers to Russia, including several groups of IT workers. Meanwhile, North Korea has received strong backing from Russia after providing weapons and sending many of its soldiers to assist Moscow’s troops in the battle against Ukraine. North Korea’s intensified cyber activities spark security concerns The MSMT discussed a 2024 report from 38 North, an analysis program operated by the Stimson Centre think tank. The report highlighted that North Korean IT workers, who concealed their nationalities, acquired contracts for animation projects managed by Japanese and US companies like Amazon and HBO Max. When reports requested that Amazon comment on the claims, a spokesperson from the tech giant alleged that the company had never directly hired these workers. “We previously collaborated with an animation studio that employed subcontractors allegedly involved in this situation. However, those individuals were not Amazon employees and did not have access to our internal systems,” the spokesperson stated. HBO did not reply to a request for comments from a reporter. In the meantime, the report also pointed out that, apart from Amazon and HBO Max, North Korean animators have also worked with firms such as the state-run animation studio in Pyongyang, SEK. This company is well-known for assisting with Western projects, including the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie. Additionally, Seoul’s intelligence agency reported last year that North Korean agents posing as recruiters used LinkedIn to target victims with job offers. To achieve this, they asked South Koreans who worked at defense firms for information on their technologies. Launched last October, the MSMT monitors and reports violations of UN Security Council sanctions on North Korea. However, it operates independently from the UN, with its members including: the UK, Canada, Italy, South Korea, the Netherlands, the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, and Germany.

53614758,613843,1761382807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53614758.jpeg,Ripple Launches ‘Prime Time’ After Hidden Road Acquisition: How This Could Boost RLUSD?,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-prime-time-after-hidden-road-acquisition/,"On Friday, Ripple Labs announced the launch of “Prime Time,” following its acquisition of Hidden Road. The company will now be rebranded as Ripple Prime. The company confirmed the completion of the acquisition, making Ripple Labs the first blockchain payment company to operate as a global, multi-asset prime broker. How Ripple Prime Is Expected To Enhance RLUSD’s Utility The acquisition was deemed a logical step, driven by the synergies between Ripple and Hidden Road, to facilitate the institutional adoption of digital assets which has been on the rise throughout the year in a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. Ripple’s digital asset infrastructure, which includes payment solutions, crypto custody, and stablecoin services , will increase the offerings within Ripple Prime. Looking ahead, Ripple Prime plans to harness blockchain technology to streamline operations and optimize costs. Notably, the launch of Ripple Prime is expected to significantly boost the utility and reach of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Currently, RLUSD is being utilized as collateral for various prime brokerage products, with certain derivatives clients opting to hold their balances in RLUSD, a trend anticipated to grow in the coming months. RLUSD’s regulatory compliance under the new stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, already signed by President Donald Trump, is said to have earned it the trust of institutions, providing further integration into traditional financial operations. In July, RLUSD was recognized as the top stablecoin for stability, governance, and asset backing by Bluechip, which awarded it an ‘A’ rating. Additionally, Ripple announced that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY) will serve as the primary reserve custodian for RLUSD. Five Major Acquisitions Over Two Years This acquisition is one of five major strategic purchases by the blockchain payment company in the past two years, including recent acquisitions of treasury management system provider GTreasury, stablecoin-based payment platform Rail, Standard Custody, and Metaco. In addition, the company is currently pursuing approval for its national bank charter license in the United States. It joins other firms, including, Circle (CRCL), Coinbase (COIN), Sony Bank, Paxos, and Crypto.com, which recently announced its intent to seek approval for this application with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). As of this writing, XRP has capitalized on these developments, surging toward $2.70 — a 3% intraday increase.

Related Reading: BNB Reclaims $1,100 As Binance Founder Receives Presidential Pardon – New Rally Coming? Pump.fun Acquires Padre On Friday, Solana’s leading launchpad, Pump.fun, announced it had acquired multichain trading terminal Padre for an undisclosed amount as part of its “mission to tokenize the world’s highest-potential opportunities.” The platform explained that trading terminals have “captured most trading volumes in the ecosystem” for the past year. Therefore, the acquisition of Padre, which supports trading across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Base, “was a no-brainer,” Pump.fun’s co-founder Alon Cohen affirmed. “Today marks another historic day for the PUMP ecosystem. What we’re known for is innovating, growing the market as a whole and creating the most retail-friendly products,” Cohen wrote on X. “But we have always wanted to find more ways to support and reward our existing, loyal user base, most of which uses pro trading terminals,” he continued, adding that “the Padre team has shown the most grit, execution capability and integrity out of any crypto team I have gotten to know.” According to the official announcement, Padre will function as usual, but users will experience significant upgrades in user experience, especially for tokens launched on Pump.fun. Additionally, the integration will improve data and speed, and offer better trading incentives. PUMP Breaks Out Of Bearish Structure Following the news, Pump.fun’s token, PUMP, became one of the best-performing tokens in the past 24 hours, jumping 11.6% to a one-week high of $0.0043. The cryptocurrency has been trading within the $0.0036-$0.0046 price range since the early October correction. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted that yesterday, PUMP was “in a bit of trouble” after retesting the range lows, needing to break out of a bearish structure to prevent a breakdown to lower levels. After today’s rally, PUMP “finally broke that structure,” suggesting that the range high should be the next target for the cryptocurrency’s price. A potential breakout from this range could set the stage for a retest of the $0.005 mark, a key support and resistance level during the Q3 rally that was lost during the October 10 pullback. PADRE Crash Drives Community Backlash Despite the PUMP rally, Pump.fun received some backlash after the acquisition. Padre’s users slammed the memecoin launchpad for one of the key changes listed in the announcement. According to the official X post, trading terminal’s token, PADRE, “will no longer have utility on the platform with no further plans for the future.” As a result, the cryptocurrency dropped 76% in an hour to a multi-month low of $0.009 before stabilizing at around $0.0139.

According to reports, the two suspects were arraigned and convicted in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York. The duo was convicted by a jury on all charges of an indictment charging them with conspiring and attempting to provide material relief to the terrorist organization . In addition, Hashimi and At Taqi were also charged with money laundering. DOJ convicts two for aiding ISIS According to the DOJ, Hashimi had already pleaded guilty to all the counts of indictment on October 6, the day the jury selection was scheduled to begin. The DOJ claimed that At Taqi sent Bitcoin in 15 separate transactions to a certain Osama Obeida, a self-proclaimed ISIS member, over the course of a year. In a conversation with a confidential source online, At Taqi claimed that he used digital assets to send money “unnoticed” through a “brother,” which typically meant another ISIS follower. In later conversations, At Taqi told the confidential source, through an encrypted communications platform, that the brother, who had been sending cryptocurrency, had gotten back in touch. In other conversations, the DOJ claims that he assured the confidential source that he was sure the brother was from Dawlah, referring to ISIS. The agency mentioned that the brother who was being used in this conversation was Obeida. In a later conversation, he introduced Obeida to the confidential source, vouching for him. After Obeida got in touch with the confidential source, he mentioned that he had known At Taqi for about two years, and in that time, he had been sending him money regularly. Obeida also sent the confidential source a photograph of an ISIS flag and weapons, showing the other party at the end of the line that the money Obeida got from the defendant was used to purchase weapons for ISIS fighters. He added a time stamp to the photograph to prove that it was taken in real time. Suspects used BTC, PayPal, and GoFundMe The other defendant, Hashimi, was part of a group chat for ISIS supporters on an encrypted platform. In April 2021, members of the group chat discussed posting links that would be used to raise funds for humanitarian efforts, but noted that the money would be diverted to help ISIS. The DOJ claimed a co-conspirator posted a Bitcoin address, and another posted a PayPal link, both of which were under the control of Obeida. In response, Hashimi warned the members of the group to be careful as they could be detected by law enforcement. According to the DOJ, Obeida was sent thousands of dollars, with the funds coming from their campaigns across platforms, including Bitcoin, PayPal, and GoFundMe. Aside from Obeida, other co-conspirators identified were Hashimi, At Taqi, a third defendant named Seema Rahman, and another one named Khalilullah Yousuf. The group contributed more than $24,000 to Obeida’s Bitcoin address, with Yousuf responsible for $20,347 of the entire funds. Others contributed between $2,000 and $900 to the wallet. The defendants also sent funds into the PayPal account operated by Obeida, creating several charitable campaigns on GoFundMe, where they raised $10,000 and sent the funds to individuals connected to Obeida using Western Union. At sentencing, each individual is expected to face a maximum penalty of 60 years in prison. Rahman had also pleaded guilty earlier this year to charges of providing material to support a terrorist organization and was awaiting sentencing. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Several altcoins have posted more impressive gains over the past days, including JUP, ZEC, CRO, BCH, and XRP. BTC Recovers All Losses The primary cryptocurrency experienced massive turbulence at the end of the previous business week when it dumped from $112,000 to under $104,000 in the span of just a day. However, it bounced off during the weekend and went on the offensive at the beginning of the new business week. The bulls initiated an impressive leg up on Tuesday that resulted in a $6,500 surge. It pushed BTC from $107,500 to a multi-day peak of $114,000. However, it turned out to be a fakeout, and bitcoin quickly lost all gains and dipped even further below $106,500. The following few days were more positive but less eventful as the markets awaited the Friday release of the US CPI numbers. BTC had calmed at around $111,000 and surged immediately with a grand after the inflation for September turned out to be lower than expected. However, its progress was quickly halted, and the bears drove it south by over two grand in the following hours to just under $110,000. Nevertheless, BTC has bounced off and now sits close to $112,000. Its market cap has risen to $2.230 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is at 58%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView CRO, XRP on the Rise Most larger-cap alts have failed to post any significant moves in the past 24 hours. ETH and BNB are slightly in the red, while SOL, ADA, DOGE, HYPE, LINK, and XLM have produced minor gains. More volatility comes from the likes of XRP, CRO, BCH, and ZEC, all of which have increased by somewhere between 3.5% and 5.3%. In contrast, TRX has dumped by over 5% and now sits inches below $0.30. The total crypto market cap has remained sideways since yesterday at around $3.850 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview Daily.

Currently trading at just $0.0022 in stage 13 of its presale, this token is gaining unstoppable momentum. Early investors have already poured in over $27.1 million, and now even a Ripple (XRP) millionaire believes Little Pepe could surge all the way to $3 in the coming bull run. With such predictions surfacing, many investors are rushing to secure their bags before the presale sells out completely. The World’s First Layer 2 for Meme Projects Unlike the countless meme coins that rely solely on hype, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) combines humor, community, and advanced blockchain innovation to redefine what a meme token can be. One of the biggest reasons behind the excitement is Little Pepe’s revolutionary approach to scalability. The project is building the world’s first dedicated Layer 2 blockchain for meme tokens, a first of its kind in the crypto space. Traditional meme tokens, such as Shiba Inu or Pepe, rely heavily on networks like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, which often struggle with congestion and high fees. Little Pepe’s Layer 2 aims to address these issues with lightning-fast speeds and minimal transaction costs, creating a blockchain environment specifically designed for the meme economy. This makes Little Pepe the first true meme network, as meme tokens, NFTs, and dApps can be launched faster than on any other chain. It is built as a Layer 2, which makes it interoperable with other major networks, all while keeping the ecosystem current with its meme nature. Certik Audit: Boosting Investor Confidence Security remains a top concern for investors, especially in an era of rug pulls and scam projects. Little Pepe has already passed a full security audit by Certik, one of the most respected blockchain security firms. This successful audit confirms that Little Pepe’s smart contracts are robust, transparent, and secure, providing investors with additional confidence to participate in the presale. The Certik stamp is often seen as a green flag for long-term credibility, a major reason why analysts and experienced traders are taking this project seriously. Fair Play Through Anti-Sniper Bot Technology Another major technical feature is the anti-sniper bot mechanism. Sniper bots pose a significant issue in crypto presales, as large investors use them to buy tokens at the start of the sale, effectively excluding smaller investors. Little Pepe's blockchain will eliminate the bots entirely. With the bots gone, no one will have the unfair advantage of buying the project during presales or launches anymore. Everyone will have the same opportunity to buy the project. The next stage in the evolution of the meme coin is the Little Pepe blockchain. With founding members knowledgeable in the industry, tokenomics, community building, and the mechanism behind meme coins, Little Pepe is an ideal candidate for future development and advancing beyond the current meme coin hype phase. Little Pepe has experience and markets with a unique strategy. Therefore, Little Pepe has already gone viral on social media and is poised to make a significant impact in the industry. How to Join the Presale Joining the Little Pepe presale is easy, safe, and fast, as all you need to do is download a crypto wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. You can buy ETH or USDT via the ERC-20 network method, then go to littlepepe.com to get started. You can connect your wallet and purchase Little Pepe tokens according to your requirements. After the presale ends, investors can claim their tokens from the same website. Conclusion Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is one of the most exciting presales in the cryptocurrency space, offering a low presale price of only $0.0022. It combines the best of meme coins with practical applications, new and breakthrough blockchain technology, and a Certik-certified package of investor protection. If this turns out to be the case, Little Pepe will go down as one of the most profitable meme coins of all time. For investors seeking the next 500x opportunity, Little Pepe is the frog that jumps the highest.

Little Pepe has addressed this by completing a rigorous security audit by Certik, a top blockchain security firm.

The fresh accumulation signals a potential shift in investors’ sentiment as Ether prices managed to surge marginally over the last 7 days after a heavy dump. The global digital assets market saw mixed indexes as Bitcoin hovered above $111K, cluelessly. The cumulative crypto market cap surged marginally to stand at $3.76 trillion. The biggest altcoin, Ether, tried to regain the $4,000 mark in order to score a breakthrough. Smart money reloads on Ethereum According to the data shared by Santiment, addresses holding between 100 and 10,000 ETH have begun accumulating again. This comes after these whales and sharks unloaded roughly 1.36 million ETH between October 5 and 16. Since then, they’ve bought back nearly one-sixth of those coins. It is seen as a modest but encouraging sign for Ethereum. 🐳🦈 Ethereum whales and sharks holding between 100 to 10,000 $ETH are finally showing some signs of confidence. After -1.36M was dumped by this group between October 5th and 16th, they have added back close to 1/6th of it since. Positive sign for crypto’s #2 market cap. pic.twitter.com/tg1BWu60Lq — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 24, 2025 Wallet data adds weight to the trend. A whale wallet “0x395” withdrew 12,000 ETH (approx. worth $46.3 million) from Binance on Oct 23 at an average price of $3,854 per coin. The whale now holds 67,981 ETH (approx. worth $264 million). Historical data shows that this same wallet added ETH at an average of $3,027 between June and mid-August. However, it then sold into strength between mid-September and early October at an average of $4,218. Another whale wallet “0x86E” bought 8,491 ETH (approx. worth $32.5 million) from OKX on October 23. This move contributed to the uptick in whale accumulation activity. Elsewhere on the network, blockchain sleuths tracked the RadiantCapital exploiter swapping 9.7 million DAI for 2,550 WETH. The swap was done at an average price of $3,803. The funds were funneled through Tornado Cash, which suggests an ongoing laundering effort. Ethereum price has dipped by more than 11% over the past 60 days, briefly testing support near $3,738. It is still running up by 18% on the year-to-date (YTD) basis. ETH is trading at an average price of $3,930 at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume stood around $29 billion. ETH ETFs see outflows Beyond whale moves, stablecoin activity on Ethereum has exploded. Token Terminal data shows a 400% jump in stablecoin transfer volume over the past 30 days. It is totaling $581 billion across more than 12.5 million transactions. The total stablecoin market cap on Ethereum now stands at $163 billion. It emerges as a sign of the network’s continued dominance in digital dollar settlements. Investor preference still remains in a split between Bitcoin and Ethereum in the ETF arena. On October 24, Ethereum spot ETFs recorded $93.6 million in net outflows while Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $90.6 million. This was the third straight day of redemptions for ETH ETFs. On October 23, Bitcoin funds ended the day with $20.3 million in net inflows. It was majorly driven by $107.8 million to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). It was then followed by smaller gains across Bitwise, Fidelity, and Grayscale’s mini trust. Outflows from GBTC of $60.5 million and Ark 21Shares’ ARKB’s $55 million nearly offset those gains but failed to drag the total into the red.

The report published by the bank stated that the Base token could be a new revenue stream for Coinbase and that the company would complement its on-chain trading strategies with USDC returns. The report noted that the Base network, built on Ethereum and launched in August 2023, has reached over $5 billion in assets locked (TVL) and over 9 million daily transactions. JPMorgan analysts stated that the Base token could “translate the network’s success into equity.” Related News: U.S. Inflation Data, Published Uninterrupted for 100 Years, May Not Be Released Next Month Given current network data and “high token economics,” JPMorgan estimated Coinbase's long-term market value at between $12 billion and $34 billion. It added that Coinbase could hold approximately 40% of the supply, which would translate to an equity value between $4 billion and $12 billion. Coinbase executives have also raised the possibility of a native token for Base in recent weeks. At the BaseCamp conference in Vermont, project leader Jesse Pollak said that issuing a token could accelerate the network's decentralization process and open up new opportunities for developers. CEO Brian Armstrong, speaking on X, said the idea was “in the exploratory phase” but that “there are no definitive plans yet.” *This is not investment advice.

That explosive growth, from pennies to a multitrillion-dollar universe, is still the gold standard for crypto success. Now, a new generation of tokens can take the same path. The leading cryptocurrencies that are on the rise are Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and a new DeFi newcomer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Each project has a value proposition, but Mutuum Finance is making waves with its new dual-lending economy and solid presale traction. At just $0.035 during Phase 6, with more than 75% sold out and $17.85 million raised so far, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming among the top cryptocurrencies this year, with analysts speculating that it might offer the type of explosive growth that Bitcoin experienced during its first few years. Investors looking for the best cryptos to buy now are keeping a close eye on MUTM, recognizing its early-stage potential. Cardano (ADA) at Its Moment of Truth as Bulls Run Out of Steam Cardano (ADA) is at a crossroads and the price is not even getting near $0.70 EMA, demonstrating losing power among buyers. The market confusion is becoming louder, if $0.59 is broken, ADA can drop suddenly into $0.50 or even $0.40, demonstrating weakness in what was deemed to be one of the strongest of the altcoins. On the flip side, a firm drop below $0.75 can reignite bullish fervor again and restore faith among the ADA soldiers. In the meantime, however, traders watch closely as Cardano teases hard support, and while some investors look for new frontiers, attention is directed towards budding DeFi upstart Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is building momentum going into the next cycle. For those asking what crypto to buy now, MUTM is appearing as a clear choice. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Outlook: Dominance Strengthens After Long-Term Breakout Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing new strength as its dominance remains strong, following the completion of a crucial multi-year market structure shift. Having endured a 3.5-year downtrend that began in 2021, DOGE finally broke above this declining channel in November 2024, suggesting a long-term reversal may be underway. The pivot was then reversed later in June 2025 and again with the wider crypto collapse on October 10, thus affirming the breakout as final. Having this technical background now established, DOGE can quite well be setting the stage for an extended phase of recovery in the subsequent bull cycle. As the market starts exploring new sources of growth, investors are also focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as its popularity surges as the next huge high-upside investment in 2025. MUTM is increasingly recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy now by early-stage enthusiasts. Mutuum Finance’s Growth Surpasses Expectations Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly turning out to be one of the best new cryptocurrencies to watch out for in 2025. Its presale is repeatedly attracting increasingly large investments from investors from all over the world, with more than 17,400 joining and investing a combined total of over $17.85 million so far. At Phase 6 at $0.035, an all-time historical low, MUTM is a good early bird investment buy before the token explodes to $0.04 in the next phase, and is a favorite crypto in 2025. The ongoing phase has seen huge buy activity which has pushed it past the 75% mark in no time. Investors believe in the long-term success of the project ranking MUTM among the top cryptocurrencies to buy now. There’s immense potential for passive income earners via Mutuum Finance. Clients can gain APY based on market demand by investing their assets in the platform liquidity pool. For example, an investor who invests $55,000 USDT in the platform can gain $5,500 a year at a 10% APY, just by letting their assets do the work for them. The rise of bitcoin from cents to more than $125,000 is a prime example of early adopter advantages. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating the same velocity with $17.85 million raised by 17,400 investors so far. With Phase 6 at $0.035 and more than 75% sold through. Go to the official Mutuum Finance website and get into position before the next phase starts to secure one of the best cryptos to buy now and join the new cryptocurrency wave.

The analyst emphasized that ETH ETFs are now experiencing significant inflows, and major banks are accepting ETH as collateral for loans. Friedman said Ethereum’s role in real-world finance has continued to strengthen, thanks to the surge in Layer 2 (L2) expansions, the growth of stablecoins, and tokenization. He added that these trends could set the stage for skyrocketing ETH prices into 2026, with supply remaining deflationary and yields from staking encouraging long-term holding. Cryptopolitan reported earlier this month that ETH is rapidly attracting institutional investments. Major minting events, such as the recent $2 billion USDT minted on Ethereum, typically precede price movements as retail and institutional investors inject new liquidity. Friedman says fringe digital assets are becoming mainstream The analyst believes that ETH is rising because cryptocurrencies, once viewed as fringe assets, are now becoming more mainstream. He also stressed that crypto, which was driven by retail investor, is now benefiting from steadily increasing institutional interest. Cyprien Grau, lead at zkEVM rollup Status Network, previously said ETH’s institutional adoption is a net positive because it carries the cryptocurrency’s value out of the crypto-native bubble and into the real-world economy. He explained that what institutions want aligns with Ethereum’s endgame, which includes credible neutrality, faster settlements, privacy, lower fees, decentralization, and scale. “They do not want to settle on each other’s private ledgers. They want a credibly neutral ground where everyone can transact under the same rules. Trying to steer core protocol governance would put those properties at risk, so the dominant strategy is cooperation, not capture.” – Cyprien Grau , head at the Status Network Crypto analyst and YouTuber Wendy O also contributed her opinion, saying that the most positive aspect of ETH is that spot and future ETFs have been approved. However, she pointed out that this did not seem to move Ethereum as the market had expected, as sentiment remained down. Brian Huang, the co-founder of Glider, also claimed that the crypto investor mindset has taken a hit lately, especially after many speculators suffered losses due to the closure of leverage positions on October 10. Wendy O believes that crypto has been in a “crab market” since the crypto liquidation occurred. However, SoSoValue data show that U.S. spot Ethereum ETPs (exchange-traded products) have notably increased in value since their debut last year. The data further reveal that ETH ETFs have doubled in value since the beginning of this year, reaching over $26.5 billion, primarily due to growing interest from institutional investors. Tychey says Ethereum is the biggest economic playground Jerome de Tychey, president of Ethereum France and CEO of Cometh, claims Ethereum is the biggest economic playground, and investors should not be worried when institutions join the fun. He also believes that Ethereum has been consistent on the neutral transport narrative, and institutions not choosing ETH directly are only delaying the inevitable. The Ethereum France President emphasized that such institutions will eventually pick on ETH due to the network’s censorship resistance and radical neutrality. The co-founder and Ceo of SSV Labs, Alon Muroch, also says fears that institutions could pose a threat to Ethereum are unfounded. He pointed out that even the largest consortia would be unable to influence ETH’s future because they would pose no threat to either Ethereum or its decentralization. Murdoch added that big-name L2s, such as Robinhood, will still be built and settled on the Ethereum network, which is ultimately beneficial for the ecosystem. Strategic ETH Reserve data shows that the total amount of ETH held on corporate balance sheets exceeds 5.9 million. Tom Lee-backed BitMine Immersion leads with over 3 million ETH in its stockpile, while Sharplink, chaired by Joseph Lubin, is second with more than 840,000 ETH. Meanwhile, staking on the Ethereum network keeps hitting ATHs with over 35.7 million ETH (~$138B) currently locked in staking contracts. However, another analyst at Seal 911 Pcaversaccio believes institutional adoption is Ethereum’s biggest threat. The analyst warns that TradiFi could tame the network’s open, cypherpunk spirit. Meanwhile, Grau believes institutions should build on L2s if they want more control and customization. He explains that L2s retain EVM composability and tooling, inherit Ethereum’s liquidity and security, and allow institutions to design their policy and execution rules.

Then you’ve likely heard of Jupiter (JUP), a pivotal aggregation layer that has quickly become a cornerstone of the ecosystem. Investors and enthusiasts alike are constantly asking: What does the future hold for this promising asset? Our comprehensive Jupiter price prediction aims to answer that burning question, exploring whether the JUP price can truly reach the ambitious $2 mark in the coming years. What is Jupiter (JUP) and Why Does This Jupiter Crypto Matter? Jupiter is more than just another token; it’s a critical infrastructure project on the Solana blockchain. At its core, Jupiter functions as a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, designed to provide users with the best possible swap rates by scanning multiple DEXs across Solana. This means when you want to trade tokens, Jupiter finds the optimal path, minimizing slippage and maximizing efficiency. This utility is not just convenient; it’s essential for a healthy and liquid DeFi ecosystem. Beyond swaps, Jupiter offers a suite of advanced features: Limit Orders: Allowing users to set specific prices for their trades. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Enabling automated, recurring investments over time. Perpetual Swaps: Offering leveraged trading opportunities for advanced users. Bridge Aggregation: Facilitating seamless asset transfers between different blockchains. The JUP token itself serves as the governance token for the Jupiter DAO, empowering holders to participate in key decisions regarding the platform’s future development, fee structures, and treasury management. This strong community involvement is a significant factor in the long-term viability and growth of the Jupiter crypto ecosystem. Understanding Jupiter’s Market Dynamics: Key Factors Influencing JUP Price Predicting cryptocurrency prices is inherently complex, and JUP is no exception. Several factors constantly interact to influence its market value. A thorough crypto price prediction for Jupiter requires looking at both internal and external forces. Fundamental Factors: Solana Ecosystem Growth: As Jupiter is built on Solana, the health and expansion of the Solana network directly impact JUP. More users, developers, and projects on Solana mean more potential activity on Jupiter. Platform Utility and Innovation: Jupiter’s continuous development of new features (like its recent launch of a launchpad for new Solana projects) enhances its value proposition and attracts more users, driving demand for the JUP token. Trading Volume and Liquidity: Higher trading volumes on Jupiter’s aggregated DEXs translate to more fees generated (some of which can be used for buybacks or staking rewards), benefiting JUP holders. Community Governance: An active and engaged DAO can lead to effective decision-making, improving the platform’s resilience and adaptability. Technical Factors: Technical analysis involves studying past price movements and trading volumes to predict future trends. Key indicators for JUP include: Support and Resistance Levels: Identifying price points where JUP has historically found buying interest (support) or selling pressure (resistance). Moving Averages: These smooth out price data to identify trend direction. A JUP price above key moving averages often signals bullish sentiment. Relative Strength Index (RSI): This momentum oscillator indicates whether JUP is overbought or oversold, potentially signaling a reversal. Volume Trends: High trading volume accompanying price movements adds conviction to the trend. Broader Market Sentiment: The overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, often driven by Bitcoin’s performance, regulatory news, and macroeconomic conditions, plays a significant role. A bull market tends to lift most altcoins, including JUP, while a bear market can suppress prices across the board. Jupiter Price Prediction 2025: Navigating the Next Bull Cycle As we look towards 2025, many analysts anticipate a potential resurgence in the broader crypto market, often referred to as a bull cycle. This optimism stems from several factors, including the upcoming Bitcoin halving events and increasing institutional adoption. For Jupiter, 2025 could be a pivotal year. Our Jupiter price prediction for 2025 is largely contingent on Jupiter’s continued dominance as a liquidity aggregator on Solana and the overall growth of the Solana ecosystem. If Solana maintains its position as a high-performance blockchain attracting new projects and users, Jupiter stands to benefit immensely. Increased transaction volumes and DeFi activity directly translate to higher utility for Jupiter’s services. Considering a bullish market scenario, with sustained development and strategic partnerships, we could see JUP’s value appreciate significantly. Potential price targets for 2025 might range: Minimum Price: Around $0.80 – $1.00, assuming a more conservative growth trajectory or minor market corrections. Average Price: Between $1.20 – $1.50, reflecting steady adoption and a moderately bullish market. Maximum Price: Potentially reaching $1.80 – $2.20, especially if a strong bull run materializes and Jupiter introduces groundbreaking new features or achieves significant market share expansion. The $2 mark becomes a tangible possibility under these optimal conditions. The platform’s ability to innovate and stay ahead of competitors will be crucial. If Jupiter successfully launches and integrates new features that attract even more users, its market position will strengthen, directly impacting its token’s value. JUP Price Target 2026: Sustaining Growth or Facing Headwinds? Moving into 2026, the market landscape might shift, presenting both opportunities and challenges for the JUP price . After a potential bull run in 2025, 2026 could see a period of consolidation or even a slight pullback, which is typical in crypto market cycles. However, the underlying fundamentals of Jupiter will play an even greater role in sustaining its value. For a strong JUP price target in 2026, Jupiter needs to demonstrate long-term resilience and continued relevance. This means: Continued Innovation: Jupiter must keep developing its product suite to maintain its competitive edge. Ecosystem Integration: Deeper integration with new and existing Solana projects will solidify its position. Community Engagement: An active and supportive DAO is vital for decentralized governance and continuous improvement. Assuming Jupiter continues its trajectory of innovation and adoption, even during a potential market cooldown, its value should remain robust. Our projections for 2026 are: Minimum Price: $1.00 – $1.30, accounting for potential market corrections after a 2025 peak. Average Price: $1.40 – $1.70, reflecting a stable and growing user base. Maximum Price: $2.00 – $2.50, if Jupiter solidifies its market dominance and the overall crypto market experiences a prolonged period of stability or renewed growth after consolidation. The ability of Jupiter to navigate regulatory changes and competitive pressures will be key to hitting these higher targets. Long-Term Jupiter Crypto Forecast 2027-2030: Is a $2 JUP Price Achievable? Forecasting several years into the future for any cryptocurrency is highly speculative, but we can analyze potential scenarios for the Jupiter crypto . The period from 2027 to 2030 will likely be characterized by further maturation of the crypto industry, increased institutional participation, and potentially clearer regulatory frameworks. For Jupiter to not only survive but thrive, it must continue to be an indispensable part of the Solana DeFi ecosystem. Its long-term value will depend on: Scalability and Performance: Solana’s ability to scale further will directly benefit Jupiter’s capacity. Cross-Chain Capabilities: As the crypto world becomes increasingly multi-chain, Jupiter’s ability to aggregate liquidity across different networks could be a massive growth driver. Real-World Utility: If DeFi integrates more with traditional finance or real-world assets, Jupiter’s role as an efficient exchange aggregator could expand significantly. Considering these factors, and assuming Jupiter maintains its innovation and market relevance, the long-term outlook appears positive. The $2 mark, which might seem ambitious in the short term, becomes increasingly achievable and even sustainable in this timeframe. Here’s a potential long-term crypto price prediction range for JUP: Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2027 $1.50 $2.00 $2.80 2028 $1.80 $2.50 $3.50 2029 $2.20 $3.00 $4.50 2030 $2.80 $3.80 $6.00+ These projections are based on strong market growth, continued development by Jupiter, and increased adoption of Solana DeFi. Achieving the higher end of these ranges would depend on Jupiter becoming a dominant force in the broader DeFi landscape, potentially beyond just Solana. Challenges and Opportunities for Jupiter’s Future Growth No project is without its hurdles, and Jupiter faces a few that could impact its Jupiter price prediction . Challenges: Competition: The DEX aggregator space is competitive, with other platforms constantly vying for market share. Jupiter must continue to innovate to stay ahead. Solana Network Issues: While Solana has made strides in stability, any significant network outages or performance issues could negatively impact user trust and, by extension, Jupiter’s activity. Regulatory Scrutiny: The broader DeFi space faces increasing regulatory attention. Unfavorable regulations could impact Jupiter’s operations and user base. Tokenomics and Inflation: While JUP’s tokenomics include a governance model, careful management of token supply and distribution will be essential to prevent excessive inflation. Opportunities: Expanding Ecosystem: Solana’s rapid growth presents a vast opportunity for Jupiter to integrate with new projects and capture more liquidity. New Product Development: Continuing to build out its suite of DeFi tools, such as advanced trading options or new launchpad initiatives, can attract new user segments. Cross-Chain Expansion: While currently focused on Solana, future expansion into other blockchain ecosystems could dramatically increase Jupiter’s total addressable market. Institutional Adoption: As institutions become more comfortable with DeFi, Jupiter’s robust infrastructure could attract significant institutional liquidity. Actionable Insights for Potential JUP Investors For those considering an investment in JUP, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always thoroughly research Jupiter’s technology, team, and roadmap before investing. Understand the risks involved in cryptocurrency investments. Monitor Solana’s Health: Since Jupiter is deeply intertwined with Solana, keep a close eye on Solana’s network performance, development, and overall ecosystem growth. Track Jupiter’s Development: Follow Jupiter’s official announcements, community forums, and social media channels to stay informed about new features, partnerships, and governance proposals. Understand Market Cycles: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. Consider a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy to mitigate risk rather than trying to time the market. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio and do not put all your funds into a single asset. A smart investment strategy involves continuous learning and adaptation to market changes. The potential for the JUP price to reach significant milestones is there, but it comes with inherent risks. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Jupiter (JUP) Jupiter stands as a powerful and indispensable component of the Solana DeFi landscape. Our in-depth Jupiter price prediction for 2025, 2026, and up to 2030 suggests a compelling growth trajectory, with the ambitious $2 JUP price target appearing increasingly achievable under favorable market conditions and sustained platform development. Its robust aggregation services, innovative features, and strong community governance position it well for future success. While the path to these price levels will undoubtedly be marked by market volatility and competitive challenges, Jupiter’s fundamental utility and ongoing innovation provide a strong foundation. As the broader crypto price prediction for the market remains optimistic for the coming years, Jupiter’s role in facilitating efficient, secure, and user-friendly decentralized trading on Solana is likely to become even more critical. Investors should remain informed and consider the long-term potential alongside short-term fluctuations.

Specifically, whales collectively sold around 70 million XRP, worth approximately $178 million, over the past 48 hours, according to on-chain data from Santiment shared by Ali Martinez in an X post on October 25. XRP whale transaction chart. Source: Santiment The sell-off, led by wallets holding between 100,000 and 10 million XRP, comes as the token trades at $2.54, clinging to fragile support amid market uncertainty. Historically, such whale liquidations have preceded short-term declines, and if selling persists, XRP could retest the key $2.00 support zone. Meanwhile, technical indicators suggest that while a short-term correction remains possible, the long-term outlook for XRP looks promising. XRP’s imminent breakout In this regard, analysis shared by ChartNerd in an October 25 X post indicated that XRP has been consolidating within a vertical accumulation range since January 2025, with technical signals pointing to a potentially major breakout. https://twitter.com/ChartNerdTA/status/1981990650548568083 According to the market structure, XRP has been trading between accumulation support and resistance zones, forming a prolonged sideways pattern that often precedes sharp directional moves. The analyst noted that clearing resistance around the $2.60 range could trigger a breakout targeting the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, projecting potential upside toward $5 to $6. The weekly 55-day exponential moving average (EMA) continues to serve as a crucial support level, helping maintain XRP’s bullish structure. Beyond market sentiment, XRP’s trajectory will likely depend on broader fundamental factors, such as anticipation surrounding the possible approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). The approval was initially expected in late October but has reportedly been delayed due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. At the same time, Ripple’s plan to raise $1 billion to establish an XRP treasury is viewed as another key bullish signal to watch. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.54, up over 3% in the past 24 hours, showing minimal impact from whale activity. Over the past week, the asset has rallied by nearly 8%.

In a recent post on X, he said he went down the “rabbit hole of XRP” and decided to invest a “significant portion” of over $25,000 into the asset. I’ve spent the last 24hrs going down the rabbit hole of $XRP . I have decided to invest a SIGNIFICANT portion into XRP. ($25..+) I believe it could revolutionize the banking systems. It’s a gamble, as all investments are. Whether you are Team XRP or not. I want everyone to… — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) October 25, 2025 Wynn said the potential for Ripple and its native token is substantial as it could “revolutionize the banking systems.” However, the meme coin trader admitted that XRP still remains a gamble, just like all other investments. His backing comes in a rather peculiar timing as the company behind the asset just announced that it has renamed Hidden Road – the prime broker it acquired earlier this year for $1.25 billion – to Ripple Prime. This means that Ripple is now the first and only crypto company to “own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker – bringing the promise of digital assets to institutional customers at scale.” Wynn also asked the community to outline the pros and cons of investing in Ripple’s cross-border token. The XRP Army, which is among the most vocal parts of the crypto community, was quick to highlight some pros, such as Ripple being the 2nd oldest chain in the Top 10 and its fast and cheap layer 1 network. Others were a bit more skeptical. One user asked how much Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, paid Wynn for this post on Friday. In a separate post, Wynn said he is done with meme coins and perpetual trading after “completing” both ventures and will now focus on building in the crypto industry. However, it doesn’t become clear if his new plans are somehow connected to Ripple.

The protocol’s presale has raised $17,850,000 since inception, drawing 17,400 holders who eye its lending mechanics. Phase 6, now 75% filled at $0.035 per token, has climbed 250% from Phase 1’s $0.01 entry. This surge underscores why experts flag MUTM among the best cryptos to buy now, especially with V1 launching on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Over the next decade, adoption in dual lending could propel values, mirroring resilient altcoins that weathered volatility. Yet urgency mounts: Phase 6 sells out fast, vanishing the $0.035 grab before Phase 7 hikes 14.3% to $0.04. Launch at $0.06 promises 425% ROI for current buyers, tying into broader crypto news today on sustainable yields. Presale Surge Fuels Investor Drive Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has accelerated its presale, blending transparency with incentives that hook early backers. Phase 6 allocation nears exhaustion, pressuring participants to secure tokens before the inevitable jump. Holders now top 17,400, a figure that reflects calculated bets on DeFi’s rebound. The team recently unveiled a dashboard spotlighting the top 50 holders, sharpening community rivalry. A 24-hour leaderboard update adds daily thrill: the peak depositor claims $500 in MUTM, contingent on one transaction in that span. It resets at 00:00 UTC, spurring consistent action. Leading buys from the last cycle hit $8,601.92, $7,000.00, $500.00, and $256.83, showcasing diverse stakes. Moreover, a $100,000 giveaway distributes $10,000 in MUTM to each of 10 winners. Entry demands a wallet submission, quest completion, and $50 presale minimum—simple steps that amplify engagement. Such moves have positioned MUTM as the best crypto to invest in, per ongoing crypto news. Dual Lending Unlocks Passive Gains Borrowers and lenders alike have tested Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s framework, revealing yields that outpace traditional savings. Users deposit ETH into peer-to-contract pools, earning APYs around 8-12% as demand fluctuates. One holder supplied $5,000 in USDT last week, pulling 9.5% yield over seven days without liquidation risks. Peer-to-peer lanes handle niche assets, like borrowing $3,000 against rare tokens at 75% loan-to-value, fostering direct deals. MtTokens accrue interest, redeemable for principal plus gains, turning idle crypto into steady income. The platform launches with the token per roadmap, eyeing top-tier exchange listings that could spike liquidity. These features cement MUTM’s role in the best cryptocurrency to invest today, blending utility with growth. Transitions to Layer-2 scaling will slash fees, inviting broader participation over years. Such rigor has drawn institutional eyes, aligning with DeFi’s maturing standards. Meanwhile, an over-collateralized stablecoin anchors operations, pegged 1:1 to the dollar via lending reserves. Borrowers mint it against ETH, repaying to burn supply, stabilizing trades amid swings. Investors thus view MUTM as a top cryptocurrency, its safeguards paving a decade of reliability. Fresh audits and bounties underscore why it ranks among altcoins primed for endurance. Long-Term Price Outlook Merges Resilience and Surge Analysts have projected Mutuum Finance (MUTM) trajectories, rooting estimates in adoption metrics and fee redistribution. By 2035, dual markets could capture 5% of DeFi volume, driving token demand through buybacks for stakers. Logic hinges on oracle-backed pricing via Chainlink, minimizing errors that plague rivals. Picture AVAX in 2020-2021: it dipped to $2.80 lows amid bearish sentiment, then rocketed to $144.96 peaks over 14 months, delivering 5,175% ROI as subnet scaling ignited ecosystems. MUTM echoes this path, starting from $0.035 presale depths, but with lending yields that AVAX lacked, potentially amplifying gains. Expect MUTM to hit $11.20 by 2030 via listings and stablecoin uptake, then $25.50 by 2035 as multi-chain expands, yielding 15,614% from now. This outstrips AVAX’s run, given MUTM’s passive income edge over mere infrastructure. Yet AVAX’s volatility exposed gaps; MUTM’s P2P flexibility dodges those, ensuring steadier climbs. As the best crypto to buy, it promises compounded returns for patient holders. Projections for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) intertwine with its core yields, recapping why it endures as a top crypto. Over 10 years, listings and scaling will elevate values, rewarding early moves like Phase 6 entries. Secure your stake now—join the presale before prices ascend further.

An analyst now projects a strong rebound that could drive the token back toward a crucial daily exponential moving average (EMA), signaling potential recovery after recent consolidation. Shiba Inu Maintains Key Support Amid Market Uncertainty Shiba Inu has been fluctuating between $0.000010 and $0.0000099, reflecting the broader market’s indecision. This mirrors the trend seen in Bitcoin and other major altcoins. Despite the stagnant price action, the asset maintains a vital support level, which analysts view as the foundation for a possible upward move. According to market analyst SwallowAcademy, SHIB’s ability to hold this critical demand zone indicates potential strength. The analyst noted that the recent dip formed a visible gap that prices could soon fill. A chart shared by SwallowAcademy highlighted that SHIB dropped below the former support range between $0.00001145 and $0.00001264. This green-marked zone had provided consistent support throughout the token’s multi-month consolidation. Shiba Inu and the 200-day EMA, Source: TradingView Now, with Shiba Inu trading near $0.000010, analysts believe it could bounce back toward that area, which has become resistance. SwallowAcademy previously identified the 200-day EMA as a persistent resistance barrier for SHIB. Since May, this indicator has rejected upward momentum on multiple occasions, halting rallies before they could extend. 200-Day EMA Holds the Key to Next Price Direction Historical price data shows that the 200-day EMA has repeatedly capped bullish runs. Shiba Inu faced rejection near this level during price peaks at $0.00001765 in May, $0.00001597 in July, and $0.00001484 in September. Each of these rejections occurred close to the EMA, reinforcing its role as a decisive technical level. SwallowAcademy emphasized that a retest of this resistance would not only fill previous market gaps but also define SHIB’s next trajectory. If the token manages to break above the EMA, it could trigger a significant bullish shift. However, another rejection might extend the current consolidation phase. At the time of writing, the 200-day EMA trends around $0.00001299. A move from the current price of $0.000010 toward this level represents an estimated 30% price increase. Adding to the optimistic outlook, ForexDreamVantage echoed similar sentiments, suggesting that Shiba Inu “is still alive.” The analyst argued that holding the present support could open the door for a rebound toward the “trend reversal zone” near $0.00001765. Reclaiming this area would likely transform market sentiment from bearish to bullish, potentially setting the stage for a broader rally.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-25 11:16:18
53618507,https://cryptonews.com/?p=443367,1761391074,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53618507.jpeg,XRP Price Prediction: Why Softer U.S. Inflation Data Could Accelerate Run to $2.80,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-why-softer-u-s-inflation-data-could-accelerate-run-to-2-80/,"XRP extended its rally above $2.55 in early Asian trading, gaining 4.3% in 24 hours as softer U.S. inflation data boosted investor confidence. With markets now betting on a Federal Reserve rate cut later this month, XRP’s bullish momentum is building. The token trades near $2.54, supported by strong volume and growing optimism that a breakout toward $2.80 may be on the horizon. Softer Inflation Boosts Rate Cut Expectations The latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed prices rose 0.3% in September, below expectations of 0.4%, while annual inflation eased to 3.0%. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, increased just 0.2%, another sign of cooling price pressure. US CPI YoY% breakdown from ECAN: pic.twitter.com/jUU5w90j90 — Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) October 24, 2025 This softer data strengthened market expectations for a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut later this month. Lower borrowing costs typically weaken the dollar and redirect capital toward higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. As traders anticipate a more accommodative monetary stance, XRP and other altcoins have gained fresh tailwinds, extending their short-term recovery. Mixed U.S. Data Keeps Markets Cautious Recent U.S. economic indicators presented a mixed picture. The S&P Global Flash PMI rose to 54.8 in October, the strongest private-sector expansion in three months, signaling resilience in business activity. However, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index slipped from 55.1 to 53.6, highlighting growing household uncertainty amid persistent inflation concerns. This combination, stronger business output but weaker consumer mood, reinforces the view that the Fed may soon pivot toward easing to support economic stability. For crypto traders, that prospect has revived interest in speculative assets like XRP, which often benefits from looser monetary policy and risk-on sentiment. Weaker Dollar Outlook and XRP’s Path to $2.80 A softer inflation outlook has pressured the U.S. dollar, encouraging traders to reallocate capital into crypto markets. As expectations of a slower tightening cycle grow, Bitcoin and XRP have both attracted renewed institutional and retail interest. For XRP specifically, sustained momentum above $2.55 could pave the way for a test of $2.80, a key resistance level that previously capped rallies in September. A successful breakout above that threshold would shift near-term sentiment firmly bullish. However, ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ripple’s SEC case may still temper aggressive upside in the short run. XRP Price Prediction – Bears Eye $2.02 as Descending Triangle Tightens On the daily chart, XRP trades within a descending triangle pattern, a formation that often signals potential downside if support gives way. The price faces stiff resistance near $2.70 – $2.72, where both the 50-day EMA and upper trendline converge. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A failure to close above this zone could trigger another correction toward $2.26, with deeper support near $2.02 and $1.77, levels where buying previously re-emerged. A confirmed breakdown below $2.26 would validate the bearish setup and potentially accelerate losses toward the $1.95 – $2.00 zone. Short-term traders may look for rejection candles or a bearish engulfing pattern around $2.70 for short entries, targeting $2.26 initially. Conversely, only a daily close above $2.72 would negate the bearish bias and signal a potential trend reversal toward $2.84 – $3.15. Outlook – Consolidation Before the Next Move Despite short-term volatility, XRP’s broader outlook remains constructive. Softer inflation, potential rate cuts, and rising institutional engagement continue to provide fundamental support for crypto assets. If buyers reclaim $2.70 – $2.72, XRP could extend its recovery toward $2.80 and even $3.00. But until that breakout materializes, traders should expect consolidation within the $2.25 – $2.70 range. In short, XRP’s technical setup shows a market at a crossroads – steady macro tailwinds point higher, but chart resistance remains the final gate to the next leg of its rally.

Francois Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, told lawmakers that capping the budget shortfall at that level is the only way to stay on track toward a 3% deficit target by 2029. “It is absolutely necessary to get within 3% between now and 2029 and this means a maximum deficit of 4.8% next year to cover a quarter of the path,” Villeroy said in an interview with La Croix, warning that anything more risks pushing France into “gradual suffocation.” The National Assembly is still grinding through the 2026 draft budget. It currently sets a deficit of 4.7%. But Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu, whose survival depends on opposition support, has publicly floated flexibility. He says the real aim is to stay “within 5%,” if that’s what it takes to avoid another political bloodbath. “It is no longer possible to govern by the discipline of one camp alone,” Lecornu told lawmakers, “but by the cultivation of a rigorous debate between lawmakers who start with different beliefs.” Credit outlook slashed as Macron’s pension freeze fuels backlash Moody’s Ratings didn’t waste time reacting. The agency slashed France’s credit outlook from stable to negative, citing political gridlock and legislative chaos. “The decision to change the outlook to negative reflects the increased risk that the fragmentation of the country’s political landscape will continue to impair the functioning of France’s legislative institutions,” it said Friday. France still holds a Aa3 rating, seven levels above junk, on par with the UK and Czech Republic. But that gap is shrinking fast. This downgrade followed earlier hits from S&P, Fitch, and DBRS, as investors began questioning how long France could delay difficult decisions. One of those delays?President Emmanuel Macron’s pension reform, which would have raised the retirement age from 62 to 64. Lecornu suspended it under pressure from left-leaning opposition lawmakers. But Moody’s warned that leaving the reform on ice for too long would damage growth and worsen long-term budget risks. Even that hasn’t calmed tensions. The Socialists, who Lecornu needs to keep his job, are threatening no-confidence votes unless the budget includes fewer cuts and new taxes on rich households and big corporations. Lecornu is trying to keep them at bay without triggering another collapse. He also backed off using Article 49.3, a constitutional tool that allows governments to bypass votes, saying this battle would have to be fought “the hard way,” through direct negotiation. Market pressure builds as spread with Germany widens The government’s proposed draft trims the deficit from 5.4% in 2025 to 4.7% in 2026, but there’s no guarantee it survives the Assembly floor intact. Lecornu has said lawmakers are free to adjust it, so long as the number stays below 5% and doesn’t derail the longer-term 3% goal. Finance Minister Roland Lescure responded to Moody’s cut by insisting France remains committed to a “ambitious” deficit reduction. But he admitted the outlook downgrade shows there’s an “absolute necessity” for a budget deal. Moody’s was clear about what happens if the stalemate continues: “If persistent, the inability to pass legislation that effectively addresses such policy challenges would mark a weakening of the country’s institutions.” That warning hit the market immediately. French asset sell-offs have picked up steam since Macron’s June 2024 snap elections, which left the National Assembly in deadlock. The yield spread between 10-year French and German bonds, a key market risk gauge, hit 89 basis points, nearly double what it was before the election. On Friday, it settled at 81, still the highest in 11 days. Then came S&P’s unscheduled downgrade, wiping out France’s average double‑A rating across all major credit agencies. That triggered forced selling among investment funds with tight rating criteria. Others scrambled to rewrite their investment rules just to keep holding French bonds.

This initiative also comes with preparations for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), setting a dual path for digital financial innovation. What Makes Kyrgyzstan’s National Stablecoin So Significant? The introduction of the Kyrgyzstan national stablecoin is more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a strategic national decision. This stablecoin, built on the robust BNB Chain, aims to bring stability and efficiency to the country’s financial infrastructure. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, a stablecoin is designed to maintain a pegged value, often to a fiat currency like the US dollar, making it ideal for everyday transactions and government use. Here’s why this development is drawing global attention: Stability : Pegged to a national fiat currency, it offers predictable value. Efficiency : Transactions on a blockchain like BNB Chain are typically faster and cheaper than traditional banking methods. Transparency : Blockchain technology provides an immutable and transparent ledger for all transactions. Accessibility : It can potentially reach a wider population, including those underserved by traditional banking. Moreover, the inclusion of BNB in Kyrgyzstan’s national cryptocurrency reserve assets highlights a deep commitment to the broader blockchain ecosystem, not just the stablecoin itself. This integration suggests a forward-thinking approach to managing national digital wealth. How Will the Kyrgyzstan National Stablecoin Transform Public Services? One of the primary goals for the Kyrgyzstan national stablecoin is its application within the public sector. Imagine a world where government payments are instant, secure, and transparent. This is the vision Kyrgyzstan is working towards. The stablecoin is expected to streamline various governmental functions, including: Government Payments : Efficient disbursement of salaries, pensions, and social benefits. Tax Collection : Simplified and transparent collection of taxes. Public Procurement : Enhanced accountability and reduced fraud in government tenders. Cross-Border Transactions : Facilitating international payments with greater ease and lower costs. This digital infrastructure could significantly reduce bureaucratic hurdles and enhance the overall efficiency of public administration. The move towards a CBDC further complements this, suggesting a comprehensive national strategy for digital finance. Binance’s Pivotal Role in Kyrgyzstan’s Digital Future The involvement of Binance , even through its former CEO Changpeng Zhao ‘s announcement, underscores the collaborative effort behind this initiative. Binance is not just a technology provider; it’s actively investing in building a robust local ecosystem in Kyrgyzstan . This commitment extends beyond the technical implementation of the stablecoin, focusing on long-term sustainability and growth. Key aspects of Binance’s ecosystem expansion include: Law Enforcement Training : Educating local agencies on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency forensics to ensure security and compliance. Blockchain Education : Partnering with 10 major universities to foster a new generation of blockchain experts and innovators. This collaboration is crucial for developing local talent and driving future technological advancements within the country. These initiatives are vital for ensuring that the adoption of the Kyrgyzstan national stablecoin is supported by a well-informed public and a secure regulatory environment. It’s a holistic approach to integrating digital assets into the national fabric. What Are the Broader Implications of This Bold Move? Kyrgyzstan’s decision to embrace a Kyrgyzstan national stablecoin on BNB Chain, alongside CBDC preparations, sends a powerful signal to the global financial community. It positions the country as a pioneer in digital currency adoption, potentially attracting further investment and innovation. This bold step could inspire other nations, especially those in emerging markets, to explore similar pathways for modernizing their financial systems. While the benefits are substantial, challenges such as regulatory frameworks, cybersecurity, and public adoption will need careful navigation. However, the proactive steps taken by Kyrgyzstan, supported by entities like Binance, demonstrate a strong commitment to overcoming these hurdles and reaping the rewards of digital transformation. In conclusion, Kyrgyzstan’s launch of a national stablecoin on BNB Chain is a truly transformative event. From streamlining government payments to fostering blockchain education and integrating BNB into national reserves, this initiative represents a forward-looking strategy for digital finance. It highlights a nation’s commitment to innovation, efficiency, and a digitally empowered future, setting a remarkable precedent for the global adoption of blockchain technology.

As ADA’s price stabilizes and future growth seems more incremental in nature, the focus is now on new crypto ventures with more potential and genuine innovation. Caught in the middle of this shift is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fresh DeFi platform in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035 per token. The phase is just days to closure with less than 25% of its allocated tokens remaining to be sold. Over $17.85 million has been raised and over 17,400 investors have signed up. For ADA billionaires seeking to diversify into high-potential early-stage projects before prices go through the roof, Mutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the shiniest new cryptos to buy in 2025. Traders who are asking what crypto to buy now are closely watching MUTM. Cardano (ADA) Experiences Massive Bullish Turnaround as Market Power Grows Cardano (ADA) is on the cusp of a trend turn in favor of a bullish trend after a protracted multi-year consolidation, since price activity is beginning to demonstrate newfound vigor. Support level of $0.64, which was a key area that previously had served as resistance, has become supportive now, lending support to ADA’s breakout potential. If momentum keeps accelerating, analysts view $2.32 as the first level of interest, to be followed by $5.43 and $7.00 as key resistance levels that will start coming into play in the next bull cycle. Above this key support level will be crucial in making the reversal, with volume and momentum being the key indicators of further bullish continuation. While ADA has its sights set on the next major move, traders also widen their radar to include upcoming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is picking up serious traction as it moves into 2025’s expected market surge. For investors still asking what crypto to buy, MUTM is becoming an obvious choice. Mutuum Finance Breaks Market Projections Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast turning into one of the best new crypto initiatives. Platform adoption has been far in excess of initial estimates, with over 17,400 investors participating in the presale and raising over $17.85 million.

Elina Valtonen, the Foreign Minister, said the latest steps taken jointly by the United States and the European Union were meaningful but not sufficient to change the situation. She said the objective now is to affect Russia’s cost calculations because its political goals remain unchanged. Valtonen spoke in Malaysia at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, where Finland is signing on to the group’s main treaty. She described how the recent US sanctions targeted Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC, the two largest Russian oil producers, while the EU moved to block imports of Russian liquefied natural gas. “The step that the United States took the other day in lockstep with Europe to strengthen the sanctions against Russia is so important,” Valtonen said.“However, we simply have to increase the pressure.” She added that “we seem to be unable to change Russia’s imperialistic goals, but we should be able to change their calculus,” and noted that “a war costs a lot of money” and Russia’s economy is still carrying that cost. White House and regional diplomacy move at the same time The tightening of sanctions came during a broader diplomatic sequence. Donald Trump, on his first trip to the region since returning to the White House earlier this year, is expected to meet ASEAN officials on Sunday. Later, he is scheduled to meet Xi Jinping in South Korea, where Trump has said he will raise China’s role in applying pressure on Vladimir Putin. This discussion comes after Chinese state-owned Sinopec canceled purchases of seaborne Russian crude following the US blacklisting of Rosneft and Lukoil. Russia has increased its military strikes in Ukraine and has shown no interest in stopping the conflict. Trump also postponed a planned meeting with Putin in Budapest, saying he did not want “a wasted meeting” without clear prospects for progress. According to Bloomberg, Finland views energy trade as one of the last remaining major leverage points in the conflict, arguing that sanctions need to remain targeted, continuous, and hard to evade. European coalition presses military and economic measures Meanwhile, over in the UK, Keir Starmer led a meeting of the so-called coalition of the willing, bringing together thirty governments working to support Ukraine and defeat Putin. Starmer called for providing long-range missiles, removing more Russian oil and gas from global markets, using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine’s defense budget, expanding air defense capabilities, and maintaining military pressure on Russian positions. The UK Prime Minister said:- “I think it’s important when we say we want to take oil and gas off the market, that we’re describing an end of a process, not the beginning of a process. I think it is really important that we continue to bear down. There are some countries which, in my view, should be moving a lot more quickly in relation to this.” Dozens of governments joined virtually, including Emmanuel Macron, who co-chairs the coalition. After the meeting, Starmer said Putin’s “ludicrous demands for Ukrainian land which he could not and has not taken by force” show he is not negotiating in good faith. “So we have been clear today that we must respond,” Starmer said. “Working with the US this coalition is determined to go further than ever to ratchet up the pressure on Putin – from the battlefield to his war economy – because that is the only way to change his mind and push him back to the table.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Economy|EUR|GBP|RUB|UAH|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|COMMODITY|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-25 11:30:36

Launched in May, this milestone underscores the accelerating appetite for regulated XRP exposure among sophisticated traders, particularly institutions stepping deeper into the digital asset market. CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives marketplace, has already transformed institutional crypto access with regulated Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, driving liquidity, price discovery, and confidence. Now, with XRP joining that elite lineup, professional investors gain a compliant, capital-efficient tool to hedge risk and capture directional exposure to one of the most adopted digital assets in the market. Therefore, the strong early response signals demand far beyond initial expectations. As XRP’s role in cross-border settlement accelerates and Ripple scales institutional adoption, market interest is surging. CME’s regulated XRP futures deliver what offshore platforms often can’t: transparent leverage, efficient hedging, and institutional-grade risk controls, empowering traders to manage exposure with confidence. Notably, futures markets aren’t just a venue for speculation, they’re a signal of trust in an asset’s long-term value. As liquidity grows and institutional participation expands, XRP benefits from more efficient price discovery, tighter spreads, and increased credibility among regulated financial players. XRP’s Bullish Momentum Builds as Key Moving Average Crossover Signals Upside Potential Toward $2.70 XRP’s bullish momentum is accelerating, fueled by a key technical breakout. Market analyst Kaan Kaya notes the 20-day SMA has crossed above the 50-day SMA, a classic bullish crossover signaling growing upward strength and the potential for the rally to extend further. Moving averages help traders quickly assess market momentum. When a short-term average breaks above a longer-term one, it confirms a shift toward bullish strength. For XRP, this crossover underscores rising confidence, increasing demand, and mounting expectations of a sustained breakout. What’s next? Well, the immediate level to watch is $2.50, which has emerged as a critical resistance zone. XRP has tested this price area multiple times, demonstrating that sellers are actively defending the level. However, recent strength suggests the bulls may finally be preparing to push through. According to Kaya, a decisive daily close above $2.50 could open the doors for the next major leg upward, with a price target near $2.70. This potential move would not only confirm the bullish crossover but also signal reclaiming a key psychological zone that could energize market sentiment even further. XRP is currently trading near $2.55, supported by growing optimism around its expanding role in institutional finance and rising participation from both retail and professional traders. Strengthening fundamentals and improving technicals are reinforcing the view that XRP may be entering a new phase of price discovery. Conclusion As XRP’s real-world utility expands and institutional adoption accelerates, CME’s regulated futures have emerged as a key access point for professional traders seeking capital-efficient exposure. Nearly $27B in notional volume within just five months underscores the trend: demand is rising, confidence is strengthening, and XRP is joining the ranks of crypto’s most established institutional assets. Meanwhile, XRP is nearing a pivotal breakout zone as the 20-day SMA crosses above the 50-day SMA, a clear signal of strengthening bullish momentum. A sustained close above $2.50 could trigger the next leg higher toward $2.70, reinforcing a broader trend reversal.

Price Breaks From Downtrend The recent move marks a clean break above a downward trendline that had acted as resistance for several weeks. Multiple failed attempts to break above the line added weight to the breakout when it finally occurred. The price now trades above that level, with a large green candle confirming the shift. Crypto analyst Batman commented , “$HYPE has finally broken out of its short-term bearish trend after months of staying under.” They added, “Once something strong gets broken, it often flips and acts as support.” The zone between $39 and $40 is now seen as an area to watch for potential support on any retest. Source: Batman/X However, views remain mixed on where the price goes from here. Analyst Crypto Patel offered a more cautious view, suggesting a possible move back toward $32. “We just broke down from the channel support and honestly? It’s looking bearish,” they wrote. “I’m expecting a retest and then a move down to the $32 support zone.” They added that if $32 fails, the next zone to watch is between $22 and $20. Still, the analyst described that area as a long-term buying opportunity. Despite the near-term uncertainty, their long-term outlook remains bullish, with price targets of $50, $100, $200, and even $500 over time. Indicators Back Uptrend The chart also shows strength in key indicators. The MACD has printed a bullish crossover, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line.

Malaysia’s Investment, Trade and Industry Minister Zafrul Aziz said, “It’s zero for now and I hope it continues to be so,” adding that the U.S. remains “an important market for Malaysia.” Malaysia is already facing a 19% levy on exports to the U.S., which has raised concerns among its major electronics producers. The trade talks come as President Donald Trump considers sweeping new tariffs on semiconductors that could go as high as 300%, a potential blow to the world’s sixth-largest chip exporter. Trump plans trade and minerals deal at ASEAN Trump is expected to visit Kuala Lumpur during the ASEAN summit, and Zafrul said it is “a possibility” that Malaysia will sign a critical minerals agreement with Trump. It is unclear whether Trump actually wants a stronger foothold in Malaysia’s rare-earth and mineral-processing sectors, areas now seemingly attracting investors from China, Japan, and both Koreas. According to Bloomberg, Malaysia has been trying to expand rare-earth mining and processing to meet global demand for materials that power electric vehicles, batteries, and renewable technologies. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced earlier this month that the country’s sovereign wealth fund, Khazanah Nasional, would collaborate with global companies to build downstream processing plants. The government’s plan is to make Malaysia dominant in the supply chains for clean energy and electronics, so they can reduce reliance on Chinese imports. The discussions are expected to take place alongside the ASEAN Summit scheduled from October 26 to 28, hosted by Malaysia under the theme “Inclusivity and Sustainability.” The summit will gather leaders from the U.S., China, Japan, and all ten ASEAN nations for a series of talks on trade, regional stability, and industrial cooperation. Japan to deepen semiconductor and AI collaboration with Malaysia Japan is preparing to strengthen cooperation with Malaysia and ASEAN in semiconductors and artificial intelligence, said Japan’s Ambassador to Malaysia, Noriyuki Shikata. Speaking to Bernama, Shikata explained that Tokyo’s renewed push is because of newly-elected Prime Minister Takaichi Sanae’s focus on economic security and high-value technology investment. “We will be very interested in upgrading our industrial cooperation in strategic sectors like semiconductors, AI and rare earths,” he said. Takaichi is traveling to Kuala Lumpur to meet Anwar and attend the ASEAN meetings. Her administration has already introduced new economic-security laws that it claims will protect the country’s critical technologies and intellectual property. Malaysia’s Shikata pointed out that Japanese companies have supported Malaysia’s industrial growth for over four decades, from Mitsubishi Motors’ role in Proton’s development to Daihatsu’s joint venture with Perodua, which created thousands of skilled jobs. He added that many Malaysians trained in Japan are now working in universities and industries across the country. Malaysia’s Shikata described green transition and energy security as the next stage of Japan-Malaysia cooperation under the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC).

Both firms have announced endeavors towards fostering the inclusion of the technology in their operations. Electronic Arts announced a strategic partnership with Stability AI. According to its statement, both firms will work on co-developing generative AI models, tools, and workflows that will transform game creation. Electronic Arts is currently one of the biggest third-party game publishers, driving popular franchises like EA Sports FC, Battlefield, and Madden NFL. On the other hand, Stability AI is best known for its popular Stable Diffusion model. Electronic Arts and Krafton are embracing AI technology In the statement, Stability AI mentioned that the partnership will focus on practical applications that will be used to improve creative workflows. Some of the projects that would be undertaken include the creation of physically based rendering (PBR) materials through artist-driven workflows, such as generating 2D textures with precise colors and light accuracy. The firms are also developing AI systems that will be used to pre-visualize entire 3D environments from prompts. The partnership will also look to enable rapid prototyping and visual storytelling, while allowing artists to maintain their creative control and quality standards. “Creativity has always been at the heart of everything our teams do,” said Electronic Arts VP of Creative Innovation Kallol Mitra, in a statement. “Together with Stability AI, we’re amplifying that creativity. Giving artists, designers, and developers the power to dream bigger and build more.” Electronic Arts’ announcement comes weeks after the firm released a statement saying it had agreed to be acquired by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in a $55 billion deal. The planned sale faced criticism from several angles of the gaming community, as gamers and industry analysts criticized the amount of potential debt Electronic Arts would be saddled with. Senators also voiced out their criticisms over the potential for foreign influence and national security risks. Krafton set to finalize its AI push in 2026 Krafton, on the other hand, announced a comprehensive transformation into an AI-first company. According to the PUBG and Subnautica publisher, the company wants to center its operations around agentic AI to automate workflows and enable employees to focus on creative activities and solve complex problems. The company is also making several investments in line with this, including spending $70 billion for GPU cluster infrastructure to support sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning tasks. In addition, Krafton is expected to allocate nearly $21 billion annually starting in 2026 for employee AI tool utilization, a support level that is more than 10 times its current level. The transformation is expected to happen in three stages, which include establishing an AI-first culture through learning platforms and a hackathon, innovating work methods by restructuring organizational management, and providing new growth opportunities through expanded employee mobility and role expansion. “We will leap forward as a company that promotes the growth of members and expands the organization’s areas of challenge through AI,” said Krafton CEO Kim Chang-han, in a statement. Krafton aims to finalize its AI platform and data integration foundation by the second half of next year, establishing a company-wide AI operation infrastructure in an attempt to strengthen its competitive position in the global gaming market. Krafton and Electronic Arts join other game publishers that have embraced the use of AI. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The second-largest asset in the world digitally is consolidating around $3,850 following weeks of lateral movement. Traders are looking at a possible recovery to $4,200 should the momentum continue to improve. As institutional flows re-enter the market and whales accumulate, optimism is slowly rebounding throughout the market. Early-stage tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are being eyed by investors as the next big thing. Wyckoff Pattern Hints at Renewed Accumulation According to market analysts, Ethereum develops a Wyckoff-style re-accumulation pattern. Crypto analyst Ash Crypto reported that ‘’ETH is moving toward the markup phase.’’ In the three-day chart, Ethereum has developed structural bases around $3,700 and $3,800, just like previous breakout patterns. The Wyckoff model postulates that large traders are gearing towards a rise in prices during low volatility. Source: X This narrative is backed by institutional data. Recent on-chain activity indicated an 8,491 ETH withdrawal (=$32 million) of OKX by a whale wallet, which is usually viewed as accumulation. The drop in exchange reserves would reduce supply pressure, which would provide a good chance of a rise above $4,000 and potentially $4,200 in the short term. Technical Setup and ETF Flows Support Upside Outlook The price structure of Ethereum resists the weak pullbacks. A possible triple bottom pattern of between $3,700 and $3,800 enhances the recovery technical argument. An established breakout of the price above $4,000 would open the next resistance zone at $4,200. In the meantime, institutional exposure is growing with the ETH ETFs. BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale recorded mixed flows this week, but cumulative inflows remained positive. According to Fundstrat Tom Lee, “Ethereum is among the best-placed digital assets for the next leg of the cycle.” There is additional support from post-merge dynamics. As issuance is approaching zero and staking participation is growing, the circulating supply of Ethereum continues to shrink. These basics, along with risk appetite returning as the Fear Index improves, provide support on the ability of a sustained recovery. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Investor Momentum Ethereum trades near the $4,200 level as early-stage investors shift their attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE. The token, built on the Ethereum network, has already raised more than $16.5 million from over 16, 500 investors worldwide. Both presale stages are progressing faster than expected, driven by retail demand and a 5 0% PATRIOT50X bonus. MAGACOIN FINANCE is unique as it is dual-audited by CertiK and HashEx and has 100% verification of smart-contract security. Such openness has enhanced investor confidence when new players are seeking authenticated opportunities. It has a valuation of less than 1$, and a coming exchange listing, analysts predict it will be in the 1,200% range as soon as it lists. The roadmap of the project, government-based governance, and tokenomics based on scarcity have made it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy in 2025. Exchange talks are already progressing, meaning wider access may be coming in the near future,- often the stage where first buyers get the greatest returns. Conclusion The technical and on-chain design of Ethereum is a good indicator of a potential recovery to $4,2000 when fear in the market declines. Bullish sentiment is still supported by institutional inflows and decreased supply. However, in addition to recognized properties, some projects promise quicker growth to investors, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is among the best crypto to buy before the next rally. Having passed 100% audits, community traction, and future exchange listings, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining more investors looking to establish themselves early in the 2026 bull market. With increasing momentum, timing is now of the essence – early entry today could make all the difference tomorrow.

American Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng and trade negotiator Li Chenggang at the Merdeka 118 tower, the world’s second-highest building in Kuala Lumpur. The discussions come at a tense moment. President Donald Trump has warned he might slap 100% tariffs on Chinese products starting November 1. This threat came after China put tough new limits on selling rare earth magnets and minerals to other countries. These materials are critical for many industries. The dispute has damaged a careful agreement that Bessent, Greer, and He had worked out over four earlier meetings since May. Recently, Washington added thousands more Chinese companies to a list that blocks them from buying American products. Beijing responded by announcing worldwide restrictions on rare earth exports on October 10. Neither the Malaysian hosts nor the American and Chinese teams shared much information about what they would discuss or whether they planned to tell reporters about any results. Getting ready for the big meeting The three officials are trying to clear the path for Trump and Xi Jinping to sit down next Thursday. That meeting is scheduled for an economic summit in South Korea, where leaders from countries around the Pacific Ocean will gather. The conversation between the two presidents could touch on giving some temporary breaks on tariffs, easing technology restrictions, and getting China to buy American soybeans again. Right before the Saturday talks began, Trump left Washington to start his trip through Asia. He told reporters what he wants to discuss with Xi. Farmers dealing with China’s decision to stop buying U.S. soybeans will be one topic, Trump said. Taiwan , the self-ruled island that China says belongs to it, will also come up. Trump made clear he has no intention of visiting Taiwan himself. Trying to avoid worse damage The world’s two biggest economies want to prevent their tariff war from returning to extremely high levels on both sides. When Bessent and Greer first met with Chinese counterparts in Geneva in May, they agreed to a 90-day pause in the fight. This brought tariffs down sharply to about 55% on the American side and 30% on the Chinese side. It also got rare-earth magnets moving again. They extended this agreement in later talks in London and Stockholm. It was set to end on November 10. But things started falling apart at the end of September. America’s Commerce Department greatly expanded a list that automatically includes companies more than 50% owned by firms already on that list. This blocked American exports to thousands more Chinese businesses. China hit back with new rare earth export controls on October 10, trying to stop these materials from being used in military equipment. Bessent and Greer called China’s action a “global supply chain power grab” and promised America and its friends would not accept these limits. News reports say the Trump team is thinking about restricting even more exports to China, including items like laptops and jet engines. Washington added more tension on Friday by starting a new investigation into whether China failed to keep promises made in a 2020 trade deal called the “Phase One” agreement. That deal had stopped their trade war during Trump’s first term as president. Get seen where it counts.

Bitcoin ETFs didn’t record any outflows among the twelve BTC funds. On-chain data revealed that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded net single-day inflows of $32.68 million. IBIT also saw a historical net inflow of $65.306 billion. Bitcoin ETFs surge after recent 1011 crypto crash Fidelity’s BTC ETF recorded total inflows of $57.92 million. FBTC also saw its total net inflows reach a historical high of $12.597 billion. The increase in inflows in Bitcoin ETFs corresponds with BTC’s price regaining strength. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at around $111,600, up more than 4.5% in the past seven days. Bitcoin ETFs saw a staggering $1.23 billion of outflows within just four days, from October 13 to October 17. The rapid outflows stemmed from the October 11 crypto market crash that saw BTC’s price drop from a high of $121,000 to approximately $103,000. Ethereum ETFs have struggled, recording a total net outflow of $93.6 million. As of October 24, ETH funds have seen cumulative total net inflows of $14.35 billion. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF saw total outflows of nearly $101 million on Friday. No Ethereum-based ETFs recorded inflows, marking three consecutive days of outflows. Ethereum’s price has also struggled to regain the $4,000 psychological level over the past three days. At the time of publication, ETH is trading around $3,950, up more than 1.7% in the past seven days. SEC timeline for Cardano ETFs stalled by U.S. government shutdown As BTC ETFs recorded inflows, the deadline for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision on three XRP ETFs and Grayscale’s Cardano ETF was set for this week. However, the SEC didn’t make any announcement about the funds despite the deadline passing this week. Andrew Jacobson, general counsel at Halliday, explained that the SEC has been operating at reduced capacity ever since the U.S. Federal Government shutdown on October 1. The former global head of legal at 21Shares also believes that ETF approvals have been paused for the time being, but he expects a flurry of approvals once the shutdown ends. Jacobson explained that fall is often the hottest season for ETFs, so things might move fast once the government is back up and running. According to the odds on the crypto betting platform Polymarket, bettors don’t expect the shutdown to end this month. Bettors on Polymarket give a 7% chance that the shutdown will end by October 31. Cryptopolitan reported on Monday that Kevin Hassett, Director of the U.S. National Economic Council, stated that the shutdown could end this week. He revealed that the U.S. Senate was planning to hold its 11th vote to fund the government and end the shutdown. The crypto market is still expecting a Cardano ETF this year, with Polymarket users pegging the odds of a Cardano ETF happening in 2025 at 77%. Cardano and other altcoin ETFs gained interest among the crypto community in September after the SEC significantly revamped its approval rules for crypto ETFs. The initiative reduced the approval threshold for spot crypto ETF approvals to 75 days from the usual 240 days. The SEC also streamlined and simplified the path forward for crypto ETFs, provided that the underlying digital assets already trade futures on regulated U.S. exchanges. The changes prompted Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart to predict the approval of over 100 crypto ETFs in the next six to 12 months.

Data shared by crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) shows that XRP’s holder net position change fell from -18.5 million to -59.5 million XRP in just 4 days. The move represents a 220% increase in outflows, marking one of the steepest short-term declines in recent weeks. The accompanying chart tracks the daily net position change among XRP holders over 2 weeks. Early in the period, data reflected steady accumulation, with multiple green bars showing over 100 million XRP inflows. However, this pattern reversed sharply, and the final bars on the chart turned red, indicating sizable net selling by existing holders. The last data point on October 21 recorded the largest outflow, with nearly 60 million XRP leaving long-term wallets as the price hovered around $2.43. Although the chart presents a clear exit pattern from long-term investors, it also provides useful insight into potential phases of consolidation that often accompany such transitions. BREAKING: LONG-TERM $XRP HOLDERS ARE CASHING OUT. NET POSITION CHANGE DROPPED FROM –18.5M TO –59.5M XRP IN JUST FOUR DAYS — A 220% INCREASE IN OUTFLOWS. pic.twitter.com/n1blX0JKWD — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 23, 2025 Short-Term Pressure, Long-Term Opportunity Despite the intensity of recent selling , the data may not solely signal weakness. Similar shifts have historically followed major rallies or preceded fresh accumulation cycles. Holder position changes of this magnitude often occur when traders rebalance portfolios after significant price movements or in anticipation of volatility. While the drop in net positions highlights temporary pressure, XRP’s underlying market structure remains relatively firm. The price holding above the $2.4 level even amid the sell-off indicates that short-term exits have not translated into a broad loss of confidence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical patterns also suggest the market could absorb current selling without severe disruption. Notable pullbacks in XRP’s history have tended to resolve into renewed buying interest once distribution phases subside. If this behavior repeats, the ongoing reduction in long-term holdings may clear the path for stronger hands to reenter the market at adjusted levels. Market Outlook as XRP Holds Key Levels The next several trading sessions will likely determine whether XRP stabilizes above $2.40 or revisits earlier support zones. A sustained recovery in holder positions could serve as an early indicator of renewed investor confidence. Steph’s chart highlights an important transition point. As sentiment oscillates, XRP’s resilience near the current range may reflect quiet accumulation under the surface. If that pattern holds, the latest outflows could ultimately precede a stronger base for the next upward phase .

The project’s price has been revised upward to about $300 million, and the administration says no taxpayer funds will be used. Private Money Funds Massive Ballroom Reports have listed a long roster of backers from several industries who are funneling money through a nonprofit charity. The Trust for the National Mall is being used as the conduit, and White House officials and outside reporting say donations will cover construction costs rather than federal appropriations. The Trust has longstanding ties to park projects, but critics have flagged the scale and speed of this fundraising drive. Major corporate names appear on the donor list. Based on reports, tech firms including Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta Platforms and Microsoft are among the contributors. Crypto companies such as Coinbase, Ripple and Tether are also listed, alongside tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American, and defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin. “I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom… The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly.” – President Trump pic.twitter.com/GibeLevvFP — The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 20, 2025 The list also includes wealthy individuals and some political allies. Exact donation amounts for most contributors remain undisclosed. Donor Roles Include Tech, Crypto And Tobacco Officials have said the ballroom will provide space for large events, with one estimate noting it could hold up to around a thousand guests. The East Wing demolition work has already moved forward while fundraising continues. That demolition and the project’s quick pace have raised questions from preservation groups and some federal overseers about whether required approvals were fully in place before work began. Based on watchdog reporting, the nonprofit handling donations may charge fees for administering gifts. One public interest group reported that the Trust would take about a 2.5% cut on donations, a figure that could translate into millions in fees as money flows in. Critics say the fee arrangement and the absence of full disclosure on donor sums make it hard to assess who might gain influence from their contributions. Transparency Questions And Recognition Reports show donors may receive forms of recognition tied to the project, and draft pledge documents discussed publicly mention options such as having names associated with the ballroom. That detail has fed concerns from lawmakers and watchdogs about whether private funding will create expectations of access or favors. At least some members of Congress have asked for more information and for clearer accounting of how gifts are handled.

According to executive remarks, the deal makes Ripple the first crypto company to own and run a global, multi-asset prime broker. Related Reading: 16,000 Ancient Bitcoins Just Moved—And It’s Costing Whales Billions Ripple President Monica Long said on X that the “future ahead is mighty bright,” and reports show the company is already moving to use XRP in new ways inside the prime brokerage business. Ripple Completes Hidden Road Deal Based on reports, Ripple Prime began life on Hidden Road’s backbone, a platform known for fast growth among non-bank prime brokers. Since Ripple announced the acquisition in April, business at the unit has tripled in size. Ripple Prime will offer services such as clearing, financing, and prime brokerage across asset classes, including FX, derivatives, swaps, and digital assets. Hidden Road’s founder, Marc Asch, will remain involved and work with CEO Brad Garlinghouse and other leaders as integration continues. The opportunities now available to Ripple Prime (fka Hidden Road) are expansive. With $RLUSD already being used as collateral for a number of prime brokerage products, and Ripple Prime looking at a variety of ways to utilize XRP, the future ahead is mighty bright. https://t.co/YFSUQlyeOO — Monica Long (@MonicaLongSF) October 24, 2025 RLUSD Gains Institutional Footing RLUSD, Ripple’s institutional stablecoin, is already being used as collateral across several prime brokerage products. According to company statements, some derivatives clients have chosen to hold balances in RLUSD rather than other currencies. Reports also note that BNY Mellon acts as the primary reserve custodian for RLUSD. Blockchain analytics firm Bluechip gave RLUSD an A rating for stability, governance, and asset backing, a ranking Ripple cites as evidence of institutional trust. Ripple’s Acquisition Push Strengthens Infrastructure Ripple has completed five major acquisitions in roughly two years, adding Metaco, Standard Custody, Rail, and GTreasury to its growing list of companies now working under its umbrella. The moves aim to expand custody, payments, liquidity, and treasury capabilities. Based on company comments, Ripple sees these buys as steps toward offering institutions a broader set of services tied to digital assets and traditional markets.

Reports show Ripple Prime’s expansion and RLUSD’s institutional traction could make XRP more useful to banks and asset managers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has repeatedly emphasized the company’s commitment to XRP, and Ripple’s latest steps put the token inside a wider set of services aimed at professional users. XRP Price Update Analysts and market watchers will be watching how quickly institutions adopt these new tools and whether XRP finds a steady, functional place in that ecosystem. XRP has been moving quietly within a tight range lately, holding between $2.30 and $2.50. The broader crypto market has stayed calm, and the token continues to trade comfortably above $2.20, showing resilience despite muted activity. According to crypto analysts, XRP’s quiet phase might not last long, pointing to a potential setup for a massive rally that could lift the coin far beyond its current zone — possibly reaching above $27 in the long run.

The effects of the recent major liquidation due to global trade tensions have faded and the market is poised for recovery, according to Tom Lee. Lee believes a crypto rally will occur towards the end of the year. The main reasons for this optimism are as follows: Technical Indicators: Open interest levels for both Ethereum and Bitcoin have fallen to “record lows,” but technical indicators are starting to “turn positive.” Institutional Support: He said that JPMorgan's statement that it was open to the idea of using cryptocurrencies as collateral was a positive catalyst. Crisis Resilience: Lee argued that even during the recent massive deleveraging event, which was “many times larger than what happened during FTX,” Bitcoin only fell 3-4%, proving it to be a “pretty good store of value.” Ethereum Fundamentals: He said that fundamental activity on Ethereum (especially from the L1 and L2 space and stablecoins) has increased significantly, but that this has not yet been reflected in the price and that there should be a “fairly large movement” towards the end of the year. Related News: U.S. Inflation Data, Published Uninterrupted for 100 Years, May Not Be Released Next Month Lee also reminded that cryptocurrencies tend to be an early indicator of overall market liquidity and the direction of stocks, adding that the current crypto movements are “sending a pretty bullish signal” to the market. *This is not investment advice.

XRP, in particular, has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. Traders are torn between optimism and caution as seasoned analysts issue warnings that the euphoric phase may soon give way to a brutal correction. One voice resonating strongly amid the noise is that of JD, a respected market analyst whose previous predictions about XRP’s price movements have proven remarkably accurate. His latest post on X has captured widespread attention, urging traders to prepare for what he describes as an imminent and potentially “biblical” top. JD’s Growing Reputation Among XRP Analysts JD’s credibility within the XRP community stems from his consistent record of calling market swings with precision. Earlier this year, his warnings of an impending drop in XRP materialized when the token plunged sharply after a period of overextension, validating his technical outlook at the time. Top is coming VERY soon (it's going to be BIBLICAL ) … Make sure you have a Take Profit strategy Or be my EXIT LIQUIDITY that will retire my whole family bloodline when Smart Money does the HISTORICAL RUG PULL that will CRASH the entire market! … — JD (@jaydee_757) October 24, 2025 That successful call cemented JD’s status as a trusted voice in crypto circles, particularly among XRP traders who rely on detailed chart analysis and smart money behavior patterns to anticipate turning points. Now, JD has issued another statement that carries the same intensity and conviction. While he stops short of naming a precise price level or date, his message implies that XRP and the broader market could soon experience an inflection point that separates disciplined traders from speculative dreamers. Risk Management and Profit Discipline Although wrapped in vivid language, JD’s post carries a serious undertone, a call for traders to have a clear take-profit strategy . His use of the term “smart money” points to the market’s cyclical nature, where institutional players often offload positions at euphoric highs, leaving retail traders holding depreciating assets after the reversal. This isn’t merely a forecast; it’s a behavioral insight. JD’s warning underscores that while optimism fuels rallies, a lack of preparation fuels losses. Traders who fail to define their exit points risk becoming what he describes as “exit liquidity,” providing the liquidity needed for larger players to lock in profits before the downturn. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Understanding the Technical Backdrop Recent XRP price data shows why JD’s caution resonates. Following its multi-month rally past $2.40, XRP entered a volatile consolidation phase amid declining volume, a pattern often preceding a decisive breakout or collapse. Analysts monitoring the XRP/USD pair note similarities to previous macro tops, where distribution phases emerged quietly before sharp corrections. JD’s post aligns with this technical framework, suggesting that the market’s exuberance may be nearing exhaustion. His emphasis on timing and caution reflects broader concerns that the current rally, while powerful, could soon give way to a liquidity-driven retracement. A Final Word: Preparation Over Prediction JD’s statement is not a proclamation of doom but a disciplined reminder of trading fundamentals. Markets reward those who plan, not those who react. Whether or not a “historical rug pull” unfolds, the core lesson remains timeless: profits are only real when they are secured. As traders debate the next big move, JD’s warning serves as a timely reminder that even in bullish times, caution remains the smartest strategy. The market’s top may not be predictable, but preparedness, as JD insists, is non-negotiable. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

That’s the take from Charlene Barshefsky, former U.S. Trade Representative under Bill Clinton, who told the Bund Summit in Shanghai on Saturday that a temporary fix is all the world should expect right now. “A US-China deal, whatever it is,” she said, “will be at best setting a tactical floor for the moment.” She added bluntly, “Strategically, it will not impact, I don’t believe, either the direction that China is going in or the direction the US is going in.” Barshefsky, who led China’s entry into the World Trade Organization over two decades ago, said she no longer sees a united global trading system. Instead, she expects the world to divide into three major economic blocs: the U.S. and its allies, China alongside the Global South, Russia, and possibly the Middle East, and a third cluster of non-aligned economies like India. The fragmentation, she warned, won’t be undone by any handshake deal between Washington and Beijing. Officials hold new talks but deepen mistrust Talks resumed Saturday in Kuala Lumpur, where top U.S. and Chinese economic officials began another round of negotiations . A U.S. Treasury spokesperson allegedly described the discussions as “very constructive.” But behind that diplomat-speak is real anxiety: both sides are desperate to avoid a repeat of the tariff war that once pushed duties above 100% on some goods. A planned meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping next week is driving urgency. But the tone of the talks remains fragile. Back in May, Bessent and Greer met with He in Geneva to set up a 90-day tariff truce, lowering duties to about 55% on U.S. goods and 30% on Chinese exports, which also allowed magnet trade to resume. That pause was extended in London and Stockholm, but it’s now running out; the clock hits zero on November 10. Things got worse at the end of September. That’s when the U.S. Commerce Department added a massive batch of Chinese firms to its export blacklist, targeting any company over 50% owned by blacklisted entities. This new rule instantly cut off U.S. exports to thousands of Chinese companies. China hits back with rare earth curbs and defends its position China retaliated on October 10 by tightening its rare earth export controls , aiming to stop their use in foreign military systems. That response triggered harsh reactions from U.S. negotiators. Bessent and Greer called it a “global supply chain power grab” and promised the U.S. and its allies would fight back. Now, Reuters reports that the Trump administration may hit back with restrictions on a massive list of software-driven U.S. exports to China, including laptops, smartphones, and even jet engines. On top of that, Washington just opened a new tariff probe into China’s failure to meet its obligations under the 2020 “Phase One” trade deal that paused the original trade war during Trump’s first term. The tensions were also visible at the Bund Summit, where multiple speakers took swipes at both sides. Some demanded that China scale back its export-driven economy to reduce its ballooning trade surplus. One of them, Yu Yongding, a former adviser to China’s central bank, pushed back hard. He said the U.S. should “take responsibility” for failing to spread globalization’s gains across its own population, instead of blaming China. Yu also argued that China has been shifting its growth model toward domestic demand, and he stood firm on the rare earth restrictions, calling them a direct answer to U.S. sanctions. When asked whether the move could damage Europe, Yu said it wasn’t aimed at them and suggested there could be a technical fix to minimize any collateral damage.

That loss didn’t show up as one clean figure, but came from multiple line items, including platform changes, restructuring, and rising tariffs. The numbers were buried in its nine-month results, where the damage spread wide. Sales revenue for the first three quarters came in at €26.86 billion ($31.22 billion), which is 6% lower than last year. Operating profit cratered to just €40 million ($46.5 million), a 99% collapse from last year. That meant return on sales (ROS), a key profitability gauge, dropped from 14.1% to a near-zero 0.2%. “This result fell clearly short of our expectations,” said finance chief Dr. Jochen Breckner during the earnings presentation. Porsche slashes full-year forecast and margins Porsche cut its full-year sales forecast, now expecting €37 to €38 billion, down from €40.1 billion earlier. Breckner said the company is now aiming for a return on sales between 0% and 2%, slashed from a previous 5%. Automotive EBITDA margin guidance also dropped, now expected between 10.5% to 12.5%, down from the prior 14.5% to 16.5%. The biggest impact came from changes in the company’s vehicle strategy . Last month, Porsche confirmed it’s extending internal combustion engine production for its Panamera and Cayenne models well into the 2030s. It’s also shifting powertrain plans for an upcoming three-row SUV. Those decisions come at a price. The company expects the combined hit from lineup changes and other costs to total €3.2 billion ($3.72 billion) this year. Out of that, €1.8 billion ($2.09 billion) is tied to the rework of its new EV platform. Tariffs added more pain. Porsche revealed it had already absorbed €500 million ($581.3 million) in tariff-related costs through Q3. That number could rise to €700 million ($813.67 million) by the end of the year, according to Breckner. This follows a 15% tariff deal signed by the EU earlier this summer. The new rate began applying to exports starting August 1, and it hit Porsche’s margins hard. North America slows, China cuts deepen, leadership changes loom North American sales also dipped, but the company blamed it on lower imports after the summer break and bloated inventories from late Q2. Meanwhile, in China, the situation looks worse. Porsche described market conditions there as “challenging,” pointing to tighter luxury demand and heavier pricing pressure. The company is responding by trimming dealerships, staff, and stakeholder costs to stop the bleeding. Leadership changes are also on the way. CEO Oliver Blume, who currently holds the top seat at both Volkswagen and Porsche, will step down as Porsche CEO. Former McLaren boss Michael Leiters will take over starting January 1, 2026. As of now, Porsche’s stock is down nearly 20% year-to-date. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Imagine a world where your digital assets skyrocket, turning a modest investment into a fortune. For holders of XRP , this dream might not be so far-fetched. A recent analysis by digital asset analytics platform Systine Research suggests an astonishing possibility: an XRP price surge that could see it reach an incredible $77 to $100. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s based on a compelling pattern reminiscent of its monumental 2017 bull run. Is an XRP to $100 Price Surge Truly Possible? Systine Research’s new report highlights that if XRP follows a trajectory similar to its historic 2017 performance, a substantial increase is on the horizon. Currently trading around $2.50, the digital asset has shown promising signs of significant accumulation. This means investors are buying and holding XRP , indicating strong underlying support after finding a solid floor at the $2 level. The report emphasizes that breaking above a crucial resistance zone, specifically between $2.80 and $3.20, could be the trigger. Such a breakout is expected to ignite a sharp price increase. This upward momentum would be largely fueled by an acceleration of institutional capital inflows, as more large-scale investors recognize XRP ‘s potential and utility. What Catalysts Could Drive the XRP to $100 Rally? Several key factors are identified as potential catalysts for this projected XRP price surge . These aren’t speculative rumors but concrete developments that could reshape XRP ‘s market position. One of the most anticipated events is the resolution of uncertainty surrounding Ripple ‘s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC . A favorable outcome could remove a major regulatory cloud, boosting investor confidence significantly. Moreover, Ripple’s strategic partnerships are set to play a vital role. The integration of the RLUSD stablecoin with a tokenized money market fund, achieved through a collaboration between Ripple and Securitize , is a major step. This move aims to bridge traditional finance with decentralized assets, expanding XRP ‘s ecosystem. Another powerful driver is the continuous expansion of XRP -based payment networks. These networks are increasingly being utilized for real-world finance applications, enhancing XRP ‘s utility and demand. As more financial institutions adopt Ripple’s technology for cross-border payments, the intrinsic value of XRP strengthens, paving the way for a potential XRP to $100 valuation. Understanding the Path to a Staggering XRP Price Surge While the prospect of an XRP price surge to $100 is exciting, it’s important to understand the dynamics at play. Market sentiment, coupled with fundamental developments, creates the conditions for such parabolic moves. The utility of XRP in facilitating fast, low-cost cross-border transactions makes it a valuable asset in the global financial landscape. Its technology offers a compelling solution for a pain point in traditional banking. However, like all cryptocurrency investments, challenges exist. Market volatility, broader economic conditions, and evolving regulatory landscapes can all influence price action. Despite these factors, the consistent development and adoption of Ripple’s technology suggest a strong foundation for future growth. The potential for an XRP to $100 scenario, while ambitious, is rooted in historical precedent and ongoing innovation. In conclusion, the analysis from Systine Research paints an incredibly optimistic picture for XRP . The combination of historical patterns, a potential resolution to regulatory hurdles, innovative partnerships, and expanding real-world utility creates a powerful narrative. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the detailed projection offers a fascinating glimpse into what could be an unprecedented journey for XRP holders. The path to an XRP price surge of this magnitude will undoubtedly be watched closely by the entire crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Systine Research? Systine Research is a digital asset analytics platform that provides in-depth reports and projections on various cryptocurrencies, utilizing data-driven analysis to forecast potential market movements. 2. What is the significance of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit for XRP? The lawsuit between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has created regulatory uncertainty around XRP . A clear and favorable resolution is widely expected to remove a significant impediment to XRP ‘s adoption and market valuation, potentially triggering a major XRP price surge . 3. How could the RLUSD stablecoin impact XRP’s value? The integration of the RLUSD stablecoin, facilitated by Ripple and Securitize , connects traditional finance with blockchain. This partnership enhances XRP ‘s ecosystem by expanding its utility in tokenized money market funds, potentially increasing demand and contributing to an XRP price surge . 4. What does “significant accumulation” mean for XRP? “Significant accumulation” indicates that a large number of investors, often institutional, are buying and holding XRP , especially after it has found a strong support level (like $2). This suggests growing confidence in its future value and can precede an upward price movement. 5. Is an XRP to $100 price surge guaranteed? While analysis from Systine Research projects a potential XRP price surge to $100 based on historical patterns and current catalysts, no investment outcome is guaranteed. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and various factors can influence price action. Investors should always conduct their own research.

Speaking at the Berlin Global Dialogue conference, Ursula said China has “dramatically tightened export controls over rare earths and battery materials in recent weeks and months,” calling the move a “significant risk.” According to Ursula, the European Union is working with G-7 partners on a coordinated plan and emphasized that “all instruments in our toolbox” are on the table. The remarks were first reported by Bloomberg. This comes after French President Emmanuel Macron urged European leaders to consider invoking the bloc’s toughest trade measure against China, the Anti-Coercion Instrument, or ACI, if diplomatic efforts collapse. The tool, created to defend the EU from economic pressure, has never been used. But with Beijing’s export curbs now threatening Europe’s access to vital inputs for electric-vehicle batteries and defense hardware, pressure is mounting for Brussels to act. EU prepares to unleash its trade weapon The ACI gives the bloc legal authority to retaliate against countries that use trade to apply political pressure. It was designed for exactly this kind of confrontation. If the EU determines that it’s being coerced, it can impose tariffs on China’s exports, curb Chinese investment inside the bloc, and even bar Chinese tech firms from bidding on public contracts. Brussels views the instrument less as a weapon and more as a warning, meaning its existence alone should make countries think twice before using trade as leverage. But this time feels different. Ursula’s warning signals that patience is running thin. Europe has been trying to persuade China to roll back its restrictions on exports of rare earths and battery materials, but Beijing’s new rules threaten to halt production lines across the continent, as industries from automakers to defense contractors depend on those inputs. The European Commission says triggering the ACI would be a “significant escalation,” which is why it’s never been deployed, not even when Donald Trump, now back in the White House, threatened in 2018 to slap a 30% import tariff on EU goods. Yet the risk to Europe’s economy is now far greater. With China’s export controls tightening by the week, the EU may have no choice but to act. How Europe could decide to strike back The ACI was proposed by the Commission in 2021, after years of tension with Washington and Beijing exposed Europe’s weakness to outside pressure. That same year, China blocked trade with Lithuania over its ties with Taiwan, a turning point that pushed Brussels to draft stronger defenses. The new doctrine, known as Open Strategic Autonomy, gives the EU more independence in areas where it once relied on global partners. Deciding to use the ACI won’t be quick. First, the Commission must investigate whether China’s actions count as coercion. If it does, it then sends a proposal to the European Council, which represents the 27 member states. To pass, the measure needs support from 55% of countries, representing 65% of the EU population. That gives France and Germany enormous influence over the outcome. If enough governments agree, the Council has 10 weeks to adopt or reject the proposal. The response could include tariffs, import bans, or limits on China’s market access. The whole process could take months as member states debate how far to go. But the tone from Ursula shows Brussels is running out of patience.

BNB outperforms Ethereum in daily transactions and active addresses, but lags Ethereum in DeFi TVL, stablecoin supply, and RWA market share. Valuation multiples for BNB, such as price to fees and market cap to TVL, suggest the token is not cheap compared to Ethereum or Solana. Speculative exposure to BNB could be considered at the right price, but Solana may offer a stronger growth and value proposition currently. It has been 9 full months since I wrote an article for Seeking Alpha focused on Binance Coin USD ( BNB-USD ) [BNB]. With the backdrop of President Trump pardoning Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ for short), I think it's worth revisiting the investment thesis for BNB. In this update, I'll briefly recap my call history and biggest concern with BNB to this point. We'll then go over key on-chain metrics for BNB that I find to be important. Brief Recap My coverage history with BNB has been considerably more cautious than I have been with other blockchain networks. In fact, I called BNB a 'sell' three times in 2023: My BNB Coverage History (Seeking Alpha) While I upgraded BNB to a 'hold' back in January, I've long held the view that Binance has a considerable amount of governance centralization risk when compared with other L1 Blockchain networks like Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Compared to other networks, BNB utilizes a much smaller amount of validators; of which, the top 8 control over 40% of the staked BNB. Despite my general bearish caution, the native token of BNB has admittedly performed quite well since the start of the year: Data by YCharts With BNB now up over 60% year to date and performing well ahead of L1 peers that I'm personally long like ETH or Solana ( SOL-USD ), it's time to take another look at the chains fundamentally as Binance founder CZ is pardoned by President Trump. Network Metrics: BNB Vs. Ethereum For the benefit of comparison, I'd like to primarily use Ethereum as BNB's contextual peer. While Ethereum is roughly 3x the size of BNB based on market capitalization, no other L1 network token is closer in value to ETH than BNB from a circulating cap standpoint. In this section, we'll look at key network metrics like transactions, daily active addresses (or DAAs), DeFi TVL, and stablecoin numbers. First, daily transactions: Data by YCharts Here we can see BNB (formerly Binance Smart Chain) has a substantial lead over Ethereum. BNB is currently processing over 22 million transactions per day. Not only is this far more than Ethereum nominally, but it also shows a better overall trend. At current levels, daily transactions on BNB have risen substantially throughout 2025 and are even ahead of the prior cycle peak. Ethereum is roughly in line with its prior cycle peak. Monthly DAAs, 5 yr trend (Artemis) Where Ethereum has had stability in the usage department for the last five years and has generally grown through secondary layers, BNB is showing exploding usage with 2.4 million average DAAs during the month of September. TVL by Chain, 10/24/25 (DeFi Llama) Yet, based on raw TVL figures, Ethereum continues to be the boss in the market with a 62.9% share of total value locked. Even Solana has a larger share of TVL than BNB . Furthermore, Ethereum's share of the RWA market is slightly above 53%, while BNB's share of RWA is just 2.7%. Ethereum actually has a larger share of RWA than BNB from 3 different scaling networks. Stablecoin Supply by Chain, 10/24/25 (DeFi Llama) At $14 billion in stablecoin supply, BNB comes in at 4th in the market behind Solana, Tron ( TRX-USD ), and Ethereum; with the latter again commanding more than half of the market share. However, despite not having nearly as large a stablecoin footprint as Ethereum or Tron, BNB's stablecoin active address figure has been top of the market in eight out of nine months this year: Stablecoin Active Addresses by Chain (Artemis) During the month of September, 11.1 million active addresses engaged with stablecoins on BNB - this was well ahead of Ethereum, which came in at just 3 million. In September, Ethereum processed $1.8 trillion in stablecoin transfer volume compared with $442 billion for BNB. Given the difference in ratios for stablecoin supply (8:1 favoring ETH) and stablecoin transfer volume (4:1 favoring ETH), BNB has a higher 'velocity of money' on the blockchain. This would imply stickier usage on BNB than on Ethereum. But it's important to remember that Ethereum has a massive L2 ecosystem. Given that, I think it's important to consider valuation multiples before jumping into any BNB long blindly. Valuation Multiples There are two general valuation multiples that I like to look at for smart contract chains, price to fees and market cap to TVL. Based on the first one, BNB and ETH are very closely valued: FDMC to Fees (Artemis) At 1.2k for BNB and 1.1k for ETH, the increases in token prices this year for both Ethereum and BNB have arguably been more driven by multiple expansion than anything else. For instance, Solana's users and daily transactions dwarf BNB's, yet that network trades at 272x fully diluted fees. FDMC to TVL (Artemis) Factoring in the DeFi angle, fully diluted market cap to TVL favors Ethereum in a big way at just 5x TVL. Again, we see multiple expansions for BNB, which now trades at 24x TVL. Solana is in the middle of each with an 11x TVL multiple in September. So based on both fully diluted cap to fees and fully diluted cap to TVL, I think it's hard to make the case that BNB is 'cheap' at current levels. Closing Takeaways If you can get beyond what I think are legitimate centralization concerns for BNB, it's difficult to argue with the usage growth story for the network. Coupled with what could reasonably be viewed as a positive news catalyst for Binance with CZ being pardoned, you could talk me into a speculative BNB proxy like the Osprey BNB Trust ( OBNB ) if it were to trade at a considerable discount to NAV (it currently doesn't). That said, for raw usage growth through DAAs and transactions, there is probably a stronger case for Solana when factoring in valuation multiples. I'm going to reiterate the 'hold' for BNB, but I am coming around on the idea of exposure at the right price.",ETH-USD|SOL-USD|BNB-USD,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-25 12:45:00

WAXP historical price sentiment WAX price history The WAX blockchain ecosystem was developed in 2017, with a launch price of $4.6083 on December 22, 2017, based on the EOS chain. 2018 saw a swift descent of the coin from $0.3914 at the start to $0.037 in December. In July 2019, WAX was trading at $0.0794, but soon it corrected down to its all-time low of $0.015 on December 30. In 2020, WAX’s price improved to a $0.0508 range by the mid-year following a slow ascent. 2021 proved a good year for WAX crypto, as it enjoyed positive sentiment from the cryptocurrency market and peaked at $0.681 in November. Strong corrections followed throughout 2022, as the token remained on a downward spiral for most of the year, reaching $0.0418. In 2023, WAXP was trading in a range of $0.039 to $0.082, shedding almost half of its value. Bullish markets of 2024 proved favorable for the token as it increased to $0.1 in March; however, the token followed a bearish route later during the year. WAX token entered 2025 in a corrective phase, reaching $0.0382 by the end of January and $0.0319 in February. In April, WAX observed a bottom price of $0.0166, while it turned bullish in May, touching $0.0277. The altcoin maintained its price levels during June and July, with periodic bullish episodes spiking to $0.0259. WAX remained in a downtrend in August and September, observing its all-time low of $0.0101 on October 10, and it is trading near $0.0132 at press time.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-25 12:46:06

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency carries a market capitalization of $476.9 billion, accounting for roughly 17% of the global crypto market cap, underscoring its dominance in the digital asset space. Despite edging 0.06% higher in the last 24 hours, ETH remains constrained below a key resistance zone that has capped gains for most of October. Institutional inflows and spot ETF optimism continue to reinforce long-term confidence, but short-term traders are treading carefully as Ethereum’s price coils within a tightening range, a structure that often precedes high-volatility breakouts. Institutional Adoption Fuels Long-Term Confidence Despite short-term hesitation, Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals remain solid, driven by institutional adoption and surging ETF inflows. Zach Friedman, Co-founder and CSO at Secure Digital Markets, noted that Ethereum’s next major price phase depends heavily on its growing integration with global finance. Ether Investors Should Closely Monitor ""Institutional Integration,"" Says Zach Friedman ( @Zcryptokid ) of Secure Digital Markets ( @SD_Markets ) https://t.co/uWSU0oDR3P @ForbesCrypto #Ethereum #Crypto #cryptocurrencies — Charles Lloyd Bovaird II (@CharlesLBovaird) October 24, 2025 ETH-based ETFs have recorded record inflows, while several major banks now accept Ethereum as loan collateral, marking a significant step toward mainstream financial utility. Over 35.7 million ETH, worth roughly $138 billion, are currently staked, reflecting investor conviction in Ethereum’s deflationary model and high yields. Friedman also highlighted the rapid expansion of Layer 2 scaling, stablecoin growth, and tokenization as long-term catalysts positioning Ethereum as a cornerstone of institutional portfolios. Ethereum Price Prediction – Technical Outlook Ethereum (ETH/USD) is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, a neutral pattern that often precedes major breakouts. The structure reflects tightening price action between converging trendlines – a clear sign of indecision among traders. ETH currently trades near $3,951, with firm support at $3,865 and resistance around $4,115, forming the key battleground for short-term direction. The 20-EMA and 50-EMA have flattened near $3,923, signaling reduced volatility but hinting at a potential bullish crossover. The RSI, now around 57, leans slightly positive, indicating gradual accumulation without entering overbought territory. A series of higher lows since mid-October supports the case for an upside move. Candlestick patterns show multiple spinning tops and Doji candles, reflecting market indecision before expansion. A decisive close above $4,115 could trigger momentum toward $4,298 and $4,550, where Fibonacci resistance aligns. Conversely, a breakdown below $3,865 may expose ETH to $3,712 or $3,510. Trade Setup: A breakout above $4,115 offers a long opportunity targeting $4,298 – $4,550, with stops below $3,865. A close under $3,865, however, would favor short setups toward $3,510. In summary, Ethereum’s triangle is nearing resolution. A breakout could validate institutional optimism and reignite the next leg higher, potentially lifting ETH toward $4,550 by early November.

Data from October 20–24 show that the firm’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, attracted $324.3 million in net inflows, signaling strong institutional appetite for the leading cryptocurrency despite recent market volatility. According to Coinglass data , BlackRock’s inflows fluctuated but maintained a dominant upward trend. The week began with a net outflow of $100.7 million on October 20, coinciding with mild weakness in Bitcoin’s price. However, investor sentiment quickly reversed as inflows surged to $210.9 million on October 21, marking a strong rebound that set the tone for the rest of the week. Momentum continued with $73.6 million added on October 22 and a further $107.8 million on October 23, reflecting renewed institutional accumulation. By October 24, inflows slowed to a more modest $32.7 million. Bitcoin ETF inflows chart. Source: Coinglass Bitcoin sustainable price The sustained capital injection from BlackRock has helped stabilize overall ETF market sentiment. While total spot Bitcoin ETF flows fluctuated, BlackRock’s consistent buying pressure more than offset the pullbacks, helping to prevent Bitcoin’s price from dropping below the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin now appears to be stabilizing above the $110,000 level. Momentum had weakened following the sharp market decline on October 10, but long-term demand remains solid, with analysts projecting bullish sentiment in the coming weeks. For instance, Tiger Research projects a $200,000 target for Bitcoin in Q4, despite rising volatility, citing continued market buying. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant highlighted the “dolphin” cohort, wallets holding 100 to 1,000 BTC, as a key indicator of Bitcoin’s structural demand. This group now holds 26% of Bitcoin’s total supply, with a significant year-over-year increase of 681,000 BTC in 2025. Bitcoin balance change by addresses.

However, Bitcoin remains comfortably above its 200-day SMA of $105,582, showing that the broader trend is still upward despite short-term consolidation. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 47.72, reinforcing a neutral sentiment as it hovers near the midpoint of the scale.

53621403,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=845237,1761396605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53621403.jpeg,Ontario will stop anti-tariff TV ads on Monday after Trump ends trade talks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/canada-to-end-anti-tariff-ad/,"The Premier of Ontario announced Friday that he will stop running television advertisements opposing American tariffs following President Donald Trump’s decision to cut off trade discussions with Canada. Doug Ford, who leads Canada’s biggest province, said he spoke with Prime Minister Mark Carney and chose to halt the advertising effort starting Monday. This move aims to get trade conversations back on track between the two countries. Trump said he was stopping “all trade negotiations” with Canada because of a television commercial paid for by Ontario. The advertisement used words from former President Ronald Reagan to speak against American tariffs. Ford explained in a public statement that the campaign accomplished what it set out to do by reaching important people in the United States. He said the goal was always to start discussions about what kind of economy Americans want and how tariffs affect workers and companies. The commercials will keep playing this weekend, including during the first World Series games between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ford told his staff to continue showing the message to Americans over the weekend so the commercial could run during the first two World Series games. The advertisement appeared on Friday night during the seventh inning when Fox showed Game 1 across the country. At that time, the Blue Jays were winning 11-4. Trump accuses Canada of using fake Ronald Reagan footage Trump wrote on Thursday that the Ronald Reagan Foundation announced Canada had used a fake advertisement that showed Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs. The president wrote, “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.” On Friday, Trump continued his criticism of the Ontario advertisements, stating that Canada was attempting to influence a forthcoming Supreme Court decision regarding his global tariff plan. Trump’s sudden call to end negotiations has made trade tensions worse between the neighboring countries that have been allies for many years. Carney said this week he wants to double his country’s sales to nations other than the United States because of the danger from Trump’s tariffs. Canadian officials stay ready to continue talks to lower tariffs in some areas, he said. Carney spoke Friday morning before getting on a plane to Asia, saying Canada cannot control American trade policy. He noted that policy has changed a lot since the 1980s, so Canada must focus on what it can control and accept what it cannot control. Carney is working to get a trade agreement with Trump, but tariffs are hurting the aluminum, steel, car, and lumber industries. White House spokesperson Kush Desai said talks with Canada have not made any helpful progress. Desai stated in a press release that Ontario’s taxpayer-funded advertisement campaign on American television networks incorrectly edited President Reagan’s 1987 radio address on trade. This shows how Canadian officials would rather play games than work with the administration. Desai added that President Trump made clear on Truth Social that more talks would be pointless if Canada cannot be serious. The Ontario government said it would spend approximately CA$75 million, which is equivalent to $54 million, to air the advertisements on various American television stations. The ads use audio and video of Reagan talking about tariffs in 1987. Canada is ready to resume trade negotiations when the US is prepared Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country is ready to start trade talks again “when the Americans are ready.” This came hours after Trump suddenly stopped negotiations between the two countries. American and Canadian negotiators were making progress in talks about the steel, aluminum, and energy industries, Carney said. He stated that Canada stands ready to continue that progress and build on it when Americans are ready to have those discussions. Kevin Hassett, a top White House economic adviser, had a different view Friday about how the discussions between America and Canada were going. Hassett said on Fox News that negotiations with the Canadians have not been very friendly and have not been going well. He thinks the president feels very frustrated with the situation. The dispute shows the ongoing challenges in trade relationships between the United States and Canada as both countries try to protect their economic interests while maintaining their long-standing partnership.

The easing inflation data in the U.S. has also pushed the global fund markets to strong results. Lipper data from LSEG showed that global equity funds recorded a net inflow of $11.03 billion this week, marking the strongest week since the start of October. The record inflows followed renewed hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump would meet with China’s Xi Jinping next week, which could secure new trade deals . Global equity funds post $11.03 billion in inflows this week The U.S. CPI rose 3.0% YoY in September, slightly below the projected 3.1%, supporting the hope that the Federal Reserve may reduce interest rates in the upcoming meeting starting Tuesday next week. The easing inflation data in the U.S. encouraged flows into the global equity funds market and risky assets. Cryptopolitan covered the CPI release yesterday, noting that the Core CPI, excluding food and energy prices, rose 0.2% month-over-month and 3.0% year-over-year, below the previous forecast of 0.3% and 3.1%, respectively. U.S. equity funds led in global inflows, adding approximately $9.65 billion after two consecutive weeks of outflows. Asian equity funds also recorded $2.81 billion in inflows following regained confidence in the region’s growth outlook. European funds, however, posted negative flows, recording $2.25 billion in outflows this week. Despite the negative flows in EU funds, local equity indexes, such as the FTSE, recorded new highs yesterday, buoyed by the easing U.S. inflation data released the previous day. Technology sector equities led the way in inflows, with $2.92 billion, marking the highest weekly inflow since early October. According to LSEG , investors poured $886 million into gold and precious metals equity funds and $891 million into the industrial sector. Gold and precious metals commodity funds posted their ninth straight week of inflows in the global market, totaling $7.16 billion, even as equities climbed. European equities, such as the STOXX 600 index, rose by 0.2% to an all-time high of 575.76. The FTSE 100 also recorded 0.7% growth today. The STOXX 600 gained over the week, following increased activity in consumer and energy stocks. Industrial and financial stocks led the Friday rally, with Lifco surging over 10% after surpassing third-quarter estimates. Saab stock rose by 6.1% following an upward revision of its annual sales forecast. LSEG group rose by 5% after brokerages raised price targets, and NatWest gained 4.9% following a higher Q3 profits result. Christoph Schon, head of investment decision research at SimCorp, stated that the rate expectations in the U.S. significantly impact global financial markets, and European share prices are reacting accordingly. Global funds brace for Fed decision with record bond buying The global bond market also attracted capital inflows, with $17.33 billion posted this week, according to LSEG data. This marks the 27th week of record inflows. Government bonds added $3.13 billion, while corporate bond funds added $1.78 billion. The euro-denominated bond funds recorded $3.2 billion in new investments. Money Market funds received $13.12 billion in new investments, reversing last week’s $7.02 billion outflows. This suggests that while the broad sentiment favors risky assets, investors remain uncertain about upcoming market trends. For a third consecutive week, bond funds attracted $1.2 billion in emerging markets. In comparison, equity funds saw $440 million in outflows. This means there is a consistent caution among investors facing volatility in developing economies and currency fluctuations. Investors await next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting, where a 25-basis-point rate cut is widely anticipated. As of Friday, the CME FedWatch Tool showed a 96.7% probability of a rate cut.

However, an interesting trend has emerged as investors try to navigate current market conditions—a shift to Digitap ($TAP) . $TAP, at the intersection of traditional banking and DeFi, has become a new favorite among investors. Dubbed the best new crypto to invest in 2025, its innovative solution in the cross-border payments market is making headlines. By allowing users to spend crypto like cash and fully integrating with Google Pay and Apple Pay for a seamless tap-to-pay experience, it is a game-changer. Are bulls tired as the Ethereum price struggles to break out? The Ethereum price hovers around $3,800. Its underwhelming performance—a 7% slide on its 30-day chart—continues. However, just as further downtrends cannot be ruled out, a rebound is also on the table. Bulls losing current support could push the Ethereum price toward $3,500. However, a jump above $4,000 tells a different story. It might be the start of a significant reversal. Crypto analyst Candy believes that as long as the Ethereum price stays above $3,600 and $3,800, it may retest $4,700 . The possibility of ETH reaching a new all-time high was also highlighted. XRP Ripple to retest lower price levels? Traders advised to exercise caution The XRP price, struggling to break out, hovers around $2.3. It dipped by 15% on its monthly chart, alongside a 23% drop on the 90-day timeframe, giving XRP Ripple a bearish outlook. With momentum declining, alongside the stalling price, traders are advised to exercise caution. Gainz2theMax , a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), believes a dip below current support could push XRP Ripple lower. However, analysts like Cryptoinsightuk hold a bullish stance. According to them, a break to the upside will push XRP Ripple toward a minimum target of $3.40 . Bullish catalysts to watch out for are the SEC’s approval of an ETF and a Fed rate cut this October. Digitap: Seamless tap-to-pay drive bullish forecasts – The best new crypto to buy now? Digitap , fulfilling its roadmap, recently launched its global money app. Aiming to put the world’s money in users’ pockets—crypto, fiat, and everything in between—it is a secure platform that unites the flexibility of crypto with the reliability of traditional banking. Given its real-world application and impending mainstream adoption, experts consider it this year’s best cryptocurrency investment. In addition to offering users the freedom to move and manage assets across currencies, blockchains, and borders, its seamless tap-to-pay experience is a game-changer. But first, it is worth noting how onboarding users to crypto can be complex and intimidating. But with Digitap, crypto can be spent like cash—its integration with Google Pay and Apple Pay enables tap-to-pay on phones. Considering how it solves universal money problems, demand has been skyrocketing. Also worth noting is how early funding quickly surpassed $1 million, outperforming other ICOs and indicating significant market interest. That isn’t all: the price also surged by 55% from $0.0125 to $0.0194. With a 40x gain projected before the end of the year, it is among the best altcoins to invest in for substantial returns on investment.

Pundit Says They Didn’t Chose XRP By Accident,https://timestabloid.com/feds-documents-mention-ripple-pundit-says-they-didnt-chose-xrp-by-accident/,"When a reference to Ripple and XRP appears in the documentation of the world’s most powerful central bank, it sends shockwaves through both the financial and crypto sectors. The Federal Reserve, which sets the tone for global monetary policy, has long been exploring the modernization of payment systems. Now, fresh attention is falling on its own materials that reportedly mention Ripple and the XRP Ledger in discussions related to real-time settlement, payment access, and cross-border liquidity. Ripple Bull Winkle, a well-known voice in the XRP community, drew widespread attention after sharing a video clip on X claiming that the Federal Reserve had confirmed Ripple’s inclusion within its internal documentation. “Brace yourselves, everyone, it is official,” he said. “You see on your screen the Federal Reserve, yes, the Fed, they confirm that they are indeed working with Ripple in their own documentation.” His statement immediately reignited speculation that the central bank’s modernization efforts may be leaning toward Ripple’s blockchain technology. The Fed’s own documents mention Ripple. Payment access. Real-time settlement. Cross-border corridors. They didn’t choose $XRP by accident — they chose it because it works. The bridge between banks and blockchain is now official. pic.twitter.com/bzQcSHonMm — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 24, 2025 Ripple’s Role in Modern Payment Infrastructure The Federal Reserve has spent years exploring technologies that can support faster, more efficient, and more inclusive payment systems. Ripple has consistently been part of that dialogue. The company has participated in public consultations with the Fed, particularly around instant payment systems like FedNow and the broader Faster Payments Task Force. In these discussions, Ripple highlighted the XRP Ledger’s ability to enable real-time, cross-border transactions at minimal cost, using XRP as a neutral bridge asset between currencies. Publicly available Fed documents and responses to policy requests show Ripple’s involvement and mention XRP as part of broader technological solutions for instant settlement. These references do not constitute a direct endorsement or contract, but they confirm that Ripple’s innovations are being studied as viable components within the Fed’s future-facing payment framework. Why the Fed’s Mention of Ripple Matters For decades, cross-border payments have been plagued by inefficiencies, slow transfer times, fragmented liquidity pools, and high costs for remittances and institutional transfers alike. Ripple’s technology was specifically designed to address these shortcomings . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By offering real-time settlement, liquidity sourcing through XRP, and interoperability between banks, Ripple provides a ready-made model that aligns with the Fed’s stated goal of achieving faster, safer, and more accessible payments. As Ripple Bull Winkle put it, “This same institution that sets global monetary policy aligned with a company building on top of XRP in the XRP ledger. They didn’t pick Ripple by chance; they picked it because XRP’s design solves the problem they actually created: fractured liquidity, slow rails, and outdated settlement.” His comment captures a growing sentiment that Ripple’s technology is no longer peripheral to the financial system; it is part of the conversation shaping its evolution. Implications for XRP and Global Finance Although the Fed’s mention of Ripple does not confirm a direct partnership or operational deployment, it signifies something equally important: legitimacy. Ripple’s inclusion in official central banking discourse underscores how blockchain-based solutions are now being recognized at the highest institutional levels. It suggests that XRP’s utility, as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain ecosystems, is being taken seriously within regulatory and policy circles. If the momentum continues, Ripple’s technology could become integral to the next generation of financial infrastructure, helping institutions transition from legacy systems to blockchain-powered rails. As Ripple Bull Winkle aptly summarized, “They didn’t choose XRP by accident, they chose it because it works.” In a world where the boundaries between traditional banking and decentralized finance are rapidly fading, the Federal Reserve’s recognition of Ripple marks a pivotal moment in that convergence, a moment that could redefine the flow of money across borders for years to come.

Speaking from his office overlooking the White House, Scott said the administration’s goal is that:- “We want the most America-first policies that are possible, without incurring market wrath. The financial elite are exaggerating risks and ignoring results.” Over the past nine months, Scott has championed tariffs, backed Trump’s attempt to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, and unleashed tons of deregulation and tax cuts. Scott’s policies have also loosened crypto rules and encouraged the use of stablecoins, while vowing to use the Internal Revenue Service to investigate left-leaning organizations accused of fueling political unrest, including groups tied to George Soros, the billionaire Scott once worked for. Scott pushes Trump’s playbook from Treasury to Argentina Abroad, Scott is leading a multibillion-dollar U.S. bailout for Argentina , aimed at supporting President Javier Milei, Trump’s libertarian ally in Latin America. The deal effectively places Scott on the U.S. government’s side of a massive currency trade, something he and Soros famously thrived on as investors when they broke the British pound. It’s a little poetic, isn’t it? Scott’s is playing the same game, just with America’s balance sheet now. Meanwhile, Scott said his philosophy differs from predecessors like Steven Mnuchin. “Unlike most of my predecessors, I have a very healthy scepticism of elite institutions and elite opinion, whereas I think they didn’t. But I have a healthy regard for the market,” he said. He added that populist governments fail when they “don’t respect the market… you’ve got to respect the market.” Within the administration, Scott’s style has made him one of Trump’s closest allies. Republican Senator David McCormick said, “I was just with Trump and he was talking about Bessent, and I think he’s got a huge amount of faith in him. He’s viewed as a voice of reason… someone who gets it done.” Markets steady as Scott defends trade war and fights critics Critics inside Washington see things differently. As Cryptopolitan previously reported, some former Treasury officials warn that Scott has made the department too political, saying its credibility with investors could “lose value that’s worth its weight in gold.” They accuse him of frittering away the Treasury’s market trust “at a rapid clip.” Still, despite trade wars and tariff fights, Scott has managed to steady markets that many expected to crumble. Since he took office on January 28, the S&P 500 has gained roughly 12%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped by more than half a percentage point, sitting near 4%. That’s not what critics predicted when Trump reignited global tariff battles in April . “He is straddling this line between appeasing Trump and appeasing the markets. And so far, he’s made it work,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha. Scott, always blunt, responded: “Where the hell is the market risk? They’ve just been wrong.” When Trump’s so-called “liberation day tariffs” triggered panic in April, Scott spent days calling top fund managers, calming nerves while Trump paused some of the highest duties. He later explained that the president had always intended to use tariffs as leverage: “He has a higher risk tolerance than I do.” On Wall Street, Scott is seen as a rare buffer against Trump’s impulsive moves — like convincing the president not to fire Fed Chair Jay Powell before his term ends. Still, his tenure hasn’t been short of drama. One clash turned physical with Elon Musk, who bankrolled Trump’s campaign and was even called the country’s First Buddy by the president and his inner circle. Another close call for Scott happened with Billy Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. “When it counts, he’s a fighter in our corner,” said one Wall Street lobbyist. “It’s almost like this ‘Bessent put.’ He knows not to go too far where markets would be disrupted… CEOs are fearful of the administration, but Bessent is our id.” Dollar drops as Scott shrugs off Wall Street’s panic Not everyone shares that confidence. Stephen Myrow, managing partner at Beacon Policy Advisors and a former Treasury official, said, “Mnuchin was still trying to be a guardrail, but if markets are looking for Bessent to be a guardrail, they’re asking too much. Bessent has no problem being political, which eventually could run a risk with the market.” That risk might already be showing. The U.S. dollar has fallen 8% since Scott took over the Treasury. He insists it will rebound as trade deficits shrink. Democrats, meanwhile, say the decline shows the market’s growing doubts about the U.S. economy. “I was in New York two weeks ago meeting with a bunch of bankers, and one of them said to me that for the first time in his career, he’s hearing people talking about hedging the dollar,” said Sean Casten, an Illinois Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. “This is insane.” Through it all, Scott has dismissed Wall Street’s panic as nothing but “continuous whining.” He believes investors are underestimating how calculated Trump’s approach is. “Where’s the crisis?” Scott asked, mockingly looking around. “I don’t see it.” Don’t just read crypto news.

According to the company's social media post, approximately 62,000 BTC have been moved from long-dormant wallets since mid-October. Glassnode noted that this has increased the supply in the market, making it harder for prices to rise: The dormant supply of Bitcoin has begun to dwindle. Without strong new demand, any upward movement in prices will encounter further resistance. Stagnant supply was seen as the primary driver of price increases in the current cycle. However, a reversal in this trend risks weakening market momentum. According to Glassnode, a similar supply reversal occurred in January 2024, resulting in a massive outflow of 400,000 BTC, causing a loss of momentum. While the current shift is more subtle, the trend is striking.

While whale wallets have seen a steady increase over the past 30 days, no major sell-off has been seen since October 15th. In contrast, wallets holding between 0.1 and 10 BTC (approximately $10,000-$1 million) have been net sellers for the past year. Momentum investors have withdrawn from the market, and buyback funds haven't generated enough demand to counter the selling pressure. Glassnode argued that this supply-demand imbalance will continue to suppress prices if new buyers do not enter the market. *This is not investment advice.

(BNKK) has made its first large purchase of $32 million worth of BONK. The purchase marks the company’s largest acquisition of the Solana-based coin to date. The Nasdaq-listed company currently owns approximately 3% of the token’s total supply. According to Arkham Intelligence data, Bonk Holdings Inc. has just received 2.26 trillion BONK tokens, valued at $32.7 million. The holdings are secured in a Solana Squad Multisig wallet, which ensures multi-signature control and institutional-grade transparency.

Bonk Holdings announces plans to double its holding This acquisition officially establishes the firm as the first BONK digital asset treasury (DAT). The company also revealed plans to double its holdings in the near future. Previously, the company announced that it aims to accumulate 5% of the BONK circulating supply by the end of the year. Jarrett Boon, the CEO of the firm, expressed his excitement for the company’s strategy. “ We are deeply integrating our public company with a proven, revenue-generating leader in the digital asset space. We are confident this model will unlock significant long-term value for our shareholders,” he said. Bonk Holdings’ crypto move ties with its 10% revenue-sharing interest in BONK.fun, a decentralized platform. BONK.fun has experienced peak activity, with 20,000 token launches and daily trading volumes above $100 million, proving steady revenue generation potential. The company, previously named Safety Shot, rebranded as Bonk Holdings Inc. and adopted the Nasdaq ticker symbol BNKK on October 10, 2025. The firm stated that the shift was an important way for it to provide “clarity” about the brand as it looks to “evolve” its plans and “sell off any unnecessary assets.” Additionally, in September, Sharps Technology announced that it would stake a portion of its 2 million SOL holdings in BonkSOL, the platform’s liquid staking token (LST), backed by Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. Bonk Inc. is just one of many digital asset treasury companies, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy leading the way, boasting over $77 billion in Bitcoin. Prominent Ethereum treasury company SharpLink claims to be using its ETH holdings to generate yield through staking and is actively exploring additional yield-bearing options. Meanwhile, the company’s stock has climbed nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, but it remains down more than 15% over the past month. BONK shows signs of stability after October’s drop The Solana-based meme coin is experiencing a period of mixed market signals as traders closely monitor its price. According to analysts, this could mean that the downturn is about to stop. Market traders are trying to determine whether the coin is preparing for another rally or further consolidation. According to CoinMarketCap, Bonk is trading in a mid-range area, with support at $0.00001054 and resistance near $0.0000187. However, declining trading volumes have added to the pressure, indicating that investors are being cautious. Investors are looking out for the one trillion token burn. But analysts caution that while a rebound is possible, sustained growth will depend on renewed trading interest and positive market catalysts. Meanwhile, investors in the market are waiting to see if Bonk can maintain its current level or if it will likely fall back to lower support. The coin is steady, currently trading at 0.00001466.

Given his election campaign and the countless pro-crypto promises he made, including firing then-SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who led the war against the industry and Ripple in particular, it was evident that the winds would shift substantially, especially for US-based companies. The Brad Garlinghouse-led entity has been at the forefront of beneficieries, mostly since the tides at the SEC changed and the four-year-long battle between the two sides finally concluded in a positive way for Ripple. But even before the end of the lawsuit, the company had started to make some bold acquisition moves, and Garlinghouse acknowledged them on Friday in a post on X. With today’s close of Hidden Road (now Ripple Prime), Ripple has announced 5 major acquisitions in ~2 years (GTreasury last week, Rail in August, Standard Custody in 2024, Metaco in 2023). As we continue to build solutions towards enabling an Internet of Value – I’m reminding you… https://t.co/O5Uub7ulw9 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) October 24, 2025 5 Big Purchases It all started in May 2023 with a $250 million deal to acquire Metaco, a Swiss-based crypto custody provider. It allowed Ripple to enhance its enterprise offerings, providing customers with the technology to custody, issue, and settle any tokenized assets. Less than a year later, another purchase made the headlines when Ripple’s President, Monica Long, outlined the acquisition of Standard Custody & Trust Company, an enterprise-grade regulated platform for cryptocurrencies. Then came 2025, when the number of deals skyrocketed to three (so far). Rail, a platform built to help businesses move money with speed, transparency, and trust using stablecoins and fiat together, was bought for $200 million. Aside from highlighting plans to create its own billion-dollar treasury company, Ripple also acquired the treasury software provider GTreasury for $1 billion to strengthen corporate finance relationships. The most expensive was the purchase of the prime broker Hidden Road. Although it was initially announced in April, the deal became official earlier this week, and the platform is now known as Ripple Prime. “We’re pleased to share that our acquisition of Hidden Road is officially complete, making Ripple the first crypto company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker – bringing the promise of digital assets to institutional customers at scale,” reads the firm’s statement. XRP Impact? The XRP Army rejoiced with each purchase and the SEC lawsuit conclusion, but some questioned the positive effects on the underlying asset, which peaked in July but has dropped by roughly 30% since then. CryptoSensei directly asked Garlinghouse about XRP’s role in the overall Ripple infrastructure, especially since the introduction of the project’s stablecoin (RLUSD) at the end of last year. Brad, many in the XRP community are trying to understand how the clearing and settlement process will work now that Ripple has integrated Hidden Road under Ripple Prime. We’ve heard RLUSD mentioned as the core settlement asset — but is that RLUSD operating on the XRP Ledger or… — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) October 24, 2025 Another user tried to explain that XRP is used for liquidity, and its true purpose is to serve as a liquidity pool. A higher USD valuation would make it easier to complete transactions in seconds, having to use less XRP. RLUSD is backed in a one-to-one ratio with the greenback, but it doesn’t solve the liquidity problem, the user said .

Senior U.S. officials said the Trump administration aims to unlock the region’s resources to foster more investments in the U.S. and establish sustainable supply chains for global industries. Zafrul Aziz, Malaysia’s Investment, Trade, and Industry Minister, says a deal with the Trump administration is possible. He briefly mentioned that his country has been in talks with the world’s superpower over a potential minerals deal . The U.S. president is expected to visit Malaysia for the Asian Nations summit before heading to Japan and later South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. It will all be capped by a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders. Trump recently touted his expectation of a fantastic trade deal with China by the end of the month, as reported by Cryptopolitan. The U.S. president said talks are heading in the right direction, and he expects a comprehensive agreement to be reached, despite the tense standoff between the two countries and ongoing threats over tariffs and rare-earth minerals. Aziz negotiates for chips to be spared from Trump’s tariffs The Investment, Trade, and Industry Minister pleaded with the Trump administration to spare chips from Trump’s tariffs, leaving them at zero, as Malaysia prepares to ink a trade deal with the U.S. on October 26. He emphasized that this is a key market for his country, stating that he hopes the chip market remains as it is. Malaysia was slapped with a 19% tariff rate for exports to the U.S., and Trump is reportedly mulling tariffs on semiconductors of up to 300%. However, the world’s sixth-largest chip exporter is strongly against the exorbitant tariffs because the U.S. is its third-largest market for semiconductor exports. Aziz expressed Malaysia’s ambitions in mining and processing rare earth minerals to tap growing demand for minerals powering EVs, green technologies like lithium batteries, and electronic devices. He disclosed that his country already plans to continue engaging firms from the U.S., China, Korea, and Japan to support its ambitions. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said earlier this month that the sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd. will partner with other global firms in the downstream processing of rare earths. Bessent claims the Trump-Xi meeting will be a pull-aside U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday that the anticipated talk between Trump and Xi in South Korea will be a “pull-aside”, implying that it will not be a formal meeting. However, Trump later contradicted the Treasury Secretary, saying that he and Xi would have a lengthy discussion to iron out all the issues. China has not confirmed any plans for a meeting. According to Reuters, neither side expects a breakthrough from the Trump-Xi meeting that would restore the terms of trade that existed before Trump’s second term. However, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 155% on Chinese imports starting on November 1 if no agreement is reached at the meeting. The two sides are reportedly preparing for a meeting focused on modest improvements and managing disagreements. An interim deal could possibly include an extension of current rates, limited relief on tariffs, or China pledging to buy U.S. Boeing airplanes and soybeans. Meanwhile, the U.S. could allow more high-end computer chip exports to China, which could loosen Trump’s controls on the rare earth magnets that have angered him. Or, nothing will come of the discussions at all. Mira Rapp-Hopper, a former official in the Biden administration and visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, also noted that Trump’s Asia policies are characterized by intense pressure on defense spending and countries’ trade policies. She believes the most critical question during his Asia trip is who the U.S. stands with, and what it stands for. Get seen where it counts.

Analyst Identifies Potential ‘Double Top’ Pattern,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-bull-cycle-potential-double-top-pattern/,"The cryptocurrency market has not had its typical “Uptober” performance so far this month, with most large-cap assets falling to new local lows in the past few months. The Ethereum price, which was on the verge of hitting $5,000 a few weeks ago, is now languishing below the $4,000 mark. While the “king of altcoins” had a stop-start performance over the past week, its price seems to be in a better place than it was seven days ago. However, an interesting outlook has emerged for the Ethereum price, with the altcoin believed to have already reached its peak in this cycle. How Feasible Is A Double Top For ETH Price? Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently took to the social media platform X to share insights into the current setup of the Ethereum price. According to the market pundit, the second-largest cryptocurrency could be in for an extended bearish period over the next few weeks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bears Tighten Grip, But This Support Zone Hints At A Potential Reversal This evaluation revolves around the potential formation of the “double top” pattern on the 3-day timeframe of the Ethereum chart. For context, the double top formation is a technical analysis pattern suggesting a possible bearish trend reversal after an asset’s price touches a resistance level without breaking through. As observed in the chart above, the initial top came around late 2021 during the altcoin season when the price of ETH rose to the then-all-time high of above $4,800. This price peak was followed by a market crash, which saw the value of Ethereum drop to around the $1,000 mark by mid-2026. Meanwhile, the purported second top of this Ethereum price setup is the current all-time high of $4,946, reached earlier in August 2025. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin’s value is currently more than 20% adrift from this record high. While the two tops (nearly four years) look somewhat identical, the price action between them makes it tricky to definitively call them a “double top” pattern. Moreover, the double top can only be confirmed when the price drops below the support level, which typically is the lowest point between the two peaks. This support level would then be at around $1,000, which is a significant distance from the current price point. Nevertheless, it is important to pay attention to the price movement of ETH over the next few weeks, as it could provide insight into the coin’s future relative to this setup. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $3,983, reflecting an almost 3% jump in the past 24 hours.

Crypto analyst SMQKE reports that Teucrium’s CEO believes Ripple is building a “new Wall Street” through its acquisition of Hidden Road, now Ripple Prime. Beyond cross-border payments, Ripple’s rapidly expanding roadmap signals an ambitious push to redefine institutional finance. Ripple has long positioned XRP as a high-performance liquidity asset, capable of settling transactions in seconds at a fraction of traditional costs. But today, the spotlight is on Ripple’s expanding institutional ecosystem. The completed acquisition of Ripple Prime, a fast-growing non-bank prime broker, marks a major leap in regulated access to digital assets. With secure global custody and streamlined brokerage infrastructure, Ripple Prime removes friction for hedge funds, asset managers, and other major market participants. Together, it accelerates XRP’s path from cross-border utility token to a core pillar of institutional finance. Teucrium’s CEO argues Ripple isn’t just improving payments, it’s modernizing capital markets. Legacy settlement systems still depend on slow intermediaries and fragmented liquidity, creating friction across global finance. Notably, Ripple is directly attacking that inefficiency with real-time settlement, tokenized assets, and infrastructure that seamlessly connects traditional markets to digital rails, a shift poised to redefine how value moves worldwide. Why is this development worth a keen eye? Well, the reference to a “new Wall Street” isn’t just a metaphor, it’s a bold ambition. Ripple aims to redefine global finance with infrastructure that enables instant value transfer, unified liquidity, and transparent institutional markets operating at speeds legacy systems can’t match. At the center of this redesign is XRP. Purpose-built as a neutral, efficient settlement asset, XRP allows capital to move seamlessly across borders without the friction of correspondent banking. As more financial institutions adopt blockchain to reduce cost, risk, and settlement delays, XRP’s utility continues to accelerate, and so does the momentum behind Ripple’s vision. XRP Enters Elliott Wave 5: Bullish Momentum Builds Above Key $2.45 Level XRP is flashing a powerful bullish signal as it enters what market analyst Bit Guru describes as the 5th wave of a developing Elliott Wave pattern, typically the phase where strong upside acceleration materializes. With price action currently holding above the crucial $2.45 support and trading around $2.58, bullish momentum appears to be gaining traction at a pivotal time for the digital asset. According to the Elliott Wave model, a core framework in technical analysis—bull markets typically unfold in five powerful waves. XRP appears to have completed its corrective phase and is now entering its decisive fifth wave, where breakout momentum historically accelerates. As a result, Bit Guru notes that holding support above $2.45 is crucial because maintaining this level would validate the bullish wave structure and keep XRP on track for a continued upward surge. Notably, a breakout above $2.50 puts XRP on track for a $2.70–$3.00 target zone, aligned with key Fibonacci 5th-wave extensions. A decisive close above $2.70 could unlock multi-month highs and spark renewed momentum across the XRP market. Conclusion Ripple’s integration of Ripple Prime and its mission to anchor XRP at the center of institutional settlement signal a future where global markets move with unmatched speed, transparency, and efficiency. Wall Street’s transformation won’t be instant, but the shift is already underway. Meanwhile, with XRP holding strong above the $2.45 support and powering into its 5th Elliott Wave, bullish momentum is rapidly building. All eyes are now on the critical $2.70 breakout, a move that could trigger a new phase of price discovery and accelerate XRP’s broader market resurgence.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-25 13:40:13

Recent data reveals a phenomenal surge in stablecoin payments , signaling a pivotal shift in global transactions and commerce. This rapid adoption is reshaping the landscape for businesses and individuals alike, promising efficiency and accessibility. The Remarkable Surge in Stablecoin Payments : A Post-GENIUS Act Phenomenon In a significant development, the volume of stablecoin payments in the U.S. has skyrocketed by approximately 70% in just six months. This impressive growth follows the implementation of the U.S. GENIUS Act, a landmark stablecoin regulation law. According to a report by Bloomberg , citing data from analytics firm Artemis , the total volume of stablecoins used for real-world payments and remittances surpassed an astounding $10 billion by August. This figure represents a substantial leap from the $6 billion recorded in February. It underscores the profound impact of regulatory clarity and technological advancements. The GENIUS Act has evidently provided the necessary framework to foster confidence and drive this accelerated adoption. Why are Stablecoin Payments Gaining Such Traction? The primary catalyst behind this surge lies in the inherent advantages stablecoins offer over traditional payment methods. Business-to-business (B2B) transactions, for instance, account for a significant two-thirds of the total volume, reaching $6.4 billion monthly. Companies are increasingly turning to stablecoins for several compelling reasons: Faster Processing Times: International payments, which often take days through conventional banking channels, can be settled in minutes with stablecoins. Lower Costs: Transaction fees, especially for cross-border transfers, are significantly reduced compared to traditional banking fees. Enhanced Efficiency: The seamless, always-on nature of blockchain networks allows for payments outside of traditional banking hours. Consequently, these practical benefits are accelerating the adoption of stablecoins, particularly for global remittances and supply chain finance. Businesses are finding tangible value in this innovative payment infrastructure. What Role Does the Banking Sector Play in Expanding Stablecoin Payments ? The growing interest isn’t confined to the crypto-native space; traditional financial institutions are also taking notice. The banking sector, recognizing the efficiency of stablecoins, is beginning to explore their integration into existing services. A prime example is Zelle , a prominent U.S. online remittance service. Zelle is reportedly planning to leverage stablecoins as a foundational payment infrastructure for its future international remittance functions. This strategic move highlights a significant validation of stablecoin technology from a mainstream financial player. It suggests a future where traditional finance and decentralized finance become increasingly blurred, benefiting consumers with more efficient and affordable options for sending money globally. The Future of Global Transactions with Stablecoin Payments The impressive growth in stablecoin payments signifies more than just a trend; it points to a fundamental shift in how we perceive and execute financial transactions. The combination of regulatory support, technological efficiency, and growing institutional interest creates a powerful momentum. As stablecoins continue to mature and gain wider acceptance, we can anticipate even greater innovation in areas like micropayments, international trade, and digital commerce. The journey toward a more interconnected and efficient global financial system is well underway, with stablecoins playing a crucial role. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping stablecoin adoption and its impact on global payments . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the GENIUS Act and how does it relate to stablecoin payments? A: The GENIUS Act is a recently passed U.S. regulation specifically designed to provide a legal framework for stablecoins. Its implementation has brought regulatory clarity, which in turn has fostered confidence and significantly boosted the adoption and volume of stablecoin payments by making their use more secure and predictable. Q2: How do stablecoin payments offer faster processing times and lower costs? A: Stablecoins operate on blockchain technology, which allows for peer-to-peer transactions that bypass traditional banking intermediaries. This direct transfer mechanism reduces the number of steps involved, enabling near-instantaneous settlement, often within minutes, and significantly cutting down on the fees typically associated with international wire transfers. Q3: Which sectors are primarily driving the increase in stablecoin payment volume? A: The latest data, reported by Bloomberg and Artemis , indicates that business-to-business (B2B) transactions are the primary drivers, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the total stablecoin payment volume. These businesses leverage stablecoins for their efficiency in cross-border payments, supply chain finance, and general operational cost savings. Q4: How is the traditional banking sector, like Zelle, integrating stablecoins? A: Traditional financial services are exploring stablecoins as a new infrastructure layer. For example, Zelle is reportedly considering using stablecoins to power its future international remittance functions. This integration would allow them to offer faster and potentially cheaper global money transfer services to their users, blending traditional reach with blockchain efficiency.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-dont-blink-or-youll-miss-it-heres-why/,"Financial markets rarely announce their turning points; they reveal them in sudden surges of price , policy, and purpose. For XRP, those elements are aligning once again. The token has regained its spotlight with a remarkable price rebound, a wave of institutional optimism, and increasing attention from regulators and central banks. CryptoSensei, a popular market commentator, captured the sentiment perfectly in a recent X post, warning investors not to “blink” as the biggest financial opportunity of this era could unfold faster than expected. XRP’s Market Momentum Gains Strength XRP currently trades around $2.50, according to data from CoinMarketCap, with a market capitalization exceeding $150 billion and daily trading volumes topping $4 billion. The chart reveals a striking upward trajectory through 2024 and 2025, placing the asset near its strongest level since the 2018 cycle peak. Analysts note that the token’s resurgence coincides with a renewed interest in blockchain-based settlement solutions among retail and institutional investors. The biggest financial opportunity of our lifetime is right in front of you… don’t blink or you’ll miss it. #XRP pic.twitter.com/KflLa64NVh — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) October 24, 2025 The breakout follows months of sideways accumulation, suggesting that market participants were positioning for a decisive move. Technical indicators show XRP holding key support levels above $2.20, while traders anticipate a potential retest of the $3 region, a zone last reached during the early-2025 rally. The combination of exceeding liquidity, a rising holder count (now over 480, underscoring), and sustained market cap growth underlines growing confidence in the asset’s long-term fundamentals. Regulatory Tailwinds and Institutional Alignment Beyond market activity, policy developments are shaping a new environment favorable to Ripple and the XRP ecosystem. The U.S. Federal Reserve has been exploring distributed ledger technologies for faster cross-border settlement , with public documents confirming Ripple’s participation in related pilot discussions. This marks a major shift from the uncertain legal climate that previously constrained XRP’s adoption potential. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s compliance-first strategy now places it in closer alignment with financial regulators. Its recent advancements, including the rollout of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin, are designed to anchor blockchain settlement within regulated financial systems. The company’s pursuit of a national banking charter and potential master account access at the Federal Reserve indicates a serious move toward institutional-grade integration. If successful, these efforts could cement Ripple’s infrastructure as part of the global financial backbone, granting XRP unprecedented real-world utility beyond speculative trading. Why This Moment Matters for XRP Holders CryptoSensei’s message to investors isn’t mere hype; it reflects a convergence of conditions rarely seen in digital asset markets. XRP stands at the intersection of regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and technological maturity. The token’s fundamentals have improved dramatically, while Ripple’s strategic partnerships and product expansion into stablecoins, banking, and payments have opened new use cases that can sustain long-term demand. Still, opportunity comes with caution. While bullish momentum suggests further upside potential, rapid market corrections remain a reality. Investors are urged to balance optimism with discipline, monitor liquidity trends, and stay alert to both macroeconomic signals and policy updates. As CryptoSensei aptly warned, this could be one of those fleeting financial windows where fortunes are made or missed in a blink. For XRP holders, every data point, chart move, and policy headline now carries amplified significance, and missing the next move might mean missing the moment altogether.

Meme season 2025 is not a joke; it’s a market movement. The hunt for the best crypto presales with 100x potential has turned investors into predators sniffing for the next explosive token. Right now, BullZilla ($BZIL) sits at Stage 7 (7-D), raising over $960 K with 31 B tokens sold and an ROI above 2,738 %. Its price climbs by $100 for every $100K raised or every 48 hours elapsed. Every minute delay means a higher entry price and a louder roar missed. 1. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Cinematic Giant of Presales BullZilla is part meme, part mechanism, a cinematic beast forged on Ethereum. Counted among the best crypto presales with 100x potential , its progressive price engine, Roar Burn mechanism, and 70 % APY HODL Furnace make it a living ecosystem. Backed by the 24-chapter “Lore Bible,” each phase burns supply and cements loyalty. Tokenomics stay balanced: 50 % presale, 20 % staking, 20 % vault, 5 % burn, 5 % team, a design that keeps holders rewarded and the market hungry. Its presale structure has become a case study in momentum. At $0.00018573 per token, Stage 7 participants are locking in profits long before launch. The price jumps 3.59% in Stage 8A and ultimately targets a listing price of $0.00527, delivering potential returns that even early Dogecoin believers would envy. Investment Scenario: Turning $45 K into a Blockbuster Bag Imagine entering Stage 7D with $45,000. That buys around 242 million BZIL tokens. When BullZilla lists at $0.00527, that bag could grow to $1.27 million, a massive 2,738% ROI. Early-stage holders already sit on gains exceeding 3,130 %. With price updates every 48 hours and a solid Ethereum foundation, BullZilla’s roar isn’t noise; it’s proof of traction that keeps buyers coming back for the next surge. The Bag Signal’s Flashing Green, Grab Your $BZIL at $0.00018573 Before Stage 8A! Frequently Asked Questions About BullZilla Presale What makes BullZilla different from other tokens? BullZilla combines deflationary mechanics, staking rewards, and cinematic storytelling to build a sustainable ecosystem. Its tokenomics generate ongoing demand and real investor utility, setting it apart from short-lived, hype-driven crypto projects. How does the Roar Burn benefit investors? The Roar Burn permanently destroys tokens after each transaction and milestone, reducing supply and increasing scarcity. This system enhances long-term price stability and rewards holders through measurable, automatic value appreciation over time. Is BullZilla’s presale still open for new buyers? Yes, BullZilla’s Stage 7D presale is live with automatic price hikes every $100K raised or 48 hours passed. Early investors secure stronger ROI potential before the next presale phase launches. 2. Bonk ($BONK): Solana’s Playful Power Token Bonk started as Solana’s comic relief but has since become a liquidity driver for the entire ecosystem. Its integration with DEXs and NFT platforms revived Solana activity and proved community tokens can spark real utility. Now trading in the top 50 by volume, Bonk fuels payments, airdrops, and DEX rewards across Solana’s web3 layer. Analysts cite its ongoing burn program and developer fund as key reasons it’s retaining relevance beyond meme status. 3. MoonBull ($MOBU): Where Math Meets Meme MoonBull is the thinker’s meme, a hybrid of humor and tokenomics. Its 23-stage presale and 95 % APY staking pool make it both fun and financially savvy. Deployed on Ethereum, it combines scarcity burns with community voting from Stage 12 onward. By turning presales into participation models, MoonBull lets holders vote on funding and marketing plans. It’s proof that a meme can be a movement when its math makes sense. Frequently Asked Questions About MoonBull How does MoonBull keep investors engaged? MoonBull keeps its community active through staking, referrals, and on-chain voting rights. Holders earn continuous rewards while influencing future upgrades, creating a participatory investment experience that blends fun, function, and sustained value. Why do analysts call MoonBull a “meme with mechanics”? Because MoonBull merges humor with hard math. Its deflationary structure, governance features, and staking systems add institutional-grade fundamentals to entertainment-driven crypto, offering disciplined economics beneath its creative community narrative. 4. La Culex ($CULEX): The Smart Stinger of Yield Farms La Culex buzzes with precision. Its Hive Vault offers an 80 % APY while maintaining zero transaction taxes, a rare combo for a meme asset. Out of its 200 B token supply, 45 % is dedicated to presale and 20 % to liquidity. Developers locked liquidity for 18 months to build trust. The project focuses on community rewards and steady growth, avoiding flash pump-and-dump cycles that hurt the meme sector in past cycles. Frequently Asked Questions About La Culex What makes La Culex different from older projects? La Culex’s zero-tax trades, locked liquidity, and transparent token structure promote stability and investor safety. These features create long-term value growth while discouraging volatility-driven speculation seen in previous meme coin cycles. Is La Culex suitable for new investors? Yes, La Culex offers beginner-friendly staking rewards, simple mechanics, and zero transaction fees. Its secure foundation provides predictable returns, making it a safe and appealing entry point for first-time crypto investors. 5. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): The Ever-Evolving Alpha Dog Shiba Inu remains the benchmark for meme longevity. Its Shibarium Layer-2 network lowers fees and speeds up transactions, while the metaverse and gaming plans keep expanding its ecosystem. With over 1.3 M holders and regular burns, SHIB proves that memes can mature into multi-chain platforms. Its focus on real-world utility has inspired a new wave of token engineering across the industry. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the best crypto presales with 100x potential are BullZilla, Bonk, MoonBull, La Culex, and Shiba Inu, each representing a different breed of meme power and profit potential. Yet BullZilla’s Stage 7 momentum and deflationary design place it a league above the rest. For those seeking a shot at transforming $1,000 into $100,000 in a few months, this might be the last low-price entry before the launch sequence erupts. Its roar is getting louder, don’t wait for the echo.

The treaty states that the goal is to combat crimes that cost the world economy trillions of dollars every year. According to the UN, the Cybercrime Convention is a powerful, legally binding instrument to strengthen our collective defenses against cybercrime. The convention is expected to take effect after 40 nations ratify it. “Cyberspace has become fertile ground for criminals Every day, sophisticated scams defraud families, steal livelihoods, and drain billions of dollars from our economies,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the opening ceremony. Tech giants dubbed the pact a “surveillance treaty” The UN has stated that the convention targets a broad spectrum of offences from phishing and ransomware to online trafficking and hate speech. Additionally, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which led the treaty negotiations, said the agreement includes provisions to protect human rights and promote legitimate research activities. However, the UN’s High Commissioner for Human Rights warned during treaty negotiations that “laws with overly broad definitions of cybercrime are frequently used to impose undue restrictions on the right to freedom of expression.” Similarly, tech giants are not embracing the initiative. The Cybersecurity Tech Accord, which includes Meta and Microsoft, has dubbed the pact a “surveillance treaty.” According to them, the initiative may facilitate data sharing among governments and criminalize ethical hackers who test systems for vulnerabilities. On the other hand, Vietnam President Luong Cuong said, the signing of the convention “not only marks the birth of a global legal instrument, but also affirms the enduring vitality of multilateralism, where countries overcome differences and are willing to shoulder responsibilities together for the common interests of peace, security, stability and development.” Also, the European Union, the United States, and Canada sent diplomats and officials to sign the treaty in Hanoi. UN cybercrime Hanoi treaty to majorly combat cybercrimes in Southeast Asia According to the Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA), 63% of Southeast Asians surveyed reported experiencing a scam in the past 12 months, resulting in an estimated $23.6 billion in losses for those affected. This represents a $19 billion increase in losses from $18 billion to $37 billion in 2023. Crime syndicates in the region are using technologies such as AI, deepfakes, and underground banking to scale their operations. In the US, the story isn’t any different. According to data from the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), global cybercrime reached record levels in 2024, with financial losses soaring to $16.6 billion. This was a sharp 33% increase from 2023, when reported losses stood at about $12.5 billion. The FBI report revealed that investment fraud was the most expensive form of cybercrime last year, resulting in over $6.5 billion in losses. Closely following were business email compromise (BEC) attacks, which siphoned an estimated $2.7 billion from individuals and corporations worldwide. Tech-support scams and personal-data breaches also featured prominently. In today’s digital age, scammers continue to exploit both technological gaps and human error on a massive scale. Experts say the figures likely represent only a fraction of the real impact, as many victims never report cyber incidents. In fact, according to a survey conducted by the Global Anti-Scam Alliance, 57% of those affected say they didn’t bother because they assumed nothing would be done.

On the XRP/BTC chart, the 50-period moving average slipped below the long-term moving average, a formation known as a death cross, which typically signals weakening price momentum and potential further downside. Instead of following the expected bearish path, XRP staged a sharp reversal, transforming a negative signal into a powerful confirmation of market resilience. Therefore, this upward move underscores renewed confidence in the asset, coming at a time when inflation concerns are cooling across major economies and risk appetite in the crypto market is improving. Analyst Black Crayfish highlights that XRP’s rapid death cross reversal shows investors aggressively defending key support, signaling strong demand and positioning ahead of potential bullish catalysts. Why is this development raising eyebrows? Well, XRP continues to defy traditional crypto market patterns, driven by Ripple’s institutional settlement solutions and strong utility fundamentals. This rebound highlights that while technical indicators guide trading, market psychology and macro trends often redefine expectations. Ripple’s Hidden Road Acquisition Positions RLUSD to Challenge USDC–USDT Stablecoin Dominance According to renowned crypto researcher SMQKE, Ripple’s recent acquisition of Hidden Road, now rebranded as Ripple Prime, marks a historic turning point in the global stablecoin and institutional liquidity landscape. SMQKE asserts that Ripple’s strategic integration of its new stablecoin RLUSD into advanced trading infrastructure could finally challenge the long-standing dominance of USDC and USDT, a duopoly that has controlled institutional settlement flows for years. Ripple plans to integrate RLUSD into institutional trading flows to challenge the Tether–Circle duopoly. As a result, emphasizing a strategy that goes beyond retail adoption. This move signals Ripple’s evolution from a cross-border payments innovator to a major liquidity provider embedded in global financial infrastructure. Notably, Hidden Road has long been a trusted institutional prime broker, linking hedge funds, market makers, and major liquidity venues across traditional and crypto markets. Ripple’s acquisition grants it direct access to Wall Street-grade order flow, the battlefield where stablecoin supremacy is decided. Therefore, SMQKE envisions a future where institutional flows, tokenized assets, and real-world financial instruments settle instantly and securely on blockchain, bypassing fragmented banking systems. Ripple’s RLUSD could spearhead a more open and competitive stablecoin market. Conclusion XRP’s defiance of the death cross, posting a 5% gain against Bitcoin, underscores its resilience amid volatility. Therefore, this reversal challenges traditional technical signals, reflecting rising investor confidence fueled by easing inflation. As it tests key resistance, XRP may be signaling a renewed bullish phase, attracting both traders and institutional interest. Meanwhile, Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road and the rollout of RLUSD to institutional flows go beyond a simple stablecoin launch, they directly challenge the USDC–USDT duopoly. Powered by Ripple Prime’s infrastructure, RLUSD promises faster, transparent, and fully compliant settlements, positioning it to reshape the global stablecoin market.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-25 14:39:56

Matthew Modabber, Polymarket’s Chief Marketing Officer, confirmed the plans during an interview with Degenz Live . “There will be a token, there will be an airdrop,” Modabber said, emphasizing that the company wants to ensure POLY has “real utility and longevity.” Polymarket’s Next Focus: U.S. Launch Before the Token Drop The CMO clarified that Polymarket’s current focus remains on re-launching its app in the United States, where it recently received approval to return after halting operations in 2022 due to regulatory uncertainty. “Why rush the token if we need to prioritize the US app, right? After the US launch, the focus will be on the token and ensuring its proper operation,” Modabber noted. His comments have sparked intense speculation among traders about the airdrop criteria. Many believe that rewards could be based on trading volume, giving the platform’s most active users a larger share of tokens once the airdrop begins. Record Activity and Rising Valuation The announcement follows a surge in market activity. According to The Block , Polymarket reached $1.4 billion in trading volume last month, while competitor Kalshi surpassed 2.5 billion prediction contracts. Polymarket is also attracting institutional capital at record pace. Bloomberg reports the company is in talks to raise new funding at a valuation of up to $15 billion. In September, Polymarket secured a $2 billion investment from Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, raising its valuation to $9 billion. This followed a $150 million round led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund earlier this year, which valued the company at $1.2 billion. Additionally, Polymarket recently signed a multi-year licensing deal with the National Hockey League, signaling deeper mainstream integration between blockchain and sports industries.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-25 14:43:16

The rapid growth follows the passage of the first-ever US legislation to regulate the digital token sector. Over $10 billion was moved through stablecoins in August for goods, services, and transfers, a significant increase from $6 billion in February and more than double the volume from a year ago. At this pace, the report’s researchers said, stablecoin payments could reach $122 billion over a full year. Artemis @artemis · Follow INTRODUCING: Part 2 of our Stablecoin Payments Report!Co-written with @CastleIslandVC and @dragonfly_xyz , with data now through August 2025.Stablecoin payments hit $10.2B monthly, up 70% since February and 137% since Aug ’24, now at a $122B annual rate.Here’s how the market 7:39 pm · 24 Oct 2025 86 Reply Copy link Read 9 replies A landmark new law provides a powerful catalyst This surge in adoption follows President Donald Trump’s signing of the Genius Act into law on July 18. The landmark legislation established a new federal regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, requiring them to back their tokens with highly liquid assets like Treasury bills, a move that has provided a new layer of confidence and legitimacy to the sector. “If you look at stablecoin supply on a certain trend, and then right after Genius passed, the trend does inflect even more,” Bloomberg quoted Andrew Van Aken, a data scientist at Artemis, noting that the growth rate of the overall stablecoin supply has clearly increased since the law was passed. We certainly think it has had an incremental impact. Business-to-business transfers are now the dominant use case The report also reveals a significant shift in how stablecoins are being used. Business-to-business transfers now make up the largest share of stablecoin payments, totaling $6.4 billion monthly. This represents nearly two-thirds of the total volume and a massive 113% increase since February. It also marks the first time that business payments have surpassed peer-to-peer consumer transactions, which have held steady at $1.6 billion monthly. According to Van Aken, companies are increasingly using stablecoins to bypass the notorious delays of the traditional international banking system. “Businesses are fed up with this very cumbersome send deposit here to this bank, which then sends another bank, which sends another bank,” he said. With an average business stablecoin payment of $250,000, the speed of settlement is a critical advantage. Traditional finance begins to take notice This rapid growth and clear utility have not gone unnoticed by the world of traditional finance. Zelle, the popular bank-owned service that facilitates consumer money movement, has announced plans to expand its services internationally and will rely on stablecoins to enable its new cross-border money movement capabilities. For stablecoin advocates, this is a clear sign that the technology is proving its real-world value. “As stable coins prove to be better money, that will only accelerate people’s trust in it and continue the growth,” Van Aken said.

The company says the new status would help it scale custody services for institutional clients, corporate treasuries, ETFs, and professional investors, including the ability to store and stake digital assets across multiple blockchains such as Cronos. Why the License Matters for Crypto.com If approved, the banking license would allow Crypto.com to operate at the federal level, unlocking broader access to the U.S. market and strengthening its position in the fast-growing crypto custody segment. Custody has become one of the most competitive sectors in digital finance as more institutions seek secure, regulated solutions for token storage and staking. “Building Crypto.com's products and services through regulated and secure solutions has been our priority since day one. We're excited to take this next step,” said co-founder and CEO Chris Marszalek. Institutional Push Continues Crypto.com emphasized that the filing will not affect its existing subsidiary, Crypto.com Custody Trust Company, which remains fully operational under New Hampshire banking oversight. The move mirrors a growing industry trend. Ripple Labs made a similar filing in July 2025, underscoring how major crypto firms are accelerating their shift into traditional finance lanes. Securing a banking license would mark one of the most significant milestones in Crypto.com’s U.S. expansion and strengthen its message to regulators, investors, and institutions: crypto platforms want to be part of the regulated financial system, not outside it.

September’s inflation report was the last clear signal he got before the government shutdown froze everything, though that one CPI report (softer shelter, cooler core services, and a hint of relief in prices) was exactly the calm the Fed wanted before stepping into the dark. But that calm will not last. RSM’s chief economist Joe Brusuelas said this is “likely to be the last solid quality report we get until probably early next spring.” The shutdown has crippled agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics, leaving the Fed with estimates instead of real figures. “The BLS is going to be imputing—or rather guessing—at a lot of the estimates they’re making,” Joe added. “So in many respects, this is the last hard data that I’m going to trust probably until early next spring.” Fed faces murky path as tariffs start to bite Even though the September inflation print gave the Fed some breathing room, the report also revealed early signs of tariff-related price pressures. Gargi Chaudhuri, chief investment strategist at BlackRock, said, “Goods prices are firming again amid tariff pressures.” Things like apparel, footwear, and household furnishings already showed early signs of cost pass-through, and economists from BNP Paribas and Goldman Sachs think this trend will become more visible by early 2026 as companies begin passing costs directly to consumers. Steven Juneau, an economist at Bank of America, said Trump’s tariffs will continue to be “a source of goods price inflation” over the next few quarters as inventories thin out and margins shrink. Lower-income Americans are struggling to keep up with everyday expenses while wealthier households, buoyed by stock market gains, are still spending freely. That imbalance keeps consumption stable, but it hides deep cracks beneath the surface. David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, said , “Inflation might not be slowing, but it’s not surprising to the upside anymore.” Powell and his colleagues will have to rely on private surveys and corporate reports to gauge where the economy stands. The Fed’s traditional compass (employment, CPI, and spending data) is gone for now. Fed expected to cut rates as Trump urges faster action The Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on October 15 came through only because the Social Security Administration needed it to calculate cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, for benefit checks. Otherwise, the federal shutdown would have delayed it too. The CPI data now serves as the final piece of evidence before the Fed’s rate decision next week. The central bank’s inflation goal remains 2%, a level last seen in February 2021. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said, “This report will clearly keep the Fed on track to cut rates.” He added that policymakers are more focused on labor data and defending their full-employment mandate, even with core CPI well above target. Markets are betting on a 25-basis-point cut, taking the benchmark range from 4% to 4.25%, with traders expecting another move in December. But what happens after that is unclear. Economists still worry that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could trigger another wave of inflation. The same report showed tariff-sensitive apparel prices up 0.7% in September and durable goods rising 0.3%. Job growth remains sluggish, though layoffs are still relatively low. Policymakers are now trying to balance those opposing forces without reliable data. Powell has repeatedly said the Fed will stay cautious in cutting rates too fast. But Trump, now back in the White House, insists inflation is “no longer a problem” and that the Fed should be “cutting aggressively.” That puts political pressure right at the Fed’s doorstep as it meets in the middle of a data vacuum. For now, the central bank is left with one clean inflation report, a darkened data pipeline, and a government that’s not sending updates.

Having been propelled by meme energy alone, DOGE’s runaway is slowing as investors look for projects with more utility and enduring growth. A new cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is thus gaining traction as a worthy challenger, uniting emergent value with leading-edge innovation in decentralized finance. Already in Phase 6 of its presale at just $0.035 per token, Mutuum Finance has already reached more than $17.85 million in funds raised, a sign of increasing investor appetite. Its two-lending DeFi model that accommodates both Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending has seen Mutuum Finance being advertised as being one of the best crypto to buy now for high-upside exposure prior to the full outburst of the bull run. For investors seeking a new cryptocurrency, MUTM continues to gain attention as a major contender. Dogecoin (DOGE) Clashes With Monster Resistance at $0.21 as Whales Won’t Back Down Dogecoin (DOGE) is dealing with one of the largest technical hurdles in its history, struggling to overcome the important $0.21 resistance point. On-chain statistics reveal that in excess of 10.5 billion DOGE, valued at some $2.2 billion, were trapped within this area, creating a profound supply barrier which corresponds to a key 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. This convergence is the reason the price has been stagnant in spite of renewed hope. Nevertheless, the bullishness is resolute, demonstrating high conviction by the whales. If DOGE breaks above $0.21 on heavy volume, it can lead to a quick move to $0.29, $0.46, and finally to $0.86, or failing which, can lead to another fall to channel support. As DOGE price action is monitored by investors, many are also focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new cryptocurrency that boasts an immense amount of momentum as investors diversify in the next wave of high-upside cryptos. Traders seeking the best crypto to buy now are keeping a close eye on MUTM’s presale progress. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Rockets with Positive Investor Sentiment Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best crypto to buy now in 2025. Its presale has been on a runaway rise, with over 17,400 investors injecting over $17.85 million thus far. Conviction by large investors is particularly unbending, as they carry a general feeling of conviction that the future of the project is rosier and make MUTM a number one choice for anyone seeking a new cryptocurrency with early-stage appeal. The top investors have bought $8,601, $7,000 and $256 worth of MUTM tokens just in the last 24 hours alone, which is an even bigger interest in adoption at this stage. With all this happening, MUTM is one of the safest bets for those investors looking for the next huge cryptocurrency and an open mind when it comes to the best crypto to buy now with high growth potential. Risk Management and Collateral Controls Mutuum Finance also has a formal risk management policy through tiered collateralization limits that are asset and proportionate to the natural risk of the token. These consist of supply collateralization limits, borrowing limits, and total collateral limits. Positions are generally overcollateralized to take up the platform from price action, with a buffer effect from change. The system also incentivizes liquidators to cover undercollateralized positions in real time so that risky trades settle in real time. Deposit and borrowing caps also constrain exposure to very illiquid or highly volatile tokens. Riskier tokens are dealt with more conservatively in terms of collateral use, although fully correlated assets can be used for levered access so that users can lever the value of their collateral in a safe way.

This comes as XRP rebounds , recording significant gains today. Ripple Among Big Tech Firms That Donate To White House Project XRP influencer Pumpius shared in an X post the private donor list of U.S. President Donald Trump’s new White House ballroom, which included Ripple. Other crypto firms on the list included Coinbase and Tether America , while Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were also on the list. Meanwhile, Ripple was listed alongside top tech firms like Amazon, Meta, Palantir, and Google. It is worth mentioning that this isn’t the first time that the crypto firm has donated to Trump or his administration. The company had donated almost $5 million to the U.S. president’s inauguration . Meanwhile, Ripple executive Stuart Alderoty had also donated to Trump’s campaign last year. Ripple’s donation to the White House ballroom project has sparked excitement in the XRP community, as it could further strengthen ties between the firm and the Trump administration. This is a positive for XRP, which is at the center of Ripple’s operations. Notably, Trump had previously mentioned XRP as one of the coins to be included in the national digital asset stockpile . The payment firm has also recorded major wins since Trump took office at the start of the year. This includes the dismissal of the XRP lawsuit , thanks to the regulatory clarity that the administration has provided. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, also revealed that their operations in the U.S. had grown significantly since Trump won the elections. The crypto firm has also made three major acquisitions this year, including the purchase of prime broker Hidden Road. XRP Rebounds Amid This Development The XRP price has rebounded amid Ripple’s donation to the White House ballroom project. Notably, the token is the biggest gainer today among the top 10 cryptos by market cap. This comes despite the market downtrend , with Bitcoin trading sideways at the moment. Ripple’s donation has likely sparked a bullish sentiment among investors. Another factor that has likely contributed to XRP’s rebound is Brad Garlinghouse’s reassurance to the XRP community. In an X post , he stated that “XRP sits at the center of everything Ripple does” even as they continue to build solutions to enable an “internet of value.” He also told the XRP community to “lock in.” This came as he commented on the firm’s completion of the $1.25 billion Hidden Road deal. The crypto firm stated that the prime broker will complement its payment services, which use XRP. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.55, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Brad Garlinghouse|Cameron Winklevoss|Coinmarketcap|Donald Trump|gemini|Pumpius|ripple|tyler winklevoss|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 15:00:42

This comes as DOGE looks to reclaim the psychological $0.2 level, which could spark a significant rebound for the meme coin. Macro Target For The Dogecoin Price Remains Above $2 In an X post, the crypto analyst stated that he still has the same macro target for the Dogecoin price. His accompanying chart showed DOGE could rally to $3 by next year, which would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the altcoin. However, there is the possibility that the meme coin could keep trading sideways till the end of the year. Related Reading: Why The Dogecoin 3.49% Annual Inflation Is Actually Not A Bug Meanwhile, Hov noted that the Dogecoin price action had played out as expected, with DOGE correcting off the low and crashing by over 50%. He added that the move did not quite make it into the lower support level, but that so far, the move off the low looks pretty corrective. The meme coin had crashed from a high of around $0.30 last month, recently touching $0.11 amid the crash that followed Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on China. Hov also stated that the focus will be on how the Dogecoin price action develops over the next week to see whether the C-wave corrective move is in. DOGE is currently looking to rebound and reclaim the psychological $0.2 level. This has been sparked by optimism regarding a potential trade deal between the U.S. and China. The White House has confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump will meet China’s President Xi Jinping on October 30 at the APEC Summit. Meanwhile, the September CPI, which dropped yesterday, came in lower than expectations, which also contributed to a bounce in the Dogecoin price. DOGE’s 3rd Bull Wave On The Horizon Crypto analyst Ether revealed in an X post that the 3rd bull wave is on the horizon for the Dogecoin price. He noted that DOGE experienced two major bull waves in 2017 and 2021 and that another bull wave is now loading. The analyst broke down the current price action, which points to another bull wave.

He further remarked that the 25MA on the higher time frame is back at support. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin price is said to be gathering strength in the lower band of a years-long ascending channel. The analyst added that all technical indicators are “whispering” the start of a new cycle. As such, he believes the 3rd bull wave is a matter of when, not if. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.19, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrps-chart-just-completed-the-right-shoulder-heres-the-significance/,"In markets driven by speculation, timing is everything, and patterns often reveal what headlines hide. While most traders have their eyes locked on Bitcoin’s next move, XRP’s chart is quietly signaling something far more dramatic. Analysts now believe the digital asset has completed its right shoulder formation, a technical event historically linked with explosive bullish reversals. As the setup tightens, the conversation within the XRP community is heating up, and few have articulated it as vividly as Ripple Bull Winkle. The Technical Picture: A Classic Setup Returns The formation of a right shoulder in technical analysis is no small event. It often concludes a head-and-shoulders pattern, one of the most recognized reversal indicators across markets. In XRP’s case, this formation comes after months of accumulation and compression, where price action has built what many analysts describe as a “spring coil”, tightening volatility ahead of a potential breakout. On major exchanges, XRP remains at $2.57 , showing resilience despite broader market fluctuations. Traders note that each retracement has found consistent support, suggesting that buyers are firmly in control as the right shoulder completes. Everyone’s staring at Bitcoin. Meanwhile… $XRP’s chart just completed the right shoulder. The same setup we saw before every historic breakout. Most people won’t see it till it’s already vertical. Watch the chart. Don’t chase the news. $XRP #Ripple pic.twitter.com/TFB2LaUSiy — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 25, 2025 Technical Perfection in Motion In a video shared on X, Ripple Bull Winkle urged the XRP army to “pay attention to the XRP chart” and “watch the signals that are all coming in.” According to him, the asset’s structure is showing what he called “technical perfection.” “XRP has been coiling like a spring,” he said. “Every dip has been bought, every retest has held. It is building momentum for its next major leg up.” His assessment reflects the growing sentiment among seasoned analysts who view XRP’s chart as one of the cleanest technical structures in the crypto market right now. Bull Winkle’s emphasis on the pattern’s “very clean, very controlled” structure aligns with historical XRP setups that preceded strong bullish rallies. Beyond the Charts: Real-World Momentum While technical indicators hint at breakout potential, real-world developments may be adding fuel to the fire. Ripple’s heightened visibility on the U.S. policy stage has not gone unnoticed. Recent reports indicate the company was represented at a White House ballroom event and made a donation linked to digital asset policy advancement, further intertwining Ripple’s corporate presence with ongoing discussions about blockchain innovation at the federal level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bull Winkle connected these developments directly to XRP’s chart movement, saying the accumulation phase “ties into what is going on in the real world, with Ripple attending the White House ballroom, with Ripple’s donation to the White House, and now with the White House setting their head of digital assets to speak at Swell.” Such comments highlight a broader narrative: technical signals are aligning with institutional and political visibility, a combination that could dramatically influence sentiment. What It Could Mean for XRP’s Next Move Market watchers believe a confirmed breakout above the neckline could mark the start of XRP’s next major leg up. Historical patterns show that once XRP breaks from similar structures, it often experiences sharp, vertical moves driven by liquidity influx and media attention. Bull Winkle summed it up succinctly: “This isn’t noise anymore. This is accumulation. XRP is about to send, it is about to teleport .” For traders, the coming days could be decisive. A confirmed breakout could validate months of quiet accumulation and push XRP into a new price discovery phase. On the other hand, failure to hold current levels might delay or invalidate the setup, but for now, sentiment leans strongly bullish. In conclusion, XRP’s completed right shoulder represents more than a chart pattern; it’s a convergence of technical precision, institutional momentum, and market psychology. As Ripple Bull Winkle cautioned, “This is your warning.” For investors watching closely, the message is clear: watch the chart, not the noise, because what comes next could define XRP’s trajectory for years to come.

US inflation data is boosting the crypto market today The crypto market is going up modestly today, with Bitcoin price rising to $111,650. Some of the top gainers were tokens like Virtuals Protocol , Humanity Protocol, Jupiter, Aerodrome Finance, Zcash, Kaspa, and XRP. All these tokens have jumped by over 5% in the last 24 hours and by double digits in the last 24 hours. The main catalyst for the ongoing crypto market rally is that the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) published encouraging inflation data on Friday. This report showed that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) jumped to 3.0% in September from 2.9% in the previous month. This increase was lower than the median estimate of 3.1%. Most notably, core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, dropped to 3.0% from the previous 3.1%. These numbers boosted the stock and crypto markets by raising the odds that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the upcoming meeting on Wednesday. Risky assets thrive when the Fed and other central banks are cutting rates. JPMorgan embrace of crypto The crypto market is going up after JPMorgan, the biggest American bank moved to embrace the industry. In an announcement, it said that it will start accepting Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral. This is notable since Jamie Dimon, the CEO, has a long history of bashing Bitcoin. In 2021, he said that it was worthless and that it had no intrinsic value. He repeated that claim last year, noting that it was a pet rock that did nothing. He said: “My personal advice would be don’t get involved … but it’s a free country. This is the last time I’m ever going to state my opinion on Bitcoin.” Therefore, the bank’s change of tune on the industry is notable because of its might. Other institutions have started to embrace Bitcoin this year. The most notable one is Vanguard, which is exploring ways to move to the industry. Schwab and Morgan Stanley have also embraced the industry. Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meeting The crypo market is going up as investors focus on the upcoming meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping at the APEC meeting in South Korea. This is an important meeting because of its role in the global economy. The meeting seeks to reduce one of the top risks in the market as the two countries have announced major trade-related news recently. Trump has threatened to cut off China from critical US software and boost tariffs. China, on the other hand, has hinted that it will start limiting rare earth materials. It has asked companies not to use Nvidia chips and placed new tariffs on US ships docking on the country. Therefore, the meeting will help to reduce the tensions, which will boost the stock and crypto market. Potential dead-cat bounce The other potential reason why the crypto market is going up is that this may be a dead-cat bounce. A DCB is a situation where a falling asset bounces back temporarily and then resumes the downward trend. This situation is commonly known as a bull trap because it normally effects inexperienced traders.

FET Community in Uproar Over Ocean Protocol Transfers,https://cryptopotato.com/rug-pull-or-misunderstanding-fet-community-in-uproar-over-ocean-protocol-transfers/,"Ocean Protocol’s sudden withdrawal from the ASI Alliance has sparked accusations of a major token rug pull. In fact, independent on-chain analytics from Bubblemaps indicate that the project transferred approximately 270 million FET, which is worth an estimated $120 million, to Binance and an OTC provider without notifying either the alliance or FET holders. The ASI Alliance, formed in March 2024, united Ocean Protocol, Fetch.ai, and SingularityNET under a single token, FET, with Ocean Protocol’s OCEAN tokens convertible at a fixed rate to FET. Ocean Protocol Under Fire Despite the merger, Ocean Protocol retained a substantial portion of OCEAN within team-controlled wallets allegedly set aside for community incentives and data farming. According to Bubblemaps, on July 1, 2024, one such Ocean Protocol wallet converted 661 million OCEAN into 286 million FET, and subsequently sent 90 million FET to OTC provider GSR Markets. By August 31, the remaining 196 million FET were distributed across 30 new addresses, and by October 14, nearly all of these funds had been transferred to Binance or other OTC providers, which was estimated to be 270 million FET – 160 million to Binance, and 109 million to GSR Markets. The transfers coincided with Ocean Protocol’s October 9 exit from the ASI Alliance, which occurred without public explanation or disclosure regarding the redistribution of community tokens. In response, the FET team took to X to publicly accuse Ocean Protocol of selling off tokens intended for community rewards, while the protocol’s CEO dismissed the claims as “unfounded and baseless rumors” and promised a formal response soon. On-chain activity confirms only the token conversions and transfers, which have left open questions about whether liquidation occurred and why such a significant portion of community-allocated funds was moved without coordination. Ocean Must Provide Answers Amid these developments, Fetch.ai CEO Humayun Sheikh and the broader FET community are demanding transparency from Ocean Protocol regarding the handling of these assets, specifically questioning the timing of the token conversions before the exit, the control structure of the OceanDAO SAFE wallet and Ocean Expedition, and the ultimate disposition of the transferred tokens. In an official statement, Sheikh said, “The ASI Alliance was founded on principles of collaboration, transparency, and shared accountability. While the situation with Ocean Protocol continues to evolve, our focus remains on protecting FET holders and upholding the integrity of the ecosystem. Challenges like this test the strength of our alliances, but they also reinforce why these principles matter. We are committed to ensuring that transparency prevails, that the community’s trust is respected, and that the foundations we’ve built for a decentralized, collaborative future remain intact.

53625288,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=845369,1761405948,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53625288.jpeg,"Kong CEO likens AI boom to U.S. railroad era, warns energy limits could stall growth",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/kong-ai-bubble-may-blow-up/,"Augusto Marietti, Kong’s co-founder and CEO, said that hyperscaling will be worth it, as the AI bubble may pop at any time. He pointed out that AI firms will ultimately need the massive AI infrastructure they are now investing billions in, just as happened with the U.S. railroad buildout. Marietti said during an interview with Business Insider that the current builders’ era is a singular moment in which the industry is likely to deploy more capex or capital to enable the AI era. He pointed out that energy-related issues will probably be the main bottleneck stunting the growth of AI, adding that the industry lacks sufficient energy to power all GPUs in the coming year. As Cryptopolitan reported mid-month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also warned that the AI bubble is about to burst, similar to the dot-com era. However, the fund clarified that the collapse of the AI bubble is unlikely to spark a financial crisis. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, also believes that AI’s transformative promise may be similar to the internet boom and fail to meet near-term market expectations. He, however, noted that only some equity holders are likely to incur losses in the event of a market correction. Gourinchas explained that the sector’s investments are built by cash-rich tech companies, not debt. Marietti digs deeper into the 19th-century U.S. railroad buildout analogy Like OpenAI’s Sam Altman and others, the Kong executive compared the current AI spending to building the U.S. railroad during the 19th century. The AI optimist argues that AI will ultimately transform the economy exponentially; therefore, all enormous expenditures are necessary to lay the groundwork for what is to come. Altman agreed in August that AI could be in a bubble phase, reiterating what others have warned: that current AI spending is unsustainable. He pointed out that capital expenditure is so high that it almost supports the entire U.S. economy. However, Marietti pushed the U.S. railroad buildout analogy even further, saying that all railroads were ultimately used, although some were deployed ahead of time. He emphasized that the current AI infrastructure is also deployed ahead of time and will be needed eventually. “Some railroads were deployed ahead of time, but then all the railroads got used…I think in AI, we’re just deploying ahead of time, and eventually something will blow up for a little bit, but we would eventually need the infrastructure that we’re deploying anyways.” – Augusto Marietti , CEO of Kong The Kong co-founder said even a down moment will not stop what is coming in the industry. OpenAI President Greg Brockman previously suggested that soon, everyone will want their personal GPU, and this level of demand would demand massive expansion by his firm and others. Marietti believes that when this happens, the AI infrastructure built today will be put to work in the future, just like railroads deployed nearly 150 years ago are still in use. Nashawaty says Kong is positioning for an agent economy During an analysis of Kong’s announcement-packed keynote at the Kong API Summit, principal CUBE research analyst Paul Nashawaty said Kong is positioning itself as the cornerstone of the agent economy’s infrastructure. He disclosed that Kong is currently open-sourcing its Volcano development kit and adding new native support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents in Konnect. Marietti echoed this sentiment, saying that Kong stands firm on the notion that opting out of AI means opting for irrelevance, as agents have become the new surface area for execution. According to the Kong boss, it is more about whether to be part of it or become the Yellow Pages. He added that every business will eventually become agentic; it is not optional. Marco Palladino, Kong’s co-founder and chief technology officer, also opined that enterprises need a playbook to prevent them from going the way of the phonebook. To that end, Palladino says the industry is establishing standards to make real-time, tool-rich interactions predictable, with the interface shifting from clicks to prompts. He added that in practice, this means protocols like MCP taking over the role REST or RST (Representational State Transfer) played for APIs. The Kong CTO said he is very bullish about agents and the ability to rapidly generate agents by abstracting away the infrastructure requirements.

According to NHK, Toyota will inform Washington of this plan while Trump is in Tokyo. Akio Toyoda, the automaker’s chairman, is expected to be the one delivering the message directly to American officials during the meetings with Japanese business executives. Koji Sato, Toyota’s president, told reporters on Wednesday that the company is now “looking into bringing cars built in the U.S. into the Japanese market.” He added that discussions are still ongoing inside the company about which specific models will be sent over and how many units are on the table. Nothing has been finalized, but the intent is clear: ship American-made cars to Japan. Toyota moves ahead as Trump returns to Asia This step from Toyota comes right after the July trade deal between Washington and Tokyo, which put new tariffs on Japanese goods exported to the U.S. To avoid friction, the Japanese government is currently reviewing its own vehicle standards. Their goal? Let U.S.-made vehicles be sold in Japan without going through another round of testing. That change would allow Toyota and other automakers to import American-built cars directly and faster. This is Japan’s government and private sector trying to look like they’re cooperating with the U.S. on fixing the trade deficit. Meanwhile, President Trump arrives in Southeast Asia on Sunday for a packed diplomatic trip. He’ll move through Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, with meetings planned at every stop. In Tokyo, he’s expected to sit down with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a right-wing ally of the late Shinzo Abe, and will also meet Emperor Naruhito. Trump’s stop in Japan will be his fourth official visit to the country. Takaichi has already announced she’s increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP by March, two years ahead of schedule. She’s also said the July trade deal with the U.S. may be looked at again, depending on how talks with Trump go. That’ll give Trump even more to discuss with Japanese executives and troops stationed across the country. Japan currently hosts more U.S. military personnel than any other American ally. Trade drives Trump’s full Asia tour Before his stop in Tokyo, Trump will be in Kuala Lumpur, where he’s scheduled to meet Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim and attend an ASEAN leaders’ dinner. This year’s summit theme is “inclusivity and sustainability.” Trump will also take part in a peace deal signing between Cambodia and Thailand. He previously said he helped resolve their deadly border conflict. From there, he heads to South Korea for the APEC conference, where he’ll give a speech to business leaders, meet with South Korea’s president, and attend a formal dinner. But the big question looming over all this? China. Trump is expected to meet with Xi Jinping, though analysts aren’t betting on a trade breakthrough. Victor Cha from CSIS said, “The first message is Trump the peacemaker. The second is Trump the moneymaker.” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday that he’s ready to subsidize U.S. farmers if talks with China stall. He also said he’ll raise Russia and Ukraine with Xi, adding, “I’d like to see China help us out.” Trump even brought up North Korea, saying he’s open to another meeting with Kim Jong Un, despite the White House denying anything’s scheduled. “You know, they don’t have a lot of telephone service,” he said, before telling reporters to “put out the word.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Economy|Toyota,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-25 15:35:24

According to a Charles Schwab survey released yesterday, 45% of US investors now say they want to put money into non-traditional assets, and that includes everything from crypto and gold to private equity, real estate partnerships, and hedge funds. The same poll says two-thirds of people think sticking only to stocks and bonds doesn’t cut it anymore. Reportedly, Schwab asked 2,400 people (2,000 adults, plus an extra 200 Gen Zers and 200 crypto investors) what they thought about investing. The message was loud and clear: the traditional model isn’t enough. Young people, especially, are fed up. Experts even have a name for it: “financial nihilism.” People want more choices, and they’re not scared to look outside the usual options. Investors pile into alts through ETFs Alternative investments, or “alts,” include anything outside the usual cash, stocks, and bonds. We’re talking commodities like gold and oil, real estate, private companies, and of course, cryptocurrency. But these options are messy. They come with complex rules, lock-up periods, and in many cases, low liquidity. That’s where exchange-traded funds (ETFs) come in. Instead of diving into private deals, more investors are picking ETFs that track these riskier assets. It’s a safer way to get in without locking up funds for years. According to State Street Investment Management, over $1 trillion has already gone into U.S.-based ETFs this year, and analysts allegedly told CNBC that much of that money has gone straight into gold and crypto ETFs. Cathy Curtis, CEO of Curtis Financial Planning, says ETFs help skip the red tape. “These [private] investments often have multi-year lockup periods, limited redemption windows, or depend on the underlying fund liquidating its holdings before investors can get paid out,” she said. In contrast, ETFs holding those same assets can still be bought and sold throughout the day, even in after-hours trading. But Curtis also gave a warning. People with smaller portfolios shouldn’t go too deep into alts. “Keep alternatives under 5% if your portfolio’s small. Bigger investors can push it to 10–15%,” she said. ETFs offer access, but they’re not magic. Government pushes make alt access easier The regulatory environment is also shifting. In August, former President Donald Trump signed an executive order that makes it easier to offer alts inside workplace retirement plans. At the same time, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rolled out changes that could speed up the launch of spot crypto ETFs. Both moves could blow the door wide open for more everyday investors to buy into alternatives without complicated legal or financial hoops. Still, not everyone’s convinced it’s time to jump ship from traditional assets. Andy Reed, who heads behavioral economics research at Vanguard, says the hype can lead people into bad decisions. “Although there is constant noise in the investment landscape, chasing fads or the latest headlines can negatively impact an investor’s portfolio in the short and long term,” Reed said. And the data backs him. If you had tossed $1,000 into the S&P 500 in February 1970, you’d be sitting on over $379,000 today. Even a $1,000 bet in January 2020 would be worth $2,200 by October 20, according to Morningstar Direct. So, while more investors are hungry for alternatives, the message from advisors is clear: non-traditional assets are growing, but they’re not a free pass. As Curtis put it, “Boring investing still works.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Business|Charles Schwab.|S&P 500|US,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-25 15:50:21

With sentiment cooling on short-term XRP prospects, eyes are already turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fast-rising DeFi token. The project is already in Phase 6 of its presale and only costs $0.035. The phase has been hit by huge FOMO with investors buying up 75% of it faster than projected. New investors have little time left to buy before it sells out. With its revolutionary dual-lending protocol and established community traction behind it, MUTM may be the next crypto to hit $1, providing investors with affordability and real-world usability in one deal. XRP Battles Below Resistance as the Bears Hold Sway XRP was able to rebound from the $2.50 area but still finds itself with its price action limited below a strong bearish falling resistance line, which indicates ongoing weakness in momentum. The token is building a lower-high pattern in a descending channel, where aggressive supply pressure is consistently pushing away attempts in the $2.45–$2.50 range. If $2.34 is not sustained as temporary support, the buyers can expect to dip further to the target range of $2.25–$2.18. A conclusive break and close above $2.50, however, has the ability to shift market sentiment, leading to a short-term bounce to $2.60–$2.65. While the short-term future of XRP is currently being insured, the majority of investors looking to see further gains in this cycle are beginning to take Mutuum Finance (MUTM) seriously as the next crypto to hit $1. Mutuum Finance’s Phase 6 Presale Sees Strong Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is soaring high in presale phase 6 due to robust investor appetite. The phase is now 75% sold out, and the $0.035 token offers a sensible buying opportunity before Phase 7 takes off and prices start to rise. More than 17,400 investors have purchased over $17.85 million of MUTM tokens. The large numbers indicate higher global interest in Mutuum Finance’s decentralized platform, solid fundamentals, and long-term growth prospects, making it the best cheap crypto to buy now for early exposure. Earn Passive Income as a Supplier You can lock crypto assets, such as USDT, in the liquidity pool as a supplier on the platform and earn passive income through the annual percentage yield (APY). APY also includes market demand in the hope that your returns can keep up with current trends within the crypto space. Taking the example of a 10% mean APY, a $50,000 investment has the potential to build up $5,000 in passive earnings within one year. Access Liquidity Without Liquidating Your Assets For the lenders, the system gives them a convenient method of obtaining liquidity without liquidating your existing assets. If you have ETH but require funds for other investments or other expenses, you can borrow a loan of USDT using your ETH as collateral. Loans are not due on a particular date; rather, they accrue interest based on an APY that is variable with the market demand. Lock In Your Position Before Prices Skyrocket Mutuum Finance has raised more than $17.85 million from more than 17,400 investors already, and with well over 75% of Phase 6 sold, the $0.035 entry price is quickly vanishing.

Many in the crypto community believe XRP is standing at that inflection point. Among them is software developer Vincent Van Code, whose recent post on X has sparked wide discussion among analysts and retail investors alike. He describes XRP’s current investment potential as the most extraordinary risk-to-reward setup he has ever seen. The Changing Narrative Around XRP For years, XRP has been viewed through the lens of regulatory uncertainty and price stagnation. But in 2025, the narrative has shifted dramatically. Ripple’s legal clarity following the conclusion of its long-running case with the U.S. SEC has opened the door for institutional engagement. With the cloud of litigation gone, Ripple has accelerated adoption efforts. Its partnerships with central banks , financial institutions, and fintech providers, as well as the rollout of its RLUSD stablecoin in December 2024, have strengthened the utility of the XRP Ledger as a global payment infrastructure. These developments have not only improved liquidity but also renewed investor confidence. Investing is all about risk/return. XRP return: likely 1000% Risk: incredibly low In my lifetime I have never seen any investment like this, nothing comes close. Yet most people are too emotionally invested in a decision they made 5 years ago. Pivoting your strategy is not… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 24, 2025 Institutional Accumulation and Market Position Recent reports confirm that several institutional funds are actively accumulating XRP, signaling long-term strategic positioning. Ripple’s technology has also gained attention from global payment networks and, notably, from documentation within the Federal Reserve’s own payment modernization discussions , which highlight Ripple’s potential role in real-time settlement systems. At the same time, XRP’s on-chain metrics show robust activity, including increased daily transaction volume and expanded use in cross-border corridors. These indicators suggest that the asset’s growth is being driven not by speculation alone, but by actual utility and enterprise adoption. Technical Momentum and Market Dynamics On the charts, XRP continues to demonstrate bullish formations that align with previous pre-breakout setups. Analysts have recently noted that XRP’s right shoulder breakout pattern mirrors historical cycles that preceded significant rallies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As of report time, XRP trades near $2.48–$2.55, maintaining strong support as traders eye the $3.00 psychological level. This technical resilience complements the growing fundamental strength, a combination that has historically preceded major uptrends in the asset’s price. Vincent Van Code’s Message to Investors In his post, Vincent Van Code emphasized that “investing is all about risk and return.” He asserted that while XRP’s return potential may exceed 1,000%, its risk remains “incredibly low” relative to other assets. Van Code added, “In my lifetime, I have never seen any investment like this, nothing comes close.” He went on to criticize the tendency of investors to remain emotionally attached to outdated positions or biases, noting that the smartest investors are those who adapt. “Pivoting your strategy is not just smart,” he said, “it means you’re a savvy investor who simply follows the money.” The Takeaway Whether or not one agrees with Vincent Van Code’s outlook, his comments reflect a growing belief that XRP’s combination of regulatory clearance, institutional adoption, and technical momentum could redefine its market position. For investors who value asymmetric opportunities, where potential upside far outweighs the perceived downside, XRP may indeed represent a once-in-a-generation setup. As Van Code concluded, the key to success lies not in stubborn conviction, but in adaptability: following the data, the trends, and ultimately, the money.

According to Reuters, President Sadyr Japarov announced the initiative on Saturday, cementing the country’s deepening relationship with the crypto giant and its recently pardoned founder, Changpeng Zhao. The new national stablecoin has been launched on the BNB Chain, and a digital version of Kyrgyzstan’s currency, the som, is now ready for use in government payments, according to a post on the social media platform X by Changpeng Zhao. Zhao, who was appointed as an adviser on digital assets to the president of Kyrgyzstan in May, also confirmed that a national cryptocurrency reserve has been established, which will include Binance’s own BNB token. A strategic move in a complex geopolitical landscape The move is a bold step for the mountainous former Soviet republic of around 7 million people, which has traditionally been dependent on Russia. In recent years, the country has actively sought to become a leader in the cryptocurrency space in Central Asia. However, that ambition has come with risks. Another Kyrgyzstan-based stablecoin, A5A7, which is backed by the Russian rouble, has been placed under sanctions by Western governments who allege it is being used to facilitate the avoidance of sanctions on Russia over the war in Ukraine. The ‘CZ’ factor and a timely presidential pardon The partnership is being driven by one of the most famous and recently controversial figures in the crypto world. Zhao’s role as a presidential adviser has given Binance a direct line to the highest levels of the Kyrgyz government. The launch of the new stablecoin is also notable for its timing, coming just one day after US President Donald Trump issued a full pardon to Zhao, who had previously been convicted of money laundering-related offenses in the United States. The ambitious crypto initiative comes as President Japarov, who came to power in 2020, has clamped down on domestic dissent and prepares for a snap parliamentary election on November 30, where his allies are aiming to expand their dominance.

The Consumer Price Index report was delayed by the ongoing government shutdown, which has also delayed crucial economic data. Bitcoin To Reach $180,000: VanEck CEO VanEck CEO Jan Van Eck believes Bitcoin’s growing correlation with global M2 liquidity could propel it beyond $180,000 before the end of the bull cycle. VanEck revealed in its mid-October report that Bitcoin’s price had long moved with the global money supply. Bitcoin has exhibited a roughly 0.5 correlation with total global M2 growth, indicating that changes in fiat currency liquidity have explained a meaningful portion of long-term returns. “While this relationship tends to weaken during short-lived shocks, such as COVID in 2020, the 2024 election, or the ‘Tariff Tantrum’ of 2025, broader trends in monetary expansion continue to dominate Bitcoin’s cycles.” Nathan Frankovitz, investment analyst at VanEck, stated that global liquidity across the top five currencies has doubled from $50 trillion to almost $100 trillion, during which Bitcoin prices have increased over 700x. Bitcoin currently makes up 2% of the global money supply. VanEck believes owning less than 2% of Bitcoin or any other digital asset implicitly addresses a short position in the asset class. As a result, VanEck reaffirmed its $180,000 year-end target for the flagship cryptocurrency despite recent price weakness and volatility. According to the asset manager, the futures market will play a crucial role in determining whether Bitcoin can reach its $180,000 price target. Delayed CPI Data Reveals Cooling Inflation Bitcoin (BTC) registered a notable increase on Friday after the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3% year-over-year, slightly below the forecast 3.1%. The report provided key inflation data during the ongoing government shutdown. The flagship cryptocurrency pushed to an intraday high of $112,158 ahead of the print before settling at $111,042. According to analysts, the CPI report cleared a vital policy overhang despite structural risks. Nic Puckrin, co-founder of The Coin Bureau, called the report “the most impactful inflation report of the year,” adding that it reduced the uncertainty created by the government shutdown. “This report finally dispels some of this uncertainty. It sets the stage for the FOMC to continue its rate-cutting cycle beyond next week, and this is what risk assets have been waiting for to resume their rally.” Puckrin added that a move past $116,000 could propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high. “As we head into the weekend and liquidity thins, we could see a pronounced move higher as investors rotate from gold into bitcoin, provided no negative headlines surface.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp increase on Friday following the CPI data release. The flagship cryptocurrency has traded in positive territory since Thursday, rising over 2% to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,116. Buyers retained control on Friday as the price continued rising and settled at $111,042. BTC is up 0.56% during the ongoing session, trading around $111,650. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index rose 3% over the past 12 months. Economists had predicted a 3.1% annual increase for the CPI numbers. The report marked the third straight month during which inflation grew hotter after cooling to 2.3% in April. Core inflation, which removes volatile food and energy prices, softened to 3% against 3.1% a month prior. The report comes as the government shutdown enters its 24th day. The shutdown delayed the report by over a week. However, the Federal Reserve still has time to digest the numbers before the next policy meeting. Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 bps. The Fed has been cautious in lowering borrowing costs this year amid fears that trade tensions and a shift in immigration policies under President Trump could make its 2% inflation target difficult to achieve. BTC rose nearly 4% on Sunday to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday, ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $115,274. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $109,945. It recovered from this level to reclaim $113,000 and settle at $113,068, ultimately dropping 1.91%. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 2% to $110,804. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as BTC fell below $110,000 and settled at $108,198. BTC plunged to $103,516 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $106,463, ultimately dropping 1.60%. Source: TradingView BTC rose on Saturday, rising 0.70% to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,208. Buyers retained control on Sunday as the price rose over 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,676. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC’s recovery continued. As a result, the price rose nearly 2% to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,568. BTC reached an intraday high of $114,082 on Tuesday. However, market sentiment soured and buyers lost momentum. As a result, the price fell 1.99% to $108,362. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell 0.72% and settled at $107,585. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Thursday, rising over 2% to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,116. Buyers retained control on Friday as BTC rose 0.84% to reclaim $111,000 and settle at $111,042. The flagship cryptocurrency is up 0.40% during the ongoing session, trading around $111,511.

The bank also highlighted changes to Coinbase’s USDC rewards and new Base-integrated DEX features driving profits and risk-management levers. JPMorgan Upgrades Coinbase Stock Coinbase shares (COIN) rallied on Friday after JPMorgan Chase upgraded the exchange, highlighting the potential of new monetization opportunities associated with its Base Network and USDC payout strategy. Analysts lifted their rating of Coinbase stock from “neutral” to “overweight” and also raised their price target to $404, a 15% upside from current levels. According to JPMorgan, Coinbase is leaning into its Base Layer-2 technology and exploring ways to capture value from the nascent platform’s growth. The bank also predicted that the launch of a Base token could present Coinbase with a $12 billion to $34 billion opportunity, putting Coinbase’s retained share between $4 billion and $12 billion. JPMorgan analysts also noted that the Base token’s distribution would likely favor developers, validators, and the larger Base community. Analysts also highlighted Coinbase’s integration of a DEX aggregator within the Base app to hedge against the growth of decentralized exchanges. USDC Rewards JPMorgan also highlighted margin expansion potential due to changes in Coinbase’s USDC rewards program. According to the bank’s analysts, Coinbase may reduce interest rewards for most users, offering them primarily to Coinbase One users. The bank believes such a move could add around $374 million in annual earnings at current USDC interest rates and yields. COIN shares rallied over 9% following the news, reaching $353. The stock’s value is up about 42% year-to-date, taking the company’s market capitalization past $90 billion. Attention Turns To Coinbase Earnings Coinbase will report its third-quarter earnings results on October 30. According to a report by Zacks Investment Research, analysts expect the company to post earnings of $1.06 per share, a 71% increase year-over-year, and revenue of $1.74 billion, a 44.1% increase from the same quarter last year. Coinbase reported a mixed second quarter, with the exchange missing earnings expectations. However, it achieved several operational milestones, including higher stablecoin revenue and rising stablecoin balances. Coinbase has also been focusing on its subscription and services segment. Analysts expect the segment to contribute between $665 million and $745 million in the third quarter. The exchange also highlighted several key developments during the quarter. These include the approval of the GENIUS Act. The act established a clear regulatory framework in the US for stablecoin adoption. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While the digital asset saw a couple of resets along the way, it continued to put in new highs, reflecting the magnitude of confidence held by its long-term investors. However, the recent correction seen this October seems to be shaking that confidence, raising questions about the sustainability of Bitcoin’s bull cycle, and if the long-feared bear market is imminent. However, recent on-chain data points to an interestingly brighter outlook than what is currently being experienced by market participants. Some Relevant BTC On-Chain Levels In an October 24 post on the X platform, pseudonymous on-chain analyst Arch Physicist highlighted what could be encouraging news for Bitcoin market participants. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Analyst Forecasts What Will Happen In The Last Quarter Of The Year The crypto pundit’s analysis was based on the Value Coin-Days Destroyed (VCDD) to Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric, which measures the amount of coins that are moved on the blockchain in relation to the potential profits based on their movements. Essentially, this metric is used to locate price zones that can serve as support or resistance. Arch Physicist highlighted four important readings from the metric, thereafter explaining on the underlying functions of each of them. The analyst noted: ‘Gamma + Epsilon’ is used to determine structural highs formed due to Long-Term Holder (LTH) profit-taking, with its current value being around $147,937; ‘Delta + Epsilon’ represents support formed by Short-Term Holder (STH) entry opportunities, currently valued at approximately $92,902. Epsilon, on its part, is used to represent potential price floors. LTH Support Holds As Bitcoin Puts In Highs Arch Physicist further explained that the metric’s functions are in tandem with Bitcoin’s historical price action. “Bitcoin’s price has broken above the structural high (Gamma + Epsilon) and reached ATHs near Beta during bull runs. It has also historically made ATLs very close to Epsilon,” the analyst said. Interestingly, the Bitcoin price in this cycle has consistently traded within the support zones established by its LTHs, and the ones by its STHs. However, price seems to be heading towards the lower support zone, which, if breached, could signal the beginning of a bear market. On the other hand, the sustained integrity of the upper support could also be indicating that the bull run has not even started. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at approximately $11,890, with no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

53627709,613956,1761411623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53627709.jpeg,Trump’s CZ Pardon Sparks Fury — Congresswoman Leads The Backlash,https://bitcoinist.com/trumps-cz-pardon-sparks-fury-governor-leads-the-backlash/,"US President Donald Trump signed a pardon for Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao on October 23, 2025, clearing a federal conviction tied to anti-money-laundering failures. According to Reuters and the Associated Press, Zhao had pleaded guilty in 2023, paid a $50 million fine, and served about four months in prison. Binance itself agreed to more than $4 billion in penalties related to US enforcement actions. Lawmakers Demand Answers Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, called the pardon “appalling but unsurprising” and accused the administration of favoring wealthy insiders. Based on reports from her office, Waters alleges that CZ spent months lobbying the president and his family and “funneled billions” into a Trump-linked crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. She and other Democrats said they want records and explanations. Markets reacted quickly after the announcement. Trading data showed Binance’s native token BNB rising in intraday trading, with some estimates putting gains between about 3% and 8% at peak moments. Reported trading volume jumped roughly 35% above recent averages on some platforms as traders digested the news. Some investors said the pardon might reduce near-term regulatory risk for Binance-related assets. Legal Context And Reaction Zhao’s conviction stemmed from charges under the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to establish an effective anti-money-laundering program. He accepted a $50 million penalty and served approximately four months behind bars. The presidential pardon removes the federal criminal conviction from his record but does not erase the facts of the case or the company’s settlement. According to multiple outlets, CZ expressed gratitude for the pardon and said he hopes to support US crypto efforts going forward. Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice. Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide. (Still in flight, more posts to come.)… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 23, 2025 Political figures responded sharply. Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats blasted the decision and raised concerns about influence and fairness. Some Republican lawmakers framed the move as a reset for US engagement with the crypto sector. Reports have disclosed that congressional offices are weighing oversight steps to probe any private meetings, donations, or contracts tied to the pardon. At the same time, exact financial links referenced in Waters’s statement remain incomplete in public filings.

This washout cleared out leverage, reset funding, and gave the market a clean sheet. The perfect foundation for another leg up, and Standard Chartered is calling for $200K BTC this year . Gold just had its largest single-day drop since 2013, and it is time for the baton to be passed. Up next is BTC, but what comes after BTC? This is Q4, and if history is any guide, that means altcoins. While BTC dominates headlines, attention focuses on Digitap ($TAP) , a new presale that could rally 50X harder. It is the world’s first omni-bank, and as payments boom, it could quickly become one of 2025’s best performers. Positioning Whiplash: Why Markets Look Better Now Markets move to hurt the majority—it is a tale as old as time. When leverage stacks too high on one side, a small move against it can trigger a liquidation cascade. Forced sellers create more forced sellers and open interest collapses in hours. That is what the $19 billion liquidation did. It flushed out longs, normalized funding, and left spot holders in control. When leverage is gone, it is precisely the backdrop large allocators prefer when adding risk in size. And everything screams that it is BTC’s turn to remind everyone how fast it can move. Bitcoin & Gold: The 90-Day Rule Bitcoin and gold compete partially in the same arena: the store-of-value/debasement trade. While negatively correlated over shorter time frames, they are strongly correlated over more extended periods. BTC trades similarly to gold but with a roughly 90-day lag. Gold runs first, and Bitcoin catches up around a quarter later. Markets are delivering a textbook setup right now. Gold’s relentless rise in price action, followed by a 5% decline in a single day, is the perfect way to pass the baton. Standard Chartered is bullish, calling for $200K before year’s end , and now that ETF inflows are picking up and leverage has been cleared, this prediction looks likely to hit. Digitap’s Omni-Bank Stack Payments and stablecoins are the golden geese in 2025. The winners will be the systems that treat bank money and on-chain capital as equal-status liquidity. And that’s why Digitap’s presale is rapidly approaching $1 million, showing strong early momentum as investors flip long on the world’s first omni-bank. Digitap is built as a control panel for moving value, whether that be stablecoins, fiat, or crypto. Everything sits on one dashboard, and under the hood, Digitap has integrated traditional banking rails and blockchains. Payments and transfers travel on the fastest rail, automatically selected by Digitap’s AI-powered routing system. The Visa card brings on-chain balances into the real world, and with non-KYC, anyone can sign up for a virtual card today. Digitap is already available for download, and this has been a central driver in the presale’s success—users can trial the app before investing, a rarity in the crypto presale world. Introducing the $TAP Flywheel The native $TAP token underpings this entire ecosystem. Holders unlock cashback rewards, VIP perks, and can stake for rewards. It has a capped supply of 2 billion and is a core player in the ecosystem. Most altcoins have suffered this cycle because they lack a revenue mechanism. Digitap allocated 50% of platform profits to open-market purchases of TAP. 50% of these acquired tokens are burnt permanently, and the other 50% distributed to stakers. More adoption and payments on Digitap directly translate into more buying pressure for $TAP, and this cash flow circuit makes it look scarily undervalued at its current price of $0.0194. But investors will have to be quick because in the next round, $TAP will be priced at $0.0268. Why $TAP Could 50X Before the End of the Year Bitcoin looks like it wants to tag $200,000 before the year ends. But while BTC offers nearly 2X returns, $TAP at these levels could easily deliver 50X or more. Early-stage platforms perform best in Q4, with an aggressive adoption curve ahead, and by compressing cross-border payment costs to below 1% (an industry that processes trillions of dollars in volume annually), $TAP looks like a dark horse that could shock everyone. It has a structural advantage thanks to the $TAP flywheel, and if settlement volume expands as predicted, $TAP could easily hit a 50X before the end of the year.

Apple, Meta, Google’s Alphabet, and Amazon are all scheduled to post quarterly results in a stretch that could shake the entire S&P 500. These companies sit at the center of market direction, index weighting, and investor sentiment. More than a dozen S&P 500 companies are also set to release results in the same window, many of them carrying strong momentum into their reports. FactSet projections show total S&P 500 profits are expected to surge by more than 13% for Q3, which would make this the fourth straight quarter of growth. According to CNBC, fifteen stocks stood out going into next week’s earnings window, with Wall Street analysts raising EPS forecasts by at least 20% over the past three and six months. On top of that, each name had at least 15% upside to its consensus 12-month price target. Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon, and others made the list. Alphabet and Visa prepare to post sharp gains Alphabet is forecast to earn $2.28 per share for the third quarter. That figure is up 71% from what analysts estimated just three months ago. Six months back, the estimate was just $1.08, making today’s forecast a massive 112% higher than it was. Alphabet’s stock, which owns Google and YouTube, has jumped 33% in three months and 63% over the past six. Analysts currently have a $252 price target on the stock, giving it an 18% upside from current levels. Visa is also expected to show strong numbers. Analysts see it reporting $2.97 per share in profit. That’s 41% higher than what the Street projected three months ago, and 50% more than estimates from six months earlier. The stock has underperformed compared to peers, down nearly 3% over the last three months and up less than 10% in 2025 so far. Still, analysts see it hitting $393, which would mean a 16% climb from where it trades today. Bank of America analysts named several stocks they expect to be well-positioned going into earnings week. Meta Platforms is one of them. The bank believes the company has more room to run, especially as investors shift back toward ad-driven tech names. CNBC Pro also flagged Roblox, Wex, Trip.com, and Coupang as buy-rated going into next week. Omar Dessouky, an equity analyst at Bank of America, shared his view on Roblox. “Tactically, we expect a beat & raise off conservative guidance,” he said, pointing out that the company’s price movement may be “driven by broadening participation,” but the current level is still attractive. Roblox stock is up 121% year-to-date through Friday. Its earnings report later this month will test whether those gains were justified or premature. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Boeing also step in Tesla has already reported, and Nvidia’s turn won’t come until November 19, which puts the spotlight fully on this week’s big names: Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Jim Cramer’s portfolio includes ten companies that are set to report in this window, so he decided to give his thoughts on each heading into the week. Boeing will announce third-quarter results before the market opens on Wednesday. One key number investors are watching is the non-cash charge tied to the 777x program, the long-haul aircraft that has faced repeated delays. Boeing is also raising output on the 737 Max, creating room for more deliveries and boosting cash flow. “The management team should be talking about a series of orders,” Jim said on CNBC, adding, “if you don’t have any Boeing, it’s not too late to buy.” Boeing’s earnings figures will confirm whether the new production plans are on schedule. Apple’s report will hit on Thursday evening. The company’s fourth fiscal quarter has been under the microscope after early signs showed stronger-than-expected iPhone 15 sales. The stock touched a record intraday high on Monday after Wall Street analysts gave positive commentary and new data pointed to solid demand. Jim is bullish, citing signs that the latest iPhones are selling better than expected. The company’s earnings release will put those assumptions to the test.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/market-expert-once-xrp-gets-going-nothing-will-stop-it-heres-why/,"Markets often roar after long silences. While the broader crypto community keeps its eyes fixed on Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP is quietly positioning itself for what could be one of the most powerful moves of the current cycle. Beneath the surface of calm price action lies a structured consolidation, a pattern that has historically preceded XRP’s major rallies. This subtle accumulation phase is drawing attention from seasoned analysts who understand that genuine momentum is built quietly, not loudly. Renewed Confidence After Legal Clarity One of the key factors fueling XRP’s strengthening foundation is the improved legal clarity surrounding Ripple and XRP. Following years of courtroom uncertainty, 2025 has brought a much clearer landscape for XRP’s status in U.S. markets. The conclusion of the Ripple vs. SEC legal battle restored institutional confidence and opened the door for renewed integration within global payment systems. With Ripple continuing to expand partnerships in cross-border settlement corridors, the stage appears set for a fundamentally supported bull cycle. Once $XRP gets going, nothing will stop it. History is repeating itself, but this time with a stronger version. XRP is retracing its cycle pattern, gathering strength, quietly preparing. Patience will be the most profitable weapon in this cycle. Feel this, understand this… https://t.co/HT9SqheU15 pic.twitter.com/uxSGvfyeWb — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL (@EtherNasyonaL) October 24, 2025 Chart Patterns Signaling a Familiar Cycle From a technical standpoint, XRP’s current structure mirrors its historical accumulation cycles. Analysts point to recurring patterns, cyclical retracements, ascending supports, and compression zones that have often acted as precursors to explosive uptrends. On the weekly chart, XRP appears to be retracing and stabilizing, similar to the patterns observed before its 2017 and 2021 breakouts. This cyclical symmetry has not gone unnoticed. According to market observer EtherNasyonaL, XRP is “retracing its cycle pattern, gathering strength, quietly preparing.” He emphasized that “patience will be the most profitable weapon in this cycle,” suggesting that the asset is nearing the end of its accumulation phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Accumulation and Utility Expansion Beyond the charts, fundamental momentum continues to build. Institutional demand for XRP has grown significantly since Ripple introduced its U.S. dollar stablecoin, RLUSD, which enhances liquidity and settlement flexibility within Ripple’s enterprise ecosystem. Large treasury managers and payment providers are increasingly exploring XRP for cross-border value transfer, a utility use case that separates it from speculative tokens. Ripple’s continued collaboration with financial institutions, central banks, and real-time settlement networks also signals that XRP’s relevance in global finance is far from waning. These developments create an environment where both technical and fundamental factors align, a rare convergence that often precedes market revaluations. Patience as the Ultimate Advantage In volatile markets, emotions can cloud judgment. Yet, as EtherNasyonaL rightly notes, patience remains the sharpest weapon in an investor’s arsenal. Those who understand XRP’s cyclical nature recognize that explosive runs are often born out of prolonged consolidation. History, as the analyst puts it, “is repeating, but this time with a stronger version.” The message is clear: XRP’s quiet strength may be the calm before a sustained breakout. For those watching closely, this cycle could redefine how patience, preparation, and conviction translate into profit.

53627965,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=212131,1761412210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/53627965.jpeg,Revolutionary AI Browsers: Unpacking ChatGPT Atlas and the Future of Web Navigation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-browsers-future-web/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary AI Browsers: Unpacking ChatGPT Atlas and the Future of Web Navigation The digital landscape is constantly shifting, and for those in the cryptocurrency space, understanding the cutting edge of technology is paramount. This week, the launch of OpenAI’s AI-powered web browser, ChatGPT Atlas , ignited a fresh debate: are AI browsers finally ready to redefine how we interact with the internet? This development carries significant implications, not just for everyday users seeking efficiency, but also for the broader digital economy, including how information is accessed and disseminated, a critical factor for crypto investors and enthusiasts. Are AI Browsers the Next Digital Frontier? The introduction of OpenAI’s ChatGPT Atlas has stirred conversations about the future of internet interaction. On a recent episode of the Equity podcast, hosts Max Zeff, Sean O’Kane, and Anthony Ha delved into the evolving browser landscape. While the idea of an AI agent streamlining online tasks is compelling, the immediate consensus among the panelists suggested that a mass exodus from established browsers like Safari or Chrome is not imminent. The history of the browser market is littered with challengers who failed to unseat the giants, often due to an inability to sustain themselves financially on the browser product alone. However, OpenAI, with its substantial funding, operates under different financial pressures, allowing it to pursue long-term vision over immediate profit. What Does ChatGPT Atlas Offer Users? The promise of AI browsers like ChatGPT Atlas is to automate and simplify online tasks, theoretically leading to significant efficiency gains. However, practical experience reveals a more nuanced reality. Max Zeff, who has personally tested Atlas and other AI-driven browsers such as Comet, observed that the efficiency gains are, at best, marginal. He described instances where users might find themselves watching an AI agent ‘click around on a website,’ performing tasks that a typical user might not even consider doing. For example, the often-cited scenario of an AI agent looking up a recipe and automatically adding ingredients to Instacart seems more like a tech industry ideal than a common user need. This raises a fundamental question about the current value proposition: are these tools addressing real-world user pain points or simply showcasing technological capabilities? How Will Web Browsing Evolve with AI? The rise of advanced AI interfaces prompts critical questions about the future of web browsing and the very concept of the open web. Anthony Ha voiced concerns about the proliferation of generative AI content at the top of search results, which can dilute the organic search experience. He also pondered the broader implications if AI browsers gain widespread adoption: could websites themselves become less central, with AI interfaces and chatbots mediating most of our online interactions? This shift could fundamentally alter how information is consumed, potentially consolidating control over digital content and raising significant security and privacy risks. If AI agents become the primary navigators of the internet, understanding their biases, data handling, and operational transparency becomes crucial for maintaining an equitable and accessible digital space. Why Does OpenAI Have an Edge in This Race? The history of internet browsers is a tale of fierce competition, with many innovative attempts failing to gain traction against incumbents like Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. Sean O’Kane highlighted that a primary reason for these failures has been the difficulty in monetizing a browser as a standalone product. Companies often struggled to generate sufficient revenue to compete with the vast resources of tech giants. However, OpenAI represents a new paradigm. With its increasingly massive funding rounds, OpenAI possesses what Sean describes as ‘infinite money.’ This financial strength allows the company to develop and deploy tools like ChatGPT Atlas without the immediate pressure of profitability. This long-term perspective enables OpenAI to iterate and evolve its browser, potentially allowing it to ‘ride it out as long as they want’ until the technology matures and finds its market fit, a significant advantage over previous challengers. Is the Agentic Web Ready for Mainstream Adoption? The concept of the ‘ agentic web ,’ where AI agents autonomously perform complex tasks on behalf of users, is a grand vision frequently discussed within tech circles. Max Zeff acknowledged the fascinating nature of this idea and the various solutions developers are building towards this future. However, he remains skeptical about its current readiness for the average consumer. The gap between the industry’s vision and actual user experience remains wide. While the technology is impressive, the practical value for ‘normal people’ is not yet compelling enough to drive a mass transition. The critical challenge for AI browser developers is to move beyond mere efficiency gains and create genuinely transformative experiences that resonate with a broad user base, addressing needs that are not currently met by traditional browsing methods. Conclusion: Navigating the AI Browser Horizon The emergence of AI browsers like ChatGPT Atlas marks a significant moment in the evolution of our digital lives. While the potential for increased efficiency and automation is clear, the journey to mainstream adoption is fraught with challenges, from proving tangible user value beyond niche applications to addressing profound questions about the open web and digital security. The financial might of entities like OpenAI provides a unique advantage, allowing for sustained development and innovation without immediate profit pressures. However, the ultimate success of these new browsing paradigms will depend on their ability to offer compelling, secure, and truly beneficial experiences that genuinely enhance how we interact with the vast information highway. Frequently Asked Questions about AI Browsers What is ChatGPT Atlas? ChatGPT Atlas is an AI-powered web browser launched by OpenAI , designed to integrate artificial intelligence capabilities directly into the browsing experience, aiming to automate tasks and enhance efficiency. Who are the main players in the traditional browser market? The dominant players include Safari (Apple), Google Chrome , and Mozilla Firefox , among others. What are the main challenges for new browsers, especially AI-powered ones? Historically, new browsers struggle to make money as a standalone product.

The boom that started in Silicon Valley is helping Wall Street hit record highs, yet in places like Birmingham, Alabama, flower shop owners like Cameron Pappas are cutting stems just to keep customers from walking away. The story, reported by CNBC, shows a country where trillion-dollar tech firms are fueling growth numbers while the rest of the economy tries to breathe. Cameron’s Norton’s Florist, a family business founded in 1921, made $4 million last year selling flowers and gifts. But with Trump’s sweeping tariffs raising import costs, Cameron said he’s been forced to “keep an eagle eye on all of our costs.” He explained that instead of raising prices, he’s trimming his flower arrangements. “If a bouquet has 25 stems in it, if you reduce that by three to four stems, then you’re able to keep the price the same,” he said. “It’s really forced us to focus on that and to make sure that we’re pricing things the best that we possibly can.” AI spending lifts the markets but not everyone else The AI mania has become a statistical miracle. A JPMorgan Chase report showed that in the first half of 2025, AI-related investments alone added 1.1% to U.S. GDP growth, beating out consumer spending as the country’s main growth driver. The Commerce Department said GDP grew 3.8% in the second quarter after falling 0.5% in the first. Yet in real terms, manufacturing has been shrinking for seven straight months, and construction is flat because of high interest rates and the rising cost of materials. Cushman & Wakefield expects total construction costs to climb 4.6% this quarter compared to last year due to tariff-driven expenses. On the surface, markets look unbeatable. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom (the eight mega-caps linked to AI) now make up 37% of the S&P 500, with Nvidia alone worth $4.5 trillion, about 7% of the entire index. Retailers tied to consumers are barely moving, with their stocks rising less than 5% this year. Target recently announced 1,800 corporate layoffs, its first major cuts in ten years, and its shares are down 30%. “I think the message that the AI economy is sort of driving up the GDP numbers is a correct one,” said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “There may be weakness in the rest of the economy, or not weakness, but there may be more modest growth.” Tech investment surge fuels trillion-dollar ambitions Investors are waiting for new AI spending updates as Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet prepare to report earnings mid-week, followed by Apple and Amazon. Last month, Nvidia announced a $100 billion deal with OpenAI, which is now valued at $500 billion. The funding will let OpenAI run 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, roughly equal to the yearly electricity use of 8 million U.S. homes. Advanced Micro Devices has doubled its stock value this year after landing its own deal with OpenAI, while Oracle is riding the same AI-infrastructure wave. “Are we sort of inflating the economy now, thereby setting ourselves up for a crash in the future?” Sundararajan asked. He added that he hasn’t seen any slowdown in demand for AI systems. The tech buildout may be helping market valuations, but it’s also deepening the gap between corporate giants and the rest of the workforce. Tariffs squeeze small businesses and consumers A KeyBank survey in September found that one in four owners are stuck in “survival mode.” This group accounts for about 40% of the nation’s GDP. Cameron’s business has seen plenty—the Great Depression, World War II, and the pandemic—but he said tariffs have created a new kind of pressure. About 80% of all cut flowers sold in the U.S. come from Colombia and Ecuador, and higher import costs have made it impossible to keep margins stable. To fight back, Cameron said he’s been sourcing flowers directly from growers in South America to avoid distributor fees. He calls it “tariff price management.” The broader cost of Trump’s tariffs is staggering. S&P Global estimates they will cost global businesses $1.2 trillion this year, with most of those costs passed straight to consumers. Consumer confidence looks bleak heading into the holidays. A Deloitte survey showed that 57% of Americans think the economy will weaken next year, compared to 30% a year ago—the most pessimistic outlook since 1997. Gen Z respondents said they plan to spend 34% less this holiday season, while millennials expect to cut spending by 13%. Seasonal hiring in retail is expected to drop to its lowest level since the 2009 recession, and new U.S. hires overall are down 58% from last year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Corporate America is also cutting back. Starbucks rolled out a $1 billion restructuring plan in September, closing stores and eliminating 900 non-retail jobs, plus another 1,100 corporate positions earlier this year. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts blamed a “challenging macro backdrop” for weaker third-quarter results, with its stock down 25%. Even AI leaders are trimming staff. Microsoft said in July it would cut 9,000 jobs to simplify management layers. Salesforce also announced layoffs, saying AI now handles tasks once done by employees.

Solana has established itself as one of the leaders with unparalleled speed, scalability, and robust ecosystem development, and it is a short-term volatility bets trader favorite. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , on the other hand, a fast-rising DeFi protocol at as low as $0.035, is receiving serious thought as the next cryptocurrency to reach $1. With over $17.85 million in its presale and less than 25% of Phase 6 remaining, investors are looking for Mutuum Finance for its innovative double-lending model and huge upside value into 2025’s market cycle. Investor uptake has exceeded all analyst prediction as MUTM goes viral. For those wondering which crypto to buy today for short-term, MUTM continues to gain strong traction, making it the next crypto to hit $1 in investor conversations. Solana (SOL) Near Critical Support, Bulls Aim for a New Rally Solana (SOL) is hovering close to a critical support range of $176–$177, which will decide its upcoming big move. A strong bounce here from these levels would mark the return of buying power and perhaps trigger another leg higher. To ensure this good story continues, though, SOL needs to break above the $186 and $195 resistance levels, showing new impetus towards returning to its former all-time highs. As investors eagerly wait for this potential breakout, a number of diversified buyers seeking to acquire exposure to 2025’s largest winners are also eyeing upstart DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which are rapidly gaining popularity for their next-generation market strategy. Investors looking for which crypto to buy today for short-term gains are closely watching Phase 6, knowing that MUTM could be the next crypto to hit $1. Mutuum Finance Stays Strong with Phase 6 Presale Nearly Complete Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now making news in the crypto community, fast becoming one of the most eagerly awaited cryptocurrencies for both retail and institutional investors. It has already smashed record-breaking presale records, attracting over 17,400 wallets and over $17.85 million to date. Days away from being fully sold out in Phase 6, MUTM continues with strong momentum. Investors are rushing to invest early in one of the best cryptos of the year. Early movers who are looking for which crypto to buy today for short-term gains are positioning themselves to ride the growth, with MUTM projected to explode. Mutuum Finance will soon launch on Sepolia Testnet V1 of its cutting-edge lending and borrowing protocol . The initial release will provide basic DeFi functionality such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and Liquidator bot. USDT and ETH will be natively supported at launch to collateralize, lend against, and borrow against, with a secure, fast, and scalable multi-asset trading experience. The goal is to provide users with the feel of the next generation of DeFi platforms. Robust Pricing Framework and Market Accuracy Mutuum Finance ensures prompt and accurate prices with Chainlink oracles cross-verifying token prices against liquid assets such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Onboarding of fallback oracles, aggregator feeds, and on-chain data also provides quality real-time price feeds. They all form the basis of collateral value, risk assessment, and liquidation of the protocol and thus make Mutuum Finance agile and resilient even in turbulent market conditions. High-ROI Altcoins for the Bull Run While Solana (SOL) settles at significant support, near-term speculators eagerly await a breakout, but all the buzz is on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With Phase 6 already 75% sold out for only $0.035, it’s no wonder investors are scrambling in ahead of the next price spike. Mutuum’s two-borrowing protocol and imminent Sepolia Testnet release provide it with actual fundamentals to justify the buzz, which most initial-stage projects don’t have. Investors searching for which crypto to buy today for short-term exposure are taking note, knowing that MUTM is likely the next crypto to hit $1. This positions it as the top altcoin for investors wanting to profit from short-term appreciation and long-term potential ahead of the 2025 bull run crest.

Jay works from a cluttered home office in a three‑story Victorian near Haight‑Ashbury in San Francisco. According to him, the problem is simple. “There’s a lot more that can go wrong with Nvidia than can go right,” Goldberg said. Out of 80 analysts covering the company, 73 have it rated as a buy. Six call it a hold. Only Jay says sell. Nvidia’s stock has jumped more than 3,000% since the beginning of 2020, making it the strongest performer in the S&P 500. The demand for its graphics processing units, or GPUs, has helped fuel both the U.S. economy and market records. Yet Goldberg does not see this as a sign of stability. He sees too much blind confidence and too little evidence of sustainable return. Going against Wall Street’s direction Goldberg admits he does not mind being the outlier. “I’m probably a little cantankerous by nature, so I’m skeptical of all of the hype around AI right now,” Jay said. “This is not my first bubble.” He covers twelve companies in total. Nvidia is the only one he rates as a sell. He has buy ratings on Apple, Netgear, Broadcom, and Arm Holdings. All of those companies are exposed to the AI boom, but Goldberg argues the real foundation of AI spending lies with six firms: Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Oracle, and OpenAI. Their spending has driven Nvidia to a valuation of about $4.5 trillion. The five publicly traded firms in that group are expected to spend nearly $400 billion in capital expenditures this year, up more than 67% from the prior year. OpenAI has plans to spend more than $1 trillion. But with four of those firms reporting earnings soon, investors are asking what actual returns justify these costs. Jay compares the situation to the telecom buildout during the dot‑com bubble. Cisco Systems soared on infrastructure spending back then, only to collapse when the traffic failed to appear. Cisco still has not regained its peak from 2000. “That feels very strongly like the pattern we’re seeing now,” Goldberg said . “We’re going to build up all this AI stuff for what are largely psychological reasons. At some point, the spending will stop, and the whole thing will tumble down, and we’ll reset.” Bulls push back, but questions remain Since Jay initiated coverage on April 30, Nvidia shares have risen more than 70%. The average analyst target is now $220, about 18% above the recent close of $186.26. Bulls argue that demand is still in early stages. Frank Lee at HSBC recently raised his target to $320, calling for broader adoption of AI accelerators. But Jay questions where upside remains if Nvidia is already close to fully sold out. His target is $100, the lowest on the Street. He also raises concerns about electricity availability for new data centers and the leverage tied to their construction. “Once you trace down where all these GPUs are going, you get into the weeds of the neoclouds and all these electricity and property deals that are taking place,” Goldberg said. “It’s easy to see how some obscure company fails and that cascades down the rest of the supply chain.” Jay keeps shelves of old phones, camcorders, and a Qualcomm server that never made it to market, a reminder of how fast technology leaders can turn into history.

The traders behind the metal’s daily moves,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/gold-prices-are-picked-by-these-guys/,"There is a small group of traders, analysts, and bullion specialists who monitor global markets full-time and then decide on its prices every single day. These guys sit in offices across New York, London, Zurich, and Hong Kong, staring at screens while the rest of the world checks what gold costs on their phones, according to Yahoo Finance. This small network of professionals sets the tone for what the world pays, from the bars stored in central bank vaults to the coins sold at retail counters. How spot and futures define the global gold market The market operates with two main prices: the spot price (what gold trades for right now per ounce) and the futures price (what gold will trade for at a date in the future). The spot price is what investors refer to as the real-time value of gold in its pure, physical form. Think of it as the wholesale rate, not the number you’ll pay if you walk into a shop. That’s because the retail price adds something called the gold premium, which covers refining, minting, marketing, dealer expenses, and profit margins. Add it all up, and you have what regular buyers actually pay. Gold ETFs, like SPDR Gold Shares or iShares Gold Trust, closely track that spot price because they’re backed by physical reserves. In futures, some people cash out before the contract expires, while others take actual delivery. Either way, these contracts are traded on major exchanges, making them far more liquid than physical gold itself. But what really changes the price comes down to supply and demand attached to events happening outside the trading floor. Politics, inflation, and central banks drive demand So far this year, global investors dumped riskier assets for gold, pushing futures up by 46% by September. Central banks also play a huge role. They buy gold to hedge against inflation and protect national reserves from currency collapse. When the U.S. dollar weakened this year, central banks, especially those in Asia and the Middle East, began adding more gold to their holdings to reduce dependence on the dollar. Interest rates are another point. When they’re up, gold tends to fall because it doesn’t yield interest. But when rates drop, gold becomes more attractive. Inflation has the opposite effect; higher inflation pushes investors to buy more gold, lifting prices. Mining production adds to that mix. Rising production costs or supply shortages tighten global supply, often sending prices higher. Between April 1934 and July 1970, gold dropped 65%. From 1970 to 1980, it soared 850%. Then it crashed 82% between 1980 and 2001, before climbing 591% from 2001 to 2025.

Following two weeks of market correction, the premier cryptocurrency attempted a price rebound, reaching around $112,000 before retracing to $107,000 price zone. Presently, Bitcoin trades in the $111,000 price range after some steady gains in the past 48 hours. Interestingly, a popular analyst with the X username DaanCrypto has identified an insightful trend amidst this market uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase Signals Accumulation Before Next Growth Wave Sideways Bitcoin Market Sets Stage For Explosive Move As Liquidity Builds In a post on Friday, DaanCrypto shared an important on-chain development of the Bitcoin market following the highly volatile price moves in October 2025. Despite the consistent price swings, the analyst explains that BTC has remained locked in a local price range over the past two weeks, with its present price hovering above the midpoint of this structure. This sideways action has been driven by buyers and sellers repeatedly foiling each other’s attempts to break out, thereby preventing the asset from establishing a decisive breakout pattern. Amid the continuous consolidation, untriggered liquidation levels are accumulating just above and below the local price range. This pattern is typical of Bitcoin’s pre-breakout phases. DaanCrypto explains that the longer the price consolidates within a tight corridor, the more liquidity pools build up outside it. Notably, when price eventually sweeps these clusters, it often triggers a cascade of liquidations and stop orders, which fuel the next large price move. Using data from Coinglass, DaanCrypto has identified $106,000 as a level with the heaviest concentration of long liquidations. Therefore, this price point functions as a critical support zone, and a downward wick below which could trigger selling forces pushing Bitcoin to deeper levels. Meanwhile, the $115,000 region holds a thick short-side liquidity, meaning a push above this threshold could fuel a rapid short squeeze and propel BTC to higher levels, perhaps beyond its current all-time high at $126,210. Related Reading: Why The Dogecoin 3.49% Annual Inflation Is Actually Not A Bug Bitcoin Still On For A Comeback? In contrast to popular sentiments of an “Uptober” and blooming Q4, Bitcoin has failed to achieve a sustainable price growth in October. A report from the Bitcoin Archive states that the crypto asset’s return in Q4 2025 is now estimated at -2.84%. This figure shows an extreme underperformance as Bitcoin’s average Q4 is valued at 74.77%. However, with over 60 days remaining until the end of 2025, there is still ample time for the premier cryptocurrency to pull off a market recovery. After the CPI data met expectations, the chances of an interest rate cut have increased, and an eventual announcement by the Federal Reserve could perhaps trigger Bitcoin’s rebound, among other factors. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $111,424, reflecting a 3.91% gain in the past seven days.

Settlement delays, cross-border bottlenecks, and multi-day fund transfers are giving way to a future where transactions settle instantly. At the center of this revolution, according to Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie, is Ripple, XRP, and its latest institutional move, the acquisition of Hidden Road. A New Financial Era Emerging In a video clip shared on X by SMQKE, Gilbertie praised Ripple’s progress and positioned it as a catalyst for the next generation of financial systems. He stated, “Bitcoin is a store of value, a brilliant idea, a digital store of value, but XRP has a use case, a legitimate use case. I think XRP is a wonderful working model, and it’s only going to get better.” Gilbertie’s comments underscore a critical distinction between Bitcoin’s role as a digital commodity and Ripple’s focus on real-world utility through institutional-grade financial settlement. His remarks reflect a growing sentiment among traditional finance executives that Ripple’s blockchain technology could reshape how money moves across markets. TEUCRIUM CEO: “RIPPLE IS BUILDING THE NEW WALL STREET WITH XRP AND HIDDEN ROAD” Listen. https://t.co/dBZk7dYa7H pic.twitter.com/07Iifhazc0 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 24, 2025 Ripple’s Acquisition of Hidden Road: A Strategic Masterstroke Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road, a multi-asset prime broker, is what Gilbertie called “really big news.” He emphasized its transformative potential, saying, “That means there’ll be almost instantaneous settlement across all asset classes inside that prime broker. It’ll be a wonderful start to the new Wall Street, the new Wall Street that’s based on blockchain that moves really quickly.” Hidden Road’s infrastructure connects institutions to liquidity across digital and traditional assets. By integrating this with Ripple’s XRP Ledger and stablecoin infrastructure (RLUSD), Ripple aims to bridge the operational gap between legacy finance and the blockchain economy. The goal is simple but revolutionary: to enable instant settlement, cross-asset trading, and frictionless money movement on a global scale. From Legacy Delays to Instant Money Gilbertie highlighted one of the clearest benefits of Ripple’s approach, eliminating inefficiencies that have plagued financial systems for decades. “No more three days for wire transfers, we’re going to have instant money , and that’s good,” he said. That statement captures the essence of Ripple’s vision: replacing multi-day settlements with near-instant, blockchain-based transfers that maintain compliance and transparency. This evolution aligns perfectly with Ripple’s broader mission, to modernize global payments infrastructure for institutions, governments, and enterprises alike. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Validation and Industry Impact For a traditional finance executive like the Teucrium CEO to speak so favorably of Ripple is significant. Teucrium, an established player in the ETF and commodities space , represents the institutional segment Ripple aims to serve. Gilbertie’s public acknowledgment of XRP’s utility signals mainstream acceptance of blockchain technology as more than speculative; it’s now being recognized as functional infrastructure for the financial world. Industry analysts have noted that Ripple’s growing portfolio, including XRP, RLUSD, and now Hidden Road, positions the company to handle tokenized assets, settlement, and liquidity provisioning all under one ecosystem. This integration could redefine how institutional trading desks operate, potentially ushering in a faster, more transparent version of Wall Street powered by blockchain rails. Building the New Wall Street As Gilbertie aptly described, Ripple’s expansion “will be a wonderful start to the new Wall Street.” It’s a vision of finance where asset settlement is instant, liquidity is borderless, and blockchain is the backbone of every transaction. With Hidden Road under its umbrella and XRP serving as the connective layer between markets, Ripple isn’t merely participating in financial innovation; it’s architecting the future of it. And as SMQKE’s post helped bring to light, that future may arrive sooner than most expect. In Gilbertie’s words, this isn’t just a technological milestone, it’s “the new Wall Street that’s based on blockchain that moves really quickly.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The token traded around $2.60 on Saturday after rebounding from a key support level, supported by renewed confidence from CEO Brad Garlinghouse. XRP Holds Key Support Zone XRP has maintained a strong base at the lower trendline of its long-term ascending triangle — a technical pattern that has historically preceded major rallies. Earlier in 2025, similar rebounds from this support zone led to price jumps of 70–80%. The token has climbed more than 8% from its recent low, aligning with the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) of $2.33. If momentum holds, XRP could rise toward the triangle’s upper boundary near $3.45 by December — a 35% upside from current levels. However, a breakdown below support could push the token back toward June lows near $1.65. Ripple Prime Adds Institutional Strength Ripple strengthened its market position on Friday by acquiring Hidden Road and rebranding it as Ripple Prime , positioning the firm as the first crypto company to operate a global, multi-asset prime brokerage. The company said: “Ripple’s foundational digital asset infrastructure across payments, crypto custody and stablecoin, as well as the use of XRP, will complement the services offered within Ripple Prime.” CEO Brad Garlinghouse called the move “another step toward building an Internet of Value,” adding that “XRP sits at the center of everything Ripple does.” Market Reaction and Analyst Expectations Analysts view Ripple Prime as a major step in XRP’s institutional adoption story. Trader Credibull Crypto said Ripple’s massive XRP holdings give it a strong incentive to drive the token’s success, since higher valuations directly benefit the company’s balance sheet. Ripple also announced plans to buy $1 billion worth of XRP to create a new treasury fund, which will trade on Nasdaq under the “XRPN” ticker. Another analyst, Zeiierman Trading, said XRP could surpass $3 in the short term due to the Hidden Road acquisition, noting that “the token is now positioned at the center of institutional adoption.” With strong technical support and a growing institutional push, XRP could continue its upward trajectory as Ripple expands its global footprint.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-25 18:23:45

Both tokens are still far below the $0.10 mark, but their growing communities and strategic development paths presage explosive growth in the next few months. SHIB, which started life as a meme token, has developed with ecosystem expansion and burns that ensure its continued relevance among top altcoins. While that’s happening, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto that costs a mere $0.035, is gaining traction for its revolutionary dual-lending protocol that combines peer-to-peer and liquidity pool designs, providing investors with utility and long-term appreciation. With a whole market ready to experience fresh bullish pressure, these two low-cost cryptos are setting up to be breakout plays into 2025, with MUTM in particular being the next crypto to hit $1 for early investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dances Towards Pivotal Accumulation Zone as Bulls Wait for Reversal Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains in a long-term declining channel that started in late 2021, all the while making decreasing highs beneath a resisting downtrend line. The meme token is currently near a critical horizontal support level between $0.0000090 and $0.0000100 that has served as an essential reversal and accumulation level for SHIB in the past. This level has proven to be resilient in past market declines, often serving as the genesis for strong bullish rallies. If buyers hold this level once more, a potential rebound could set the stage for additional upside momentum as the next cycle commences. While investors are cautiously observing whether SHIB can regain strength from this key support level, other investors are also following closely Mutuum Finance (MUTM) too, a DeFi crypto startup that’s gaining popularity fast among those seeking high-upside plays in 2025 and looking for the next crypto to hit $1. Mutuum Finance Experiences Explosive Growth in 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the most sought-after coin of 2025 following a record-breaking presale. Six phases in, the protocol has recorded $17.85 million in sales of its coins to more than 17,400 investors, with Phase 6 more than three-quarters complete now. With its current price standing at $0.035, MUTM offers investors the lowest entry point prior to the next stage in order to enjoy a 14.28% price value gain. It is an early investment for before a period of huge growth. As an investor looking for a high-potential cryptocurrency with early gains, MUTM tops the list with DeFi crypto innovation, practical real-world application, and long-term promise, making it a serious candidate for the next crypto to hit $1. Earn Passive Income with Crypto Members on the MUTM platform are able to stake their cryptocurrencies, such as USDT, into the liquidity pool and earn passive return in the form of APY . Since rates of APY are dependent on market demand, your return will also change with time. If an average rate of 10% APY, your $70,000 will be $7,000 every year as return. Your crypto wealth grows without you having to be actively involved. Borrow Without Liquidating Your Assets The platform also provides an opportunity to the lenders to obtain a cash loan without liquidating their cryptos. As an example, if you have ETH but wish to use cash for daily expenditures or other investments, you can take a USDT loan on your ETH as collateral. The loan is not term collateralized; the interest is paid in the form of an APY that will keep pace with current market conditions. The Cheap Cryptos You Need With the market positioning itself for a fresh wave of bullish activity, cheap tokens such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are giving investors a final opportunity to acquire positions prior to breakout activity. SHIB’s return to key levels of accumulation can be the beginning of a new rally, but it is Mutuum Finance’s Phase 6 presale, which is more than 75% sold out at $0.035, that is causing ripples. With its real DeFi crypto use case, passive income potential, and staggering community growth, MUTM could very well be the next crypto to hit $1. The clock is ticking, early adopters could be the ones celebrating when the next big crypto rotation begins, cementing MUTM’s position as the top DeFi crypto project and a must-watch next crypto to hit $1.

New data revealed BTC inactive for seven or more years, showing significant activity. So far this year, 270,000 BTC have been transformed, which is a new all-time high. This figure has already surpassed 2024’s 255,000 BTC and far exceeded 2023’s 59,000 BTC, with two months still remaining. 2025 Becomes Year of the Awakening CryptoQuant explained that Bitcoin’s surge in long-dormant coin movements may stem from several factors, such as old miners relocating long-held reserves, transferring funds to fresh cold wallets for enhanced security, and partial liquidations as elevated prices present lucrative opportunities. At the current pace, 2025 could see more than 300,000 BTC with 7+ years of dormancy being moved. Adding to the trend, a tweet from on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain highlighted a miner wallet 18eY9o, which has been dormant for 14 years and holding 4,000 BTC mined in 2009 and consolidated in 2011, recently became active. The wallet holder transferred 150 BTC, which is worth roughly $16.59 million. This move is part of the broader pattern of early-era coins resurfacing, suggesting both strategic repositioning by miners and renewed liquidity from historically inactive addresses. Bitcoin noted a modest 2.1% surge in the past day as it trades at $111,178. With more long-held coins potentially entering circulation, it would be interesting to see how these dormant Bitcoin awakenings could influence price trends and investor behavior in the final months of the year. Dormant Bitcoins Awakening In September, a 12-year-old miner-era wallet transferred 400.08 BTC, valued at roughly $44 million, to multiple new addresses. The coins were originally mined 15 years ago. A humorous X post even noted the generational wealth unlocked by awakening a decade-old wallet. Earlier, in July, a 14-year-dormant wallet containing over 80,000 BTC moved 20,000 BTC worth $2.4 billion, with billions more sent to institutional custodian Galaxy Digital. The reactivation of multiple wallets, some funneling funds to exchanges like Binance and Bybit, drew immediate comparisons to the Mt. Gox trustee sell-offs of 2024 and raised fears of a market correction.

Platform officials stated that it has never released any cryptocurrency, token, or smart contract addresses, nor has it participated in any investment projects. The statement emphasized that the organization's mission is to “spread free, high-quality education globally,” and that users will never be asked for money or asked to download apps.

This revelation comes after the crypto prediction platform’s founder, Shayne Coplan, teased the potential launch of a “POLY” token. Token Release To Come After US App Launch In a recent interview, Moddaber disclosed that Polymarket will eventually launch a crypto token, which will be accompanied by an airdrop. The company’s executive claimed that they intend to provide value through the potential launch of a cryptocurrency. Moddaber said in the interview: We could have launched a token whenever we wanted, and it’s just how thorough we want to be about it. We want it to be a token with true utility, longevity, and to be around forever, right? That’s what we expect from ourselves, and that’s what I think everyone in the space expects from us. However, the Polymarket Chief Marketing Officer highlighted that the primary focus is currently on the US app launch. As Bitcoinist reported in September, the crypto prediction platform has received the green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to launch in the United States. Moddaber questioned the need to rush a crypto token launch when the priority should be on the US app. “After the US launch, there will be a focus on the token and getting that live and making sure that it’s well done,” the marketing executive said. While Polymarket has had its fair share of trouble with the regulatory authorities in recent years, the recent approval by the US CFTC represented the end of investigations into the crypto prediction platform. Polymarket Continues Massive Valuation Growth Polymarket, which gained prominence in 2024 during the 2024 US elections, has become a major player in the prediction market over the past year. As a result of this growing popularity, the firm has been able to secure a number of partnerships in recent months. Most recently, the crypto prediction firm secured a $2 billion investment from the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE’s) parent company, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). This funding round brought its valuation to around $9 billion earlier this month. According to the latest report, the company is reportedly preparing for another funding round, as it eyes a $15-billion valuation.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|Poly|Polymarket|Token Airdrop,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|AIRDROP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 19:00:49

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/credible-crypto-ripple-will-do-everything-to-make-xrp-successful-heres-why/,"Ripple’s recent streak of high-profile acquisitions is painting a clear picture of ambition and intent, a deliberate march toward solidifying its position as the global leader in blockchain-powered finance. Beneath the surface, each acquisition appears to serve a single underlying mission: building an interconnected network where Ripple’s XRP becomes indispensable to global value movement. Credible Crypto’s latest analysis underscores this reality, emphasizing that Ripple has every reason and every incentive to ensure XRP’s long-term success. Ripple’s Expanding Empire: Strategic Acquisitions with a Purpose In less than two years, Ripple has announced five major acquisitions, each one strategically aligned with its vision of an “Internet of Value.” These include: Metaco (2023) – a Switzerland-based digital asset custody firm that strengthened Ripple’s tokenization and custody capabilities. Standard Custody (2024) – a regulated custody platform acquired to expand Ripple’s institutional-grade digital asset infrastructure. Rail (August 2025) – focused on stablecoin payment rails, designed to make cross-border transactions faster and cheaper. GTreasury (October 2025) – enhancing Ripple’s corporate treasury and liquidity management capabilities. Hidden Road (October 2025) – recently rebranded as Ripple Prime , marking Ripple’s entry into the prime brokerage space for institutional digital asset trading. ""I’m reminding you all that $XRP sits at the center of everything Ripple does."" Said this before and I'll say it again.

Ripple’s Incentive: Why XRP Must Succeed Credible Crypto’s X post draws attention to a simple but powerful truth: Ripple’s fortune is directly tied to the success of XRP. With approximately 100 billion XRP ever created, a substantial portion of which remains locked in Ripple-controlled escrow accounts, the company stands to benefit immensely from any sustained appreciation in XRP’s value. As Credible Crypto noted, when a company holds such a massive reserve of a digital asset scheduled for gradual release over the next decade, it will “do everything in its power to make that asset successful.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s efforts — from enterprise integrations to institutional partnerships- reflect this alignment of incentives. Every partnership, every acquisition, and every technological rollout increases the potential for XRP’s utility and, by extension, its market value. Building Real-World Utility: From Stablecoins to Institutional Settlement Ripple’s strategy is not about speculation; it’s about utility-driven growth. The company’s launch of RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, and the integration of institutional-grade solutions like Ripple Prime and GTreasury create the financial ecosystem needed to embed XRP into real-world financial flows. By combining custody, liquidity, and settlement under one umbrella, Ripple is designing a framework where XRP functions as the native bridge asset across all its platforms. This means banks, treasurers, and financial institutions can execute cross-border settlements, stablecoin conversions, and liquidity sourcing seamlessly, with XRP quietly powering the backbone of those transactions. The Bigger Picture: Incentives Meeting Execution Credible Crypto’s conclusion is clear: Ripple’s incentive is not theoretical; it is operational. The company’s acquisitions, product launches, and partnerships all point toward one direction — an integrated financial infrastructure where XRP is indispensable. With institutional adoption growing, regulatory uncertainties easing, and Ripple’s ecosystem rapidly expanding, the groundwork for XRP’s next growth phase appears firmly in place. Whether markets fully price in this alignment between Ripple’s strategy and XRP’s utility remains to be seen, but one fact is undeniable: Ripple is building for the long game, and XRP sits at the center of it all.

From blockchain’s promise of decentralization to the ever-present debate on data ownership, the reliability and ethics of advanced systems are paramount. This vigilance extends beyond finance to everyday applications, particularly when an AI security system misfires with alarming consequences, challenging our trust in the very technology meant to protect us. Imagine a scenario where a simple snack could trigger a full-blown security alert, leading to a student being handcuffed. This isn’t a dystopian novel; it’s a real-world incident that unfolded at Kenwood High School in Baltimore County, Maryland, highlighting the complex and sometimes unsettling implications of AI deployment in sensitive environments. The event serves as a stark reminder that while AI promises efficiency, its flaws can have profound human impacts, echoing the scrutiny applied to any centralized system in the crypto world. The Alarming Reality of AI Security Systems in Schools The incident at Kenwood High School involved student Taki Allen, who found himself in a distressing situation after an AI security system flagged his bag of Doritos as a potential firearm. Allen recounted to CNN affiliate WBAL, “I was just holding a Doritos bag — it was two hands and one finger out, and they said it looked like a gun.” The immediate consequence was severe: Allen was made to kneel, hands behind his back, and was handcuffed by authorities. Principal Katie Smith confirmed that the school’s security department had reviewed and canceled the gun detection alert. However, before this cancellation was fully communicated, the situation escalated, with the school resource officer involving local police. Omnilert, the company behind the AI gun detection system, acknowledged the incident, stating, “We regret that this incident occurred and wish to convey our concern to the student and the wider community affected by the events that followed.” Despite this regret, Omnilert maintained that “the process functioned as intended.” This statement itself raises critical questions about what ‘intended function’ means when it results in a false accusation and physical restraint. Understanding the Peril of AI False Positives The incident at Kenwood High School serves as a stark reminder of the challenges posed by false positive alerts generated by AI systems. A false positive occurs when an AI system incorrectly identifies a non-threat as a threat. In this case, a common snack item was mistaken for a weapon, leading to an unwarranted security response. The ramifications extend beyond mere inconvenience, impacting individuals directly and eroding public trust in technology designed for safety. Why do these errors happen? AI systems, especially those designed for visual detection, rely heavily on vast datasets for training. If these datasets lack diversity, are poorly annotated, or if environmental factors like lighting, angles, or object occlusion are not adequately represented, the system can misinterpret benign objects. A Doritos bag, under certain conditions, might possess visual characteristics that, to a machine learning algorithm, superficially resemble the outline of a firearm. The consequences of such errors in high-stakes environments like schools are significant: Student Trauma: Being falsely accused and subjected to security protocols can be a deeply traumatic experience for a student. Resource Misallocation: Law enforcement and school personnel resources are diverted to address non-existent threats. Erosion of Trust: Repeated incidents can lead to skepticism and distrust in the very systems meant to ensure safety, potentially hindering their effectiveness when real threats emerge. Unpacking Algorithmic Bias in AI Surveillance Beyond simple misidentification, the incident at Kenwood High School raises uncomfortable questions about algorithmic bias , a persistent challenge in AI development. Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system’s output that create unfair outcomes, such as favoring or disfavoring particular groups of people. While the direct link to racial bias wasn’t explicitly stated in Taki Allen’s case, such incidents often spark broader discussions about how AI systems, trained on potentially biased data, might disproportionately affect certain demographics. Consider these points regarding algorithmic bias in AI security: Training Data: If the datasets used to train AI models are not diverse or representative of the population, the AI may perform poorly when encountering individuals or objects outside its ‘learned’ parameters. This can lead to higher error rates for certain groups or in specific contexts. Contextual Understanding: AI currently struggles with nuanced contextual understanding. It sees patterns but often lacks the common sense to interpret situations beyond its programmed parameters, making it prone to errors when objects are presented in unusual ways or are not perfectly matched to its threat library. Ethical Implications: Relying on AI for critical judgments, especially in environments involving minors, demands rigorous ethical review. The potential for an algorithm to make life-altering decisions based on imperfect data is a significant concern. Addressing algorithmic bias requires continuous auditing of AI systems, diversifying training data, and involving diverse perspectives in the development and deployment phases to ensure fairness and accuracy. Navigating Privacy Concerns in an AI-Driven World For those attuned to the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency, the proliferation of AI surveillance systems raises significant privacy concerns . The incident at Kenwood High School is not just about a mistaken identity; it’s about the pervasive nature of AI monitoring in public and semi-public spaces, and the implications for individual autonomy and data rights. The very presence of an AI system constantly scanning for threats means constant data collection, processing, and analysis of individuals’ movements and belongings. Key privacy considerations include: Constant Surveillance: Students and staff are under continuous digital scrutiny, potentially creating an environment of mistrust and reducing feelings of personal freedom. Data Handling: Who owns the data collected by these systems? How is it stored, secured, and used? The lack of transparency around data governance is a major red flag for privacy advocates. Mission Creep: What starts as a gun detection system could potentially expand to monitor other behaviors, raising questions about the scope of surveillance and potential for misuse. False Accusations and Digital Footprints: Even if an alert is canceled, the initial flagging creates a digital record. In an increasingly data-driven world, such records, however erroneous, could have unforeseen long-term consequences. The cryptocurrency community, deeply familiar with the fight for digital self-sovereignty, understands that such systems, while ostensibly for security, can easily become tools for pervasive monitoring, chipping away at the fundamental right to privacy. The debate around AI surveillance parallels the ongoing discussions about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their potential for governmental oversight of personal finances – a fear that drives many towards decentralized alternatives. Balancing Technology and Student Safety: A Critical Equation While the goal of enhancing student safety is paramount, the methods employed must not inadvertently cause harm or infringe upon fundamental rights. AI security systems are introduced with the best intentions: to prevent tragedies and create secure learning environments. However, the incident at Kenwood High School demonstrates that the implementation of such technology requires careful consideration of its broader impact. The core challenge lies in striking a balance: Security vs. Freedom: How much surveillance is acceptable in exchange for perceived safety? Where do we draw the line to protect students’ civil liberties and psychological well-being? Psychological Impact: For a student like Taki Allen, being handcuffed and searched due to an AI error can be a deeply unsettling and potentially traumatizing experience, impacting their sense of security and trust in authority figures. Human Element: AI is a tool, not a replacement for human judgment. The role of trained personnel in verifying alerts, de-escalating situations, and providing a human touch remains indispensable. Mitigating Risks and Ensuring Accountability To prevent similar incidents and foster trust in AI security systems, several measures are essential: Enhanced Human Oversight: AI alerts should always be treated as preliminary information, requiring human verification and contextual understanding before any action is taken. School resource officers and administrators need clear protocols for verifying alerts and de-escalating situations. Transparency and Accountability: Companies developing and deploying AI systems must be transparent about their systems’ capabilities, limitations, and error rates. Clear lines of accountability must be established when errors occur. Rigorous Testing and Training: AI models need continuous, diverse, and real-world testing to reduce false positives and address algorithmic biases. Training data should reflect a wide range of scenarios and demographics. Community Engagement: Schools and authorities should engage with students, parents, and the wider community to discuss the deployment of AI systems, address concerns, and build consensus. Policy Development: Clear, ethical guidelines and policies are needed for the responsible deployment of AI in sensitive environments like schools, balancing security needs with privacy rights and civil liberties. The incident at Kenwood High School is a potent reminder that technology, no matter how advanced, is only as good as its design, implementation, and the human oversight it receives. While AI offers powerful tools for security, its deployment must be tempered with a deep understanding of its limitations and a steadfast commitment to human dignity and rights. Conclusion The case of the Doritos bag mistaken for a firearm by an AI security system at Kenwood High School underscores a critical dilemma in our increasingly tech-driven world. While the promise of AI for enhancing student safety is compelling, the realities of false positive alerts, potential algorithmic bias , and escalating privacy concerns demand our urgent attention. This incident is a vivid illustration of how even well-intentioned technology can have unintended and harmful consequences if not implemented with caution, transparency, and robust human oversight. As we continue to integrate AI into every facet of our lives, from financial systems to public safety, it is imperative that we prioritize ethical development, rigorous testing, and a commitment to protecting individual freedoms, ensuring that our pursuit of security does not inadvertently compromise the very liberties we aim to safeguard.

The S&P 500 finished the week at 6,791.68 while the US 100 Index reached 25,358.15, both setting new all-time highs. Easing inflation data, strong corporate earnings, and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts have all combined to keep investor sentiment bullish. Amid this record-setting environment, crypto analyst Ash Crypto posted an observation on X that asks the question of how high Bitcoin would trade when it finally catches up to the US stock market. US Stock Market’s Record-Breaking Momentum The S&P 500’s record-breaking climb represents a continuation of the stock market’s steady ascent through the second half of the year, which has been boosted by the Fed rate cut in September, expectations of further rate cuts, and confidence in corporate performance. Related Reading: Analyst Says Understanding This Bitcoin Structure Is Like Having A Superpower The tech-heavy US 100 Index led the charge, climbing past 25,000 for the first time ever this week as large-cap technology stocks posted strong quarterly results. This trend means that the long-running bull trend in traditional markets is intact. However, what is really compelling is the contrast between Wall Street’s all-time highs and Bitcoin’s relative stagnation. After starting October in a breakout move to new all-time highs above $126,000, the leading cryptocurrency went on a flash crash that took many traders by surprise. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is consolidating around $111,000 despite other asset classes showing strength. Ash Crypto’s post argues that Bitcoin’s price is being artificially held back compared to how stocks have responded to the same macro backdrop. If Bitcoin had followed the percentage gains of the S&P 500 or US 100 Index, it could already be trading between $140,000 and $150,000. When Bitcoin Finally Catches Up The first surge of liquidity always appears in the stock market whenever the Fed begins to slow quantitative tightening (QT) or hints at loosening conditions. This is because the stock market is where the deepest capital pools and institutional participation exist. Equities react first because that’s where the credit channels are most established. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Sees Sharp Decline With Market Crash – Here Are The Numbers Bitcoin is still positioned outside the traditional financial system, and hence, tends to lag this initial move. But once the excess liquidity starts spilling into other assets, Bitcoin’s price has always increased at a much faster pace than stocks. According to Ash Crypto, Bitcoin will catch up soon and hit at least $130,000. Notably, Bitcoin’s on-chain data is already showing signs of the impending surge. For instance, recent figures show that available sell-side liquidity (the total amount of Bitcoin sitting on exchanges ready to be sold) has dropped to just 3.12 million BTC, its lowest point in seven years. Furthermore, data shows that long-term investors have bought 373,700 BTC in the past 30 days. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,600.

One area of focus is the pending review of crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), where delays caused by the shutdown have stalled decisions on several digital asset products . Among these, XRP is emerging as a potential frontrunner for accelerated approval once regulatory activity restarts. X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), a respected crypto commentator, highlighted this shift in a recent post , noting that “the ETF logjam is clearing” and that “fast-tracked approvals could push XRP from $3 to $10+.” His captioned analysis presented how different XRP price scenarios could significantly affect investor outcomes, using a $10,000 investment as the benchmark. What happens when the U.S. government reboots and $XRP is first in line? The ETF logjam is clearing. Fast-tracked approvals could push XRP from $3 to $10+ A $10K position could 3x or 4x Are you prepared for regulatory momentum to flip bullish? pic.twitter.com/R4UNG8ObYk — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) October 23, 2025 Regulatory Restart and Market Acceleration The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has paused various financial reviews, including those related to digital asset ETFs. Once agencies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) resume operations, pending applications are expected to move forward at a faster rate. X Finance Bull shared an image emphasizing that this acceleration could benefit XRP’s standing among institutional products, potentially making it one of the first assets to gain from resumed regulatory processing. According to his data, the “base/steady” scenario envisions XRP at $3, generating an approximate 24.5% return on a $10,000 investment. The “bullish” case sees XRP at $5 , turning the initial investment to $20,745 with a return of 107.5%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The “very bullish” scenario projects a price of $10, which would send the $10,000 investment to $41,490, representing a 314.9% gain. The projections aim to demonstrate how market confidence and ETF approvals might enhance both liquidity and investor exposure to XRP. What to Expect from XRP The central argument in X Finance Bull’s post is that the combination of renewed regulatory activity and ETF approvals could act as a catalyst for XRP’s next major movement . If the shutdown’s conclusion leads to expedited SEC reviews, XRP may benefit from renewed institutional interest. Investors following these developments are now considering whether the end of the shutdown marks the beginning of a new phase for regulated crypto exposure. The prospect of regulatory momentum turning bullish, as X Finance Bull described, captures the current optimism surrounding XRP’s near-term outlook and reinforces the view that timing within the approval cycle could be crucial to capturing future gains.

The Rich Dad Poor Dad author identified Ethereum as the next big opportunity, comparable to Bitcoin when it was priced at $4,000. Indeed, his outlook comes as Ethereum continues to find ways of trading around $5,000 following recent volatility. As of press time, the second-ranked cryptocurrency was trading at $3,958, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours. ETH one-week price chart. Source: Finbold In an X post on October 25, Kiyosaki said that those who acquire Ethereum today could see returns similar to early Bitcoin investors, who capitalized on the cryptocurrency’s meteoric rise. “People who acquire Ethereum today at $4000 will be like the rich who invested in Bitcoin when it was $4000. Old thinkers will be left behind as the GAP becomes the GRAND CANYON. Consider those ideas and choose which side of the GAP you want to be on,” Kiyosaki stated. Kiyosaki’s investment mindset In his commentary, he contrasted two distinct mindsets he termed “old thinking” and “new thinking,” which, according to him, will determine how individuals fare as the wealth gap continues to widen. Kiyosaki noted that billions of people are struggling to make ends meet, cope with inflation, and maintain job security, as traditional financial strategies prove increasingly ineffective. Old thinkers rely on outdated strategies such as pursuing more schooling, working longer hours, saving in conventional currencies, and depending on retirement plans, approaches he warned will leave them further behind. In contrast, new thinkers start businesses, save in tangible assets like gold and silver , and invest in technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, with ETH offering a groundbreaking opportunity akin to early Bitcoin. His outlook reinforces his long-standing advocacy for alternative assets which have the potential to preserve wealth ahead of his projected economic downturn .

The Nasdaq-listed company saw its total revenue for the fiscal third quarter of 2025 fall to $81.1 million, down from $95.4 million a year earlier. A 55% decline in Bitcoin mined led to digital asset self-mining revenue dipping from $68.1 million to $57.4 million. However, the impact of the decline was partially offset by an 88% rise in the average Bitcoin price. Hosted mining revenue plummeted to $8.7 million from $16.9 million, reflecting what the company described as a “continued strategic shift” toward its expanding high-density colocation business. HDC revenue up despite total revenue decline Revenue from high-density colocation, formerly known as high-performance computing (HPC) hosting, rose to $15 million from $10.3 million a year ago, which may be considered a small win as the company’s pivot toward artificial intelligence–focused infrastructure. Core Scientific reported gross profit of $3.9 million from a loss of $0.2 million, while net loss dropped to $146.7 million from $455.3 million in the same quarter last year. It attributed the relatively smaller loss to a lower non-cash fair value adjustment of $74.9 million, down from $408.5 million a year ago, and this is related to warrant and contingent value right remeasurements. Adjusted EBITDA turned negative at $2.4 million, compared with $10.1 million a year earlier. It was reportedly weighed down by increased operating expenses and lower revenue. Capital expenditures (capex) totaled $244.5 million, and $196.4 million of the capex was funded by CoreWeave under existing colocation agreements. The company ended the quarter with $694.8 million in liquidity, comprising $453.4 million in cash and equivalents and $241.4 million in Bitcoin. A transition toward high-density colocation Once one of North America’s largest Bitcoin miners, Core Scientific has been steadily repurposing its vast data center footprint to serve AI workloads and enterprise clients. The third-quarter uptick in HDC revenue highlights early traction in this direction, though it still represents a small fraction of total income. With mining yields shrinking and energy costs rising, companies like Core Scientific are rebranding themselves as partners to the artificial intelligence boom, leveraging their access to power and data center capacity. The company stated that it plans to “rapidly increase revenue derived from high-density colocation” and convert most of its remaining mining facilities to support AI-related workloads. Merger uncertainty grows ahead of shareholder vote CoreWeave announced in July that it had reached an agreement with Core Scientific to acquire it in an all-stock transaction valuing the miner at roughly $9 billion. The merger is expected to help CoreWeave, whose business reportedly accounts for 76% of Core Scientific’s revenue, expand its AI infrastructure footprint. However, the deal has faced growing resistance. A proxy advisory firm recently recommended that investors vote against the acquisition, as it reportedly stated that Core Scientific could sustain the “considerable success” it has so far achieved as a standalone company. Some large shareholders have also voiced opposition to the acquisition, and one of them is Core Scientific’s third-largest shareholder, Gullane Capital. Its founder, Trip Miller, reportedly said , “Under the math of the deal today, I would have to vote no.” Another investor, Two Seas Capital, also said it would be voting against the deal. The fate of the acquisition now lies on the results of the upcoming shareholders’ meeting scheduled for October 30, as the investors are expected to cast their votes there.

Bitcoin remained above $111,000, while other top coins like Ethereum and Solana were up significantly from its lowest level this month. This article provides the forecasts for some notable coins like Jupiter (JUP), Hyperliquid (HYPER), and XRP. Jupiter price prediction Jupiter is a top player in the Solana ecosystem, where it runs one of the biggest perpetual exchanges. It has launched numerous solutions in the past few months, including a lending platform with over $800 million in assets and a prediction platform in collaboration with Kalshi. Jupiter price has rebounded in the past few weeks, moving from a low of $0.1070 on October 11 to $0.4330, its highest point on October 9. It has now crossed the important resistance level at $0.4045, its highest point on October 14. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have all pointed upwards, a sign that the trend is strengthening. It has moved above the Major S/R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Therefore, the most likely Jupiter price forecast is bullish, with the initial target being at $0.50, the strong pivot reversal point of the MML tool. This target is about 15% above the current level. A move below the support at $0.4046 will invalidate the bullish outlook. JUP price chart | Source: TradingView Hyperliquid price forecast Hyperliquid is a major player in the perpetual trading industry, where it handles volume worth billions of dollars a day. Its volume this month stood at over $252 billion, meaning that it may pass or equal its September volume of over $280 billion. HYPE price has pulled back from the year-to-date high of $59.2 in September to the current $43. Most recently, it has bounced back from a low of $31.68 as the crypto market rebounded. This rebound happened as it filed to raise $1 billion public offering to buy HYPE . The coin is attempting to move above the 50-day and 25-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It is also attempting to rise above the lower side of the ascending channel. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index has crossed the neutral point, while the two lines of the MACD indicator have made a bullish crossover. Therefore, the token will likely keep rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $50. HYPE price chart | Source: TradingView XRP price prediction The daily chart shows that the XRP price has rebounded in the past few weeks. It has jumped from a low of $1.7775 on October 11 to the current $2.60. The chart shows that the Ripple price has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. This is one of the most popular bullish reversal pattern. The token is about to move above the 50-day and 25-day Exponential Moving Averages. Also, the two lines of the MACD have formed a bullish reversal pattern, while the Relative Strength has jumped.

XRP is continuing to gain institutional attention due to its growing cross-border payment collaborations and growing worldwide adoption from global financial institutions. With it is also Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a dark horse, a very promising DeFi cryptocurrency in Phase 6 of presale. The tokens cost $0.035 and the phase is less than 25% remaining before sell out. For those investors looking for what crypto to buy before the next bull wave, XRP and MUTM are two initiatives which are at the precipice of established credibility and high-upside innovation and therefore represent large decisions before November 2025. Investors who want a solid early-stage position can see MUTM as the crypto to buy now. XRP Picking Up Speed as Bulls Set Up for a Breakthrough Ripple (XRP) is picking up momentum, maintaining ground in the $2.40 region after bouncing off of its $2.20 support level. Consolidation mode seems to be coming to an end as the momentum mounts quietly behind the scenes showing that purchasing pressure is taking over. A convincing breakout above $2.66 could herald the start of XRP’s next leg higher potentially aiming for the $3.10–$3.50 area, last viewed during its previous major rally. This configuration closely resembles the “bullish beauty” pattern seen in previous market cycles, whereby XRP’s accumulation periods also tended to be followed by robust upside action. While traders track this emerging potential breakout, quite a number of investors are also looking towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new DeFi coin that is building momentum among those interested in the next high-upside crypto to buy now before 2025’s market upswing. For anyone considering what crypto to buy in 2025, MUTM is being closely watched. Relentless Growth at Mutuum Finance Boosts Investor Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the buzz in DeFi circles as one of the most potential cryptos to watch out for this year. The token is currently on Presale Phase 6, and its price is $0.035, 16.17% higher than Phase 5, and this is as cheap as it comes. Demand has been extremely robust, with over 17,400 members contributing over $17.85 million to date. With over 75% of Phase 6 sold out, Mutuum Finance is showing tremendous investor appetite and emerging as a long-term value, high-growth DeFi crypto. Early investors see MUTM as a prime candidate for crypto to buy now, while others keep it on their radar when deciding what crypto to buy. Whatever the case, the crypto is seeing strong FOMO. Double Market Models: P2C and P2P Mutuum Finance operates under two core markets: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C marketplace, the users lend or borrow the crypto assets with the help of smart contracts, which allow the transaction to occur automatically. The automated process provides seamless, transparent, and secure operations to all the customers without any human intervention and with minimized risk. P2P market offers lending and borrowing between users directly without accessing the common liquidity pool. The structure is secure with high-grade tokens only, no centralized coins, exploit risk tokens, or no limit minting tokens. APY rates on this market are demand-based for a specific token, thus offering flexibility to lenders and borrowers and the potential for higher returns. All P2P and P2C marketplace transactions are made secure using audited, decentralized smart contracts. This offers a secure and stable platform where users can lend, borrow, and offer assets with trust as the prime focus of mind that their funds are guarded by sophisticated blockchain algorithms. Buy Now Before November While Ripple is still holding on to its run irrespective of volatility in the markets, all the real hype is going to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi protocol under the radar with true-world use case and high investor adoption. The clock is ticking for anyone who wants to get in on early exposure prior to the next phase and price increase. While investors hedge their bets for the potential market reversal in November, MUTM can be the smartest early bet before the next crypto bull leg begins, the crypto to buy now that offers low-cost entry and high potential.

CZ, who just a year ago was serving a four-month prison sentence for allowing money launderers to use his crypto platform Binance, is now walking free and back in the corridors of influence. His company was fined $4 billion, and he personally paid $50 million while stepping down as CEO. Yet this week, his name is cleared, and the man behind one of the biggest scandals in crypto is once again welcome in Trump’s America. For Binance, the pardon is redemption, after a huge political investment that paid off. The company spent months rebuilding its network in D.C., aligning itself with Trump’s pro-crypto stance and betting on the power of those closest to him. Lobbying firms cash in on Trump connections “I don’t believe I ever met him,” Trump told reporters about CZ.“But I’ve been told, a lot of support, he had a lot of support and they said that what he did is not even a crime, it wasn’t a crime, that he was persecuted by the Biden administration, and so I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of good people.” One of those “good people” appears to be Ches McDowell, a longtime hunting buddy of Donald Trump Jr. and the head of Checkmate Government Relations, a North Carolina lobbying firm that didn’t even have a Washington office until early this year. Photographers caught McDowell and Trump Jr. chatting with Trump during a White House event honoring Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist killed last year. That quiet moment symbolized just how deep these ties now run. Checkmate pulled in $7.1 million in the past three months, making it one of the highest-earning lobbying firms under Trump’s second administration. Binance hired McDowell in late September to lobby the White House and Treasury Department on financial rules and what filings called “executive relief.” For just one month, Binance paid $450,000. But CZ’s push for a pardon began far earlier. In February, three weeks after Trump’s inauguration, Binance and CZ also hired Teresa Goody Guillén, a prominent crypto lawyer and former SEC contender under Trump. Her firm has already earned $290,000 this year from both clients. After the pardon was confirmed, Guillén wrote on X that she and CZ expressed their “profound gratitude to President Donald J. Trump, whose courage and moral clarity made this day possible.” Binance rebuilds its Washington presence The pardon capped nearly a year of effort by Binance to build closer ties with the Trump administration. Beyond hiring top lobbyists, Binance deepened its relationship with the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial crypto venture, a profitable enterprise that’s quietly become part of the family’s growing business network. Binance’s lobbying activity has mirrored its legal troubles. Its U.S. unit, Binance.US, hired its first lobbyist in late 2021 and spent more than $1 million on crypto lobbying in 2022. During the first nine months of 2023, as CZ and the company negotiated with prosecutors, spending rose to nearly $1.2 million. Then, when CZ pleaded guilty and stepped down, that number crashed to zero by the end of 2023. With Trump back in the White House, the engine restarted. In 2025 alone, Binance has already spent $860,000 lobbying policymakers, putting it on pace to match its previous high. In July, the company’s new CEO, Richard Teng, joined the advisory board of The Digital Chamber, the top crypto trade group in Washington. Later, Richard posted on X that “with President Trump and his administration being such a huge advocate for the crypto industry, the future is bright.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Business|Binance,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-25 20:00:41

That’s what happened when popular crypto enthusiast Diep Sanh shared a lighthearted yet thought-provoking statement on X. In his post, Diep Sanh projected that if XRP ever reached $1,000, his 1,307 XRP holdings would be worth $1.3 million, a fortune he pledged to donate almost entirely to charity, keeping only $100,000 “to buy ice cream.” The post resonated widely across the XRP community, blending humor, ambition, and philanthropy in one message. But beyond the surface, it also reignited a deeper conversation about XRP’s long-term potential, realistic price expectations, and the broader emotional connection investors have with the digital asset. When XRP hits $1000, my 1307 XRP will be worth $1.3 million. I’ll give away $1.2 million for charity… and keep $100K to buy ice cream — BD (@DiepSanh) October 25, 2025 The Dream: A Million-Dollar XRP Portfolio Diep Sanh’s viral statement encapsulates a common sentiment among XRP holders: faith in XRP’s eventual massive appreciation. With Ripple expanding aggressively into real-world financial infrastructure through acquisitions like Metaco , Standard Custody , GTreasury , and Hidden Road (now Ripple Prime), optimism surrounding the asset’s utility continues to grow. Many XRP supporters argue that Ripple’s technology, facilitating real-time settlement, cross-border payments, and liquidity management, could someday underpin a large segment of global finance. If that happens, they say, XRP could become one of the world’s most valuable digital assets. At a hypothetical $1,000 per XRP, the token’s market capitalization would exceed $50 trillion, dwarfing the entire cryptocurrency market and rivaling the GDP of major economies combined. While that figure is mathematically staggering, for devoted holders like Diep Sanh, it symbolizes more than money; it’s a reflection of belief in XRP’s long-term mission to build an “Internet of Value.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Reality: The Path to $1,000 Remains Steep Despite the excitement such posts generate, most analysts maintain that a $1,000 XRP price target is highly unrealistic under current global liquidity conditions . To reach that level, XRP would need not just mass adoption by financial institutions, but also a major reconfiguration of the global monetary system, something that would require decades of systemic evolution. Current projections from credible market analysts place XRP’s potential long-term valuation far below such extremes, emphasizing that even a rise to $10–$20 would already represent a historic achievement . Nevertheless, crypto markets have a history of defying expectations, and the narrative of “impossible targets” has often fueled retail enthusiasm and innovation alike. A Symbol of Hope and Generosity While Diep Sanh’s statement may not be an economic forecast, it carries a message of hope, community, and philanthropy. The idea of donating nearly all future gains to charity struck a chord with many in the XRP ecosystem, highlighting how the crypto space isn’t just about profit, it’s also about purpose. Whether or not XRP ever reaches such astronomical levels, posts like this remind the community of the passion that drives the industry forward. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, the mix of optimism and altruism expressed by voices like Diep Sanh’s will continue to inspire both believers and skeptics alike.

The token is trading at $2.61, marking an approximately 5% increase in the last 24 hours and standing out as the best performer among the top ten cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the second-best performer, has risen by only 0.86% in the same period. This contrast highlights how XRP’s current momentum is being fueled by a wave of positive developments surrounding Ripple and its growing network of institutional initiatives. Ripple’s Expanding Reach Through Strategic Acquisitions The rise in XRP’s price is not just another short-term rally. It comes at a time when Ripple is expanding its reach into traditional finance through a series of strategic moves. The company recently completed its acquisition of the prime brokerage platform Hidden Road in a $1.25 billion deal. The business has now been rebranded as Ripple Prime , integrating Ripple’s payment and liquidity infrastructure into a full-service institutional platform. The move positions Ripple to offer advanced trading, custody, and settlement solutions for digital and fiat assets, strengthening the utility and visibility of XRP across global markets. New Growth Channels Through GTreasury and Evernorth Another major step is Ripple’s acquisition of GTreasury for $1 billion . GTreasury is a leading treasury management software provider used by corporations for liquidity and risk management. This acquisition has excited the XRP army, as it will expand XRP’s relevance into areas such as treasury operations and enterprise liquidity management. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At the same time, Ripple-backed Evernorth is preparing to go public through a listing that could raise more than $1 billion . Evernorth plans to build and hold XRP as part of its digital treasury strategy , creating a publicly traded vehicle tied directly to the token’s growth. Backed by major investors including Ripple, SBI Holdings, and Pantera Capital, Evernorth’s structure demonstrates growing institutional confidence in XRP as a core asset for digital finance. If successful, it could become the largest public entity dedicated to holding XRP, signaling a shift toward mainstream exposure for the token. A Sign of What Lies Ahead for XRP Each of these developments points to Ripple’s evolving strategy to build an interconnected financial framework powered by XRP. The company is no longer focusing solely on payment corridors but is constructing an entire infrastructure around XRP. This strategic expansion increases the token’s utility while reinforcing its role as a bridge asset for institutional finance. Investors are excited for XRP’s future, and this rally could be an early indication of how Ripple’s ongoing expansion could soon position XRP as the leading digital asset in global finance.

Imagine a world where unique musical compositions can be conjured from simple text prompts, ready to be minted as exclusive digital assets or enhance virtual experiences. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the imminent reality as OpenAI reportedly dives into developing a new generative music tool, promising to democratize sound creation and open new avenues for digital artists and enthusiasts alike. The Dawn of Generative Music: OpenAI’s Latest Leap The news, initially reported by The Information, suggests that OpenAI, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, is expanding its creative horizons beyond text and video generation. Their new endeavor involves a sophisticated system capable of producing music from various inputs, including text descriptions and existing audio snippets. This move positions OpenAI at the forefront of a burgeoning field, pushing the boundaries of what machines can ‘understand’ and ‘create’ in the realm of auditory art. The implications for content creators, from independent musicians to large-scale media producers, are vast, offering tools that could dramatically reduce production times and costs while fostering unprecedented levels of creative experimentation. Unpacking the Potential of OpenAI’s New Creation What exactly could this new AI music tool offer? Sources close to the project hint at several transformative applications. Picture the ability to instantly generate background scores for videos, tailor-made to fit the mood and pace of the visuals. Or consider musicians who could provide a vocal track and have the AI seamlessly add a guitar accompaniment, a full orchestral backing, or even a jazz ensemble. This functionality suggests a future where musical collaboration transcends human-only interaction, allowing creators to rapidly prototype ideas, fill instrumental gaps, or even discover entirely new genres. The tool’s potential to integrate with existing platforms like ChatGPT and Sora also raises exciting possibilities for multimodal content creation, where narratives, visuals, and sounds are woven together by AI. How Does This AI Music Tool Work? While specific technical details remain under wraps, the core concept revolves around advanced machine learning models trained on vast datasets of musical scores and audio recordings. One intriguing detail mentioned in the report is OpenAI ‘s collaboration with students from the prestigious Juilliard School. This partnership involves annotating musical scores, a crucial step in providing high-quality training data for the AI. By feeding the model rich, structured musical information, OpenAI aims to teach the AI not just to produce sounds, but to understand musical theory, harmony, rhythm, and emotion. This rigorous training is essential for developing an AI music tool that can generate not just noise, but truly compelling and contextually appropriate music. The Rise of Text-to-Music: A New Creative Frontier The concept of generating music from simple text prompts, or text-to-music , represents a significant leap in human-computer interaction. Imagine typing ‘a melancholic piano piece with rain sounds for a reflective scene’ and receiving a bespoke composition within moments. This capability could empower individuals without formal musical training to bring their auditory visions to life. For seasoned professionals, it could serve as an unparalleled brainstorming partner, generating variations and ideas that might otherwise take hours or days to produce. While OpenAI has previously explored generative music models, these new developments leverage the company’s recent advancements in large language models and multimodal AI, promising a level of sophistication and coherence not seen before. Beyond the Hype: The Future of AI Innovation in Music The emergence of AI innovation in music isn’t limited to OpenAI. Companies like Google and Suno have also been making strides in generative music, showcasing the industry-wide push towards automating and assisting creative processes. This competitive landscape drives rapid development, benefiting users with increasingly powerful and accessible tools. However, this progress also brings forth critical discussions around copyright, intellectual property, and the role of human artists in an AI-augmented world. As these tools become more sophisticated, the line between human and machine creativity will blur, necessitating new frameworks for attribution, compensation, and ethical usage. The potential for AI to democratize music creation is immense, but navigating its societal impact will be crucial. Benefits of Generative Music Tools The advent of sophisticated generative music tools like the one reportedly being developed by OpenAI offers a plethora of benefits across various sectors: Democratization of Music Creation: Individuals without formal musical training can now create professional-sounding tracks, lowering the barrier to entry for aspiring artists and content creators. Accelerated Content Production: For filmmakers, game developers, advertisers, and podcasters, AI can quickly generate custom soundtracks, saving significant time and resources in post-production. Enhanced Creative Exploration: Musicians can use AI as a collaborative partner, generating new ideas, variations, or accompaniments, pushing their creative boundaries. Personalized Experiences: AI-generated music can be tailored in real-time for personalized user experiences in apps, games, or virtual environments, adapting to user actions or moods. Cost Efficiency: Reducing the need for expensive studio time, session musicians, or licensed music, making high-quality audio more accessible. Revitalization of Archival Content: AI could be used to restore or augment old recordings, or even generate new pieces in the style of historical composers. Challenges and Ethical Considerations While the promise of AI innovation in music is exciting, it also presents significant challenges and ethical dilemmas that require careful consideration: Copyright and Ownership: Who owns the copyright of AI-generated music? The developer, the user who prompted it, or the AI itself? This is a complex legal area currently being debated. Artist Displacement: Concerns exist that widespread adoption of AI music tools could reduce demand for human composers, session musicians, and sound designers. Quality and Authenticity: Can AI truly replicate human emotion and nuance in music, or will AI-generated tracks lack the ‘soul’ and authenticity listeners seek? Data Bias: If training data is biased towards certain genres or styles, the AI’s output might perpetuate those biases, limiting diversity in new music. Deepfakes and Misinformation: The ability to generate realistic audio could be misused to create deepfake voices or manipulate audio recordings, raising concerns about misinformation. Monetization Models: New models will be needed to fairly compensate all parties involved in the creation and distribution of AI-generated music.

The Solana network contributor’s latest disapproval came as a vocal reaction to Changpeng Zhao’s support for a Kyrgyzstan government CBDC pilot. Several hours ago, CZ took to X to reveal what he called “updates from Kyrgyzstan.” In the post, he listed updates such as how the country’s national stablecoin has launched on BNB Chain, how the CBDC is ready for rollout , and how the national cryptocurrency reserve has been set up with BNB included. He also expressed pride in bringing Sign, a platform that describes itself as the blockchain stack built for sovereign nations, to work with Kyrgyzstan. Mert kicks against the idea of CBDCs In his response to CZ, Mert claimed CBDCs are “*entirely* antithetical to what crypto is.” He continued , “We are trading sovereignty for surveillance, everyone must be united in saying NO to this, crypto without privacy is not crypto.” Then in another tweet, he implied that CZ, with all his experience and know-how, should not be one of those “helping nations” develop CBDCs” and called it “incredible to brag about.” “It is insane to me that the most influential person in crypto is not only promoting this, but making it happen, unbelievable, CBDCs are entirely dystopian,” Mert’s statement reads. Quite a number of commenters seemed to agree with Mert’s opinions with a considerable number claiming CZ does not actually care about the industry and will do anything “to pump his bags.” CZ’s progress update comes after his two-day trip to Kyrgyzstan CZ’s ties to Kyrgyzstan have grown since he made his first visit to Kyrgyzstan in May, when he was introduced to President Sadyr Japarov, became a member of the inaugural National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies, and signed a memorandum for crypto and blockchain collaboration. His latest comment about the country came after a second visit, which lasted for two days, and saw him in another meeting with President Sadyr Japarov, where they discussed opportunities in blockchain technology and digital economy expansion. CZ has spoken positively about the visit on X, stating he “had a great time in Kyrgyzstan” over those two days. Aside from his informal meeting with the president, CZ also joined him on a visit to Ala-Archa National Park, an excursion shared by Presidential press secretary Askat Alagozov on Facebook. With its new legislation, which includes a regulatory sandbox for testing financial solutions and a legal framework for virtual assets, stablecoins, and mining, Kyrgyzstan hopes to advance its digital asset strategy, and CZ seems committed to helping, as he has been appointed to the National Council on blockchain development in Kyrgyzstan. The former Binance CEO, who just received a pardon from Trump, has encouraged other crypto companies to explore opportunities in Kyrgyzstan, highlighting the country’s potential for digital innovation and international investment.

The community is divided about how many new NEAR tokens should be printed every year. For months, people in the community have been talking about cutting the network’s inflation rate from 5% to 2.5%. The goal was to balance NEAR token emissions with generated fees. Near is operating at a loss At the moment , the NEAR Protocol pays around $140 million worth of tokens annually to the network validators. But this amount does not make sense compared to NEAR’s total value locked (TVL) and generated revenue. The protocol has around $162 million in total value locked (TVL). To make things worse, NEAR Protocol has a lifetime revenue of only $17 million since its inception in 2020. The protocol generated $259,116 in revenue in the last 30 days based on DeFiLlama data . Securing the network is expensive compared to the generated revenue . That’s why the community is trying to fix this issue. They voted on reducing the inflation rate from 5% to 2.5%. More than 50% of voters said yes, but that’s not enough. The voting result should hit a supermajority, which is 66.67% or more. This is part of the protocol’s required rules to count the proposal as an official change. The vote has technically failed to reduce NEAR’s inflation. Devs might cut NEAR emission Some of NEAR’s core developers are hinting that they might still include the emission cut in the next software update anyway. A validator group called Chorus One called that out, saying it’s basically breaking the rules. They wrote on X, “We believe this sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the integrity of NEAR. It gives the impression that decisions can be unilaterally enforced by the core team .” To prevent this scenario, Chorus One believes that NEAR validators must be careful about the changes implemented before installing the next software upgrade. Meanwhile, Louis Thomazeau from L1D Fund defended the idea. He says cutting NEAR’s inflation is just “common sense” and that the token shouldn’t stick to rules so hard it hurts the project. Now the whole community is split. Some people say NEAR has to follow its own governance system because if it doesn’t, the rules stop meaning anything . Others say the protocol should just do what’s best for survival, even if it bends the rules a little. In the past, other well-known projects experienced similar situations that caused a split between the community, validators, and devs . Such scenarios could end up in a hard fork, like Ethereum’s split in 2016 after the infamous DAO hack that exploited millions of ETH tokens. Sometimes, enforcing a manual change could help a protocol survive. In March, a Hyperliquid trader exploited JELLY perpetuals. He basically squeezed the market and caused huge losses for the platform’s HLP vault. The Hyperliquid team delisted the JELLY perps and manually changed the oracle price to close open positions and contain losses. NEAR is currently up by 1.5% in the past 24 hours and trades at $2.29. The token ranks #52 on CoinGecko and is up by 6.5% in the past seven days. NEAR has a market cap of $2.9 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $101 million. The Layer 1 network token is down by 88.8% from its all-time high of $20.44, which was recorded in mid-2022. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

He added that more healthy bullish candles are needed to confirm a shift in momentum. For now, his attention is on the lower timeframes, where he plans to look for the next long opportunity once the current position is secured. Indecisive Daily Close Reflects Market Uncertainty After CPI Data Crypto analyst CryptoWzrd began his analysis by noting the ambiguity in recent price action, stating that the daily Bitcoin candle closed indecisively, although it was green. The primary focus of the past week was the traditional weekly candle close following the release of the US CPI data. Meanwhile, the weekly candle also closed without a clear direction, leaving the overall market structure ambiguous. Related Reading: Analyst Says 55% Chance Bitcoin Bull Run Isn’t Over Yet – Here’s Why The analyst defined a clear condition for the rally to continue. BTC’s ability to push higher is entirely dependent upon holding above the $110,500 resistance level. Maintaining this key floor should generate enough positive momentum to boost the market further upside, targeting the major resistance at $120,000 and potentially higher if conviction remains strong. However, if the price fails to hold $110,500, the market is at risk of declining further. In this scenario, the analyst targets the key technical support level located at $100,000 as the likely floor for the ensuing correction. Regardless of whether Bitcoin executes a bullish or bearish move, the analyst issued a warning regarding the broader market. During the weekend, most altcoins will not forge their own paths but will instead simply mirror the outcome of Bitcoin’s price action. The health of the altcoin market is directly linked to Bitcoin Dominance (BTCD), which the analyst observes as neutral on the daily chart. For altcoins to break free of Bitcoin’s gravitational pull and remain positive, the market requires more structural weakness in BTC.D. On Choppy Price Action & Ongoing Uncertainty CryptoWzrd concluded the analysis by noting that the intraday chart activity had been “somewhat choppy” throughout the day, suggesting a lack of clear directional momentum in the short term. Despite this recent consolidation, the underlying expectation remains bullish.

At this stage, the market has performed its necessary moves, and the next step is simply to wait for the market to play out and confirm the push toward the pivotal $120,000 resistance target.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-sends-strong-warning-to-xrp-holders-heres-why/,"A new scam targeting cryptocurrency users has surfaced, disguised as an official communication from Ledger, one of the world’s leading hardware wallet providers. Jungle Inc (@jungleincxrp), a well-known figure in the XRP community and a prominent crypto content creator, was among the first to raise the alarm after sharing an image of the fake letter on X. Warning: a friend just received a letter in the mail from hackers pretending to be from Ledger. You scan the QR code and give them access to your device. Be careful!!! Ledger will not send you something like this. pic.twitter.com/PBRuZgb7Yl — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) October 23, 2025 The Scammer’s Approach The letter, which appears professional and includes Ledger’s logo, a Paris address, and a formal sign-off from a supposed company executive, claims to introduce a new mandatory feature called “Transaction Check.” It instructs users to scan a QR code to activate the feature by October 31, 2025. At first glance, the letter looks legitimate, listing known devices and referencing security updates and compliance requirements. However, scanning the QR code redirects users to a fraudulent website designed to steal sensitive information and compromise wallet security . The scam’s sophistication has caught the attention of the wider crypto community. By copying Ledger’s official style and incorporating detailed text about “global cryptocurrency regulations” and “enhanced transaction verification,” the perpetrators made the letter difficult to distinguish from genuine correspondence. Malicious actors often target hardware wallet users due to the significant assets they store offline. This attempt was designed to exploit user trust in Ledger’s reputation for safety, preying on those who might rush to comply with what appears to be an official security update. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Impact on Users and Investor Caution The warning has been particularly relevant for XRP investors, many of whom use hardware wallets for long-term storage. One XRP holder recently lost $3 million from a cold wallet , and the fake notice’s professional tone and specific deadlines were clearly designed to pressure recipients into taking immediate action and causing a similar loss of funds. Incidents like this highlight that even the best hardware security cannot defend against human error. Scams relying on deception remain among the most effective methods for stealing digital assets. Staying Secure in a Targeted Environment Ledger has consistently stated that it does not send physical letters or require QR code scans for any form of activation. Official communications are always conducted through Ledger Live or verified digital channels. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, scams have become more polished and convincing . Jungle Inc’s post serves as a timely reminder that caution remains essential, especially for those managing high-value assets such as XRP.

The call came while Trump was aboard Air Force One, traveling toward Malaysia before heading to Japan and South Korea. Takaichi said she appreciated the congratulations and described the talk as “good and candid.” It was clear from her tone and her own words that she wanted no confusion about her stance on the Japan-U.S. alliance. Takaichi said she intends to place the alliance at the center of her foreign and security policy. She also said she wants to work directly with regional partners toward what she called a Free and Open Indo-Pacific. Takaichi later expanded on the conversation. She said, “I just finished a phone call with President Trump. First of all, he warmly congratulated me on my appointment as Prime Minister, and I was very grateful for his kind words. I conveyed to him that strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance is the top priority for my administration’s foreign and security policy. We confirmed our shared commitment to further elevating the Alliance to new heights.” She also said she expressed respect for Trump’s handling of the recent situation in the Middle East. She added that Japan sees itself as indispensable to the United States in both China strategy and the Indo-Pacific framework. Takaichi also thanked Trump for his previous support on the abduction issue and said she asked for continued cooperation on that matter. She ended the statement by saying she looked forward to welcoming him in Tokyo soon. Takaichi signals direction of Japan’s policy Takaichi’s political path has long been shaped by her late mentor, Shinzo Abe, who stepped down in 2020 and was assassinated in 2022. Abe’s approach, known as Abenomics, involved government spending and cash handouts, even with Japan’s national debt standing near three times the size of the economy. Takaichi has shown no intention of distancing herself from his political direction. Her rise has already had market effects, as shares of military-related companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Yaskawa Electric, and Japan Steel Works saw heavy buying. Investors are betting that her government will put more weight on national defense and industrial capacity tied to security. Her approach to defense lines up with Abe’s. She has made it clear that Japan will not sit lightly on regional security. And with Trump expected to arrive in Japan soon for direct talks, analysts are showing interest in how both leaders frame the next phase of the alliance. Takaichi has described Trump as “cheerful and engaging” after speaking with him. She said he knew details about her political history and even recalled memories of Abe. She said she thanked him for the friendship he has shown to Akie Abe. Alliance priorities and economic commitments Takaichi has already touched on one sensitive topic: Japan’s pledge of $550 billion to the Trump administration under an earlier deal tied to U.S. tariff reductions on Japanese imports . She previously suggested Japan might want to revisit the pledge, given public concern about sending Japanese taxpayer funds abroad, though she later said she would honor the agreement. She did not dwell on public dissatisfaction but pointed out that commitments already made will be kept. The call also shows that both sides intend to keep close coordination. Takaichi said she aims to work side by side with the U.S. and partners in Asia to maintain the Indo-Pacific vision. She reiterated that the alliance stands as the core of her diplomacy. Trump is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with her when he arrives in Japan later in his tour. That meeting will likely touch on military cooperation, regional posture, and economic agreements. With regional tensions running high, neither side appears interested in guesswork or distance.

This figure accounts for nearly one-third of the country’s total foreign currency income in 2024. Bybit Exploit Was the Largest Contributor The MSMT, a coalition of 11 countries formed in October 2024, was created to track how North Korea evades international sanctions through cybercrime. Its latest findings reveal that the scale of crypto theft rose in 2025, with hackers stealing $1.64 billion in the first nine months alone, marking a 50% increase from the $1.19 billion stolen last year. Most of this year’s total came from a February attack on Bybit, which was linked to the TraderTraitor group, also known as Jade Sleet or UNC4899. The hackers targeted SafeWallet, a multi-signature wallet provider for Bybit, using phishing emails and malware to gain access to internal systems. They then disguised external transfers to appear as internal ones, allowing them to take control of the cold wallet’s smart contract and move the funds undetected. According to the MSMT, North Korean hackers often avoid attacking exchanges directly, instead targeting third-party service providers. Groups such as TraderTraitor, CryptoCore, and Citrine Sleet have used fake developer profiles, stolen identities, and detailed knowledge of software supply chains to carry out their attacks. In one notable case, the Web3 project Munchables lost $63 million in a hack, although the funds were later returned after they reportedly faced problems during laundering. How the Laundering Works The analysis reveals a nine-step process used to clean and convert stolen crypto into cash. Hackers begin by swapping stolen assets for Ethereum (ETH) on decentralized exchanges, then use mixing services such as Tornado Cash and Wasabi Wallet to hide transaction trails. The ETH is then converted to Bitcoin (BTC) through bridge platforms, mixed again, stored in cold wallets, and then traded for Tron (TRX) before being converted to USDT. The final step involves sending USDT to over-the-counter brokers who exchange it for cash. Brokers and companies in China, Russia, and Cambodia were identified as key players in this process. In China, nationals Ye Dinrong and Tan Yongzhi of Shenzhen Chain Element Network Technology, along with trader Wang Yicong, helped move funds and create fake IDs. Russian intermediaries converted about $60 million from the Bybit hack through OTC brokers, while Cambodia’s Huione Pay was used to transfer stolen funds despite its license not being renewed by the central bank. The MSMT also said that North Korean hackers have worked with Russian-speaking cybercriminals since the 2010s. In 2025, actors linked to Moonstone Sleet leased ransomware tools from the Russia-based group Qilin. In response, the 11 jurisdictions making up the MSMT issued a joint statement urging UN member countries to raise awareness on these cyber activities and called on the UN Security Council to restore its Panel of Experts “in the same strength and structure it had prior to its disbandment.” The post North Korea’s Crypto Theft Reaches $2.83B Since 2024 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Hacking|North Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|ETH|EXCHANGE|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-25 21:28:56

According to the analysis, the address in question purchased 249,500 SOL (approximately $46.78 million) through the FalconX and Wintermute platforms in the last 4 days alone. This address reportedly purchased a total of 827,000 SOL (approximately $146 million) since the end of April, staking all of these assets. The average purchase price was calculated at $177.

But even as investors analyze Solana’s price forecast, traders are quietly focusing on what may be the best cheap crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at only $0.035 and in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM is fast becoming the next big crypto in decentralized finance (DeFi). Its novel dual-lending model, which combines Peer-to-Peer and liquidity pool mechanisms, has the potential to revolutionize on-chain lending efficiency to a degree of practical innovation that Solana’s network innovations are yet to maximally leverage. With increasing hype, solid tokenomics, and presale momentum building, Mutuum Finance takes center stage as the low-cap altcoin pacing the field in 2025. Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: Bulls Eye a Rebound After Key Rejection Solana (SOL) is also experiencing near-term bearish pressure after rejection from the 20-day EMA at approximately $198, an indication that bears continue to control the trend. Price now trades close to the key channel support area of $170 to $165, a must-hold spot for buyers. A bounce off this support and successful retake of the $198–$205 resistance can trigger a short-term rally into the $220+ area, restoring confidence in Solana’s upside momentum. Breakdown below the channel, however, can open the doors for a deeper correction into $155–$145, where buyers can start to re-enter for value plays. Although near-term market sentiment remains bearish, analysts comment that a powerful bounce would be enough to reverse momentum at speed, a scenario that is seeing many traders also looking at high-upside, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a project increasingly coming into view as the most compelling next big crypto opportunities of 2025. Mutuum Finance Breaks New Presale Record Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently the best cheap crypto to buy now in the DeFi sector. Its presale continues to explode, with more than 17,400 investors presently investing in excess of $17.85 million. The token is currently at its lowest potential level of $0.035 in Stage 6, providing a limited-time discount for early participants to join the next big crypto before the upcoming bull market explosion. Mutuum Finance allows holders to generate passive income by lending cryptocurrency assets like USDT to the liquidity pool and receiving returns in the form of annual percentage yield (APY), based on market demand. At the same time, lenders can lend without relinquishing holdings by collateralizing assets like ETH to lend USDT, with the interest rate on APY by markets and without a repayment plan, to cover initial stakes but allow flexibility. The platform will reach a key milestone later this year as its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol , Version 1 (V1), will launch live on the Sepolia Testnet. V1 will bring in fundamental DeFi building blocks like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and Liquidator bot, all automated with native ETH and USDT lending, borrowing, and collateralization, offering users a fast, scalable, and secure multi-asset trading experience while freeing their crypto to achieve its highest potential without restrictions. Already raising more than $17.85 million with more than 17,400 investors already signed up, Mutuum Finance’s Phase 6 presale is selling out at a record-breaking speed, with more than 75% of tokens sold. For only $0.035, this is as cheap as MUTM will be before the $0.04 explosion in Phase 7. Early movers are scooping up for what many consider the best cheap crypto to buy now, with actual DeFi functionality and breakthrough potential. While Solana stumbles in momentum, Mutuum Finance is leading buy charts and ruling investor focus as the next big crypto of 2025.

The firm ties Bitcoin’s long-run gains to broad money growth and futures market flows, and it lays out a path that reaches as high as $180,000 before the current bull market ends. Related Reading: XRP Sparks Bullish Frenzy As Top Software Dev Says It Beats ETF Hype VanEck Links Bitcoin To Global Money Supply Reports have disclosed a roughly 0.5 correlation between Bitcoin and total global M2 growth since 2014. Over that span, global liquidity across the top five currencies rose from about $50 trillion to nearly $100 trillion. Bitcoin’s price jumped roughly 700x during the same years. VanEck frames Bitcoin’s current size at about 2% of global money supply and argues that owning less than that share is, in effect, a bet against the asset class. This is a simple, numeric way to link money printing and asset demand. It does not claim perfect prediction, but it does say the connection is meaningful. Futures Flows And Market Fragility Based on reports, futures markets have been a major driver of short-term price moves. VanEck cites that about 73% of Bitcoin’s price variance since October 2020 can be traced to shifts in futures open interest, with a t-statistic of 71 supporting the relationship. Cash collateral backing those contracts sits near $145 billion. Open interest peaked at $52B on Oct. 6 and then fell to $39 billion by Oct. 10 after an eight-hour, 20% plunge in BTC. Borrowed positions have climbed near the 95th percentile at times, though positions above 30% have not held for more than 75 days historically. That pattern shows how crowded bets can unwind fast, and it helps explain sudden swings. Rotation Between Safe Havens And Risk Assets Meanwhile, analysts said that gold’s recent $2.5 trillion market cap correction should be read as a cooling off rather than a loss of faith. They said investors could shift between protection and growth exposure depending on macro prints. Based on reports, a soft US CPI print or easing trade tensions could redirect capital into Bitcoin, supporting scenarios where BTC moves to around $130,000–$132,000 in Q1 2026. Shorter-term targets in VanEck’s work include $129,200 and $141,000, while a clear rise above $125,000 would be taken as a sign of renewed buying strength.

Bearish Indicator Suggests Possible 70% Decline",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-going-to-30000-bearish-macd-indicator/,"The Bitcoin price had another rollercoaster performance in the past week, surging to over $113,000 by mid-week before crashing back down to around $107,000. While the premier cryptocurrency’s price action has steadied in the past few days, market uncertainty still seems to be the order of the day. However, the Bitcoin price seems to be leaning more toward a bearish setup, as suggested by the negative shift of a relevant technical indicator on a longer timeframe. Below is what happened to the price of BTC the last four times this indicator flipped bearish. BTC Price At Risk Of 70% Correction: Analyst In an October 24 post on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward a bearish outlook for the price of Bitcoin. The online pundit revealed that the market leader might have returned to a familiar position that has often led to significant losses (approximately 70%) in the past. This bearish prediction is based on the changes in the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator, which shows the relationship between moving averages of an asset’s price (the Bitcoin price, in this context). Typically, a cross of the MACD line above the signal line is a bullish sign for the asset’s price. Meanwhile, when the MACD line crosses beneath the signal line, it indicates that the asset might be taking a bearish structure. As seen in the highlighted chart, the Bitcoin MACD line just crossed below the signal line on the monthly timeframe, which means that the flagship cryptocurrency could be gearing up for an extended period of downward price movement. What’s more striking is the historical performance of the Bitcoin price whenever this MACD crossover occurs. According to Martinez, the price of BTC has seen an average drop of 70% in the last four occasions this indicator flipped to negative. The last time the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator turned bearish was in September 2021, starting the eventual descent of the market leader to around $16,000 mark in November 2022. As shown in the chart, the Bitcoin price fell by more than 70% in this period. If history is to go by, this means that the price of BTC is at risk of a 70% decline over the next few months, putting the target at around $33,000 from the current price point.
