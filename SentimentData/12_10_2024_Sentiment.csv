This fragile situation is underscored by data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which revealed that over 30,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.83 billion, has been transferred to crypto exchanges within a short period. Undoubtedly, such a huge amount of BTC entering crypto exchanges is problematic, especially in terms of a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. 30,000 BTC Sold In 72 Hours According to Santiment data highlighted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC have sold or redistributed around 30,000 BTC in the past 72 hours. Considering the current average price of Bitcoin, this comes out to about $1.83 billion worth of BTC exchanging hands. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analysts Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $10,000 If This Happens #Bitcoin whales have sold or redistributed around 30,000 $BTC in the past 72 hours, totaling $1.83 billion! pic.twitter.com/y9FsARYrmM — Ali (@ali_charts) October 10, 2024 Exchange inflow data from IntoTheBlock, which tracks the activities of various holder cohorts, reveals that on October 8 alone, around 18,220 BTC was moved to exchanges. This was followed by an additional 16,000 BTC on October 9 and roughly 13,800 BTC on October 10. While not all inflows lead to immediate selloffs, high volumes of BTC entering exchanges often suggest that investors are positioning themselves for potential sales. This continued exchange inflow could signal a buildup of selling pressure, with market participants potentially preparing to liquidate their holdings in the near future. Bitcoin Under Increased Selling Pressure? On a positive note, the current selloffs are largely being driven by short-term holders, which has led to a shift in Bitcoin ownership. Many of the BTC being sold are being scooped up by long-term holders, who view the dip as an opportunity to strengthen their positions. This shift in ownership could stabilize the market, as long-term holders are typically less likely to sell going forward. Related Reading: Second XRP ETF Filing Hits The Market, How Did The XRP Price Respond? Moreover, exchange inflow data shows a gradual decline in the amount of BTC being sent to exchanges each day. This trend indicates that fewer investors are moving their Bitcoin into exchange wallets, which could be a sign that the recent wave of selloffs is losing momentum. In terms of exchange reserve, data from CryptoQuant shows a steady decline in the amount of BTC held on wallets controlled by crypto exchanges since the beginning of October. This decline in exchange reserves contradicts the fears of continued selloffs, as it implies there is less Bitcoin available for sale on exchanges. If this trend continues, it could further reduce the selling pressure and provide a more optimistic outlook for Bitcoin’s near-term recovery. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $60,854, establishing a price floor of around $60,000.

Even though investors are upbeat, expecting prices to soar in the coming sessions, uncertainty continues to engulf the market. Ethereum Finds Support At $2,300: Over 52 Million ETH Bought The second world’s most valuable coin is bearish, dumping by over 50% from July highs and unable to break the local resistance at $3,500. As traders closely monitor how price action pans out, one analyst has picked an interesting development from market data. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces ‘Sell-Off Risk’ If It Loses $2,300 Resistance – Analyst Citing IntoTheBlock data on October 11, the analyst observes that over 52 million ETH has been acquired by traders at around the $2,300 level. Considering the amount of coins in the hands of traders at this price, this zone is the immediate support. As such, if buyers have the upper hand, lifting prices from this point, this level will anchor the uptrend. If sellers double down, as has been the case in the past few trading months, the probability of ETH dropping below Q3 2024 lows will be elevated. Presently, the sentiment is bearish, as seen in the CoinMarketCap poll. Over 65% of ETH holders and traders expect prices to struggle in the short term. Therefore, how prices react at the local support will shape the short to medium-term formation. A surge, lifting ETH above $2,800, will be crucial in driving demand, providing the much-needed tailwinds for optimistic traders. USDT, USDC, And Stablecoin Market Cap Falling: Is Buying Power Dwindling? Although optimism is high, other related market data points to weakness. Over the past few trading weeks, the market capitalization of stablecoins like USDT and USDC has been falling. As of October 10, the analyst notes it was down $780 million from recent swing highs, pointing to a possible drop in buying power. Usually, whenever USDC, USDT, and even DAI move to centralized exchanges, more users are keen on buying crypto assets, including ETH and BTC. However, if there is an outflow or its market cap dwindles, it may mean that more users are cautious and closely monitor events before committing. Typically, more coins, including stablecoins, tend to find their way to centralized exchanges when there are concerns about market prospects. Such inflows tend to precede a market-wide correction.

However, what’s been happening is that more holders have been staking. By mid this week, market data revealed that over 34 million ETH remain locked, earning holders a 3.3% APY.

Veteran Trader Predicts Possible 75% Crash—Here’s Why,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-next-move-veteran-trader-predicts-possible-75-crash-heres-why/,"Peter Brandt, a well-known veteran in the trading community, recently took to X to share a concerning outlook on Bitcoin price trajectory. Brandt’s warning comes amid a relatively stagnant performance by the leading crypto, failing to produce any decisive moves toward new all-time highs in recent months. Brand pointed out a historical pattern that could signal a 75% drop for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Puell Multiple Signals A Bullish Surge: Could A New ATH Be Near? Reason Why A 75% Plunge Could Be Looming In his post, Peter Brandt pointed out that Bitcoin has been moving sideways for 30 weeks since its last all-time high (ATH). He referenced historical patterns, explaining that when Bitcoin fails to make a new ATH within this time frame, it typically experiences a decline of over 75%. Brandt emphasized the importance of Bitcoin breaking out soon, suggesting that a significant drop might follow if it doesn’t. He also mentioned that markets that don’t show upward momentum often struggle to do so. Hey Bitcoiners Are you familiar with the concept of “market analogs?” Here is something to think about It has been 30 weeks since $BTC made an ATH Whenever has not made a decisive new ATH within this time length a 75%+ decline has occurred pic.twitter.com/CUyK4C2W93 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 11, 2024 However, he made it clear that this was an observation based on historical data rather than a prediction or personal opinion, noting: I am always amused by people who confuse a market observation with a market opinion. Drivers who cannot turn their heads in both directions always end up in an accident. Bitcoin Performance And Fundamental Analysis Despite Brandt’s cautionary note, Bitcoin has regained ground after briefly dipping below $60,000. Today, Bitcoin is trading at $62,172, up 2.8% in the past 24 hours after touching a low of $58,982 yesterday. While some traders remain hopeful that Bitcoin will continue its upward trajectory, others are growing concerned about potential volatility, especially given the historical patterns that Brandt has outlined. Data from the CryptoQuant platform further supports the notion of potential downside pressure. According to a recent analysis, BTC’s “Coinbase Premium Gap” has reached its lowest level since August, signaling a wave of selling activity. The Coinbase Premium Gap measures the difference between Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase (a US-based exchange) and other global exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Path To $80,000 “Melt-Up” In Q4 2024 – Details Inside A positive premium typically indicates strong buying pressure from US investors, while a negative premium can reflect waning demand. The current negative premium could suggest that institutional interest in Bitcoin is declining, adding weight to Brandt’s observation that Bitcoin might be on the brink of a major correction.

Despite an 8% decline since September, BTC shows bullish signs, with higher lows and market sentiment indicators not reflecting the price movement. Global liquidity growth and HODLer balance trends hint at a potential BTC price surge, though retail FOMO is currently lacking. iShares Bitcoin Trust offers a low-cost, tax-advantaged way to gain Bitcoin exposure, benefiting from diminished BTC supply and fiat debasement. What the fin-fluencers online have dubbed 'Uptober' has been a disappointment to say the least. The price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has failed to sustain a meaningful rally in the month of October. Some analysts, myself included , have expected positive returns for BTC through the end of the year. Speaking to seasonality in a previous article for Seeking Alpha, I wrote the following: With an 80% win rate going back to 2014, October is historically one of the best months of the year for BTC. The mean change in the month is 19%. Q4 has generally been a good time to let BTC positions run. Alas, October has yet to yield much fruit as we approach the mid-way point of the month: Data by YCharts In fact, BTC has actually fallen by 8% since the end of September. But 'Uptober' is not over yet. There are positive signs emerging that, I think, will help propel Bitcoin higher between now and the end of the year. In this update, we'll look at technical signals, cycle indicators, and ETF flow data for the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). Bitcoin Technicals I don't generally make my Seeking Alpha posts about technical analysis, as I try to focus more on fundamental data. But I see several positive signs in the Bitcoin chart. First, let's examine the weekly: BTC Weekly Chart (TrendSpider) Here we see a very clear structure of lower highs and lower lows between March and early August. Notably, BTC did not revisit the top of this channel on the late-September rally. Instead, it has pulled back once again below the 8-week moving average in two consecutive weeks before reversing higher over the 20-week MA. Consider that the early-September decline made a higher low than the previous decline. At minimum, I believe this action is setting up for yet another test of the top of the trend. The daily chart also provides some interesting insight as well: BTC Daily Chart (TrendSpider) I like this one for the sentiment tell. Outside of a one-week period at the end of September, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has remained in fear for most of the last two months, even though BTC is 27% off its August low . The price is moving higher, but market sentiment indicators don't seem to believe it. I think this is bullish. Not only do I suspect we'll see another test of the trend line from March, but I think we could even see a breakout of resistance. Cycle Indicators Bitcoiners often like to look at pricing models that attempt to gauge things like 'fair value' or cycle top signals. There are numerous such instruments, but I suspect the most important variable in determining where the price of Bitcoin is ultimately going to go is probably global liquidity. Like Gold or other assets more broadly, we've generally seen fiat currency devaluation through the years lead to higher prices for financial assets. This has been true for BTC as well. Bitcoin vs Global M2 Growth (BGeometrics) It's important to keep in mind that Bitcoin is a global phenomenon, in the same way digitally printing fiat currency is a global phenomenon. And though the rate of change is nothing like it has been in previous cycles, growth in global M2 has been on the rise again for most of the last two years. Bitcoin has accounted for much of this liquidity growth. But the parabolic move has alluded us. Right now, we’re already seeing a resurgence in global M2 growth, but the price of BTC hasn’t gone much of anywhere for 6 months. Perhaps there's a meaningful signal there. Or, perhaps, BTC is about to make up some ground. The all important HODLer balance of BTC has dripped down to 12.8 million of the 19.7 million coins in circulation. This is a decline of about 1 million BTC since the start of the year. Bitcoin HODLer Balance (IntoTheBlock) Bitcoin’s HODLer balance hasn’t been this low since Q1-23. I don’t think this is anything to be all that concerned about, to be honest. Typically, what we’ve seen historically is HODLer balance peaks somewhere before the real bull run begins. It isn’t until HODLer balance starts going back up that the price top has generally been in. As far as post-halving price performance goes, the 2024 vintage has been a massive dud to this point: Performance By Halving (IntoTheBlock) This post-halving epoch is admittedly off to a rough start. We are not currently following historical patterns from the previous three epochs. I suspect the approval of the spot ETFs changed things and pulled forward quite a bit of post-halving BTC demand. But one of the big problems for demand is we just don’t have the same level of retail mania 'FOMO' that we’ve seen in the past. If/when that happens, we generally see market prices explode as much as 10x higher than realized prices. BTC Realized Value (BitcoinMagazinePRO) That realized price level is currently $25k. To be clear, I’m not saying we see BTC take out a quarter million per coin; to the contrary, I actually think this cycle’s top is potentially going to disappoint bulls considerably without a parabolic liquidity pump from central banks. The latter of which is possible, but not something that I think investors should be banking on as a certainty just yet. The point is, if market participants see higher BTC prices in the future as a realistic bet, how does one put that trade on without directly buying the coin? iShares Bitcoin Trust As of October 9th, the iShares Bitcoin Trust is home to over 364k BTC: IBIT Holdings (The Block) IBIT is now the largest single holder of Bitcoin in the public markets. The fund almost has as much BTC under management as the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust ( FBTC ) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) combined. Through IBIT, BlackRock ( BLK ) now controls more Bitcoin than MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), Marathon Digital ( MARA ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), and every other public company combined through official balance sheet holdings. IBIT Daily Flows (TheBlock) The 'fee flight' from Grayscale's flagship fund has been well documented at this point. BlackRock's fund has clearly been a large beneficiary of that GBTC outflow. However, even now, with the fee flight story slowing down, IBIT's daily asset flow has very rarely been negative going back to January inception. And there's a good reason for this. The fund's expense ratio is among the lowest in the market at 0.25%. And BlackRock's reputation as a fund manager has perhaps given Bitcoin some level of credence for more traditional investors who would otherwise avoid digital assets altogether. Closing Remarks I believe Bitcoin bulls are going to enjoy Q4-24. 'Uptober' may not have started the way many believed it would, but I don't think that means it's going to end badly. There are positive signs both in the technicals and in some of the cycle data. Fundamentally, Bitcoin continues to have the same setup that has propelled it higher so many times before; diminishing BTC supply and perpetual fiat debasement. In a world with higher BTC prices, IBIT will generate handsome returns. It's among the lowest-cost spot products and remains a more than suitable way to get exposed to Bitcoin through a tax-advantaged traditional investment account.",BTC-USD|IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|ZRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-12 02:20:00

The token is now leading the crypto market’s recovery in the daily timeframe, suggesting a possible continuation of its bullish momentum before the month ends. Related Reading: ‘Cardano Isn’t Dying’: Charles Hoskinson Defends Project Amid ADA Price Criticism Celestia Leads The Crypto Market TIA, the native token of modular blockchain Celestia, has seen a 7.3% surge in the past week. The cryptocurrency recovered from the October 3 lows, moving from the $4.5 support level to trade above the $5 mark this Friday. Celestia has been on a downtrend since hitting its March all-time high (ATH), suffering a brutal 80% correction from $20 to $4 in the past six months. September’s retrace dragged TIA below the $4 mark, registering its lowest price since early November 2023. However, the token’s Q3 retraces didn’t alarm many investors who considered Celestia’s on-chain developments a potential bullish sign. Since then, the cryptocurrency has seen a 40.1% monthly increase, fueling the bullish sentiment among the community. Today, TIA registered eight hourly consecutive green candles, propelling the price 14% from the $4.9 zone to the $5.6 resistance level before retracing to the $5.5 mark. Throughout the morning, the token has hovered between $5.50-$5.55, recording a 16.3% surge in the past 24 hours. This performance crowned Celestia as the largest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, only followed by Worldcoin (WLD), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Popcat (POPCAT). Is A Big Move Coming For TIA? Several market watchers note Celetia’s performance, suggesting that the cryptocurrency’s chart hints a breakout may be around the corner. To crypto analyst Yuriy, TIA’s performance indicates a “big move is coming,” remarking that its open interest (OI) significantly increased in the past month. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Poseidon noted TIA’s 80% correction, asserting that we might be near the end of the “brutal downside trend.” To the analyst, the price’s 4-month range between $4-$7 looks like a potential bottom, which could signify the ongoing bullish momentum will continue. However, Poseidon asserted that TIA must reclaim the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) to call the trend shift. Similarly, crypto trader Bluntz previously suggested that the cryptocurrency had bottomed, displaying an inverted head and shoulders pattern after the weekly recovery. Related Reading: Experts Discuss What Made Solana Memecoins The Cycle’s Top Narrative Youtuber Crypto Jack noted that Celestia’s bounce from the $4.5 support zone targets the upper trendline of its 4-month consolidation range. To the analyst, the bullish momentum could send TIA above the $7 resistance level this month. Other analysts called it one of “the most tempting altcoins to buy,” setting targets above $10 for Celestia. Nonetheless, some noted that the upcoming token unlocks, set to start on October 30, could negatively impact TIA’s price.

According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan, the current market is still amid a bull cycle, with promising long-term prospects for Bitcoin holders. While the market has faced some short-term turbulence, key indicators suggest that more gains may be on the horizon. Related Reading: Bitcoin On The Brink: Will $60K Hold Or Is A Major Correction Coming? Bull Run Is Still In Progress Crypto Dan’s insights, shared on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, highlight how Bitcoin’s current movement mirrors patterns seen in previous bull cycles. Specifically, Dan noted that long-term investors realized profits twice during the 2013 and 2020 bull markets. He further pointed out that 2017’s market peak differed, lacking the same period adjustments in other cycles. Dan suggested that if we follow the patterns of 2013 and 2020, the current market could be poised for another significant upswing. In addition to the cycle comparison, Dan emphasized the global macroeconomic situation, specifically the recent trend of interest rate cuts by central banks worldwide. He explained that while liquidity may take several months to return to markets fully, prices typically move ahead of these developments based on investor expectations. This anticipatory movement could set the stage for significant price increases by 2025, offering long-term investors the potential for substantial gains. The analyst advised: If you “invest” through a big frame rather than a short-term picture, you are more likely to get a much better result. Bitcoin Bounces Back, Coinbase Premium Points to Accumulation Meanwhile, Bitcoin has shown signs of recovery after dipping to $58,000 earlier in the week. At the time of writing, the asset is trading at $62,080, marking a 2.4% increase in the past 24 hours. This recovery has been met with positive sentiment from the crypto community, especially as other indicators point to the continued accumulation of Bitcoin. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Avocado Onchain, provided further insights into Bitcoin’s price movements, particularly focusing on the Coinbase Premium, an indicator that measures the difference between Bitcoin prices on Coinbase and other exchanges. Avocado explained that the Coinbase Premium dropped to -100 points, typically a bearish signal. However, Bitcoin’s price has since rebounded, suggesting a positive outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hope: Mt. Gox Delays Repayment Plan Until October 2025 According to the analyst, historically, during bull markets, Bitcoin’s price tends to bounce back after the Coinbase Premium falls below -50. This pattern has held true over the past year, with Bitcoin consolidating within a broad price range for the past eight months. Avocado noted that, in a bear market, such negative premiums would typically lead to panic selling, yet that has not been the case now. Instead, the data indicates that larger players may be accumulating Bitcoin at lower prices, signalling that the bull market “may not be over.” Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin analysis|bitcoin market|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto market|cryptoquant,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-10-12 04:30:43

This division comes amid ongoing debates about regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its enforcement actions against the cryptocurrency sector. Ripple Larsen’s $1 Million XRP Donation Christian Larsen, co-founder of Ripple, has made headlines by making the first documented crypto donation to Kamala Harris’s campaign, contributing $1 million in XRP to a prominent super political action committee (PAC) supporting her candidacy. Related Reading: Over 52 Million ETH Bought At $2,300, Will Ethereum Bulls Defend This Support? This donation was revealed through recent filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as reported by FOX journalist Eleanor Terret. Larsen’s contribution signifies a strategic endorsement of Harris, who has recently been vocal about the needed support for the growth of the digital asset ecosystem. This political move comes on the heels of comments from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who has criticized the SEC’s ongoing legal battle against the company. The SEC recently appealed a favorable ruling from Judge Analisa Torres, which stated that XRP, when sold on public exchanges, does not qualify as a security under existing laws. In response, Ripple announced it would file a cross-appeal against the SEC on Thursday, intensifying the ongoing legal conflict. Crypto Community Divided? Garlinghouse has been outspoken about the SEC’s actions, recently asserting, “If Gensler and the SEC cared about the rule of law, they would accept their loss and move on.” Ripple’s CEO argues that the regulator is more interested in causing disruption than providing clarity for industry players, warning that the agency’s actions could stifle US innovation in technology. While Larsen has aligned himself with Harris, the political contributions from the crypto community are not one-sided. Gary Cardone, a well-known digital asset investor, along with the Winklevoss twins, founders of the Gemini exchange, and Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell, have publicly supported Donald Trump.

The former President and Republican candidate has criticized regulatory overreach, stating, “They want to choke you, and we are not going to let that happen.” Trump has also pledged to replace SEC Chairman Gary Gensler upon his potential return to the White House, further indicating his commitment to fostering a favorable environment for the crypto industry. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5379, showing no change from Thursday’s trading session.

Chinese Stimulus Measures To Help Bitcoin? According to the State Council Information Office, China’s Finance Minister, Lan Fo’an, is expected to provide details on upcoming fiscal stimulus measures during a press conference on Saturday. These measures aim to stimulate economic activity in the country. On September 24, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) cut interest rates on existing mortgages by 0.5% and lowered reserve requirement ratios for banks to boost market liquidity. The global crypto market is increasingly paying attention to China’s stimulus plans, as enhanced liquidity could positively impact the prices of digital assets like BTC. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Top Analyst Predicts What’s Next For Crypto While the announcement is anticipated, confirmation of another round of fiscal measures, especially if they exceed market expectations, could significantly boost risk-on assets like Bitcoin. In addition, if the US Federal Reserve (Fed) decides to cut key interest rates further, it could increase investor appetite for riskier assets, including digital currencies known for their volatility. Currently, prediction markets are speculating at least another 50 basis points (bps) cut in interest rates by the end of the year. Such a move would increase global liquidity and help BTC avoid a capitulation that could cause its price to crash into the high $40k range. BTC Options Expiry Could Trigger Price Volatility Another factor that could impact Bitcoin’s price volatility is the $1.1 billion worth of 18,000 BTC options set to expire on October 11. At press time, the put-call ratio is 0.91, indicating a slight tilt toward put options. With Bitcoin hovering around $60,000, the chances of reaching the “max pain” price of $62,000 are growing. For those who are uninitiated, “max pain” refers to the price level where the most options traders are likely to incur losses. While Bitcoin has recently benefited from global interest rate cuts, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election in November have made it difficult to predict BTC’s future price movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Fails At MA-200, Is A Crash To $52,000 Coming? Despite the challenges above, some trading firms and crypto analysts are confident about the resiliency of digital assets and the potential for a Q4 2024 crypto rally. For instance, crypto trading firm QCP Capital noted that Bitcoin’s swift recovery following the Iranian offensive against Israel indicated its strong demand among investors. Similarly, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan outlined three major factors that could help the BTC price “melt-up” to a new all-time-high (ATH) of close to $80,000 in Q4 2024. BTC trades at $62,086 at press time, up 2.7% in the last 24 hours.

This announcement comes as the project aims to raise $300 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion through its initial token offering, which garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency community. The Trump DeFi Initiative In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), World Liberty Financial announced that the public sale will be open to individuals who qualify through a whitelist process. The governance token, WLFI, will have a non-transferable status for the first 12 months, although it will allow holders to participate in voting on platform decisions immediately. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: $1.83 Billion Makes Its Way To Exchanges, Is A Bloodbath Coming? The initial phase of the project includes launching a DeFi lending platform, modeled after Aave, on Scroll, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. It will initially support Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, with future plans to introduce a stablecoin-focused credit card, facilitate integration with exchanges for seamless asset transfers, and fractionalize real-world assets like hotels and clubs. World Liberty Financial is presented as a key component of Trump’s vision to “Make America great again, this time with crypto.” The initiative aims to position the US as the leading global hub for cryptocurrency, enhancing financial security and enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries through decentralized finance. However, specific functionalities and a definitive launch date for the platform have yet to be announced. Interestingly, a preliminary white paper for the project includes a disclaimer stating that World Liberty Financial is “not owned, managed, operated or sold” by the Trump family, although it notes that they may receive compensation from the initiative. This disclaimer aims to clarify the project’s structure amidst ongoing scrutiny. Political Polarization Ahead? The launch of World Liberty Financial has raised expectations among investors, but it has also raised eyebrows within the cryptocurrency community, particularly within industry leaders such as Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of the Ethereum and Cardano blockchains. Hoskinson has expressed concerns that Trump’s DeFi venture could become a “political flashpoint,” exacerbating existing tensions surrounding cryptocurrency regulation in the US under Biden’s administration. Related Reading: BNB Under Siege: Failed Recovery Sparks Fears of Deeper Losses Hoskinson also warned that the political polarization surrounding Trump could provoke a backlash from Democrats that could threaten the viability of the initiative. The Cardano founder indicated that if Democrats perceive Trump’s DeFi project as a significant threat, they might leverage governmental power to impose restrictions, potentially driving many crypto projects offshore to jurisdictions with more favorable regulations. Despite his concerns, Hoskinson acknowledged that it has attracted influential investors and advocates. However, he remains skeptical about whether this support will translate into effective policy changes should Trump regain power.

After a modest 5% pump on Friday, investors and analysts are increasingly optimistic about the direction Solana could take in the coming months. One prominent analyst, Carl Runefelt, has shared a technical analysis predicting a 20% surge for SOL in the next few weeks, citing bullish patterns and favorable market conditions. His analysis suggests that Solana could reach $176 by the end of the year if current momentum holds. Related Reading: Dogecoin Targets $0.11 As Short-Term Traders Fuel DOGE Price – Details However, Solana still faces key resistance levels that could challenge its upward trajectory. Despite the recent surge, some market participants are cautious, given the overall volatility in the crypto space. If Solana manages to maintain its current support and break through resistance, the next few months could be pivotal for the asset’s long-term price action. Can SOL capitalize on its recent gains and reach new highs, or will it struggle to maintain momentum in the face of market headwinds? Investors are eager to see how this plays out as we approach the end of the year. Solana Testing Supply Levels Solana has been trading within a range of $210 to $110 since mid-March, leading to mixed opinions among investors. While some see this price action as a consolidation phase, others believe it could signal an upcoming breakout. Notably, top analyst and entrepreneur Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, revealing a bullish triangle pattern forming for SOL. According to Runefelt’s analysis, if Solana breaks out of this triangle pattern, it could experience a sharp upward movement, potentially reaching $176 in the coming weeks. This would represent a significant surge from its current trading levels and a key milestone for SOL. The price has struggled to break through the $160 resistance level since early August, but Runefelt suggests that a breakout from the triangle could push the price well beyond this resistance. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Testing $0.34 Support – On-Chain Data Suggests Price Consolidation A successful break above these critical levels would mean a 20% surge for Solana, with bullish momentum potentially driving it even higher. Investors are closely watching these movements, as a breakout could signal the end of Solana’s extended sideways trading and mark the start of a new upward trend. If SOL can maintain support and continue this rally, it may soon test new highs and solidify its position as one of the top-performing altcoins. SOL Technical Analysis: Zones To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $145, following a 7% surge from local lows at $135. The price has managed to rise above the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $140, a key indicator of short-term trend strength. However, SOL is still 4% away from the crucial 200 moving average (MA) at $152, which represents a stronger, longer-term trend signal. A breakout above both the EMA and MA levels is essential for bulls to fully regain control and reclaim the trend. Surpassing these indicators could pave the way for a move to the $160 supply zone, where sellers are expected to be more active. This would signal a continuation of bullish momentum, with potential for further gains. Related Reading: XRP Will Jump 75% If It Holds Current Demand Level – Details On the other hand, if the price fails to hold above the $140 mark, this recent surge could be short-lived, and a deeper correction might follow. A break below this level could drive SOL down to $110, which is a significant demand zone that buyers may defend. Traders are keeping a close eye on these levels as the next few days will determine SOL’s s`hort-term direction.

Analyst Provides Update On $78,000 Prediction",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-bitcoin-price-primed-for-new-record-high-analyst/,"A crypto analyst has offered an update on their analysis, predicting the Bitcoin price to climb to a new all-time high in the coming months. What’s Next For Bitcoin In October? In a September 23 post on X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward an interesting prognosis on the current price action of Bitcoin and its future trajectory. According to the pundit, the premier cryptocurrency looked set for a bullish breakout — albeit not in a straightforward move. In his forecast, Martinez said that the price layout (at the time) could see Bitcoin fall to the $60,000 level and then make a comeback to $66,000. Following the recovery, a deep correction would see the market leader slump to $57,000 before rallying to a new all-time high of $78,000. Related Reading: BNB Under Siege: Failed Recovery Sparks Fears of Deeper Losses This projection is based on the formation of a descending channel pattern on the daily Bitcoin price chart. A descending channel is a technical analysis chart formation characterized by two major trendlines; the upper line acting as the resistance level and the lower line acting as the support level. The space between these trendlines serves as the channel within which prices over a period. Typically, the formation of a descending channel suggests the persistence of a downward price trend and lower highs. Meanwhile, traders can use this pattern to identify optimal entry and exit points. For instance, a descending channel can be used to confirm the continuation or reversal of a market trend. If a breakout occurs to the upside of the upper trendline, it may imply a shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. Meanwhile, a breakout across the bottom trendline is a trend continuation signal. In a new post on the X platform, Martinez provided an update on the $78,000 forecast, confirming that the Bitcoin price dropped to $60,000 before jumping back to $66,000. Following the latest correction to around $59,000, the next move for the premier cryptocurrency seems to be the breakout rally to $78,000. Contrary to general expectations, the price of Bitcoin has not exactly shined in the historically bullish month of October. However, this latest projection shows that the “Uptober” month could just be starting for the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin sits just beneath $63,000, reflecting a 5% increase in the past 24 hours. This latest rally represents a price recovery as the premier cryptocurrency has been under intense bearish pressure over the past week, falling as low as $59,000 at some point. According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin is up by 1% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Over 52 Million ETH Bought At $2,300, Will Ethereum Bulls Defend This Support?

Since early August, the price has struggled to hold above the crucial $0.36 level. This shift has left ADA in a precarious position, with investors and traders watching for signs of a potential recovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Break Yearly Highs ‘Any Moment Now’ – Crypto Analyst Data from IntoTheBlock highlights a significant drop in whale activity over the past month, raising concerns about further downside pressure. The decrease in large transactions suggests that major holders may be stepping back, adding to the likelihood of a deeper correction for the altcoin. If ADA fails to break above the $0.36 resistance in the coming days, a 30% retrace to lower demand levels seems inevitable. Market participants are awaiting confirmation of either a breakout or further declines as the broader market remains uncertain. The next few days will be crucial for determining Cardano’s short-term direction. Cardano Whales Leaving Early? Cardano is at a crucial liquidity level, with on-chain metrics indicating a potential for further decline, especially given the significant decrease in whale activity. Recent data from IntoTheBlock highlights a concerning trend: ADA whales, or large investors, have increasingly sold their holdings over the past month. This trend is evident in the 100% fall in ADA’s large holders’ netflow, which refers to the balance between the amount of the coin these addresses buy and the amount they sell. Large holders are addresses with over 0.1% of Cardano’s circulating supply. When the flow declines, these investors sell more coins than they buy, signaling a potential loss of confidence in Cardano. This lack of confidence often trickles down to retail investors, leading them to sell their holdings. The drop in ADA’s whale concentration over the past month confirms this selling activity, raising concerns about ‘Smart Money’ potentially exiting the Cardano ecosystem. If this trend continues, it could push ADA below its current liquidity level, resulting in a deeper correction. Related Reading: Solana Bullish Pattern Signals Massive Gains Ahead – 2021 Rally Could Repeat Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, as the exit of large holders could signal a bearish sentiment that may lead to a significant price decline. As Cardano navigates this critical phase, investors will watch for signs of recovery or further weakness in the coming days. Key Levels To Watch Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.35 after experiencing days of choppy price action below the critical $0.36 resistance level. The price is 15% below the 1D 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.40, a key area of resistance that bulls must overcome to reverse the prevailing downtrend. This crucial level was lost in April, and since then, ADA has failed to close above it four times. If the price continues to struggle, a deeper correction to fresh yearly lows at $0.25 could be in store. Such a move would represent a significant 30% retracement from current levels, further intensifying bearish sentiment in the market. Investors are aware of these critical price points, as a failure to reclaim the EMA and break through the $0.36 resistance may lead to increased selling pressure.
