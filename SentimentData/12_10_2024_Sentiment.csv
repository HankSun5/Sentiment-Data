This fragile situation is underscored by data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which revealed that over 30,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.83 billion, has been transferred to crypto exchanges within a short period. Undoubtedly, such a huge amount of BTC entering crypto exchanges is problematic, especially in terms of a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. 30,000 BTC Sold In 72 Hours According to Santiment data highlighted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC have sold or redistributed around 30,000 BTC in the past 72 hours. Considering the current average price of Bitcoin, this comes out to about $1.83 billion worth of BTC exchanging hands. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analysts Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $10,000 If This Happens #Bitcoin whales have sold or redistributed around 30,000 $BTC in the past 72 hours, totaling $1.83 billion! pic.twitter.com/y9FsARYrmM — Ali (@ali_charts) October 10, 2024 Exchange inflow data from IntoTheBlock, which tracks the activities of various holder cohorts, reveals that on October 8 alone, around 18,220 BTC was moved to exchanges. This was followed by an additional 16,000 BTC on October 9 and roughly 13,800 BTC on October 10. While not all inflows lead to immediate selloffs, high volumes of BTC entering exchanges often suggest that investors are positioning themselves for potential sales. This continued exchange inflow could signal a buildup of selling pressure, with market participants potentially preparing to liquidate their holdings in the near future. Bitcoin Under Increased Selling Pressure? On a positive note, the current selloffs are largely being driven by short-term holders, which has led to a shift in Bitcoin ownership. Many of the BTC being sold are being scooped up by long-term holders, who view the dip as an opportunity to strengthen their positions. This shift in ownership could stabilize the market, as long-term holders are typically less likely to sell going forward. Related Reading: Second XRP ETF Filing Hits The Market, How Did The XRP Price Respond? Moreover, exchange inflow data shows a gradual decline in the amount of BTC being sent to exchanges each day. This trend indicates that fewer investors are moving their Bitcoin into exchange wallets, which could be a sign that the recent wave of selloffs is losing momentum. In terms of exchange reserve, data from CryptoQuant shows a steady decline in the amount of BTC held on wallets controlled by crypto exchanges since the beginning of October. This decline in exchange reserves contradicts the fears of continued selloffs, as it implies there is less Bitcoin available for sale on exchanges. If this trend continues, it could further reduce the selling pressure and provide a more optimistic outlook for Bitcoin’s near-term recovery. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $60,854, establishing a price floor of around $60,000.

Even though investors are upbeat, expecting prices to soar in the coming sessions, uncertainty continues to engulf the market. Ethereum Finds Support At $2,300: Over 52 Million ETH Bought The second world’s most valuable coin is bearish, dumping by over 50% from July highs and unable to break the local resistance at $3,500. As traders closely monitor how price action pans out, one analyst has picked an interesting development from market data. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces ‘Sell-Off Risk’ If It Loses $2,300 Resistance – Analyst Citing IntoTheBlock data on October 11, the analyst observes that over 52 million ETH has been acquired by traders at around the $2,300 level. Considering the amount of coins in the hands of traders at this price, this zone is the immediate support. As such, if buyers have the upper hand, lifting prices from this point, this level will anchor the uptrend. If sellers double down, as has been the case in the past few trading months, the probability of ETH dropping below Q3 2024 lows will be elevated. Presently, the sentiment is bearish, as seen in the CoinMarketCap poll. Over 65% of ETH holders and traders expect prices to struggle in the short term. Therefore, how prices react at the local support will shape the short to medium-term formation. A surge, lifting ETH above $2,800, will be crucial in driving demand, providing the much-needed tailwinds for optimistic traders. USDT, USDC, And Stablecoin Market Cap Falling: Is Buying Power Dwindling? Although optimism is high, other related market data points to weakness. Over the past few trading weeks, the market capitalization of stablecoins like USDT and USDC has been falling. As of October 10, the analyst notes it was down $780 million from recent swing highs, pointing to a possible drop in buying power. Usually, whenever USDC, USDT, and even DAI move to centralized exchanges, more users are keen on buying crypto assets, including ETH and BTC. However, if there is an outflow or its market cap dwindles, it may mean that more users are cautious and closely monitor events before committing. Typically, more coins, including stablecoins, tend to find their way to centralized exchanges when there are concerns about market prospects. Such inflows tend to precede a market-wide correction. Related Reading: SUI Rallies 100%, But Signs Of Fatigue Emerge – Is A Drop Incoming? For now, inflows of ETH to centralized exchanges have not been picked. However, what’s been happening is that more holders have been staking. By mid this week, market data revealed that over 34 million ETH remain locked, earning holders a 3.3% APY.

Veteran Trader Predicts Possible 75% Crash—Here’s Why,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-next-move-veteran-trader-predicts-possible-75-crash-heres-why/,"Peter Brandt, a well-known veteran in the trading community, recently took to X to share a concerning outlook on Bitcoin price trajectory. Brandt’s warning comes amid a relatively stagnant performance by the leading crypto, failing to produce any decisive moves toward new all-time highs in recent months. Brand pointed out a historical pattern that could signal a 75% drop for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Puell Multiple Signals A Bullish Surge: Could A New ATH Be Near? Reason Why A 75% Plunge Could Be Looming In his post, Peter Brandt pointed out that Bitcoin has been moving sideways for 30 weeks since its last all-time high (ATH). He referenced historical patterns, explaining that when Bitcoin fails to make a new ATH within this time frame, it typically experiences a decline of over 75%. Brandt emphasized the importance of Bitcoin breaking out soon, suggesting that a significant drop might follow if it doesn’t. He also mentioned that markets that don’t show upward momentum often struggle to do so. Hey Bitcoiners Are you familiar with the concept of “market analogs?” Here is something to think about It has been 30 weeks since $BTC made an ATH Whenever has not made a decisive new ATH within this time length a 75%+ decline has occurred pic.twitter.com/CUyK4C2W93 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 11, 2024 However, he made it clear that this was an observation based on historical data rather than a prediction or personal opinion, noting: I am always amused by people who confuse a market observation with a market opinion. Drivers who cannot turn their heads in both directions always end up in an accident. Bitcoin Performance And Fundamental Analysis Despite Brandt’s cautionary note, Bitcoin has regained ground after briefly dipping below $60,000. Today, Bitcoin is trading at $62,172, up 2.8% in the past 24 hours after touching a low of $58,982 yesterday. While some traders remain hopeful that Bitcoin will continue its upward trajectory, others are growing concerned about potential volatility, especially given the historical patterns that Brandt has outlined. Data from the CryptoQuant platform further supports the notion of potential downside pressure. According to a recent analysis, BTC’s “Coinbase Premium Gap” has reached its lowest level since August, signaling a wave of selling activity. The Coinbase Premium Gap measures the difference between Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase (a US-based exchange) and other global exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Path To $80,000 “Melt-Up” In Q4 2024 – Details Inside A positive premium typically indicates strong buying pressure from US investors, while a negative premium can reflect waning demand. The current negative premium could suggest that institutional interest in Bitcoin is declining, adding weight to Brandt’s observation that Bitcoin might be on the brink of a major correction.

Despite an 8% decline since September, BTC shows bullish signs, with higher lows and market sentiment indicators not reflecting the price movement. Global liquidity growth and HODLer balance trends hint at a potential BTC price surge, though retail FOMO is currently lacking. iShares Bitcoin Trust offers a low-cost, tax-advantaged way to gain Bitcoin exposure, benefiting from diminished BTC supply and fiat debasement. What the fin-fluencers online have dubbed 'Uptober' has been a disappointment to say the least. The price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has failed to sustain a meaningful rally in the month of October. Some analysts, myself included , have expected positive returns for BTC through the end of the year. Speaking to seasonality in a previous article for Seeking Alpha, I wrote the following: With an 80% win rate going back to 2014, October is historically one of the best months of the year for BTC. The mean change in the month is 19%. Q4 has generally been a good time to let BTC positions run. Alas, October has yet to yield much fruit as we approach the mid-way point of the month: Data by YCharts In fact, BTC has actually fallen by 8% since the end of September. But 'Uptober' is not over yet. There are positive signs emerging that, I think, will help propel Bitcoin higher between now and the end of the year. In this update, we'll look at technical signals, cycle indicators, and ETF flow data for the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). Bitcoin Technicals I don't generally make my Seeking Alpha posts about technical analysis, as I try to focus more on fundamental data. But I see several positive signs in the Bitcoin chart. First, let's examine the weekly: BTC Weekly Chart (TrendSpider) Here we see a very clear structure of lower highs and lower lows between March and early August. Notably, BTC did not revisit the top of this channel on the late-September rally. Instead, it has pulled back once again below the 8-week moving average in two consecutive weeks before reversing higher over the 20-week MA. Consider that the early-September decline made a higher low than the previous decline. At minimum, I believe this action is setting up for yet another test of the top of the trend. The daily chart also provides some interesting insight as well: BTC Daily Chart (TrendSpider) I like this one for the sentiment tell. Outside of a one-week period at the end of September, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has remained in fear for most of the last two months, even though BTC is 27% off its August low . The price is moving higher, but market sentiment indicators don't seem to believe it. I think this is bullish. Not only do I suspect we'll see another test of the trend line from March, but I think we could even see a breakout of resistance. Cycle Indicators Bitcoiners often like to look at pricing models that attempt to gauge things like 'fair value' or cycle top signals. There are numerous such instruments, but I suspect the most important variable in determining where the price of Bitcoin is ultimately going to go is probably global liquidity. Like Gold or other assets more broadly, we've generally seen fiat currency devaluation through the years lead to higher prices for financial assets. This has been true for BTC as well. Bitcoin vs Global M2 Growth (BGeometrics) It's important to keep in mind that Bitcoin is a global phenomenon, in the same way digitally printing fiat currency is a global phenomenon. And though the rate of change is nothing like it has been in previous cycles, growth in global M2 has been on the rise again for most of the last two years. Bitcoin has accounted for much of this liquidity growth. But the parabolic move has alluded us. Right now, we’re already seeing a resurgence in global M2 growth, but the price of BTC hasn’t gone much of anywhere for 6 months. Perhaps there's a meaningful signal there. Or, perhaps, BTC is about to make up some ground. The all important HODLer balance of BTC has dripped down to 12.8 million of the 19.7 million coins in circulation. This is a decline of about 1 million BTC since the start of the year. Bitcoin HODLer Balance (IntoTheBlock) Bitcoin’s HODLer balance hasn’t been this low since Q1-23. I don’t think this is anything to be all that concerned about, to be honest. Typically, what we’ve seen historically is HODLer balance peaks somewhere before the real bull run begins. It isn’t until HODLer balance starts going back up that the price top has generally been in. As far as post-halving price performance goes, the 2024 vintage has been a massive dud to this point: Performance By Halving (IntoTheBlock) This post-halving epoch is admittedly off to a rough start. We are not currently following historical patterns from the previous three epochs. I suspect the approval of the spot ETFs changed things and pulled forward quite a bit of post-halving BTC demand. But one of the big problems for demand is we just don’t have the same level of retail mania 'FOMO' that we’ve seen in the past. If/when that happens, we generally see market prices explode as much as 10x higher than realized prices. BTC Realized Value (BitcoinMagazinePRO) That realized price level is currently $25k. To be clear, I’m not saying we see BTC take out a quarter million per coin; to the contrary, I actually think this cycle’s top is potentially going to disappoint bulls considerably without a parabolic liquidity pump from central banks. The latter of which is possible, but not something that I think investors should be banking on as a certainty just yet. The point is, if market participants see higher BTC prices in the future as a realistic bet, how does one put that trade on without directly buying the coin? iShares Bitcoin Trust As of October 9th, the iShares Bitcoin Trust is home to over 364k BTC: IBIT Holdings (The Block) IBIT is now the largest single holder of Bitcoin in the public markets. The fund almost has as much BTC under management as the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust ( FBTC ) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) combined. Through IBIT, BlackRock ( BLK ) now controls more Bitcoin than MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), Marathon Digital ( MARA ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), and every other public company combined through official balance sheet holdings. IBIT Daily Flows (TheBlock) The 'fee flight' from Grayscale's flagship fund has been well documented at this point. BlackRock's fund has clearly been a large beneficiary of that GBTC outflow. However, even now, with the fee flight story slowing down, IBIT's daily asset flow has very rarely been negative going back to January inception. And there's a good reason for this. The fund's expense ratio is among the lowest in the market at 0.25%. And BlackRock's reputation as a fund manager has perhaps given Bitcoin some level of credence for more traditional investors who would otherwise avoid digital assets altogether. Closing Remarks I believe Bitcoin bulls are going to enjoy Q4-24. 'Uptober' may not have started the way many believed it would, but I don't think that means it's going to end badly. There are positive signs both in the technicals and in some of the cycle data. Fundamentally, Bitcoin continues to have the same setup that has propelled it higher so many times before; diminishing BTC supply and perpetual fiat debasement. In a world with higher BTC prices, IBIT will generate handsome returns. It's among the lowest-cost spot products and remains a more than suitable way to get exposed to Bitcoin through a tax-advantaged traditional investment account.",BTC-USD|IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|ZRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-12 02:20:00
