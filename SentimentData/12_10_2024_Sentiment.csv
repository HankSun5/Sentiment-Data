This fragile situation is underscored by data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which revealed that over 30,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.83 billion, has been transferred to crypto exchanges within a short period. Undoubtedly, such a huge amount of BTC entering crypto exchanges is problematic, especially in terms of a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. 30,000 BTC Sold In 72 Hours According to Santiment data highlighted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC have sold or redistributed around 30,000 BTC in the past 72 hours. Considering the current average price of Bitcoin, this comes out to about $1.83 billion worth of BTC exchanging hands. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analysts Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $10,000 If This Happens #Bitcoin whales have sold or redistributed around 30,000 $BTC in the past 72 hours, totaling $1.83 billion! pic.twitter.com/y9FsARYrmM — Ali (@ali_charts) October 10, 2024 Exchange inflow data from IntoTheBlock, which tracks the activities of various holder cohorts, reveals that on October 8 alone, around 18,220 BTC was moved to exchanges. This was followed by an additional 16,000 BTC on October 9 and roughly 13,800 BTC on October 10. While not all inflows lead to immediate selloffs, high volumes of BTC entering exchanges often suggest that investors are positioning themselves for potential sales. This continued exchange inflow could signal a buildup of selling pressure, with market participants potentially preparing to liquidate their holdings in the near future. Bitcoin Under Increased Selling Pressure? On a positive note, the current selloffs are largely being driven by short-term holders, which has led to a shift in Bitcoin ownership. Many of the BTC being sold are being scooped up by long-term holders, who view the dip as an opportunity to strengthen their positions. This shift in ownership could stabilize the market, as long-term holders are typically less likely to sell going forward. Related Reading: Second XRP ETF Filing Hits The Market, How Did The XRP Price Respond? Moreover, exchange inflow data shows a gradual decline in the amount of BTC being sent to exchanges each day. This trend indicates that fewer investors are moving their Bitcoin into exchange wallets, which could be a sign that the recent wave of selloffs is losing momentum. In terms of exchange reserve, data from CryptoQuant shows a steady decline in the amount of BTC held on wallets controlled by crypto exchanges since the beginning of October. This decline in exchange reserves contradicts the fears of continued selloffs, as it implies there is less Bitcoin available for sale on exchanges. If this trend continues, it could further reduce the selling pressure and provide a more optimistic outlook for Bitcoin’s near-term recovery. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $60,854, establishing a price floor of around $60,000.

Even though investors are upbeat, expecting prices to soar in the coming sessions, uncertainty continues to engulf the market. Ethereum Finds Support At $2,300: Over 52 Million ETH Bought The second world’s most valuable coin is bearish, dumping by over 50% from July highs and unable to break the local resistance at $3,500. As traders closely monitor how price action pans out, one analyst has picked an interesting development from market data. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces ‘Sell-Off Risk’ If It Loses $2,300 Resistance – Analyst Citing IntoTheBlock data on October 11, the analyst observes that over 52 million ETH has been acquired by traders at around the $2,300 level. Considering the amount of coins in the hands of traders at this price, this zone is the immediate support. As such, if buyers have the upper hand, lifting prices from this point, this level will anchor the uptrend. If sellers double down, as has been the case in the past few trading months, the probability of ETH dropping below Q3 2024 lows will be elevated. Presently, the sentiment is bearish, as seen in the CoinMarketCap poll. Over 65% of ETH holders and traders expect prices to struggle in the short term. Therefore, how prices react at the local support will shape the short to medium-term formation. A surge, lifting ETH above $2,800, will be crucial in driving demand, providing the much-needed tailwinds for optimistic traders. USDT, USDC, And Stablecoin Market Cap Falling: Is Buying Power Dwindling? Although optimism is high, other related market data points to weakness. Over the past few trading weeks, the market capitalization of stablecoins like USDT and USDC has been falling. As of October 10, the analyst notes it was down $780 million from recent swing highs, pointing to a possible drop in buying power. Usually, whenever USDC, USDT, and even DAI move to centralized exchanges, more users are keen on buying crypto assets, including ETH and BTC. However, if there is an outflow or its market cap dwindles, it may mean that more users are cautious and closely monitor events before committing. Typically, more coins, including stablecoins, tend to find their way to centralized exchanges when there are concerns about market prospects. Such inflows tend to precede a market-wide correction.

However, what’s been happening is that more holders have been staking. By mid this week, market data revealed that over 34 million ETH remain locked, earning holders a 3.3% APY.
