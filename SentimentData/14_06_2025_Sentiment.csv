Each is moving on strong catalysts, but FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out for its early-stage growth potential and explosive return forecasts. Dogecoin (DOGE) Poised for Momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) is flashing breakout signals as it climbs toward $0.20, with a 23.70% jump in daily volume confirming rising interest. Analyst Trader Tardigrade notes that Dogecoin (DOGE) has cleanly broken past a long-standing resistance trendline, with an impending MACD crossover further strengthening the bullish case. Adoption metrics are also turning heads. According to Santiment , the number of Dogecoin (DOGE) wallet holders has soared to 7.97 million. This surge reflects growing trust and reinforces Dogecoin (DOGE) as a top altcoin in terms of both reach and engagement. XRP Global Reset Narrative Gains Traction XRP is fueling global reset narratives as real-world use cases and institutional backing accelerate. Crypto educator Edo Farina reports that a Chinese firm, Webus International Limited, recently filed a Form 6-K with the SEC, revealing a $300 million XRP treasury management initiative. Furthermore, the approval of RLUSD under Dubai’s DFSA regime, as announced by Ripple, allows XRP-backed stablecoins to operate on XRPL and Ethereum, adding utility. Adding to its widespread acceptance, XRP’s recognition by the United Nations establishes it as a serious player in the future of regulated altcoins. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Altcoin Eyeing a Meteoric $4 Rally While Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP dominate headlines, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is generating buzz with a projected climb from $0.00000035 to $4. This price target signifies an ROI that is truly unparalleled in the current altcoin market, setting a new benchmark for potential gains. With the altcoin still in Stage 2 of its presale, the window presents a rapidly closing opportunity for early adopters to secure explosive upside. Investor activity backs the hype. Over $441,000 has already been raised in the ongoing Stage 2, following $2 million secured in Stage 1, signaling strong market demand. As the upcoming price increase nears, interest in FloppyPepe (FPPE) is surging. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Beyond the Hype – Utility and Trust FloppyPepe (FPPE) is building long-term value through utility. Its AI tools include FloppyAI for real-time market analysis, FloppyX for generating short-form videos, and Meme-o-matic for meme creation. These features put FloppyPepe (FPPE) at the intersection of crypto utility and culture. Investor confidence is further boosted by a smart contract audit completed by SolidProof. Its Floppynomics model also supports sustainability. A 1% transaction burn reduces the circulating supply, 1% rewards holders, and 1% supports wildlife conservation. Meanwhile, top crypto analyst Nass Crypto recently called FloppyPepe (FPPE) an AI gem to his audience of over 1 million, sparking a surge of organic attention. These credibility drivers are fueling its rise as a breakout altcoin. Positioning for Profit: Secure An 80% Token Bonus To incentivize new participants, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is offering an 80% token bonus, now available with the code FLOPPY80 at checkout. This bonus, combined with the deeply discounted entry price of FloppyPepe (FPPE), has ignited FOMO as more buyers rush to secure tokens. With presale progress moving quickly, the opportunity window is closing fast. Investors are urged to buy tokens now and capitalize on this time-sensitive bonus before it’s too late. The demand and FOMO for the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale is already skyrocketing, and only early investors will be able to make potential profits from this rival altcoin. Catch The Next Meme Coin Explosion With The FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale The altcoin and meme coin market is heating up, with Dogecoin (DOGE) showing signs of a breakout, XRP locking in key milestones, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) eyeing an explosive rally. These assets signal that capital is flowing back into crypto broadly. However, the true winner, though, is FloppyPepe (FPPE) , with its sky-high potential and amazing utility. Now is the moment to act. Early positioning in altcoins like FloppyPepe (FPPE) could define portfolios for years to come. As Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP move the macro needle, this rival AI meme coin might be the breakout story everyone wishes they had bought into sooner.

The plan seeks to address Cardano’s low stablecoin-to-TVL ratio. A sovereign-style fund structure and governance board are being considered. Charles Hoskinson , founder of Cardano and CEO of Input Output Global, proposed a plan to convert $100 million worth of ADA from the protocol’s treasury into a blend of stablecoins and Bitcoin. According to a video published by Hoskinson on June 13, Cardano’s current stablecoin-to-TVL ratio is lagging behind Ethereum and Solana, which exceed 100%. He argued that using a portion of the treasury to support stablecoin liquidity could strengthen Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem and attract broader participation. Cardano Decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund https://t.co/8RIELNl872 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 13, 2025 Hoskinson Suggests Treasury Diversification He suggested the converted funds could be allocated across existing assets within Cardano, such as stablecoins like USDA, USDM, and IiUSD, as well as BTC to support emerging Bitcoin DeFi products. “ADA does not have a liquidity problem, so no proposal’s been pushed yet,” Hoskinson said, adding that the network’s daily trading volume would be sufficient to absorb the proposed sale over time through OTC and TWAP mechanisms. He dismissed concerns that such a transaction would depress the price of ADA. The video introduced the idea of a sovereign-style fund structure for managing treasury assets. Hoskinson said this could involve the election of a governing board and partnerships with regulated Web3 asset managers to generate yield and reinvest proceeds into the ecosystem. He emphasized the need to prepare Cardano’s treasury for multi-asset holdings, noting upcoming features such as partner chains and native token support. “As we’re doing the post-mortem on the budget process, make some provisions in the Constitution for more granular treasury management on the portfolio allocation side,” he said. Cardano Joins Broader Push for Multi-Asset Treasury Governance Hoskinson said discussions are ongoing with DeFi projects and large token holders, with the goal of having a formal proposal in place before the Rare Evo conference later this year. “I would argue we need to enhance the voting system as well,” said Hoskinson. “I think the time has come to have some form of anonymous ballot for certain voting rounds so that people, especially smaller people, can vote without fear of retaliation.” Cardano is one of several networks exploring treasury diversification through multi-asset reserves and off-chain yield generation. These efforts follow the model of sovereign-style funds, where asset conversion and reallocation are managed to maintain spending capacity over time. Some DeFi ecosystems are also beginning to introduce formal oversight structures for protocol funds. Proposals under review include elected boards, third-party asset managers, and cross-chain capital deployment, marking a shift in how on-chain treasuries are structured and governed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does Cardano’s treasury compare with other blockchain protocols in size and structure? Cardano holds one of the largest protocol treasuries in crypto, with around 1.7 billion ADA. Unlike some competitors, it currently lacks a yield strategy or multi-asset diversification, which is what this proposal seeks to change. What are the risks of converting ADA to stablecoins and BTC? Risks include market exposure to external assets, execution slippage, and potential backlash from stakeholders concerned about deviating from ADA-only holdings. Regulatory classification of stablecoins could also affect strategy. Could this proposal affect ADA’s on-chain governance or community voting power? If treasury allocations shift to non-ADA assets, and yield returns are reinvested differently, governance weight tied to ADA holdings might dilute unless explicitly addressed in the system design. What precedent is there for treasury investment in crypto ecosystems? Projects like MakerDAO, Optimism, and Uniswap have begun exploring treasury diversification through RWAs, yield-bearing stablecoins, and partnerships with asset managers, but execution varies widely. Why might Cardano want to prioritize Bitcoin DeFi integration? Integrating BTC liquidity could attract new users, tap into dormant capital, and complement stablecoin growth, especially if paired with cross-chain yield strategies and institutional-grade custodial support.

However, the emergence of Ruvi AI , a blockchain-powered platform integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), is sparking conversations among analysts who believe it could surpass Ethereum in potential return on investment. With predictions of a $1 token valuation before the end of 2025 , Ruvi AI is quickly gaining traction as an innovative and lucrative opportunity. Can Ruvi AI Surpass Ethereum? Ethereum’s success is rooted in its early adoption of smart contracts and widespread usage in decentralized applications. Similarly, Ruvi AI is carving its own space in the crypto industry by merging blockchain and AI. This integration allows Ruvi AI to address real-world challenges in industries such as marketing , entertainment , and finance , something Ethereum initially lacked focus on. What makes Ruvi AI particularly attractive are its early-stage growth opportunities. Investors entering during Ruvi AI’s ongoing Phase 2 presale can purchase tokens at just $0.015 each . This low entry point provides a stark contrast to Ethereum’s current valuation, making Ruvi AI a more accessible option for those seeking high returns. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success and Projected Growth Ruvi AI’s presale performance speaks volumes about its market potential. The project has already raised an impressive $1.7 million and sold over 145 million tokens , reflecting growing investor confidence in its vision. By the time the presale ends, Ruvi AI’s token price will increase to $0.07 , a clear and transparent move outlined in its roadmap. This price adjustment is not speculation-driven but part of Ruvi AI’s deliberate strategy to ensure steady growth. Post-listing, analysts predict the token could hit $1 in valuation , representing a 66x return for those who invest early during the presale. Amplified Gains With Ruvi AI’s VIP Tiers For investors looking to boost their returns even further, Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers packed with significant bonuses. Here’s a detailed breakdown: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These tiers are designed to reward early participants, offering opportunities to multiply earnings as the token’s value grows. Building Trust Through Transparency and Security Ruvi AI is not just promising high returns but also focusing on investor reassurance. Its upcoming third-party audit by CyberScope , a leader in blockchain security, will provide a comprehensive review of the platform’s infrastructure. This audit aims to validate Ruvi AI’s codebase and security measures, further elevating confidence among potential investors. Furthermore, Ruvi AI has established a partnership with WEEX Exchange , ensuring global liquidity and smooth trading for its tokens. Such collaborations signify Ruvi AI’s commitment to creating a trustworthy, scalable platform. Real-World Applications That Scale One of Ruvi AI’s defining features is its focus on real-world utility , which sets it apart from speculative tokens. By leveraging AI and blockchain, Ruvi AI creates scalable solutions across key sectors: Marketing: AI-powered analytics empower businesses to refine customer targeting, enhance engagement, and improve campaign results. Entertainment: The platform enables personalized recommendations and integrates secure payment systems, strengthening the connection between creators and audiences. Finance: Ruvi AI applies blockchain for fraud prevention and transaction transparency, making financial operations more efficient and secure. These practical applications ensure Ruvi AI is not just a profitable investment opportunity but also a platform with staying power across industries. Why Ruvi AI Could Outperform Ethereum While Ethereum’s legacy remains strong, its growth potential is naturally limited due to market maturity. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, stands at the cusp of exponential growth with its low entry point , planned valuation increases , and real-world applications . With its $0.015 presale price , attractive VIP rewards , security measures like the CyberScope audit , and its WEEX partnership , Ruvi AI provides an enticing mix of affordability and long-term scalability. These factors make it a compelling option for investors seeking substantial returns before 2025 ends. For those ready to seize a groundbreaking opportunity, Ruvi AI is the rare project that combines innovation, practicality, and explosive growth potential. Secure your stake today and join a revolution that may one day rival, or even surpass, Ethereum’s massive success.

45961347,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70962,1749855638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Sends Urgent Warning to XRP and Crypto Holders,https://timestabloid.com/expert-sends-urgent-warning-to-xrp-and-crypto-holders/,"In a stark video message shared on X, Levi of Crypto Crusaders delivered a sobering warning to holders of XRP and other cryptocurrencies. Citing a statement from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Levi cautioned that the broader crypto market could face a brutal downturn if looming economic risks are not properly addressed. “If you hold any XRP or any other cryptocurrency, I need you to see what I’m about to show you,” Levi began. According to Levi, Secretary Bessent recently issued a dire assessment of the U.S. economy, warning that if the current debt ceiling impasse remains unresolved , the United States could face its worst financial crisis since the 2008 global meltdown. Levi described this as “the most shocking statement any Treasury Secretary has ever made,” emphasizing that the implications stretch far beyond traditional markets and could strike the heart of crypto investments. URGENT WARNING FOR #XRP & CRYPTO HOLDERS! pic.twitter.com/UhVCrUWxAI — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) June 12, 2025 Risk-Off Sentiment Could Trigger Selloffs The core of Levi’s warning is grounded in historical behavior during financial crises. As panic sets in and liquidity tightens, investors tend to abandon riskier asset classes, and crypto sits high on that list. Bitcoin may enjoy some hedge-like qualities in certain macro cycles, but Levi pointed out that altcoins, particularly low-cap and speculative tokens, are likely to face the brunt of the selloff. “During times of financial crisis, people sell their riskier assets,” Levi explained. “If we don’t see the interest rate being lowered by the Federal Reserve before the end of this year, it’s very likely a lot of altcoins, especially the mid to low caps, will get decimated — similar to how they got decimated back in 2021.” His reference to the 2021-2022 crypto crash is a sobering reminder of how quickly markets can unravel under economic stress. In that period, soaring inflation and tightening monetary policy led to a rapid collapse in token prices across the board. Levi’s forecast suggests that without decisive action from the Federal Reserve, the crypto market could be heading into a similarly turbulent phase. Why Interest Rates Matter for Crypto Levi’s concerns also highlight a crucial but often overlooked relationship between monetary policy and the health of the crypto market. When interest rates are high, capital becomes more expensive, borrowing slows, and risk appetite declines. Investors tend to favor safer, yield-bearing assets like government bonds over speculative plays like altcoins. Conversely, when interest rates are lowered, liquidity returns to the market, borrowing costs drop, and high-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, often rally as a result. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For XRP and other digital assets, lower interest rates could act as a tailwind, encouraging institutional investment and retail speculation alike. But with the Federal Reserve maintaining a cautious stance amid persistent inflationary pressures, the hoped-for pivot to rate cuts remains uncertain. If rates remain elevated, the outcome could be catastrophic for certain segments of the crypto market. A Call for Caution While Levi did not issue a blanket call to sell, his message was clear: investors should be prepared. A potential convergence of economic instability, regulatory uncertainty, and hawkish central bank policy poses a serious threat to crypto valuations in the coming months. In Levi’s words, “There’s a reason this warning is coming now. We could be on the edge of something bigger than we’ve seen since 2008.” As global markets hold their breath, crypto holders — particularly those invested in altcoins — would do well to stay informed, practice risk management, and monitor the economic landscape closely. In volatile times like these, even one policy decision or macro shift can reshape the future of digital finance overnight.

As a result, the Donald Trump-backed company has the agency’s greenlight to implement a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury plan . “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities. By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our FinTech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy,” Devin Nunes, Trump Media’s CEO and President, noted What the Approval of Trump Media’s Bitcoin Treasury Bid Means The adoption of Bitcoin by the Trump-backed company is a top gesture that the United States will continue to support the cryptocurrency industry in the long haul. The SEC and the Congress have been working towards ensuring a clear crypto regulatory landscape is implemented in the shortest time possible. As a result, more institutional investors will follow in the same direction of adopting Bitcoin to hedge against high inflation. At the time of this writing, data from BitcoinTreasuries suggest that 235 institutional investors currently hold over 3.4 million BTCs in their respective treasury accounts. The ultimate impact of the rising demand for Bitcoin is a further stress on the supply vs demand shock, which has fueled the BTC rally in the past year. From a technical analysis standpoint, BTC price will experience a parabolic rally before the end of this year catalyzed by institutional investors and clear regulatory frameworks.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 23:12:22

In addition to the direct donation, the foundation said it will match up to $750,000 in community contributions. Ethereum Foundation Steps in to Support Roman Storm as Tornado Cash Trial Looms Storm is set to stand trial on July 14, 2025, in Manhattan federal court. He is charged with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter, conspiracy to launder money, and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions. The Ethereum Foundation described its donation as a stand for privacy and open-source development. “Privacy is normal, and writing code is not a crime,” it wrote in a statement posted Friday on X . The EF is donating $500K to the legal defense of Roman Storm, and we will match up to a further $750K in donations from the community. Privacy is normal, and writing code is not a crime. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) June 13, 2025 Storm was indicted in August 2023 for his role in building and maintaining Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer accused of facilitating the laundering of over $1 billion in illicit funds. The service allegedly allowed users to obscure the source and destination of transactions, an activity that U.S. authorities say was exploited by hackers and criminal networks to move stolen assets . Storm’s trial comes as prosecutors and regulators increase scrutiny of crypto tools tied to privacy and decentralization. His defense has argued that the case threatens the foundation of decentralized finance (DeFi) by criminalizing open-source development. “In 31 days, I face trial,” Storm said in a Friday post on X. “The DOJ wants to bury DeFi, saying I should’ve controlled it, added KYC, never built it. SDNY is trying to crush me, blocking every expert witness. If I lose, DeFi dies with me.” His co-founder, Roman Semenov, was also charged in the case but remains at large, reportedly in Russia. A third developer, Alexey Pertsev, was convicted of money laundering by a Dutch court in May and sentenced to more than five years in prison. He is currently under electronic monitoring as his appeal progresses . Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2022 . The agency claimed the tool had facilitated over $7 billion in illicit transactions since 2019 and failed to adopt safeguards against criminal misuse. Storm’s legal team previously sought to dismiss the charges, arguing that OFAC overstepped its authority by sanctioning the mixer’s smart contracts. That motion followed a separate ruling in a related case that questioned the agency’s reach over decentralized code. With the trial approaching, the Ethereum Foundation’s contribution marks one of the most high-profile shows of support yet for Storm and raises broader questions about how far developers should be held responsible for permissionless code. Vitalik Buterin Donates $170K to Support Tornado Cash Developers Early This Year Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated 50 ETH, worth around $170,000 in January 2025 , to support the legal defense of Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev. @VitalikButerin has stepped forward with a substantial donation to support the legal defense of Tornado Cash developers. #Buterin #ETH https://t.co/b6gbH3KxZw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 1, 2025 The contribution was confirmed through the Juicebox project “Free Pertsev and Storm,” which has so far raised over $650,000 through JusticeDAO, a decentralized fund backed by the crypto community. Buterin’s support follows mounting legal pressure on the developers. In May, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed it would proceed with federal charges against Storm, including allegations of money laundering and sanctions violations. DOJ pursues federal charges against Roman Storm, cofounder of Tornado Cash, after dropping unlicensed money transmission charge. #TornadoCash #RomanStorm https://t.co/ZGXe7IGREZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 16, 2025 The charge relating to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business was later dropped . The legal campaign against Storm has also sparked backlash across the crypto space. In April, the DeFi Education Fund urged the Trump administration to step in , calling the DOJ’s actions a “lawless prosecution” of open-source software developers. The petition has since gained momentum, with signatures from key industry figures including Coinbase’s Fred Ehrsam, Paradigm’s Matt Huang, and Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko.

Curious investors and seasoned traders alike are eagerly eyeing certain coins with the potential for exponential growth. This brief exploration delves into three standout altcoins poised for impressive gains, capable of transforming modest investments into substantial wealth. Dive deeper to discover these promising digital assets. SUI Price Action: Analyzing Recent Trends and Current Dynamics In the past month, SUI recorded a sharp decline of approximately 25.42%, coupled with a six-month drop near 31.94%. This period highlighted significant downward pressure, with historical price movements showcasing both rapid recoveries and severe sell-offs. The momentum over the weeks was mixed, reflecting short-term upticks against a backdrop of overall weak performance. Notably, a 3.75% gain over the last week contrasts with the long-term bearish trend, indicating a phase of volatility that has tested both buyers and sellers. Currently, the price fluctuates between $2.77 and $4.01, with resistance levels identified at $4.77 and $6.01. Key support levels are found at $2.29 and $1.05. Current indicators reveal a bearish sentiment, with an Awesome Oscillator of -0.230 and a Momentum Indicator of -0.219, while the RSI is around 39.66. Although bulls have made some gains this week, the market sentiment remains predominantly bearish without a clear trend. Traders should monitor these levels for buying opportunities near support and consider profit-taking if resistance is breached, while acting cautiously in this volatile environment. Kaspa (KAS): Past Trends and Key Levels Shape the Near-Term Outlook Kaspa experienced a one-month decline of 37.3% and a six-month drop of 49.7%. The market has shown significant lows and steep falls, indicating a consistent bearish pressure. This performance highlights the challenges faced by investors and the overall sentiment in the market. The past weeks have reflected a struggle to regain stability, driven by negative trends and decreased interest among traders. The current price for Kaspa sits within a range of approximately $0.065 to $0.116, with support at $0.047 and resistance at $0.15. Bears continue to dominate, supported by negative momentum signals and a low RSI near 36. There is no clear upward or downward trend, allowing for trade opportunities based on price fluctuations. Short-term buying near the support level could be considered, while caution is advised regarding potential declines. A break above $0.15 may signal a shift that could favor bulls, suggesting the need for tight stop-loss orders to manage risks. Hyperliquid Shows Robust Growth and Bullish Potential Hyperliquid experienced substantial gains in recent periods, with a 16.05% increase over one week followed by a 52.88% rise in one month. Over the past six months, the coin advanced by 62.21%, showing vibrant investor interest and pronounced price expansion. Movements ranged from a low of $21.20 to a high near $42.08, reflecting dynamic market activity. These gains underline the asset’s evolving strength and momentum, highlighting consistent upward trends and bullish sentiment that encouraged traders to take strong positions. At present, Hyperliquid trades within a range between $21 and $42. The market has identified resistance at approximately $51 and support just under $10. A secondary target for upward movement exists near $72, suggesting additional gains may be possible if bulls can overcome current obstacles. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index near 63 show buying interest is sustained without reaching overbought territory. With technical signals favoring bulls while acknowledging potential pauses ahead, investors are closely monitoring these key levels. Strategies include entering near support to capture pullbacks and watching resistance for breakouts. Overall, the situation is balanced with bullish strength but still respects previous trading thresholds. Conclusion SUI , KAS , and HYPE are promising investments with potential for high returns by 2025. Their unique features and growing user base suggest significant growth opportunities. These coins have demonstrated strong performance and innovation in the crypto market. Keeping an eye on their development and market trends could prove beneficial. Investing in these altcoins could lead to substantial financial gains in the near future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Qubetics Could Be Among the Top Altcoins to Buy This Year,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-not-buying-chainlink-early-qubetics-could-be-among-the-top-altcoins-to-buy-this-year/,"The altcoin landscape in mid-2025 is once again shifting. As the broader market stabilizes, with Bitcoin maintaining its position above $70,000 and Ethereum holding near $3,700, market attention is turning to altcoins that offer real infrastructure value rather than speculative hype. Chainlink ($LINK)—one of the most pivotal DeFi infrastructure projects—continues to be a benchmark for long-term performance, having launched at just $0.11 in 2017 and now trading above $14. The protocol played a foundational role in connecting smart contracts to off-chain data, and its impact on the broader blockchain ecosystem remains significant. Yet, as market participants look for new opportunities with asymmetric upside, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged as a powerful contender among the top altcoins to buy. While Chainlink solidified its place in crypto history, Qubetics is building for the future—delivering solutions for one of blockchain’s most persistent challenges: cross-border transactions. Qubetics is gaining attention for more than just projections—it’s standing out for its bold approach to tokenomics, reduced total supply, and a focused commitment to solving real-world inefficiencies in cross-border value transfer. Unlike earlier blockchain initiatives that emphasized scalability without addressing end-user pain points, Qubetics is delivering practical infrastructure designed to streamline international payments across chains and currencies. Analysts have issued confident forecasts, with long-term valuations ranging between $10 and $15 following mainnet launch—highlighting the protocol’s potential to emerge as a dominant force in next-generation decentralized finance, making it the top altcoins to buy now. Qubetics ($TICS): Practical Solutions for Cross-Border Financial Connectivity Qubetics is entering the final stage of its crypto presale , but the traction it has achieved in just three months reflects more than market timing—it reflects market fit. The protocol’s core utility revolves around solving one of blockchain’s most under-addressed challenges: efficient cross-border transactions. Despite advancements across the industry, sending money across jurisdictions remains expensive, fragmented, and time-consuming. Qubetics is building infrastructure to make these transactions seamless, fast, and accessible across multiple chains and currencies. Traditional cross-border transactions often involve delays, high intermediary fees, and complex compliance checks. For businesses operating internationally—whether it’s an e-commerce brand in the US sourcing products from Southeast Asia or a European SaaS platform accepting payments from Latin America—these inefficiencies eat into profits and stall growth. Qubetics addresses this problem with its decentralised payment rails, allowing direct, peer-to-peer transfers validated on-chain without banks or intermediaries. This significantly reduces transaction costs, enables near-instant settlements, and ensures traceability and transparency without compromising security. With its native interoperability, Qubetics supports seamless asset flow across major blockchain networks, removing the need for wrapped tokens or centralised bridges. A logistics startup in Nairobi can pay suppliers in Tokyo using $TICS without worrying about currency exchange delays or hefty conversion fees. Similarly, freelancers in remote locations can receive payments securely, while platforms leveraging Qubetics can automatically comply with regional regulations using its embedded compliance modules. This makes Qubetics more than a payments tool—it becomes a real-world financial infrastructure for the decentralized age and the top altcoins to buy today. Use cases for Qubetics span a broad spectrum. Global freelancers, for example, face significant payment delays and excessive conversion fees—Qubetics enables instant, stablecoin-based payouts across borders. Small businesses managing international vendors or customers can settle invoices securely and immediately without third-party interference or the volatility of traditional remittance channels. Even nonprofits distributing aid to remote regions can benefit from transparent, traceable on-chain payments that reduce corruption and middlemen. Currently, Qubetics is in Stage 37 of its crypto presale. The token is priced at $0.3370, with 10 million tokens remaining before its public allocation closes. A listing price of $0.40 has been confirmed, providing a 20% ROI for final-stage buyers. Being one of the top altcoins to buy, this project has already raised over $18 million from more than 27,900 holders and has distributed over 515 million $TICS tokens, indicating strong early adoption. In a major shift toward scarcity and governance decentralization, Qubetics recently reduced its total token supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion and increased its public sale allocation to 38.55%. Analysts are taking notice, with price forecasts ranging from $1 shortly after listing to $10–$15 post-mainnet launch. For a strategic buyer, the numbers are compelling: an $18,000 investment at the current price secures approximately 53,414 $TICS. At $1, that value rises to $53,414. At $5, it reaches $267,070. And at $15, the projected high, it grows to $801,210. The Qubetics ecosystem is supported by real infrastructure tools. QubeQode, a proprietary development IDE, allows developers to build blockchain applications natively. TICSScan provides block-level transparency. This is not a marketing campaign in search of utility; this is a fully structured ecosystem aimed at driving long-term adoption in both enterprise and retail environments. Chainlink ($LINK): The Oracle Pioneer with Long-Term Stability Chainlink revolutionized the way smart contracts interact with external data, making it a cornerstone of the modern DeFi infrastructure. From its modest beginnings at $0.11 per token, Chainlink surged to over $50 during the 2021 bull run and currently trades in the $13–$14 range as of June 2025. Its decentralized oracle networks have been integrated across sectors ranging from decentralized finance and insurance to gaming and logistics, enabling smart contracts to execute with real-world information securely. The protocol’s development has not slowed. Recent launches such as Chainlink Functions and the continued rollout of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) are focused on enhancing developer tools and expanding cross-chain communication capabilities. Chainlink’s positioning today is less about explosive growth and more about sustained reliability. It has become a foundational layer for many applications, earning its status as a blue-chip asset within the digital asset class. However, the significant gains made in its early years have leveled off, and many in the market now view Chainlink as a long-term hold rather than a high-growth opportunity. For those seeking substantial near-term appreciation—especially among the top altcoins to buy—emerging Layer-1 protocols like Qubetics are generating more aggressive interest. Conclusion: Chainlink Holds the Past, Qubetics May Define What’s Next Chainlink remains an essential component of the blockchain data infrastructure. It continues to deliver reliable value for those seeking a secure and established asset. However, its growth is now measured and incremental. For buyers seeking dynamic upside, with direct application to real-world financial problems and a tokenomics structure designed for performance, Qubetics stands out as one of the top altcoins to buy in this cycle. The presale is nearing completion. The final $TICS tokens are in distribution. The listing price offers immediate upside, and the longer-term forecasts signal the kind of potential that early-stage backers seek. With global use cases, an aggressive development roadmap, and measurable demand, Qubetics offers more than narrative—it offers execution. For those who missed the earliest days of Chainlink, Qubetics may offer a comparable opportunity, backed by stronger fundamentals, a community-first distribution model, and real-world solutions.

Officials in the department’s antitrust division, who are probing the deal , have reportedly been examining the details of the Alphabet Inc. unit’s plan following its announcement in March, said the sources, who asked to be kept anonymous. Such inquiries include discussions with the merging companies as well as competitors and customers. The review, which is still in its early stages, is expected to last some months and will ultimately determine whether US officials let the deal proceed. The review is in its early stages and could take months Full-scale antitrust merger reviews are relatively rare compared to the number of deals announced each year, so the firms have been preparing for scrutiny . Google has agreed to pay Wiz a breakup fee of about $3.2 billion, or about 10% of the deal value, if it doesn’t close, which is a risk as the iconic company has been facing intense antitrust scrutiny from Washington. In the past year, federal judges found that it has illegal monopolies in online search and some advertising technology markets. As such, it is facing a potential breakup of large parts of its business, including its Chrome web browser and some advertising tools used to place display ads around the web. Google’s planned acquisition of Wiz is one of its largest purchases Wiz is not Google’s first large cybersecurity purchase. In 2022, it acquired Mandiant for $5.4 billion in an effort to bulk up its cloud computing business, which has historically lagged behind its peers. Google’s largest acquisitions by dollar value. Source: App Economy Insights If the deal goes through, it will have set a record as one of the company’s largest purchases, beating its Motorola purchase of $12.5 billion and the Mandiant acquisition of $5.4 billion. Mandiant and Wiz provide complementary services. However, while Mandiant specializes in threat intelligence and cyber breaches, Wiz’s tools do that and work to identify and block threats across organizations’ often-complex cloud environments. Wiz is also integrated with competing services from Amazon.com Inc., Oracle Corp. and Microsoft. While announcing the deal, Google touted the acquisition as a way to beef up its cloud security offerings and provide customers with new ways to keep their systems secure in a new era of AI. Both companies have said Wiz’s products will continue to work on major cloud platforms, including competing services. Google’s attempt to acquire Wiz is happening at a time when the cloud security market is booming. The market is already worth over $30 billion today, and that value is expected to triple by 2034.

With ADA currently trading near $0.69, backed by a strong ecosystem of smart contracts and DeFi integration, MUTM is turning heads thanks to its aggressive presale momentum, upcoming CertiK audit, and lean protocol design targeted at DeFi users. The project has gained more than 11,900 investors who have contributed $10.45 million during the ongoing presale. Investors taking part in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will see a 100% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Analysts highlight MUTM as one of the best new altcoins to buy now, citing its low entry price, scalable architecture, and potential to become the next big cryptocurrency. As investors ask what crypto to invest in before altcoins run full steam, MUTM’s positioning under $1 makes it a standout in today’s fast-moving market. Reimagining DeFi Lending with a Powerful Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders can depend on regular income, while borrowers find safe options when they borrow money. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance Presale Now Underway The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of risky meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $10.45 million total sales and attracted more than 11,900 token holders before the following price adjustment. Certified Secure: USD-Pegged Stablecoin Validated by CertiK Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin’s robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. Underpinned by open-source smart contracts and the success of a Certik audit, the platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem, charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. Early Investors Reap Rewards as Community Expands As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway prize, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. Cardano’s sluggish network activity and fading transaction volumes are casting doubt over ADA’s near-term prospects, prompting many investors to reassess their exposure. Meanwhile, smart money is pivoting toward high-utility projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as the best new altcoin to watch, with its presale already drawing in over $10.45 million from 11,900+ investors and delivering real utility at just $0.03 per token. With a launch price of $0.06, early participants are set to lock in a 100% ROI, and analysts are forecasting breakout potential that could rival or even surpass major players like Cardano.

45962792,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=771525,1749857435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45962792.jpeg,"XRP Has A 70% Shot To Beat Bitcoin, Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-70-shot-to-beat-bitcoin-says-analyst/,"A fresh XRP/BTC chart released on 12 June by the market technician known as Dr. Cat has injected new controversy into one of crypto’s most stubborn trading pairs. The analyst, posting to X, argues that despite a bruising six-week slide, conditions still favour an eventual breakout for XRP that would leave Bitcoin lagging. He assigns the scenario a formidable 70 percent probability. XRP Vs. Bitcoin: 70% Chance Of Breakout, But When? At the heart of Dr. Cat’s thesis is the 2,041-satoshi level, where three separate Ichimoku timeframes—monthly, bi-monthly and tri-monthly—intersect. “The price keeps eating support after support with no reaction from bulls at all as if supports don’t exist,” he concedes, but he stresses that this specific shelf is “the most important support.” Related Reading: XRP Could Crash To $1.55 Before Explosive Surge, Analyst Warns Candles on the attached one-month chart already hover fractionally below the line; a decisive monthly close beneath it, he warns, would flip the three-day structure fully bearish and scatter the pair into unpredictable, possibly chaotic ranges. Even so, the strategist insists history is on the side of XRP bulls. “Price has spent years performing very well and coiling up with higher lows for this attack now,” he writes, framing the past twelve quarters as a prolonged accumulation that has never surrendered its series of macro higher lows. That coiling, he believes, will allow XRP to mount at least a “minor … attack in August” toward the 3,000-satoshi region—roughly a 45 percent appreciation from current levels—and perhaps fuel a “much bigger attack” once the broader market cycle matures. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Flag Pattern Above Accumulation Zone That Points To $5 Target The optimism is not unqualified. Dr. Cat calculates a 30 percent chance of a complete flop if 2,041 sats fails on a monthly-close basis. Under that bearish branch, the cross could slice toward 1,800 – 1,900 sats, attempt a feeble rebound, or continue a “slow bleed all the way down to the bottom of the range where it started the monster move.” In such a setback, he would not expect the long-anticipated “monster bullish move” until Q4 2025 at the earliest. For the moment, therefore, the market hangs on a single number. Hold above 2,041 and Dr. Cat sees a clear shot at outperforming Bitcoin—first modestly, then dramatically.

Ethena is gaining momentum with strong technical signals and growing traction in the DeFi space. Pi Coin continues to generate buzz, but questions around its delayed mainnet and unclear roadmap are keeping some traders cautious. In the middle of this activity, BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging as a clear standout. Still in presale, it has already raised over $299.6 million and sold 22.4 billion coins. The current price of $0.0276, offering 2660% ROI from batch 1 to batch 29. What makes BlockDAG different is not just scale, but presence. With 1.5 million users mining through the X1 app, a CertiK audit, and a gamified ecosystem, the project is already making waves. Add in the rumoured US-based sponsorship, and BDAG is poised to leap from crypto circles into the cultural spotlight. Ethena Climbs Toward $0.50 as DeFi Momentum Returns Ethena is gaining attention after breaking past key resistance levels, with analysts now targeting a move toward $0.50. Rising total value locked across its ecosystem is fueling confidence, while its synthetic stablecoin, USDe, continues to attract new interest. This resurgence in utility is placing Ethena in the spotlight as a DeFi contender with serious upside. Technical indicators are flashing bullish signals. Surging volume and strong moving averages support the rally, but Ethena still depends on broader market strength. If sentiment holds, ENA could lead the next DeFi breakout. If not, the move may lose steam just as quickly as it started. Pi Coin Rally Watch Begins, But Uncertainty Lingers Pi Coin is testing resistance near $0.66 after bouncing off recent lows, and trading volume is on the rise. Market chatter is heating up, with some speculating a run to $1.20 or even $2 if momentum continues. Much of the buzz comes from Pi’s large user base and mobile-first promise. Still, big questions remain. The mainnet has seen repeated delays, and the lack of a clear KYC rollout adds to concerns. On-chain activity is minimal, making real adoption hard to measure. Pi Coin has potential, but its future depends on clearing the fog around its execution and roadmap. BlockDAG Redefines Presale Power with $299.6M Raised and Viral Reach BlockDAG is pushing boundaries and setting new records for what a presale crypto can achieve. With over $299.6 million raised and 22.4 billion coins sold, it has become one of the standout campaigns of the year. Priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, BlockDAG has already sold 22.4B coins and raised $299.6 million. Those who joined in Batch 1 have gained 2,660%. What separates BlockDAG from other early-stage projects is not just numbers; it is visibility. The project has leaned into bold branding moves and already secured partnerships with names like Inter Milan and UFC champion Alex Pereira. This strategy pushes BlockDAG beyond the crypto niche and into wider cultural relevance. At the core is real utility. The X1 Miner app is live and growing rapidly, now used by over 1.5 million people globally. The app rewards users daily for simple engagement, no hardware or deep technical skills required. Accessibility is converting casual users into consistent contributors. Backed by CertiK-audited security, an EVM-compatible DAG structure, and viral features like Buyer Battles and streak rewards, BlockDAG is not waiting for its launch to deliver. It is already building the kind of engaged ecosystem most projects only dream about. The Bottom Line Ethena is gaining traction and Pi Coin is stirring speculation, but BlockDAG is building something far more complete. BlockDAG is rolling through Batch 29 at $0.0276. It’s raised $299.6 million and sold 22.4 billion coins and crossed 1.5 million x1 app users. Batch 1 holders? They’re sitting on 2,660% gains. More than just numbers, BlockDAG is edging into mainstream visibility. Its expanding brand strategy and real-world presence are setting it apart from typical presale projects. For those watching closely, BDAG is emerging as a leading contender for the highest potential crypto of 2025.

If you’re an investor or simply curious about the future of digital assets, a recent report from a major player in the institutional finance world has just dropped some significant insights. Coinbase Institutional , the arm of Coinbase catering to larger financial entities, has shared its outlook, and it’s decidedly bullish, especially when it comes to Bitcoin and its potential to reach new all-time highs ( ATHs ). What Did the Coinbase Institutional Report Say About Bitcoin ATHs? According to analysis highlighted by The Block, Coinbase Institutional believes that the stage is being set for Bitcoin to potentially achieve fresh ATHs in the latter half of 2025. This isn’t just a hopeful guess; their report outlines several key macroeconomic and industry-specific factors that they see driving this potential surge. It’s a forecast rooted in observed trends and anticipated policy shifts. Their perspective offers a glimpse into how large financial institutions are viewing the digital asset space. While retail interest often grabs headlines, the flow of capital and strategic positioning by institutional players like those served by Coinbase Institutional can significantly impact market dynamics and contribute to price movements towards new ATHs . What Factors Are Driving This Optimism for the Crypto Market? The report from Coinbase Institutional points to a confluence of factors that could create a favorable environment for Bitcoin and the broader Crypto Market . Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the potential trajectory outlined in their analysis. Here are the primary catalysts identified: Stronger U.S. Economic Growth: A robust economy can signal increased investor confidence and potentially more disposable or investable capital looking for returns, including in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Potential U.S. Federal Reserve Rate Cuts: Lower interest rates typically make riskier assets, such as growth stocks and potentially cryptocurrencies, more attractive compared to traditional fixed-income investments. This shift in monetary policy could encourage capital flows into the Crypto Market . Rising Corporate Adoption: As more corporations begin to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, integrate blockchain technology, or offer crypto-related services, it lends legitimacy and increases demand, contributing to Institutional Adoption . Greater Regulatory Clarity: Uncertainty around regulations has long been a hurdle for the Crypto Market . Clearer rules of the road can reduce risk for institutional investors, making it easier and safer for them to allocate capital to digital assets. These points collectively paint a picture of a maturing market environment where external economic forces and internal industry developments align to support upward price potential for Bitcoin towards new ATHs . Considering the Risks: What Could Challenge Bitcoin’s Rise to New ATHs? While the outlook is optimistic, Coinbase Institutional ‘s report doesn’t ignore potential headwinds. A balanced view is essential in any market forecast. They specifically mention two key risks: Rising Yields: Conversely to rate cuts, if bond yields rise unexpectedly, traditional safe-haven assets become more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from the Crypto Market . Leveraged Corporate Crypto Buying: While corporate adoption is a bullish signal, excessive use of leverage by companies to acquire crypto assets could introduce instability. A market downturn could trigger liquidations, amplifying price drops. These risks highlight the inherent volatility still present in the Crypto Market and serve as important considerations for investors evaluating the potential path to new ATHs . Why Does Institutional Adoption Matter for the Crypto Market? The mention of rising corporate and Institutional Adoption is particularly significant. Historically, the Crypto Market was dominated by retail investors. However, as infrastructure has improved and regulatory landscapes have begun to clarify, larger financial institutions, asset managers, and corporations are increasingly exploring or entering the space. This inflow of significant capital and expertise provides greater liquidity, stability, and validation to the market. Coinbase Institutional is at the forefront of facilitating this trend, and their insights are valuable because they are directly engaging with this crucial segment of the market. Actionable Insights: What Can Investors Learn from This Forecast? While no market forecast is a guarantee, the perspective from Coinbase Institutional offers several takeaways for those interested in the Crypto Market : Long-Term Perspective: The focus is on H2 2025, suggesting that significant price movements towards new ATHs might not be immediate. Patience could be key. Macroeconomic Awareness: Pay attention to global economic indicators, particularly U.S. growth data and Federal Reserve policy decisions, as these are identified as major drivers. Regulatory Watch: Keep an eye on regulatory developments. Positive clarity could unlock further institutional capital. Risk Management: Be aware of the potential risks, such as rising yields and leverage, and incorporate risk management into your investment strategy. This isn’t financial advice, but rather a look at the factors a major institutional player believes will shape the market. In Conclusion: A Bullish Horizon for Bitcoin and the Crypto Market? The report from Coinbase Institutional provides a compelling case for optimism regarding Bitcoin ‘s potential to reach new ATHs by the second half of 2025. Their analysis, grounded in anticipated macroeconomic shifts, increasing Institutional Adoption , and potential regulatory clarity, suggests a favorable environment is developing for the Crypto Market . While acknowledging the risks, the overall sentiment is clearly positive, offering a potential roadmap for what the coming years might hold for digital assets. It underscores the growing influence of institutional players and the evolving narrative around cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class.

Following a surge in Middle East tensions, the market saw a brief but sharp reaction, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable dip. However, the story didn’t end there. Demonstrating remarkable resilience, the Bitcoin price quickly began to recover, leaving many investors pondering the implications of geopolitical events on the digital asset landscape. Why Did Middle East Tensions Impact the Bitcoin Price? Geopolitical events often send ripples through global financial markets, and the crypto market is no exception. When tensions escalate in significant regions like the Middle East, several factors come into play: Risk-Off Sentiment: Investors tend to move away from perceived riskier assets and towards safer havens like gold or government bonds during times of uncertainty. While Bitcoin is sometimes seen as digital gold, its relatively young age and volatility mean some investors still classify it as a risk asset, leading to sell-offs during global fear. Liquidity Crunch: Major global events can sometimes lead to a need for immediate liquidity. This can cause investors to sell assets, including cryptocurrencies, to cover potential losses elsewhere or meet margin calls. Market Psychology: Fear and uncertainty are powerful drivers in any market. News headlines about escalating conflicts can trigger panic selling, even if the direct impact on the asset’s underlying fundamentals is minimal. The recent tensions between Israel and Iran served as a clear catalyst, prompting a swift reaction across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin saw a drop of approximately 5.5% from its recent highs as the news unfolded. Understanding the Recent BTC Recovery What’s particularly striking about this episode is the speed and strength of the subsequent BTC recovery . Almost as quickly as it dipped, Bitcoin began to claw back its losses. According to reports, Bitcoin found support and bounced back significantly, illustrating the underlying demand and bullish sentiment that persists in the market. This bounce was reportedly supported by key technical levels, such as the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). For those less familiar with technical analysis, the 50-day SMA is a widely watched indicator that smooths out price data over the past 50 days, providing a dynamic support or resistance level. When price holds above this line, it’s often seen as a sign of underlying strength. The rapid recovery suggests that the dip was primarily driven by short-term panic or leveraged positions being liquidated, rather than a fundamental shift in the market’s long-term outlook. Once the initial wave of selling subsided, buyers stepped back in, eager to acquire Bitcoin at a discount. Historical Parallels: Learning from Past Shocks This isn’t the first time geopolitical events have impacted the crypto market , nor is it the first time Bitcoin has shown resilience in the face of such shocks. The market often looks back at previous instances for clues on how assets might react. A notable parallel mentioned in market discussions is Bitcoin’s reaction to events in October 2023. Following reports of missile attacks, Bitcoin experienced a decline of around 8.8%. However, this dip proved to be a short-lived correction before the price resumed a significant upward trajectory, preceding a rally that saw substantial gains. These historical examples suggest a pattern: while initial geopolitical shocks can trigger immediate negative reactions due to uncertainty and risk aversion, they often do not derail the longer-term trend for Bitcoin, especially if the underlying bullish catalysts remain intact. Instead, these dips can sometimes be viewed by long-term investors as buying opportunities. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Bitcoin’s ability to recover quickly from a dip induced by major global events sends a positive signal to the broader crypto market . It suggests that: Underlying Demand is Strong: Despite short-term volatility triggers, there is persistent buying pressure keeping the price supported. Market Maturity: While still volatile, the market is becoming more sophisticated. Investors are quicker to differentiate between fundamental shifts and temporary external shocks. Potential for Decoupling: While correlated with traditional finance in some ways, Bitcoin’s reaction patterns can differ, sometimes recovering independently or even acting as a hedge in the long run, although this is still debated. The recovery in Bitcoin often leads to a positive sentiment ripple effect across altcoins, as Bitcoin’s performance heavily influences the overall health of the digital asset space. Bitcoin Forecast: Eyes on $150k and Beyond Despite the recent volatility, the long-term Bitcoin forecast remains overwhelmingly positive among many analysts. The dip and subsequent recovery are viewed by some as merely noise in a larger bullish trend. Several key factors underpin this optimistic outlook: The Halving: The quadrennial Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, decreases supply and has historically been a significant catalyst for price appreciation. Spot ETF Inflows: The approval and success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the door for significant institutional and retail capital to flow into Bitcoin, providing sustained buying pressure. Increasing Adoption: Growing awareness and adoption of Bitcoin and blockchain technology by individuals, corporations, and even some nation-states contribute to its value proposition. Macroeconomic Factors: Ongoing concerns about inflation and currency devaluation in various parts of the world lead some to view Bitcoin as a store of value or a hedge against traditional financial instability. Given these strong tailwinds, analysts are predicting ambitious targets for the end of 2024 and beyond. Price targets ranging from $100,000 to $150,000, and even as high as $200,000, are frequently cited. The recent recovery from the geopolitical dip is seen by proponents as further evidence that short-term shocks are unlikely to prevent Bitcoin from reaching these higher valuations in the coming months. Navigating Volatility: Challenges and Actionable Insights While the quick BTC recovery is encouraging, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile. Geopolitical risks, regulatory uncertainty, and unexpected market shifts can always lead to further price swings. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this environment: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand what you are investing in. Don’t make decisions based solely on headlines or social media hype. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps average out your purchase price and reduces the stress of volatility. Focus on the Long Term: Short-term price movements, especially those triggered by external events, can be distracting. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, focus on the bigger picture. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders or diversifying your portfolio. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news and global events, but react thoughtfully, not impulsively. The recent dip and recovery serve as a powerful reminder that volatility is part of the journey in the crypto space. However, they also highlight Bitcoin’s growing maturity and its ability to bounce back from external shocks. Compelling Summary In conclusion, the recent episode where Middle East tensions caused a temporary drop in Bitcoin price , followed by a rapid BTC recovery , underscores the complex interplay between global events and the digital asset market. While geopolitical uncertainty can trigger short-term dips, Bitcoin’s quick bounce back, supported by technical levels like the 50-day SMA, demonstrates its underlying strength and resilience. This pattern echoes past instances where dips caused by external shocks preceded significant rallies. With strong fundamental drivers like the halving and ETF inflows, the long-term Bitcoin forecast remains bullish, with many analysts predicting substantial price appreciation towards and beyond $150,000. For investors, this event is a valuable lesson in market dynamics, highlighting the importance of staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective in the volatile yet promising crypto market .

What Did SharpLink Gaming Acquire? According to a recent GlobeNewswire press release, SharpLink Gaming has purchased a staggering 176,271 ETH. This acquisition comes with a hefty price tag, valued at approximately $463 million at the time of the purchase. This isn’t just a small dip into the crypto market; this is a substantial commitment. The company revealed that this significant ETH holding now constitutes over 95% of its total treasury reserves. This strategic shift positions ETH as the primary treasury reserve asset for SharpLink Gaming. To help finance this substantial purchase, SharpLink Gaming successfully raised $79 million through a share sale. This demonstrates a clear intent to back their new treasury strategy with fresh capital specifically allocated for this purpose. Why is SharpLink Gaming’s ETH Purchase Significant? This acquisition immediately propels SharpLink Gaming into a unique position within the publicly traded company landscape. By acquiring 176,271 ETH, SharpLink Gaming becomes the largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum globally. While other companies hold Bitcoin (BTC) as a treasury asset (like MicroStrategy), SharpLink’s move is particularly notable for its focus and scale within the Ethereum ecosystem. The decision by a Public Company listed on Nasdaq to allocate such a significant portion of its treasury to a volatile asset like ETH is a powerful indicator. It suggests a growing belief among some traditional companies in the long-term value and potential of decentralized technologies and specific digital assets like Ethereum. Furthermore, the press release highlighted that over 95% of their acquired ETH is being staked or used in liquid staking protocols. This is a crucial detail. Staking ETH allows holders to earn rewards by participating in the network’s security and validation process. Liquid staking provides similar yield-earning opportunities while maintaining liquidity. This suggests SharpLink isn’t just holding the asset; they are actively utilizing it to generate yield, potentially offsetting some of the risks associated with price volatility. Implications of Adopting ETH as a Treasury Asset Adopting ETH as a primary treasury asset presents both potential benefits and challenges for SharpLink Gaming: Potential Benefits: Yield Generation: Staking provides a passive income stream on their significant holdings. Potential Appreciation: Belief in Ethereum’s future growth and adoption could lead to substantial returns. Diversification: Offers diversification away from traditional fiat and financial instruments. Alignment with Technology: As an online technology company, embracing a leading blockchain asset could align with their business focus. Potential Challenges: Price Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for significant price swings, which could impact the company’s balance sheet. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Custody and Security Risks: Safely storing and managing such a large amount of digital assets requires robust security measures. Accounting Treatment: How cryptocurrencies are treated for accounting and tax purposes can be complex. This strategic decision by SharpLink Gaming could potentially pave the way for other publicly traded companies to explore similar moves into the Ethereum ecosystem, especially given the yield opportunities offered by staking. What Does This Mean for Ethereum? For the Ethereum network, this represents a significant vote of confidence from the traditional finance world. A Nasdaq-listed company making such a large-scale acquisition and adopting ETH as a core treasury asset adds credibility and visibility to the asset. It highlights Ethereum’s growing status beyond just a platform for decentralized applications to a store of value and yield-bearing asset for institutional players. The fact that the majority is staked also contributes directly to the security and stability of the Ethereum network, further strengthening its infrastructure. Looking Ahead SharpLink Gaming’s bold move to acquire 176,271 ETH and become the largest Public Company holder of Ethereum is a landmark event. It signifies a potential shift in how traditional companies view and utilize digital assets, moving beyond just speculative interest to integrating them into core financial strategies. While the volatile nature of the crypto market means this strategy isn’t without risk, SharpLink’s commitment, backed by capital raised specifically for this purpose and their focus on staking for yield, indicates a well-considered approach to leveraging their new Treasury Asset . This development will undoubtedly be watched closely by both the crypto community and the traditional finance world, potentially influencing future institutional adoption trends for Ethereum and other digital assets.

This strategic decision by a prominent company in Brazil underscores the growing interest from traditional businesses in leveraging digital assets for balance sheet management and investment. Why Méliuz is Doubling Down on Bitcoin Investment According to reports, Méliuz successfully raised $32.5 million with the explicit intention of using these funds to acquire more Bitcoin . This isn’t their first foray into the crypto market; as of May 31st, Méliuz already held a notable 320.25 BTC. The decision to raise capital specifically for this purpose signals a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Several factors likely influence companies like Méliuz to pursue a crypto investment strategy: Inflation Hedge: With global economic uncertainty, Bitcoin is often viewed as a potential hedge against inflation due to its finite supply. Store of Value: Bitcoin’s characteristics as a decentralized, immutable digital asset appeal to companies seeking a robust store of value outside traditional financial systems. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can diversify assets away from traditional fiat currencies and securities. Alignment with Customer Base: As a fintech company, Méliuz’s customer base is likely tech-savvy and potentially interested in cryptocurrencies, making this move align with their brand and future offerings. Potential for Appreciation: Despite volatility, the long-term growth potential of Bitcoin remains a key driver for corporate adoption . What Does This $32.5M Raise Mean for Méliuz and Corporate Adoption? Raising $32.5 million solely for Bitcoin acquisition is a bold statement. It indicates that Méliuz sees Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic component of its financial future. This move could potentially: Strengthen Balance Sheet: A significant BTC holding could appreciate over time, enhancing the company’s overall financial position. Attract Investors: Companies with a clear crypto strategy can attract investors interested in the digital asset space. Set a Precedent in Brazil: As a leading fintech in Brazil , Méliuz’s decision could encourage other Brazilian companies to explore similar strategies, boosting local corporate adoption . While the exact amount of Bitcoin Méliuz will acquire with the $32.5 million depends on the market price at the time of purchase, it will significantly increase their existing 320.25 BTC holdings. This represents a substantial commitment to the digital asset class. Brazil’s Growing Interest in Crypto Investment Brazil has emerged as a key player in the Latin American cryptocurrency market. Regulatory clarity is improving, and public interest is high. Méliuz’s move is not isolated but part of a broader trend of increasing crypto investment and adoption within the country, both at the individual and corporate levels. The country has seen increasing trading volumes on exchanges and a growing number of businesses integrating crypto payments or exploring blockchain technology. Méliuz, being a fintech, is well-positioned to navigate this evolving landscape and potentially integrate crypto services further into its platform in the future. Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Holders While the potential benefits of holding Bitcoin are significant, companies undertaking such a strategy must also consider the challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, potentially impacting the reported value of corporate holdings. Accounting and Tax: Navigating the accounting and tax implications of holding volatile digital assets can be complex. Security: Securely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols. Regulatory Uncertainty: While improving, the regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings can still present challenges in various jurisdictions. Méliuz, having already held Bitcoin, likely has some experience with these aspects, but scaling up their holdings will require even more rigorous management. Looking Ahead: Méliuz and the Future of Corporate Crypto Méliuz’s strategic decision to raise funds specifically for acquiring more Bitcoin is a powerful indicator of the growing institutional confidence in digital assets. It positions them among a growing list of public and private companies globally that are incorporating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. This development is particularly noteworthy for the Brazil ian market, potentially paving the way for further corporate adoption . As the line between traditional finance and digital assets continues to blur, companies like Méliuz are at the forefront, demonstrating how businesses can actively participate in the evolving financial ecosystem through strategic crypto investment . This move by Méliuz reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class, attracting serious capital from established businesses looking for long-term value and diversification in an unpredictable global economy.

Are you constantly on the lookout for the next big thing in the crypto space? Do you find yourself scouring various platforms hoping to discover promising early-stage crypto projects before they hit the mainstream? If so, you’re likely aware that spotting these gems early can be challenging, yet potentially rewarding. That’s where platforms designed specifically for discovery come into play. And the latest news from the Binance ecosystem is certainly buzzing with potential for those interested in new crypto projects . What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter? Before diving into the specifics of the recent announcement, let’s clarify what Binance Alpha actually is. Think of Binance Alpha as a dedicated showcase within the broader Binance Wallet ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to shine a light on innovative, early-stage cryptocurrency projects that are still developing and building their communities. It’s not the main Binance exchange where you trade established assets; rather, it’s a space for discovery and early engagement. This platform is significant because it leverages the massive reach and infrastructure of Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto platforms. By featuring projects on Alpha, Binance provides these nascent ventures with exposure to a vast audience of potential users, investors, and community members who are already active within the Binance Wallet environment. It’s a curated space, meaning projects aren’t just added randomly. They undergo a selection process. Why Roam Crypto ? Exploring the Selection Criteria The specific news generating interest is the addition of Roam (ROAM) to the Binance Alpha lineup. According to an official announcement shared via Binance’s X account, Roam crypto has been added to this early-stage showcase. But what makes a project like Roam crypto stand out enough to be featured on Alpha? While the exact internal criteria are proprietary, Binance has indicated that their selection process for Binance Alpha projects focuses heavily on two key areas: Community Engagement: Projects that demonstrate strong, active, and growing communities are often favored. A vibrant community signals genuine interest, potential network effects, and a solid foundation for future growth. Market Trends: Binance Alpha also looks at emerging market trends and innovative use cases. Projects that are building solutions relevant to current or future demands in the crypto landscape are more likely to be considered. The inclusion of Roam (ROAM) suggests that it has met these criteria, showcasing promising community activity and aligning with relevant market trends that Binance Alpha aims to highlight. Navigating Early-Stage Crypto Opportunities For users exploring Binance Wallet and the Alpha section, the addition of projects like Roam crypto presents an opportunity to get involved with potentially groundbreaking ventures from the ground up. Engaging with early-stage crypto can come with significant upsides if the project succeeds, but it’s crucial to understand the inherent risks involved. Projects featured on Binance Alpha are, by definition, early stage. This means they are still developing, may have smaller market caps, and could be more volatile than established cryptocurrencies. Due diligence is paramount. Users interested in exploring new crypto projects on Alpha should: Research the project’s whitepaper and technology. Evaluate the team behind the project. Understand the project’s tokenomics and use case. Assess the level and quality of community engagement. Binance Alpha serves as a discovery tool, but it doesn’t replace the need for individual research and risk assessment. The Role of Binance Wallet in Discovering New Crypto Projects It’s important to remember that Binance Alpha is integrated within the Binance Wallet . This integration makes it convenient for Binance users to discover and potentially interact with these new crypto projects without leaving the familiar Binance ecosystem. The wallet acts as the gateway to exploring these early opportunities, providing a potentially streamlined experience for users interested in diversifying their exposure beyond the main exchange listings. What’s Next for Roam (ROAM) and Other Alpha Projects? The big question often asked when a project appears on Binance Alpha is whether it will eventually be listed on the main Binance exchange. This is a critical point that Binance explicitly addresses: inclusion on Binance Alpha does NOT guarantee a future listing on the Binance exchange. Alpha is a platform for showcasing, not a pre-listing waiting room. While some projects that gain significant traction and meet Binance’s stringent listing requirements *might* eventually be listed on the main exchange, being on Alpha is not a direct path or promise of this. The journey from early-stage crypto on Alpha to a main exchange listing is long, uncertain, and depends on many factors, including continued development, community growth, regulatory compliance, and meeting Binance’s performance standards. Therefore, while the addition of Roam (ROAM) to Binance Alpha is certainly positive visibility for the project and an exciting discovery for users, it should not be interpreted as a signal of an imminent main exchange listing. It’s an opportunity to observe, engage, and learn about a promising new crypto project in its early phase. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Crypto The inclusion of Roam (ROAM) on Binance Alpha highlights Binance’s continued effort to support the broader crypto ecosystem by providing a platform for innovative, early-stage crypto projects to gain visibility. For users of Binance Wallet , Alpha serves as a curated window into the world of new crypto projects , selected based on factors like community engagement and market relevance. While this offers exciting potential for discovery, remember that being featured on Binance Alpha is distinct from a main exchange listing. It’s an invitation to explore the potential of Roam crypto and similar ventures at an early stage, requiring careful consideration and research before any engagement.

Donald Trump recently made a striking statement regarding the possibility of military action against Iran, suggesting it could actually benefit markets. This perspective, shared with the Wall Street Journal and reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, immediately sparked debate and analysis among investors and political observers alike. The core of his argument hinges on the idea that preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon would remove a significant long-term risk, thus creating a more stable environment for economic activity and investment. What Did Trump Say About Trump Iran Relations and Market Benefits? The specific comment from Donald Trump highlighted the controversial notion that military intervention against Iran, aimed at halting its nuclear ambitions, would be viewed positively by financial markets. According to reports, his reasoning was that the potential for a nuclear-armed Iran poses a greater, more destabilizing threat in the long run. By neutralizing this threat through military means, the argument goes, a major cloud of uncertainty would be lifted, allowing markets to react favorably. This viewpoint is significant because it directly links geopolitical strategy with economic outcomes in a way that is not always universally accepted. While preventing nuclear proliferation is a widely supported goal, the idea that military conflict—with all its inherent risks and humanitarian costs—could be a net positive for markets is highly contentious. It suggests a transactional view of international relations where security objectives are weighed against potential market reactions. Understanding the Potential Market Impact Iran Scenario Presents Analyzing the potential market impact Iran tensions and possible military action could have is complex. Financial markets inherently dislike uncertainty, and geopolitical risk is a major source of it. Historically, significant international conflicts or major escalations have often led to immediate market volatility, but the longer-term effects can vary widely depending on the nature, scale, and duration of the event, as well as the broader economic context. Here’s a breakdown of potential market reactions: Oil Prices: The Middle East is a critical region for global oil supply. Any conflict involving Iran, a major oil producer and situated near key shipping lanes like the Strait of Hormuz, would almost certainly lead to a sharp spike in oil prices due to supply disruption fears. This is typically negative for the global economy and stock markets, as higher energy costs impact businesses and consumers. Stock Markets: Initial reactions to military action are often negative, driven by fear and uncertainty. Defense stocks might see gains, but broader indices tend to fall as investors move to safer assets. The duration of any downturn would depend on the perceived scope and outcome of the conflict. Safe Havens: Assets traditionally seen as safe havens, such as gold, the U.S. dollar, and potentially certain government bonds, often see increased demand during periods of geopolitical stress. Cryptocurrencies: The reaction of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in such a scenario is less predictable. Some argue they could act as a digital safe haven outside traditional financial systems, while others believe they would fall along with other risk assets during a general market panic. Past events have shown mixed reactions. Trump’s argument implies that the negative reaction to the conflict itself would be outweighed by the positive reaction to the removal of the nuclear threat. This is a crucial point of contention. How Does Geopolitical Risk Influence Investment Decisions? Geopolitical risk is a constant factor that investors must consider. It refers to the risks associated with political events and decisions that could affect the stability of a country or region, potentially impacting economic and financial conditions globally. Events like wars, political instability, terrorism, and international disputes all fall under this umbrella. Investment managers and analysts constantly monitor geopolitical developments to assess their potential impact on portfolios. High geopolitical risk typically leads to: Increased market volatility. A flight to safety (moving investments into lower-risk assets). Reduced foreign direct investment in affected regions. Disruption of supply chains and trade routes. Changes in government spending priorities (e.g., increased defense spending). The potential for Iran Military Action is a prime example of a significant geopolitical risk event. Markets would attempt to price in the likelihood of such an event, its potential severity, and its possible outcomes. Trump’s statement can be seen as an attempt to frame one potential outcome (the removal of the nuclear threat) as the dominant factor for market reaction, downplaying the immediate disruptive impact of conflict. Exploring the Potential Economic Consequences Beyond Immediate Markets The economic consequences of military action extend far beyond the immediate fluctuations of stock and commodity markets. A conflict involving Iran could have wide-ranging effects on the global economy: Energy Costs: As mentioned, oil price spikes would increase costs for transportation, manufacturing, and consumers worldwide, potentially slowing economic growth and fueling inflation. Trade Disruption: Major shipping lanes could be affected, disrupting global supply chains and increasing shipping costs. Regional Instability: Conflict could spill over into neighboring countries, creating refugee crises, disrupting regional trade, and requiring international aid, all of which have economic costs. Government Budgets: Military action is expensive, potentially leading to increased government debt or cuts in other spending areas. Investor Confidence: Prolonged instability can erode investor confidence, leading to reduced investment and slower economic expansion. While preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons could arguably reduce a long-term existential risk, the short-to-medium term Economic Consequences of military intervention are almost universally viewed by economists as negative and disruptive. The destruction of infrastructure, loss of life, and regional instability associated with conflict have profound and lasting economic impacts that are difficult to quantify but undeniably significant. Historical Context: How Have Markets Reacted to Past Geopolitical Shocks? Looking at history provides some perspective, though every situation is unique. Markets have reacted differently to various geopolitical events: Event Date Initial Market Reaction (S&P 500) Medium-Term Reaction Key Economic Impact Invasion of Kuwait (Gulf War) Aug 1990 Significant decline Recovery once conflict outcome became clearer Oil price spike, brief recession in some areas 9/11 Terrorist Attacks Sep 2001 Markets closed for days, sharp decline upon reopening Recovery within weeks Increased security spending, disruption to travel/tourism Invasion of Iraq Mar 2003 Market rally (war had been anticipated) Continued rally Prolonged instability, impact on oil prices over time Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine Feb 2022 Initial decline, high volatility Markets fluctuated based on war developments, sanctions Major energy and commodity price shocks, supply chain issues, inflation surge As the table shows, there’s no single template. The invasion of Iraq in 2003, for instance, saw a market rally because the conflict’s commencement removed the uncertainty of *if* it would happen. However, the broader Economic Consequences and regional instability were significant and long-lasting. The key takeaway is that while markets might eventually recover or even rally after the initial shock or once an outcome is priced in, the underlying economic disruption caused by conflict is real and detrimental. Actionable Insights for Investors Amidst Geopolitical Uncertainty Given the ever-present potential for Geopolitical Risk and the specific concerns around Trump Iran dynamics and potential Iran Military Action, what should investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of geopolitical developments, but be wary of sensationalism. Understand the potential catalysts and consequences. Assess Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical events can cause significant volatility. Ensure your investment portfolio aligns with your comfort level for risk and your long-term financial goals. Diversification is Key: A well-diversified portfolio across different asset classes, geographies, and sectors can help mitigate the impact of localized or regional shocks. Consider Safe Havens (Cautiously): While gold or certain currencies can offer protection, their performance isn’t guaranteed, and timing entries/exits is difficult. Focus on the Long Term: Short-term geopolitical noise can be distracting. For long-term investors, staying focused on fundamental investment principles and goals is often the best strategy. Understand Specific Sector Impacts: Be aware that some sectors (like energy, defense, aerospace) are more directly affected by geopolitical events than others. Trump’s statement about the Market Impact Iran conflict could have is a reminder that political figures often frame complex situations in ways that support their objectives. Investors must look beyond simple pronouncements and conduct their own analysis of the multifaceted risks and potential outcomes. Conclusion: Navigating the Complex Interplay of Politics, Conflict, and Markets Donald Trump’s assertion that military action against Iran could be a market positive is a provocative statement that simplifies a highly complex reality. While preventing nuclear proliferation is a global priority that could, in theory, reduce a long-term risk, the immediate and medium-term Market Impact Iran conflict would create involves significant negative factors, including energy price shocks, trade disruption, and regional instability. The Economic Consequences of war are typically severe and widespread, impacting livelihoods and growth far beyond the trading floors. History shows varied market reactions to geopolitical events, demonstrating that context, anticipation, and the specific nature of the conflict matter. However, the human and economic cost of military action is undeniable. Navigating periods of heightened Geopolitical Risk requires investors to remain informed, diversified, and focused on their long-term strategy, rather than relying on simplistic predictions about market reactions to conflict.

But while Ethereum may be staging a strong comeback, a growing number of analysts are shifting their focus to what could be the best crypto to buy in 2025, a tiny, under-the-radar altcoin called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 11,900 investors. More than $10.45 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 100% profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. This DeFi token has been called the top crypto of the summer, with bullish predictions suggesting a staggering 8,000% return as early as Q3. For retail investors wondering what to buy before June ends, this could be the kind of once-in-a-cycle play that mirrors early successful rallies. Ethereum Holds Tight Near $2,680 as Summer Rally Builds Ethereum (ETH) is trading at approximately $2,676 after posting a modest intraday high of $2,720 and a low near $2,489. Over the past week, ETH has consolidated within a range of $2,400–$2,700, reflecting strengthened support zones and a narrowing volatility band that analysts view as a bullish signal. Recent inflows into spot ETH ETFs—surpassing $295 million in a single week highlight renewed institutional interest. These fundamentals place Ethereum firmly on traders’ radar, while fresh altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) begin to stir market excitement at much smaller price points. Mutuum Finance Presale Skyrockets: $10.45M Raised and 11,900 Investors Can’t Be Wrong Mutuum Finance is rapidly carving its place in the DeFi lending space, having already attracted over $10.45 million and built a thriving community of 11,900+ holders. Right now MUTM tokens are available at just $0.03 but in the next presale round prices will jump to $0.035 meaning anyone who buys now locks in an instant 16.67% profit. When Mutuum officially launches at $0.06 early investors could see a massive 100% gain. This is the kind of growth that DeFi investors dream about. The Power of Dual Lending: Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Models Changing the Game Mutuum Finance’s secret weapon is its hybrid lending system that blends: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Lock your USDT into smart-contract-driven liquidity pools and earn passive income, no hassle, all automated. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Cut out the middleman and lend or borrow directly, with full control and privacy over loan terms. This combination gives users unmatched flexibility, privacy, and competitive yields, putting Mutuum ahead of the pack. Built on Trust: Certik-Audited & Backed by a Stable USD-Pegged Coin Security is vital in crypto and Mutuum Finance delivers. Its open-source smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by Certik, one of the blockchain industry’s top security firms. On top of that, Mutuum is creating a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on Ethereum, designed to maintain long-term price stability and avoid the collapse risks that have tanked algorithmic stablecoins. Huge Rewards for Early Backers To reward its earliest supporters, the platform is hosting a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will each win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This is your chance to join a thriving community earn amazing rewards and ride the wave of what could be the next big DeFi success story. Ethereum may be eyeing a new ATH, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aiming for something far more explosive, analysts are forecasting up to 8,000% gains, and momentum is building fast. With over $10.45 million raised and 11,900+ early adopters, this under-$1 DeFi rocket is already rewriting the 2025 playbook. The next price jump is looming. The window to buy early is closing.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) shows signs of another rally, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is grappling with a price drop, making traders rethink their next move. But here’s where things get interesting: all eyes are now on Unstaked, a project that’s flipping the script. Unstaked is using AI to create real, on-chain utility that goes beyond hype. Imagine owning AI agents you can customize, run, and profit from. The potential? Huge. With over $9.7 million raised and more than a billion tokens sold, $UNSD is still in presale at just $0.011397. As the platform gears up to launch real tools and a deflationary token model, experts are eyeing a $5 target for $UNSD. That could mean a 3000x return, turning $100 into $300,000. Is this a hidden gem? You might be catching it at the perfect moment. How Unstaked’s AI is Changing the Game for Crypto Unstaked isn’t just launching another token; it’s crafting a game-changing product that’s built to last. At its core are AI agents that run autonomously on platforms like Telegram and X, handling everything from marketing to community growth around the clock and without human intervention. But these aren’t your typical bots. They’re powered by blockchain, customizable, and ready to use from day one. And here’s the kicker: they generate on-chain proof of work that drives token rewards. This isn’t just a presale token; it’s a new kind of utility in the crypto space. Every action, upgrade, and customization runs on $UNSD, ensuring the token remains in constant demand as the user base expands. With over $9.7 million raised and more than 1 billion tokens sold, the momentum is building fast. And with Stage 20 priced at just $0.011397, there’s massive room for growth. Forget the hype, this is utility-driven crypto at its best. Analysts are eyeing the potential: what happens when a functional AI product hits the market with a token still under two cents? With projections pushing $5 per token, a $100 investment today could explode into $300,000. For those seeking something more than the latest meme coin, Unstaked stands out as a real opportunity, backed by cutting-edge tech and an undeniable utility. If you’re looking for the next big thing in crypto, Unstaked could be it. Is Dogecoin on the Verge of a Major Rally? Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing strong bullish signals, with the price comfortably holding above the $0.17 breakout level. Analysts are now eyeing a double inverse head and shoulders pattern, which could signal a move toward $0.34, a 100% jump from here. The key test is the retest of $0.17. If DOGE bounces back cleanly, it could spark a rally, especially if meme coin interest picks up again. But that’s not all. Chart watchers are also spotting an ascending broadening wedge, which could send DOGE as high as $3.80 in the long run. With positive funding rates and long holders showing strong confidence, the bullish case for Dogecoin is becoming harder to ignore. The recent support zone is holding firm, adding to the momentum. For traders looking for a meme coin with solid structure and potential, DOGE is staying firmly on the radar. Whale Activity Sparks Hope for SHIB’s Reversal Shiba Inu (SHIB) has taken a hit, dropping over 7.5% in the last 24 hours, and now it’s testing key support at $0.00001240. If that level doesn’t hold, SHIB could slide another 18%, which has sent retail traders scrambling. Short positions are stacking up, with nearly $942K in short liquidations sitting near $0.00001306, adding to the downside pressure. However, while smaller investors are heading for the exits, whales are making their move. On-chain data reveals a big surge in SHIB transactions, with large transactions in the $100K–$1M range up by 175.86%. This suggests the bigger players are seeing this dip as a buying opportunity. Retail may be panicking, but the whales are positioning for a potential reversal. If SHIB can hold that $0.00001240 support, the rebound could be just as strong as the drop. The Bottom Line Dogecoin (DOGE) has been holding strong after breaking past $0.17, with charts suggesting a move towards $0.34. Shiba Inu (SHIB), on the other hand, has faced a price dip that’s rattled retail traders, though whale buying signals suggest a potential rebound if support holds. While both coins are catching attention, it’s Unstaked that’s creating a real buzz. With over $9.7 million raised and 1 billion tokens sold, $UNSD is picking up speed. Priced at just $0.011397 in Stage 20, it’s a steal with massive upside potential. The real draw? AI agents that users can own, deploy, and profit from, all supported by on-chain proof. If Unstaked delivers on its promise, it could be more than just another presale; it might be the best crypto to invest in right now. If $UNSD hits its projected $5, that $100 buy-in could grow into $300,000.

This marks a 1.8% dip over the past day and places the asset approximately 6% below its all-time high of over $111,000 reached last month. While the correction is not severe compared to historical volatility, it highlights ongoing uncertainty in the market as BTC consolidates near record highs without sustained upward momentum. One metric drawing attention amid this price movement is the Puell Multiple, a tool used to evaluate whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued relative to miner income. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Most Reliable Signal Just Flashed—Next Stop: $170,000 Bitcoin Puell Multiple Suggests Miner Revenues Have Yet to Catch Up CryptoQuant analyst Gaah highlighted that while prices recently surged above $108,000, the Puell Multiple remains below 1.40, a level typically associated with discounted or non-euphoric market phases. This decoupling between BTC price and miner revenue offers insight into how recent gains may be more demand-driven than organically supported by on-chain mining fundamentals. The Puell Multiple measures the daily issuance of BTC in USD terms relative to its 365-day moving average. Historically, readings below 1.0 are seen during market bottoms or accumulation phases, indicating undervaluation. Gaah points out that current readings hovering around 1.40 suggest miner profitability is still lagging, even as the asset trades near historic highs. This pattern contrasts with previous bull cycles where high prices were often accompanied by elevated miner earnings, driven by both network activity and block rewards. This disparity may be due in part to the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. While halving events typically drive price appreciation through reduced supply, they simultaneously put downward pressure on miner revenue. In this case, despite a climb in market price, the halving’s impact continues to suppress income for miners, implying that the price increase has not yet been accompanied by the kind of broader economic expansion that would traditionally drive a full-fledged bull market. Potential for Continued Growth as Institutional Forces Drive Demand Gaah also points to the possibility that external factors may be playing a more dominant role in driving recent price action. These include increasing institutional inflows through spot Bitcoin ETFs, as well as a tighter circulating supply as long-term holders reduce active selling. These forces could be supporting price without necessarily boosting miner profitability in the short term, especially if the uptick is concentrated in secondary market demand rather than new BTC issuance. The current environment may signal a unique window for participants analyzing Bitcoin’s valuation. A high market price combined with conservative fundamentals suggests the market is not yet in a speculative excess phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? If miner revenues eventually rise in line with growing demand, driven by either increased transaction fees or broader network usage, it could support further upside. As such, both technical and fundamental indicators may continue to evolve in the coming months, offering a clearer view of whether the current cycle has more room to run.

Visibility alone is no longer enough. Today’s top picks must deliver real-world value, clear roadmaps, and sustainable models to earn trust and attention. While new tokens continue to launch, only a few stand out as truly promising. These are the names gaining traction not through hype, but through measurable growth and active user engagement. The four projects highlighted here represent the most popular altcoins of 2025. Each offers a unique edge, but BlockDAG (BDAG) currently leads with its structured model and massive presale success. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Step-by-Step Growth with Presale Precision BlockDAG is emerging as one of the most popular altcoins of 2025, thanks to its unique approach to pricing and project development. Instead of following hype-driven patterns, BlockDAG has built a structured presale system that increases coin value across 45 predefined batches. This step-by-step method allows users to track progress while rewarding early participation with better entry prices. Currently in Batch 29, BDAG is priced at $0.0276, with more than 22.4 billion coins sold and nearly $300 million raised. These figures reflect not just strong demand but also the success of a system built around transparency and controlled growth. Each new batch signals fresh milestones, making the entire process more predictable and grounded in real traction. This batch-based model also reduces post-launch price instability by aligning token distribution with measurable market activity. BlockDAG’s focus on sustainable growth and user clarity is making it a standout option among altcoins, with strong appeal for those seeking long-term structure and value. 2. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise Powerhouse with Real-World Impact Hedera continues to rise in relevance as one of the most popular altcoins, driven by its hashgraph consensus model that supports fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. This unique structure sets it apart from traditional blockchain platforms and appeals to businesses looking for scalable and efficient systems. Its speed and energy efficiency give it an edge in enterprise use cases. HBAR powers applications in decentralized identity, payments, and supply chain solutions, creating tangible value for global users. Hedera’s governance model includes blue-chip corporations such as Google and IBM, ensuring stability and long-term strategy. With institutional support and enterprise-grade features, HBAR is gaining steady momentum across both retail and corporate markets. 3. VeChain (VET): Supply Chain Efficiency Meets Blockchain Utility VeChain has carved a strong niche for itself among the most popular altcoins by focusing on real-world supply chain management. Its blockchain enables businesses to verify and trace products at every stage, ensuring transparency and accountability in industries like food safety, healthcare, and luxury goods. VET plays a crucial role in running this ecosystem, while VTHO handles transaction fees. This dual-token structure keeps costs low and performance high. Enterprises can also build custom applications using VeChain’s tools, expanding its utility beyond logistics. With consistent updates and real-world partnerships, VeChain continues to prove that business-focused blockchain solutions can thrive. 4. Stellar (XLM): Bridging Currencies and Expanding Inclusion Stellar remains a strong contender among the most popular altcoins thanks to its mission of financial access and cross-border transaction efficiency. Its protocol enables fast and low-cost exchanges between fiat currencies, making it ideal for remittance services and global payment networks. XLM acts as the connecting layer between currencies, streamlining transfers across borders without reliance on expensive intermediaries. Stellar’s technology supports smart contracts and custom tokens, adding versatility to its core offerings. With ongoing partnerships involving banks, fintech firms, and even government initiatives, Stellar continues to build a reputation for practical utility and global reach. Key Insights As the crypto market matures, becoming one of the most popular altcoins now depends on more than hype. Projects must deliver real value, strong infrastructure, and user-focused design. BlockDAG meets this demand with its clear pricing strategy and record-setting presale, offering a rare mix of structure and momentum. Alongside it, HBAR, VET, and XLM continue to prove their relevance through practical use cases that solve real-world problems. From fast financial networks to supply chain transparency and global payments, these projects highlight the evolving criteria for success. In 2025, popularity comes from performance, and these altcoins are delivering.

Investment management giants Invesco and Galaxy Digital have taken a significant step towards potentially bringing a Solana ETF to the market. According to a recent report shared by @solidintel_x on X, these firms have officially registered a specific entity for a Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund within the state of Delaware. This development, while an early procedural step, is generating considerable buzz and speculation about the future of SOL ETF products in the United States. What Does This Invesco Galaxy Delaware Registration Signify? The registration of an entity in Delaware by Invesco Galaxy specifically for a Solana ETF is a standard, yet crucial, part of the process for launching investment products in the U.S. Delaware is a popular state for corporate registration due to its well-established corporate law and court system. This move doesn’t mean the ETF is approved or even formally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yet, but it indicates that Invesco and Galaxy are actively exploring and preparing for the possibility of launching a Solana-focused investment vehicle. Think of it like setting up the legal foundation before building the actual structure. Registering the entity provides the necessary legal framework under which a future ETF could operate. It signals serious intent from major players in both traditional finance (Invesco) and the crypto asset management space (Galaxy Digital). Why is a Solana ETF Important for SOL? The potential introduction of a Solana ETF is highly anticipated by the crypto community for several reasons. An ETF provides investors with exposure to the price movements of an underlying asset without requiring them to directly buy, store, or manage the asset itself. For Solana (SOL), an ETF could: Increase Accessibility: Make investing in SOL easier for traditional investors, financial advisors, and institutions who may be hesitant to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges or self-custody. Boost Liquidity: Potentially bring significant capital into the Solana ecosystem, increasing trading volume and market depth. Enhance Legitimacy: An SEC-approved ETF would lend further credibility to Solana as an asset class in the eyes of mainstream finance. Drive Demand: As seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the launch of such a product can lead to increased demand from a broader investor base. This Delaware registration by Invesco Galaxy is a tangible sign that major financial firms see potential in bringing such a product to market, reflecting growing institutional interest in assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Comparing the Solana ETF Path to Bitcoin and Ethereum The journey towards a Solana ETF is likely to follow a similar, albeit potentially faster, path to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Bitcoin spot ETFs were approved in the U.S. in January 2024 after years of applications and rejections. Ethereum spot ETFs received crucial initial approval in May 2024, with trading expected to begin later. These approvals have set precedents and potentially cleared some regulatory hurdles for subsequent Crypto ETF applications for other digital assets like Solana. However, regulators will still scrutinize any Solana application based on factors like market size, liquidity, potential for manipulation, and the underlying technology. While the path might be clearer, approval is far from guaranteed. What Are the Potential Hurdles and What Comes Next? While the Invesco Galaxy Delaware registration is positive news, several significant steps remain before a Solana ETF could potentially trade on a U.S. exchange: Formal SEC Filing: Invesco and Galaxy would need to file official applications (like a 19b-4 rule change proposal and an S-1 registration statement) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulatory Review and Approval: The SEC would then undergo a review process, which can take several months and involve public comment periods. Approval is not guaranteed and depends on the SEC’s assessment of market readiness and regulatory compliance. Market Conditions: Favorable market conditions and continued regulatory clarity would be beneficial for the approval process. Investors interested in a potential SOL ETF should closely monitor official filings with the SEC and regulatory announcements rather than solely relying on early-stage registrations like the one in Delaware. Actionable Insight: Staying Informed on the Potential SOL ETF For those tracking the development of a potential Solana ETF , the key action is to stay informed through official channels. Follow news regarding Invesco and Galaxy’s formal filings with the SEC. Understand that the Delaware registration is a preliminary step. While it signals intent, it doesn’t guarantee a product launch or regulatory approval. Diversifying information sources and understanding the regulatory process is crucial when evaluating the potential impact of such developments on the Solana market. Summary: A Promising Step for Solana’s Institutional Future The Delaware registration of a Solana ETF entity by Invesco Galaxy is undoubtedly a promising development for the Solana ecosystem. It underscores growing institutional confidence in SOL as an asset class and represents an initial, foundational step towards potentially offering a regulated investment product to a broader market. While significant regulatory hurdles remain, this move signals serious intent from major financial players and adds to the narrative of Solana’s increasing integration into traditional finance. The journey towards a U.S. SOL ETF is still ongoing, but this registration marks a notable milestone on that path, igniting hope for increased accessibility and adoption.

Dogecoin (DOGE) has shown strong technical signs, and ONDO’s rebound highlights growing demand for real-world asset-backed crypto. Yet, while both offer promising price action, Web3 ai is making progress on a different front. The project is drawing eyes thanks to its $0.000422 price, strong utility, and transparent AI-driven platform that has already crossed $7.8 million in raised funds. Web3 ai, now in Stage 08 of its presale, is proving it’s not just another trending coin. Its main feature is the ICO & Token Sale Advisor, a tool created to help users review early-stage crypto opportunities. While coins like DOGE and ONDO benefit from market speculation, Web3 ai offers a structured approach to evaluating new crypto launches. Dogecoin: Technical Chart Suggests Further Breakout Dogecoin (DOGE) has spiked by 25%, and analysts are tracking an uncommon triple bottom setup combined with bullish RSI divergence. CoinCentral noted that if DOGE breaks through current resistance, it could reach $0.25 soon and possibly $0.40 later on. These levels line up with predictions from earlier meme coin trends. This current Dogecoin chart pattern isn’t just a random setup. Similar formations in past cycles led to massive price runs. Traders are seeing renewed energy around DOGE, helped by stronger community backing and social media activity. However, the coin’s price remains reactive to outside forces like public figures or sudden market shifts. Still, from a technical angle, the breakout is valid. With MACD turning bullish and rising volume, DOGE could see more upside ahead. It’s shaping up to be a solid short-term contender among bullish crypto plays. ONDO: Strong Recovery Aims for $3 Mark ONDO has bounced back 55% from recent lows, showing strength in the tokenized asset space. TronWeekly reports that ONDO broke through its consolidation phase as buying pressure increased, pushing it into a breakout. This rally is being fueled by higher demand for digital treasury products. ONDO has now flipped the $0.90 resistance into support, clearing the way for possible targets of $1.80 and $3 if momentum holds. Analysts are also watching institutional interest rise, which could lead to long-term support. However, rapid price increases can invite corrections. And because ONDO works in the real-world asset sector, there’s always a risk from future regulatory changes. Still, in the current rotation, ONDO stands out as one of the most solid mid-cap DeFi options with bullish potential. Web3 ai: $7.8M Raised and 21B Coins Sold in Stage 8 Unlike the flashy gains seen with DOGE and ONDO, Web3 ai offers consistent progress through real-world features. The project has raised more than $7.8 million so far and sold over 21 billion coins in its presale. Now priced at $0.000422 in Stage 08, Web3 ai brings substance to the AI crypto space. At the heart of the platform is the ICO & Token Sale Advisor. This AI-backed engine reviews and ranks early crypto launches. Instead of listing ICOs by date, it assesses vesting terms, token supply, and other critical factors to highlight trustworthy projects. It spots red flags like unfair token allocations and risky unlock periods. The tool also checks GitHub codebases and team backgrounds. It monitors project milestones and checks user discussions across Telegram, X, Reddit, and other social platforms. Users can compare ICOs by development activity, sector, and security level through customizable filters. This AI tool gives users a better way to spot serious crypto projects, avoiding low-effort launches. Since access to this platform is tied to the $WAI coin, its value is directly connected to ongoing usage. With its $0.000422 price and AI tools already live, Web3 ai looks like a smart early entry for those focused on real crypto solutions. Which Crypto Path Makes the Most Sense? Dogecoin has made a 25% jump on a rare chart setup. ONDO has climbed 55%, fueled by strong interest in tokenized assets. Both show short-term strength. But for a deeper, more practical offering, Web3 ai leads the way with tools designed to reshape how people explore crypto projects. With over $7.8 million raised, 21 billion coins sold, and a price of $0.000422, Web3 ai is building more than hype. Its platform offers a structured way to assess crypto launches, which sets it apart as a long-term play worth noting.

If so, you’ve likely heard the buzz surrounding the potential for a significant shift in how investors access digital assets. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have grabbed headlines, the real excitement brewing right now is centered around the possibility of a broader wave of Altcoin ETF approvals. Altcoin ETF Filings See an Unprecedented Surge in 2025 Imagine this: a flood of new investment products hitting the market, making it easier than ever for mainstream investors to gain exposure to a diverse range of digital currencies beyond the top two. That’s precisely the scenario unfolding as we head further into 2025. According to recent data from Cointelegraph Research, there has been an impressive surge in applications submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Specifically, reports indicate that at least 31 separate applications for various Altcoin ETF products have been filed so far this year. This number is substantial and signals a clear intent from financial firms to bring these investment vehicles to market. This isn’t just a trickle; it’s a significant flow of formal proposals landing on the SEC’s desk. What’s Driving This Wave of SEC Filings? So, why the sudden rush now? The primary catalyst appears to be a renewed sense of optimism regarding the regulatory landscape in the United States. The sentiment around cryptocurrency regulation, particularly concerning investment products, seems to be shifting. A key factor cited is the environment under current U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins. There’s a growing perception that the regulatory body might be adopting a more pragmatic or at least clearer approach to digital assets compared to previous periods. This perceived shift is empowering financial institutions to confidently pursue these new product offerings. Filing an ETF application is a costly and time-consuming process, so firms wouldn’t undertake this unless they saw a realistic path towards approval. The volume of these SEC Filings suggests that confidence is indeed high. Major Players Entering the Crypto ETF Space It’s not just the quantity of filings that’s noteworthy; it’s also the quality and reputation of the firms involved. Established financial giants are stepping into the ring, targeting specific altcoins. Companies like VanEck and Franklin Templeton, names familiar to traditional investors, are among those who have reportedly filed applications. These firms aren’t just filing generic applications; they are targeting specific, prominent altcoins. Assets mentioned in these filings reportedly include major players like BNB, XRP, and Solana. The fact that large, reputable asset managers are seeking to create dedicated Crypto ETF products for these specific assets highlights their growing legitimacy and perceived investment potential within the broader financial world. This move could significantly broaden the investor base for these particular cryptocurrencies. Could This Spark an ‘Altcoin Summer’? The big question on everyone’s mind in the crypto community is: What does this mean for market prices? The surge in filings, combined with the optimistic regulatory outlook, is fueling significant hope for what many are calling an ‘ Altcoin Summer ‘. Historically, an ‘Altcoin Summer’ refers to a period where altcoins, in general, experience significant price rallies, often outperforming Bitcoin. This can be driven by various factors, including market sentiment, technological developments, or increased liquidity and adoption. Analysts are bullish on the potential for approvals. Estimates suggest that out of the numerous filings, over 10 approvals are considered likely in the near future. If even a handful of these dedicated altcoin ETFs get the green light, it could unlock significant capital from traditional investment channels, pushing demand and potentially prices higher across a wide range of altcoins. The anticipation alone is contributing to positive sentiment in the market, laying the groundwork for that potential ‘ Altcoin Summer ‘ rally. Understanding the Implications for Cryptocurrency Investment For both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers, the prospect of Altcoin ETFs has several key implications for their Cryptocurrency Investment strategies. Here’s a quick look at some potential benefits and challenges: Potential Benefits: Increased Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making it much easier for retail and institutional investors to gain exposure without dealing directly with crypto exchanges, wallets, or private keys. Greater Legitimacy: ETF approvals from a major regulator like the SEC lend significant credibility to the underlying assets and the crypto market as a whole, potentially attracting more conservative investors. Enhanced Liquidity: Increased institutional participation via ETFs could bring substantial liquidity into the altcoin market. Diversification Options: Depending on the ETF structure (single-asset, basket), investors could easily diversify their exposure across different altcoins. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: While optimism is high, regulatory hurdles could still cause delays or rejections for some applications. Market Volatility: ETFs provide exposure but do not eliminate the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies. Tracking Error: ETFs aim to track the price of the underlying asset, but fees and operational factors can lead to slight differences (tracking error). Concentration Risk: Single-asset ETFs mean your investment is tied solely to the performance of that one altcoin. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on SEC announcements regarding these filings. Research Specific Assets: If you’re interested in exposure via potential ETFs, research the specific altcoins being targeted (BNB, XRP, Solana, etc.) and understand their fundamentals and risks. Evaluate ETF Structures: Once approved, understand how each specific ETF is structured (e.g., spot price tracking vs. futures, single asset vs. basket). Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Even through an ETF wrapper, altcoins are high-risk investments. Looking Ahead: The Road to an Altcoin Summer The sheer volume of Altcoin ETF filings in 2025 is a clear indicator of where the financial industry sees future growth in the digital asset space. Driven by a more favorable regulatory climate and increasing institutional confidence, the path is being paved for potentially groundbreaking new investment products. While approvals are not guaranteed, the high number of applications and analyst predictions paint a promising picture for the accessibility and potential performance of altcoins. Whether it fully blossoms into a widespread ‘ Altcoin Summer ‘ remains to be seen, but the foundational steps are certainly being taken, making this a fascinating time for anyone involved in Cryptocurrency Investment .

This case highlights ongoing efforts to police market manipulation within the cryptocurrency sector and underscores the growing reach of crypto regulation . What Exactly is Crypto Wash Trading? Before diving into the specifics of the Gotbit case, it’s crucial to understand what crypto wash trading entails. At its core, wash trading is a form of market manipulation where an investor simultaneously buys and sells the same asset to create a misleading impression of market activity. It’s like a person selling an item to themselves repeatedly to make it look popular. How it Works: A trader places both a buy and a sell order for the same asset at roughly the same price. These orders execute against each other. The Goal: The primary objective is not to profit from price movements, but to inflate trading volume artificially. Why Do It? Inflated volume can make an asset appear more liquid and popular than it is, potentially attracting legitimate traders or meeting exchange listing requirements. Legality: Wash trading is illegal in traditional financial markets and is increasingly being targeted by authorities in the crypto space as a form of market manipulation that undermines fair markets. What Happened to the Gotbit Founder and the Firm? The focus of this recent enforcement action is Aleksei Andriunin, the Gotbit founder . According to reports from The Block, Andriunin received an eight-month prison sentence. This sentence stems from his involvement in conducting multi-million-dollar crypto wash trades . The market-making firm itself, Gotbit, also faced severe consequences. The company was reportedly given five years of probation. More significantly, as part of the judgment, Gotbit is required to cease its operations. This effectively shuts down the firm’s activities in the market. Market makers like Gotbit typically play a vital role in providing liquidity to trading pairs. However, when these services are used for illicit activities like inflating trading volumes through wash trading, it distorts market signals and harms genuine participants. How Does Market Manipulation Harm the Crypto Ecosystem? Cases involving practices like crypto wash trading are detrimental to the overall health and reputation of the digital asset space. Market manipulation creates an unfair trading environment. Here’s how: Distorted Prices: Artificial volume can give a false sense of demand, potentially leading to unstable or manipulated prices. Misleading Investors: Traders relying on volume indicators might be tricked into thinking an asset is more actively traded or desirable than it truly is. Reduced Trust: Incidents of manipulation erode confidence among both retail and institutional investors, making them hesitant to participate in the market. Unfair Advantage: Those engaging in wash trading gain an unfair advantage over legitimate traders who are playing by the rules. Ensuring crypto market integrity is paramount for the long-term growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Enforcement actions like the one against the Gotbit founder send a clear message that such behavior will not be tolerated. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Integrity? The sentencing of the Gotbit founder and the shutdown of the firm are strong indicators of a push towards greater accountability and transparency in the digital asset markets. Protecting crypto market integrity is a stated goal of regulators worldwide. This case serves as a practical example of authorities taking action against firms and individuals who engage in deceptive practices. For the market to mature and attract broader participation, participants need confidence that they are trading on a level playing field, free from artificial manipulation. Steps taken to curb crypto wash trading and other forms of deceit are crucial for building this trust. Is Increased Crypto Regulation Inevitable? This case fits into a broader global trend of increasing scrutiny and the development of formal crypto regulation frameworks. As the digital asset market grows, regulators are becoming more active in applying existing laws or creating new ones to address unique aspects of crypto. Enforcement actions often precede or coincide with new regulatory guidance. The focus areas typically include investor protection, market stability, and preventing illicit finance activities, including various forms of market manipulation . While the pace and nature of crypto regulation vary by jurisdiction, the direction appears clear: a move towards more oversight and established rules for market participants, including exchanges, platforms, and market makers. Lessons Learned and Actionable Insights The Gotbit case offers important lessons for everyone involved in the crypto space: Due Diligence: Investors should look beyond just reported volume when evaluating assets. Consider the reputation of the exchange and the market makers involved. Regulatory Risk: Firms operating in the crypto space must understand and comply with evolving crypto regulation to avoid legal repercussions. Market Integrity Matters: Supporting platforms and practices that promote genuine trading activity is vital for the ecosystem’s health. This incident serves as a reminder that while the crypto market is innovative, it is not immune to old forms of financial crime like market manipulation , and regulators are watching. Conclusion The sentencing of the Gotbit founder for multi-million-dollar crypto wash trading and the subsequent forced cessation of Gotbit’s operations mark a significant moment in the ongoing effort to enforce crypto regulation and protect crypto market integrity . It underscores the risks associated with market manipulation in the digital asset space and signals a continued push by authorities to ensure fair and transparent markets. As the regulatory landscape evolves, participants must remain vigilant and committed to ethical practices to foster a healthy and trustworthy ecosystem.

For those following the cryptocurrency space, understanding shifts in foundational tech like semiconductors and AI is crucial, as they underpin many advancements and market dynamics. Recently, Nvidia , a giant in the chip industry, made a significant announcement impacting its financial outlook regarding the China market. Why is Nvidia Excluding China? Nvidia has decided it will no longer include the Chinese market in its official revenue forecast and profit projections. This isn’t a sudden decision but a direct consequence of ongoing geopolitical tensions and, more specifically, U.S. chip export restrictions aimed at limiting China’s access to advanced semiconductor technology. CEO Jensen Huang stated that the company doesn’t anticipate these restrictions being lifted or significantly altered in the near future, even under a potential change in U.S. administration. Understanding the Impact of Chip Export Restrictions The U.S. government has implemented licensing requirements that severely limit the type and performance of chips that American companies, including Nvidia, can sell to China. These restrictions are primarily targeted at preventing China from acquiring cutting-edge AI chips that could be used for military modernization or other strategic purposes. For Nvidia, this means even its specially designed H20 chip, intended to comply with previous regulations for the Chinese market, now faces licensing hurdles. The implications are substantial: Reduced Market Access: China is a massive market for technology components, especially advanced chips needed for AI development. Financial Hit: Nvidia has already acknowledged a significant financial impact. In its first-quarter results, the company estimated that these restrictions would lead to an approximate $8 billion reduction in its second-quarter revenue. Strategic Shift: By excluding China from forecasts, Nvidia signals that it views this market segment as highly uncertain and outside its predictable revenue streams for the foreseeable future. Focus on AI Chips and Global Markets While the restrictions specifically target advanced AI chips , they affect Nvidia’s overall strategy and global sales mix. The company is a leading provider of GPUs essential for AI training and inference, making it particularly vulnerable to regulations aimed at controlling AI technology proliferation. The decision to exclude China from the revenue forecast underscores the strategic challenges major tech companies face when navigating complex international trade policies and national security concerns. What Does This Mean for Nvidia’s Revenue Forecast? Removing a major market like China from forecasts introduces both challenges and a degree of clarity. It presents a challenge in finding alternative markets or revenue streams to compensate for the loss. However, it also provides clearer guidance to investors about the expected performance based on markets where sales are less subject to sudden regulatory changes. Jensen Huang reportedly referred to any potential reversal of restrictions as a ‘bonus,’ highlighting the company’s current stance of not relying on sales to China for core projections. Conclusion: Navigating Geopolitical Headwinds Nvidia’s move to exclude China from its revenue forecast is a clear indicator of the deep impact U.S. chip export restrictions are having on the global semiconductor industry. It highlights the strategic importance of AI chips and the challenges companies like Nvidia face in a fractured geopolitical landscape. This decision provides a more realistic, albeit potentially lower, baseline for the company’s financial expectations, reflecting the current reality of limited access to a key market.

News regarding a potential US Iran meeting has recently surfaced, carrying significant implications for global stability and potentially, for investor sentiment in volatile markets like crypto. Trump Iran Meeting: A Cloud of Uncertainty According to a report shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, former U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that a meeting between the U.S. and Iran was still on the schedule for an upcoming Sunday. However, the crucial detail that grabbed attention was his expressed uncertainty about whether this meeting would actually take place. This simple statement injects a notable degree of doubt into a potentially high-stakes diplomatic engagement. Why is a meeting between the U.S. and Iran significant? The relationship between the two nations has been fraught with tension for decades, marked by periods of intense hostility, sanctions, and proxy conflicts in the Middle East. Any direct talks, especially at a high level, could signal a potential shift in dynamics, for better or worse. The uncertainty surrounding the meeting’s occurrence adds another layer of complexity to an already delicate geopolitical landscape. Understanding Geopolitical Uncertainty Geopolitical uncertainty refers to the unpredictability of political events and their potential impact on international relations and global stability. This uncertainty can stem from various sources, including: Changes in leadership or government policy International disputes and conflicts Economic instability in key regions Unexpected diplomatic developments (like the potential cancellation of a planned meeting) When significant geopolitical events or potential events are uncertain, it creates a climate of risk aversion among investors. They become hesitant to commit capital, and existing investments can become more volatile as market participants react to news and speculation. How Geopolitical Events Fuel Market Volatility Market volatility is a measure of how much the price of an asset fluctuates over time. Geopolitical events are well-known catalysts for increased volatility across various asset classes. Here’s how it often plays out: When news like the uncertainty surrounding the Trump Iran meeting breaks, traders and investors attempt to assess the potential outcomes and their consequences. Will the meeting happen? If so, what will be discussed? Will it lead to de-escalation or increased tension? The lack of clear answers leads to speculation, which can cause rapid price swings. For instance: Safe Havens: Assets traditionally considered safe havens, like gold or certain government bonds, might see increased demand, driving up their prices. Risk Assets: Assets perceived as riskier, such as stocks or commodities tied to the affected regions (like oil), might experience sell-offs, leading to price declines. Currency Markets: Exchange rates can fluctuate significantly as capital flows react to perceived risks in different economies. The uncertainty itself, regardless of the eventual outcome, is often enough to trigger a knee-jerk reaction in the markets as participants price in potential worst-case scenarios. Exploring the Crypto Market Impact The Crypto market impact from geopolitical uncertainty is a topic of ongoing debate. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes touted as digital gold or a hedge against traditional financial system instability and geopolitical risks. The argument is that they are decentralized and not tied to any single nation-state’s policies or stability. However, the crypto market has also shown a strong correlation with traditional risk assets, particularly technology stocks. During periods of broad market fear or sell-offs, cryptocurrencies often decline alongside stocks, behaving more like a risk asset than a safe haven. So, how might the uncertainty around the US Iran meeting affect the crypto market? Several scenarios are possible: Increased Volatility: The most likely immediate impact is increased price swings in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as traders react to global sentiment. Safe Haven Narrative Test: If traditional markets react negatively, it could test the safe haven narrative for Bitcoin. Will investors flock to it, or will they sell off crypto alongside other risk assets? Regional Impact: Uncertainty in the Middle East can affect energy prices, which in turn can have broader economic impacts that ripple into all markets, including crypto. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased global instability could potentially lead to renewed calls for stricter regulation of cryptocurrencies, which some see as a potential tool for circumventing sanctions or capital controls. Investors in the crypto space need to be particularly aware of these macro-geopolitical factors, as they can significantly influence market sentiment and price action, sometimes overshadowing crypto-specific news. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Navigating markets during times of geopolitical uncertainty requires careful consideration. Here are a few actionable insights for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep track of major global news events, especially those involving key players like the U.S. and Iran. Understand the potential implications beyond just the headline. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Periods of high volatility can be stressful. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for risk. Consider Diversification: While crypto can be part of a diversified portfolio, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes can help mitigate risk during uncertain times. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, short-term geopolitical volatility might present buying opportunities, but this requires conviction and the ability to stomach potential further price drops. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Market reactions to geopolitical news can be swift and emotional. Try to stick to a pre-defined strategy rather than making impulsive trades based on fear or hype. The uncertainty surrounding the US Iran meeting serves as a reminder that the crypto market does not exist in a vacuum. It is increasingly intertwined with global economic and political forces. Summary: Navigating the Ripples of Uncertainty President Trump’s statement regarding the potential US Iran meeting has introduced a new element of geopolitical uncertainty into the global landscape. This uncertainty is a known driver of increased market volatility across traditional financial markets and has a tangible potential for significant Crypto market impact . While some view crypto as a hedge against such instability, its behavior often mirrors that of other risk assets during sell-offs. Investors should remain vigilant, stay informed about global events, and approach the market with a clear strategy to navigate the potential turbulence that geopolitical developments can create.

Officials within the Indian government have confirmed that the tax department has launched investigations into cases of cryptocurrency-related tax evasion. This development underscores the increasing scrutiny on digital assets and highlights the importance of understanding and complying with India crypto tax regulations. What Triggered the Investigation into Crypto Tax Evasion India ? The move by the Indian tax authorities isn’t entirely unexpected. With the significant growth in cryptocurrency adoption and trading activity across the country over the past few years, the volume of transactions involving digital assets has skyrocketed. While many participants in the crypto market are compliant taxpayers, the potential for large, untracked gains has naturally drawn the attention of tax authorities looking to ensure everyone pays their fair share. Several factors likely contributed to the timing of this investigation: Increased Adoption: A larger user base means a wider pool of potential taxpayers and transactions. Regulatory Clarity (Partial): While a comprehensive regulatory framework is still evolving, the Finance Act 2022 brought significant clarity on how cryptocurrency income is taxed, making it easier for authorities to identify non-compliance. Data Availability: Exchanges operating in India and globally are increasingly subject to reporting requirements, providing tax departments with data points to cross-reference with filed tax returns. Global Trend: Tax authorities worldwide are ramping up efforts to tackle crypto tax evasion, and India is aligning with this global push. This investigation signals a serious intent from the government to enforce the existing tax laws pertaining to digital assets. Understanding Cryptocurrency Tax India : The Current Landscape Before diving deeper into the investigation, it’s crucial to understand the existing tax rules for cryptocurrencies in India. The framework, introduced in 2022, treats income from the transfer of Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs), which includes cryptocurrencies, in a specific manner. Here are the key aspects: Flat 30% Tax on Gains: Any income from the transfer (sale, exchange, etc.) of VDAs is taxed at a flat rate of 30%. This is applicable regardless of your income tax slab. No Set-off of Losses: A significant point is that losses from the transfer of one VDA cannot be set off against income from the transfer of another VDA. For example, a loss on Bitcoin cannot be adjusted against a gain on Ethereum. Furthermore, losses from VDA transfers cannot be set off against income from any other source (like salary, business, etc.). No Deduction for Acquisition Cost (with exceptions): The only deduction allowed when calculating the gain is the cost of acquisition. No other expenses related to the transfer (like mining costs, exchange fees, etc.) are deductible. 1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source): A 1% TDS is applicable on the transfer of VDAs above a certain threshold (Rs 10,000 in a financial year, or Rs 50,000 for specified persons like individuals/HUFs with significant income). This TDS is not the final tax but acts as a mechanism for the government to track transactions and collect tax upfront. The final tax liability is calculated during tax filing. Tax on Gifts: If you receive cryptocurrency as a gift, it is taxable in the hands of the recipient if the aggregate value of VDA gifts received during the financial year exceeds Rs 50,000. This is taxed under the head ‘Income from Other Sources’ at the recipient’s applicable income tax slab rate. This structure makes it relatively straightforward, yet potentially high-tax, for those profiting from crypto trading or investments. Who Might the Indian Tax Department Crypto Investigation Target? While the tax department hasn’t released specific criteria for their investigations, it’s reasonable to assume they would focus on individuals and entities exhibiting certain patterns: High-Volume Traders: Individuals or entities involved in frequent, large-value transactions on domestic or international exchanges. Data from exchanges, both within India (due to TDS) and potentially from international cooperation agreements, could highlight such activity. Non-Filers or Under-Reporters: Taxpayers who have engaged in significant crypto activity but have either not filed tax returns or have filed returns without reporting their crypto income. Users of Unregulated Platforms: While harder to track, individuals using peer-to-peer platforms or foreign exchanges with less stringent KYC/AML procedures might also be on the radar if linked to other identifiable financial activities. Those Flagged by TDS Data: The 1% TDS mechanism provides the tax department with a wealth of data on who is transacting in crypto and the value of those transactions. Discrepancies between TDS data and filed returns would be a major red flag. Entities Accepting Crypto Payments: Businesses that have accepted cryptocurrency as payment for goods or services but have not accounted for this income correctly in their books. The investigation is likely data-driven, using information from exchanges, the TDS system, and potentially other financial intelligence sources to identify potential cases of non-compliance with India crypto tax laws. What Are the Potential Consequences of Crypto Tax Evasion India ? Evading taxes, including those on cryptocurrency income, carries significant penalties under Indian tax law. The consequences can range from financial penalties to legal prosecution. Potential repercussions include: Penalty for Underreporting Income: If income is underreported or misreported, a penalty of 50% to 200% of the tax payable on the underreported income can be levied, in addition to the tax due. Interest on Unpaid Tax: Interest is charged on the amount of tax not paid by the due date. Prosecution: In serious cases of willful evasion, prosecution can be initiated, which may lead to imprisonment. Reputational Damage: Being found guilty of tax evasion can severely damage an individual’s or business’s reputation. The tax department has powers to scrutinize accounts, demand information, and assess tax liability. Non-cooperation can also lead to penalties. Actionable Insights: How to Ensure Compliance with Cryptocurrency Tax India Given the ongoing investigation, the most crucial step for anyone involved with cryptocurrencies in India is to ensure full compliance with tax laws. Here are some actionable insights: Gather All Transaction Data: Collect comprehensive transaction history from all exchanges and wallets you have used, both domestic and international. This is the foundation for calculating your tax liability. Calculate Your Gains and Losses Correctly: Determine the cost of acquisition and sale value for every VDA transfer. Calculate the gains subject to the 30% tax. Remember the restrictions on setting off losses. Account for TDS: Ensure that the 1% TDS deducted on your transactions is correctly accounted for in your tax calculations. You can claim credit for this TDS when filing your return. Report All Crypto Income: Clearly declare your income from the transfer of VDAs under the appropriate head (Income from Virtual Digital Assets). Also, report any VDA gifts received above the threshold. File Your Income Tax Return Accurately and On Time: Use the correct ITR form and report all sources of income, including cryptocurrency. File your return by the due date to avoid interest and penalties. Maintain Proper Records: Keep detailed records of all your cryptocurrency transactions, including dates, amounts, costs, sale values, and exchange details. These records are essential if your return is selected for scrutiny. Consult a Tax Professional: Cryptocurrency taxation can be complex. If you have significant transactions or are unsure about any aspect, consult a chartered accountant or tax advisor experienced in crypto taxation. Consider Voluntary Disclosure: If you have previously failed to report crypto income, consider filing an updated return (ITR-U) to disclose the income and pay the tax with applicable interest and penalties. This is generally a better option than waiting for the tax department to initiate action. Being proactive and ensuring compliance is the best way to avoid potential issues with the Indian tax department crypto investigation. Challenges in Enforcing Crypto Regulations India from a Tax Perspective While the tax department is increasing its enforcement efforts, there are inherent challenges in taxing and regulating cryptocurrencies: Decentralization: The very nature of some cryptocurrencies makes tracking transactions difficult, especially those occurring off exchanges or on decentralized platforms. Global Nature: Transactions often cross international borders, involving foreign exchanges and wallets, complicating data collection and enforcement. Anonymity/Pseudonymity: While not truly anonymous, identifying the real-world identity behind certain wallet addresses can be challenging without cooperation from exchanges or service providers. Complexity of Transactions: Various types of crypto activities exist (trading, mining, staking, DeFi, NFTs), each potentially having different tax implications, requiring detailed understanding and tracking. Taxpayer Awareness: Many individuals may not be fully aware of their tax obligations regarding cryptocurrencies, leading to unintentional non-compliance. Despite these challenges, the tax department is leveraging available data points, technological tools, and potentially international information sharing agreements to build cases against non-compliant taxpayers. The Broader Picture: Crypto Regulations India Beyond Tax The tax investigation is part of a larger picture concerning crypto regulations India . While taxation has been clarified, the broader regulatory framework covering aspects like trading platforms, investor protection, and the legal status of cryptocurrencies is still under development.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just announced some key personnel changes that could potentially reshape the landscape for digital assets in the United States. These appointments are particularly noteworthy because they include individuals with direct experience in the crypto sector, sparking hope for a more informed and perhaps even a more accommodating regulatory approach. Understanding the Significance of SEC Crypto Appointments Why are SEC crypto appointments such a big deal? Well, the SEC plays a critical role in overseeing financial markets, including how cryptocurrencies and related products are classified, traded, and offered to the public. Their decisions have a massive impact on everything from whether a spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved to how crypto platforms operate. For years, the industry has called for clearer rules, and changes in leadership can often signal a shift in regulatory priorities and perspectives. The recent announcement highlights the appointment of four senior officials, and what caught the eye of many industry observers is that two of these individuals bring experience specifically relevant to the burgeoning world of digital assets . Jamie Selway: Stepping in as the new director of the Division of Trading and Markets, effective June 17th. This division oversees trading venues like exchanges and brokers – areas directly relevant to how cryptocurrencies are bought and sold. Brian Daly: Taking the helm as the new director of the Division of Investment Management, starting July 8th. This division is crucial for investment products, including funds and ETFs, which are major vehicles for institutional and retail investment in crypto. Their backgrounds in the digital asset space suggest that the SEC is bringing in expertise that understands the nuances and complexities of this technology and market. This move has been interpreted by publications like The Block as a potential indicator that SEC leadership, possibly under Chairman Paul Atkins, might be leaning towards a more pragmatic or even ‘crypto-friendly’ stance compared to previous approaches. What These SEC Digital Assets Appointments Could Mean The addition of officials with digital asset experience could lead to several potential outcomes for the market and participants. While it’s too early to make definitive predictions, here are some possibilities: Increased Understanding: Officials with direct experience might better grasp the technology, market structures, and potential benefits of digital assets, leading to more informed rulemaking. Potential for Clearer Guidance: Their insights could contribute to developing clearer regulatory frameworks, reducing uncertainty that has long plagued the industry. Review of Existing Stances: It’s possible that previous regulatory positions on certain tokens or activities could be revisited with a fresh perspective. Smoother Process for New Products: A deeper understanding within the SEC could potentially streamline the review process for new crypto-related financial products, such as various types of ETFs or investment funds. However, it’s important to temper expectations. The SEC is a large institution, and regulatory processes are complex and often slow. These appointments are significant, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. The overall direction will depend on many factors, including the views of the Commissioners and the broader political and economic environment. The Future of Crypto Regulation US The landscape for crypto regulation US has been a major point of discussion and often frustration for the industry. The lack of a comprehensive, clear framework has been cited as a barrier to innovation and institutional adoption. Different agencies, like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), have sometimes appeared to have overlapping or conflicting views on which assets fall under their jurisdiction. These new SEC officials could play a vital role in shaping the future of this regulation. Their experience could inform discussions around: How to classify different types of tokens (security vs. commodity vs. other). Appropriate consumer protection measures for crypto investors. Regulation of crypto exchanges and trading platforms. Oversight of stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi). The hope is that their appointments will contribute to a more collaborative and effective approach to developing rules that protect investors while allowing the digital asset space to innovate responsibly. Navigating Digital Asset Regulation: What Stakeholders Should Consider For businesses and investors in the crypto space, these appointments are a signal to pay close attention to upcoming SEC actions and statements. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow announcements and speeches from the SEC, particularly from the divisions led by the new officials. Engage Constructively: Industry participants should continue to engage with regulators, providing input and education on digital asset technologies and markets. Prepare for Potential Changes: While hoping for clearer rules, businesses should remain prepared for evolving regulatory requirements. Understand Divisional Roles: Recognize that the Division of Trading and Markets and the Division of Investment Management handle different aspects of the market, and changes in their leadership are relevant to specific types of crypto activities and products. These appointments represent a step towards potentially integrating more specialized knowledge into the regulatory body overseeing digital asset regulation . While the path forward still holds uncertainties, the inclusion of officials with relevant experience is a positive development for those seeking clarity and progress in the US crypto market. Concluding Thoughts: A New Era for SEC and Crypto? The appointment of two senior SEC officials with experience in the digital assets sector is a significant development that shouldn’t be overlooked. It suggests a potential evolution in how the regulatory body approaches the complex and rapidly changing world of cryptocurrency. While challenges remain in establishing a comprehensive crypto regulation US framework, bringing in expertise from the industry itself could pave the way for more informed, effective, and perhaps even favorable policies for digital assets moving forward. The coming months under the leadership of Jamie Selway and Brian Daly in their respective divisions will be closely watched by everyone invested in the future of finance.

Some coins are getting more attention due to strong community support, price growth, or important updates. Among these, one stands out not just for its tech but also for its fast-growing reach, BlockDAG. Along with BlockDAG, ONDO, TIA, and APT are each offering unique value across the DeFi sector. From linking digital assets to real-world use, to building scalable blockchain tools and pushing smart contract progress, these four are grabbing attention. Here’s a closer look at the top crypto projects in 2025 and why they’re becoming more relevant. 1. BlockDAG: Strong Utility, Global Reach, and US-Based Sponsorship BlockDAG is doing what many early-stage platforms have struggled to achieve, blending strong tech features with rising user numbers and wide exposure. Sources suggest BlockDAG is in talks for a US-based sponsorship, which could lead to major branding exposure. With ties to names like Inter Milan and Alex Pereira already in place, this new development could further raise its visibility among mainstream audiences. At the heart of its momentum is a presale that has raised $299 million, selling over 22.4 billion coins. BlockDAG is currently in Batch 29 of its presale, with coins priced at $0.0276 and targeting a launch price of $0.05. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. The project is fully audited by CertiK, EVM-ready, and runs through the X1 app, which has 1.5 million miners onboard. With community engagement tools like Buyer Battles giving rewards to active users, BlockDAG (BDAG) lead among the top crypto projects in 2025, combining tech depth and mainstream appeal. 2. ONDO: Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto Tools ONDO is building momentum by offering tokenized US Treasuries, giving it a real use case in this cycle. The project recently enabled transactions on its testnet through the Ondo Chain using OUSG, its Treasury-based asset, while also working with major firms like J.P. Morgan and Chainlink. It’s also introduced USDY for Latin America and enabled Solana support, helping improve liquidity across different networks. Currently priced around $0.90, ONDO holds a market cap of $2.8 billion and sees daily trading between $130–162 million. Despite earlier price drops from its $2.14 high, it is regaining attention thanks to strong product development and growing institutional support. With over $1.37 billion in value locked and more backing from regulated custodians, ONDO continues to stay relevant as one of the top crypto projects in 2025, offering real-world integration. 3. TIA: Building Scalable and Modular Infrastructure Celestia’s token, TIA, focuses on modular design, allowing developers to create separate execution spaces using Celestia for data. This structure helps improve scalability and avoid network slowdowns. It’s already working with systems like Arbitrum Orbit and Polygon CDK, helping other chains without overloading its own. The price of TIA stands near $2.21, a steep drop from its earlier high above $20. However, steady volume around $122 million and a market cap under $1.5 billion hint at a possible rebound. Future projections go from $2.62 up to $11 by 2026, depending on how quickly rollup usage spreads. With support for Ethereum tools, use of WebAssembly, and strong decentralization, TIA ranks as one of the top crypto projects in 2025 for those watching future blockchain scaling. 4. APT: Growth Path Amid Short-Term Challenges APT, the token for Aptos, has recently crossed above $5 resistance, now trading at $5.13. This follows activity like Bitwise’s ETF filing and rising development based on RapidLane, its improved execution engine. RapidLane lifts throughput, helping Aptos rival other fast blockchains. Even though $53 million in tokens will be unlocked this month and $60 million more next month, which may cause brief price dips, the project’s long-term goals are clear. With Aptos built on the Move language, its ecosystem is growing with grant programs and platforms like xBTC. Some expect APT to temporarily fall to $3.80, but longer-term estimates go as high as $31 in 2025. With better tools and expanding features, APT remains one of the top crypto projects in 2025 worth monitoring. Summing Up! These four cryptos give a strong overview of DeFi’s direction, with each bringing a different strength. ONDO connects digital finance with traditional assets. TIA builds the core tools for future blockchains. APT moves ahead with upgraded smart contract tech. But BlockDAG leads the list with the most balanced mix of reach, growth, and tech. With a $299 million presale, 1.5 million users, and a presale price of $0.0276, it has already shown a 2,660% increase since its first batch. Its US-based sponsorship adds further visibility. Among all, BlockDAG stands out as one of the top crypto projects in 2025 with both user momentum and solid delivery.

In a move that underscores the dynamic nature of large-scale crypto movements, a substantial amount of BTC has shifted addresses, sparking widespread discussion about potential market implications. What Did the Whale Alert Reveal About This Bitcoin Transfer? According to data provided by Whale Alert, a service that monitors large transactions on various blockchains, a colossal amount of 7,999 BTC was recently transferred. This particular transaction originated from Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, and was directed towards a wallet address currently classified as ‘unknown’. The sheer scale of this Bitcoin transfer is noteworthy, valued at approximately $847 million at the time of the transaction. Whale Alert’s notifications are crucial for traders and analysts trying to gauge the activities of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’. Such large movements can sometimes signal potential shifts in market sentiment or liquidity. Key Details of the Bitcoin Transfer Metric Detail Amount Transferred 7,999 BTC Originating Exchange Coinbase Destination Wallet Unknown New Wallet Approximate USD Value $847 Million Reported By Whale Alert Why Does a Large Coinbase Outflow Matter? A significant Coinbase outflow , like the one observed with this 7,999 BTC transfer, is often interpreted as a potentially bullish signal by market participants. Exchanges are typically used for trading activities. When a large amount of Bitcoin leaves an exchange and moves to an unknown wallet, it can suggest that the owner intends to hold onto the assets for the long term rather than selling them in the immediate future. This is because moving assets off an exchange, especially in such large volumes, often involves setting up cold storage solutions, which are less accessible for quick trading. Conversely, large inflows to exchanges can sometimes precede selling pressure, as traders move assets onto platforms to potentially execute trades or take profits. Therefore, tracking Coinbase outflow and inflow data is a key metric for analysts assessing market sentiment and potential supply dynamics. Who is This BTC Whale and What Are They Doing? The term BTC whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin. These players can significantly influence market dynamics due to the sheer size of their holdings and transactions. The identity of the wallet receiving the 7,999 BTC remains unknown, which adds an element of mystery and fuels speculation. Several possibilities exist regarding the nature of this BTC whale and the purpose of the transfer: Institutional Investment: It could represent a large institution moving recently acquired Bitcoin into cold storage for safekeeping. This would align with the narrative of increasing institutional adoption. Private Investor/Fund: A wealthy individual or a private investment fund could be consolidating assets or securing a large position off-exchange. Exchange Internal Transfer: Less likely for a move to a completely ‘unknown new wallet’, but sometimes exchanges perform internal rebalancing, though these are usually identifiable. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The BTC might have been purchased via an OTC desk, and this transfer represents the delivery of the assets to the buyer’s secure wallet. Without concrete information on the wallet’s owner, these remain educated guesses based on typical large-scale crypto movements. However, the fact that it left a major exchange like Coinbase and went to a new, unknown address is a strong indicator of a potential long-term holding strategy by the recipient. How Does This Fit Into the Broader Crypto News Landscape? This significant transfer is just one piece of the larger puzzle in the dynamic world of crypto news . Large transactions are constantly occurring across various blockchains, and monitoring them helps provide insights into market activity, investor behavior, and potential trends. In a market often driven by sentiment and large capital flows, keeping an eye on whale movements is considered a crucial aspect of analysis. Recent crypto news has highlighted increasing interest from institutional players and corporations in Bitcoin. Transfers like this one can sometimes be indicative of such trends, especially if followed by similar patterns from other exchanges or into identifiable institutional wallets. However, it’s important not to overstate the impact of a single transaction. While significant, the market’s direction is influenced by a multitude of factors including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. What Can We Learn From Tracking Whale Activity? Tracking large transactions, as reported by services like Whale Alert, offers several potential benefits for market participants: Gauging Sentiment: Large outflows from exchanges can suggest accumulation and a bullish bias among whales, while large inflows might indicate potential selling. Identifying Trends: Observing patterns in whale behavior over time can help identify broader trends in institutional or large investor interest. Understanding Liquidity: Movements of large volumes can impact the available supply on exchanges, potentially affecting price volatility. Spotting Potential Opportunities: While risky, some traders attempt to anticipate market moves based on observed whale activity, although this requires sophisticated tools and analysis. It’s essential to remember that whale tracking is not an exact science and should be used as one of many tools for market analysis. Large transfers can have various legitimate reasons that do not directly predict immediate price movements. Actionable Insights for the Reader Given this large Bitcoin transfer and the ongoing interest in whale activity, what steps can interested individuals take? Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and data providers like Whale Alert to stay updated on significant on-chain movements. Analyze Context: Don’t view a single transaction in isolation. Consider it within the broader market context, including price action, news headlines, and other on-chain metrics. Use Whale Data as an Indicator, Not a Guarantee: Understand that large transfers are just one piece of the puzzle. They can signal potential intent but do not guarantee specific market outcomes. Focus on Long-Term Trends: For most investors, focusing on the long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader market is often more productive than trying to trade based on individual whale movements. Summary: A Closer Look at the $847 Million Bitcoin Transfer The recent movement of 7,999 BTC, valued at approximately $847 million, from Coinbase to an unknown wallet, as highlighted by Whale Alert , is a significant event in the world of cryptocurrency. This large Coinbase outflow suggests that a major holder, a likely BTC whale , is potentially moving assets off-exchange for long-term storage, which is often interpreted positively by the market. While the identity and exact intentions of the recipient remain a mystery, such transactions are vital pieces of crypto news that analysts use to gauge market sentiment and potential supply dynamics. Tracking these large transfers provides valuable insights but should always be done in conjunction with other forms of market analysis.

This isn’t just a simple donation; it’s a powerful statement from one of the most influential organizations in the Ethereum ecosystem, underscoring the high stakes involved in the ongoing legal battles facing developers in the crypto space, particularly those working on tools designed to enhance crypto privacy . Why is the Ethereum Foundation Stepping Up for Roman Storm ? The Ethereum Foundation confirmed it is contributing $500,000 towards the legal costs for Roman Storm. This substantial sum highlights the perceived importance of his case, not just for Storm himself, but for the broader principles the Foundation believes are at stake. In their statement, the Foundation emphasized that “privacy is normal” and, crucially, that “writing code is not a crime.” This position aligns with a long-held view within the crypto and open-source communities that code is a form of speech and that developers should not be held criminally liable for how others choose to use the tools they create. The Foundation’s financial support signals a commitment to defending developers whose work touches upon sensitive areas like privacy, especially when facing legal challenges from powerful entities like the U.S. Department of Justice. What is Tornado Cash and Why the Controversy? To understand the context of the DOJ indictment and the Ethereum Foundation’s support, it’s essential to know what Tornado Cash is. Tornado Cash is a decentralized protocol designed to improve transaction privacy on the Ethereum network. It works by pooling together cryptocurrency from various users, mixing it, and then allowing users to withdraw the same amount (minus fees) to a new address. This process makes it significantly harder to trace the origin of funds. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it generally works: Deposit: User A deposits ETH or another token into the Tornado Cash pool. Wait: User A waits for a period while other users also deposit and withdraw funds. Withdraw: User A withdraws the same amount of ETH to a completely new wallet address using a cryptographic proof (a ‘note’) from their original deposit. The controversy arises because while Tornado Cash can be used for legitimate privacy reasons (e.g., protecting financial history from public view, preventing tracking by advertisers or unwanted parties), it has also allegedly been used by malicious actors, including cybercriminals and entities sanctioned by the U.S. government, to launder illicit funds. This dual-use nature has placed it squarely in the crosshairs of regulators. Unpacking the DOJ Indictment : What Are the Charges Against Roman Storm ? Roman Storm was arrested and subsequently indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice in August 2023. The charges against him are serious and carry significant potential penalties. The indictment alleges three main counts: Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering: This charge alleges that Storm conspired with others to conduct financial transactions involving the proceeds of specified unlawful activities, knowing that the transactions were designed to conceal the nature, source, or ownership of the funds. Conspiracy to Operate an Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business: The DOJ alleges that Tornado Cash operated as a money transmitting business without obtaining the necessary licenses, and Storm was involved in this operation. Conspiracy to Violate Sanctions Laws: This charge is particularly sensitive, alleging that Storm conspired to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by facilitating transactions for sanctioned entities, notably the North Korean cybercrime group Lazarus Group, which the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash for allegedly enabling. The DOJ’s case appears to focus not just on the existence of the tool, but on Storm’s alleged involvement in its operation, maintenance, and alleged knowledge or willful blindness regarding its use by illicit actors. This distinguishes it from merely writing and publishing code, a point the defense and its supporters, including the Ethereum Foundation, are likely to contest vigorously. The Bigger Picture: Crypto Privacy Under Fire? The case against Roman Storm and the subsequent support from the Ethereum Foundation highlight a fundamental tension at the heart of the crypto space: the desire for privacy and anonymity versus the demands of financial regulation aimed at preventing money laundering and sanctions evasion. Blockchain technology is inherently transparent, making transaction histories publicly viewable. Privacy tools like Tornado Cash were developed precisely to counter this transparency for users who value financial confidentiality. Proponents of privacy tools argue that privacy is a fundamental right and necessary for various legitimate activities, such as protecting sensitive business transactions, preventing stalking or harassment based on public financial data, or simply maintaining personal financial confidentiality in a world where data is increasingly exploited. Regulators, on the other hand, view tools that obfuscate transaction origins as significant risks that can be exploited by criminals, terrorists, and sanctioned regimes to move illicit funds undetected. They argue that the need to combat serious financial crime outweighs the general desire for privacy in this context. The legal battle facing Storm could set important precedents regarding the legal liability of developers who create decentralized, open-source software. If developers can be held responsible for the illicit actions of users of their tools, even if they have no direct control over the usage, it could have a chilling effect on innovation and the development of privacy-enhancing technologies in the crypto space and beyond. What Does This Mean for Developers and Users? The DOJ indictment and the subsequent legal proceedings against Roman Storm serve as a stark reminder of the legal risks associated with developing and using certain types of crypto software, particularly those focused on privacy or facilitating peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. For developers, this case underscores the importance of understanding the regulatory landscape and potential legal liabilities associated with their projects. While the “code is speech” argument is a strong defense within the community, its acceptance in traditional legal systems is still being tested. Building in compliance features where possible or clearly disclaiming responsibility for user actions might become even more crucial, though the decentralized nature of many projects makes this complex. For users, the case highlights the risks associated with using privacy tools that are under regulatory scrutiny. While using such tools might be legal in some jurisdictions or for certain purposes, their association with illicit activities and the regulatory crackdown can lead to assets being frozen or other legal consequences. Ultimately, the outcome of the case against Roman Storm, supported by the Ethereum Foundation ‘s significant contribution, will be closely watched by the entire crypto community. It represents a critical juncture in the ongoing debate about the balance between financial privacy, regulatory control, and the freedom to develop open-source technology.

Analyst Sees Path To $137,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-following-abcd-pattern-analyst-sees-path-to-137000/,"Brewing tensions between Israel and Iran have triggered global de-risking across risk-on assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). The top cryptocurrency by market cap is down 1.7% over the past 24 hours. That said, technical indicators still point toward a potential new all-time high (ATH) for BTC in the coming months. Bitcoin Tracing The ABCD Pattern According to a recent post on X by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, BTC appears to be following the ABCD pattern. The analyst noted that Bitcoin is currently trading within a wedge formation and could target as high as $137,000 if it breaks out. For the uninitiated, the ABCD pattern is a classic chart setup with four points and three legs – AB, BC, and CD – where AB and CD are typically equal in length, and BC serves as the retracement. It helps identify potential reversal zones and signals when a price move may be losing momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance – A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Several other technical indicators also point to a potential new ATH for BTC. For instance, crypto analyst Crypto Caesar shared the following 4-hour Bitcoin chart highlighting a bullish double bottom pattern that suggests BTC is primed for recovery. Fellow crypto commentator Jelle identified a cup and handle pattern on the daily BTC chart. Jelle shared the following chart showing that BTC has already formed the “cup” and is now beginning to shape the “handle,” which typically precedes a sharp upward move. Meanwhile, crypto trader Merlijn the Trader pointed to the Hash Ribbons – an on-chain indicator historically associated with major rallies. Merlijn shared the following BTC daily chart, noting that the last four appearances of this signal preceded strong Bitcoin uptrends. To explain, Hash Ribbons is an on-chain indicator that uses Bitcoin’s 30-day and 60-day hash rate moving averages (MA) to spot miner capitulation and recovery. A bullish signal appears when the short-term average crosses above the long-term one. Are BTC Bears Regaining Ground? Although BTC remains above the psychologically important $100,000 mark, some concerning signs are beginning to emerge. The cryptocurrency was recently rejected from the $110,000 resistance level again, giving bears temporary control.

Such dynamics are typically observed during the late phase of a bull cycle. In parallel, short-term holders are showing signs of declining confidence in BTC, as reflected in recent on-chain activity. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $105,568, down 1.7% over the past 24 hours.

While the immediate focus is on the humanitarian and security implications, for participants in the financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, such events are closely watched for their potential to trigger significant shifts. Understanding the Geopolitical Tension Behind the Israel Missile Event The report confirms an Israel missile alert triggered by a launch originating from Yemen. This incident is not isolated but occurs within a broader context of escalating regional tensions. Yemen has been a flashpoint for conflict, and actions originating from there impacting Israel represent a significant development. This particular event underscores the complex and volatile geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Several factors contribute to the heightened geopolitical tension in the region: Ongoing conflicts and proxy wars involving regional and international powers. Disputes over territory, political influence, and religious differences. The involvement of non-state actors capable of launching cross-border attacks. The intricate web of alliances and rivalries that can quickly escalate localized incidents into broader confrontations. An confirmed Yemen launch targeting Israel is a direct manifestation of these underlying tensions, raising concerns about potential retaliation and further escalation across the region. How Does Geopolitical Tension Influence Market Volatility? Financial markets, including traditional assets like stocks, bonds, oil, and gold, are highly sensitive to geopolitical events. Increased geopolitical tension typically introduces uncertainty and fear, leading investors to reassess risk exposure. This often results in: Flight to Safety: Capital tends to flow into assets perceived as safe havens, such as gold, certain government bonds (like US Treasuries), and sometimes the US dollar. Increased Volatility: Prices of riskier assets (like stocks and many commodities) can experience sharp swings as traders react to news, rumors, and speculation about the potential impact of the conflict. Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts in key regions can disrupt global supply chains, affecting commodity prices (especially oil and gas) and potentially impacting inflation. Changes in Investor Sentiment: Overall market confidence can be shaken, leading to broader sell-offs or a reluctance to invest until the situation stabilizes. The news of an Israel missile alert following a Yemen launch fits squarely into the category of events that can fuel this kind of market volatility . Exploring the Potential Crypto Impact Given that cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7 and are increasingly integrated into the global financial landscape, they are not immune to the effects of major geopolitical events. The potential crypto impact from events like the recent Israel missile incident can be multifaceted: Historically, the reaction of the crypto market to geopolitical tension has been debated. Some argue that Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ could act as a safe haven asset, independent of traditional financial systems and government control. Under this narrative, increased global instability might lead investors to seek refuge in Bitcoin, driving its price up. However, the reality is often more complex. Crypto markets are still relatively young and can be highly correlated with traditional risk assets, particularly technology stocks. In times of broad market panic or deleveraging, investors may sell off all risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, to raise cash or cover margin calls. Therefore, increased market volatility stemming from geopolitical events could also lead to downward pressure on crypto prices. What Factors Determine the Crypto Market’s Reaction? The specific crypto impact of the Yemen launch and resulting Israel missile alerts will depend on several factors: Scale of Escalation: A contained incident might have minimal lasting impact, while a significant escalation into a broader regional conflict could trigger a more severe market reaction. Global Economic Context: The state of the global economy (inflation, interest rates, recession fears) at the time of the event can amplify or dampen its effects on markets. Market Sentiment: The prevailing sentiment in the crypto market (bullish, bearish, or neutral) before the event can influence how it reacts. A market already under pressure might be more susceptible to negative news. Correlation with Traditional Markets: The degree to which crypto is currently correlated with stocks and other risk assets will play a significant role. Narrative Strength: The strength of the ‘digital gold’ or safe haven narrative for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies during the specific event. Potential Scenarios for Crypto Impact: Based on past reactions and current market dynamics, here are a few potential scenarios for the crypto impact following the news of the Yemen launch and Israel missile alerts: Scenario Description Potential Crypto Reaction Reasoning Limited Impact / Quick Recovery Incident remains isolated, no major escalation. Minor dip followed by quick recovery or sideways movement. Market assesses the event as not significantly changing the broader economic/geopolitical outlook. Increased Volatility / Short-Term Dip News creates initial panic; broader market sell-off. Prices dip alongside stocks; increased trading volume and price swings. Crypto acts as a risk asset, sold off during general market fear and deleveraging. Flight to Safety Narrative Emerges Significant escalation; traditional systems perceived as vulnerable. Bitcoin (and potentially other select crypto) sees inflows; outperforms traditional risk assets. Investors seek non-sovereign, decentralized assets as a hedge against geopolitical instability. (Less common scenario currently) Sustained Downtrend (if part of larger crisis) Incident is part of a prolonged, escalating regional or global crisis impacting the global economy. Crypto market experiences a sustained downturn, possibly steeper than traditional markets due to higher beta. Broader economic fallout, loss of confidence, and continued risk-off sentiment dominate. As of the immediate aftermath of the report, the market reaction is being closely monitored. Initial news often leads to knee-jerk reactions, and it takes time to assess the true potential for escalation and its lasting effect on global stability and financial markets. Navigating Market Volatility: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Events like the Yemen launch causing Israel missile alerts serve as a stark reminder of how quickly the global landscape can change and impact financial markets. For those holding or trading cryptocurrencies, navigating this potential market volatility requires a thoughtful approach. Stay Informed, But Be Critical Keep track of reliable news sources regarding the geopolitical situation. However, be wary of sensationalism and rumors that can exacerbate panic. Focus on verified information from reputable outlets and official statements. Assess Your Risk Tolerance and Portfolio Geopolitical shocks are part of the investing landscape. Review your portfolio allocation. Are you comfortable with the potential downside if markets react negatively? Consider whether your current holdings align with your long-term investment goals and risk tolerance in light of increased uncertainty. Avoid Emotional Decisions Sudden news and market drops can trigger fear and panic selling. Conversely, a quick rebound might lead to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Try to stick to your pre-defined investment strategy. Emotional trading during periods of high market volatility often leads to poor outcomes. Consider Diversification While diversification within crypto (holding various coins) is important, also consider your overall asset allocation across different asset classes. However, during systemic shocks driven by geopolitical events, correlations between asset classes can sometimes increase. Think Long-Term For long-term crypto investors, short-term geopolitical shocks might be viewed as temporary noise. Historically, markets tend to recover from such events over time, provided they don’t trigger a sustained global crisis. Consider whether short-term price movements should alter your long-term conviction in the underlying technology and adoption trends. Manage Your Leverage If you are trading with leverage, periods of high market volatility significantly increase the risk of liquidation. Geopolitical events can cause rapid and large price swings, making leveraged positions particularly vulnerable. Conclusion: Monitoring the Crypto Impact Amidst Rising Tensions The news of missile sirens across Israel following a launch from Yemen is a serious geopolitical development with potential ramifications far beyond the immediate vicinity. For global financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space, it introduces a new layer of uncertainty and the potential for increased market volatility . While the immediate crypto impact remains to be fully seen and will depend on how the situation evolves, investors should be prepared for potential price swings. The incident highlights the interconnectedness of global events and financial markets. Staying informed, managing risk prudently, and avoiding impulsive decisions are crucial strategies for navigating these turbulent times. The situation remains fluid, and market participants will be closely watching for further developments from both the region and the subsequent reactions in traditional and crypto markets.

A recent announcement from Iran serves as a stark reminder that Geopolitical Risk remains a significant factor on the world stage. This development, while centered on diplomatic negotiations, highlights the interconnectedness of global events and their potential, albeit indirect, influence on various sectors, including the broader financial landscape that encompasses the Crypto Market Impact . Understanding the Latest Development: Why Did Iran Skip the Talks? According to reports from Iranian state television, Iran will not be participating in nuclear talks with the United States that were scheduled for Sunday. This decision introduces a fresh layer of Global Uncertainty into already complex diplomatic efforts aimed at reviving the Iran Nuclear Deal , formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The planned talks were seen by some as a potential pathway to de-escalation and a step towards bringing both the U.S. and Iran back into full compliance with the 2015 agreement. The deal, which curbed Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, has been in jeopardy since the U.S. withdrew in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, prompting Iran to gradually reduce its own commitments. The exact reasons cited by Iran for skipping this specific round of talks were not immediately detailed in initial reports, but such decisions often stem from a complex interplay of factors: Leverage: Iran may be seeking to gain leverage in future negotiations by signaling dissatisfaction or demanding concessions before returning to the table. Internal Politics: Domestic political considerations within Iran can heavily influence its negotiating stance and willingness to engage. Response to External Events: The decision could be a reaction to recent actions or statements from the U.S., other parties to the deal (like the UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China), or regional adversaries. Procedural Disagreements: There might be disagreements over the format, agenda, or participants of the planned talks. Regardless of the specific immediate cause, the outcome is clear: a delay, and potentially a setback, in diplomatic efforts, increasing Geopolitical Risk . How Does Geopolitical Risk Connect to the Crypto Market Impact? At first glance, nuclear negotiations in the Middle East might seem worlds away from the decentralized ledgers and digital currencies of the crypto market. However, global markets are highly sensitive to shifts in Geopolitical Risk and Global Uncertainty . When major geopolitical events occur, they can trigger broader market reactions: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty often leads to increased volatility across asset classes as investors react to potential instability. Flight to Safety: In times of heightened risk, some investors may move capital out of perceived riskier assets (like stocks, or sometimes, cryptocurrencies) into traditional safe havens (like gold or certain government bonds). Impact on Traditional Finance: Geopolitical events can affect oil prices, currency exchange rates, and stock markets. These shifts in traditional finance can indirectly influence sentiment and liquidity in the crypto market. Regulatory Concerns: Geopolitical tensions can sometimes lead to increased scrutiny or calls for stricter regulation of cryptocurrencies, particularly regarding their potential use in circumventing sanctions. While the Bitcoin Price and the broader crypto market are driven by their own unique fundamentals (adoption rates, technological developments, halving cycles, etc.), they do not exist in a vacuum. They are increasingly integrated into the global financial ecosystem and can react to macro-economic and geopolitical headwinds. Exploring the Iran Nuclear Deal: What’s at Stake? The potential revival of the Iran Nuclear Deal is significant for several reasons, all of which contribute to the level of Global Uncertainty : Table: Key Aspects of the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA) Aspect Description Significance Nuclear Restrictions Limits on uranium enrichment levels and stockpiles, restrictions on advanced centrifuges, intrusive inspections by the IAEA. Aims to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Breakdown increases proliferation risk. Sanctions Relief Lifting of international sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program (U.S. sanctions largely reimposed after 2018 withdrawal). Intended to provide economic benefits to Iran. Reimposition severely impacts Iran’s economy. Monitoring & Verification Robust inspection regime by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Ensures transparency and verification of Iran’s compliance. Reduced cooperation increases opacity. Parties Involved Iran, P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, UK, U.S.) and the European Union. Requires consensus and cooperation among multiple global powers, adding complexity. A failure to revive the deal could lead to Iran further expanding its nuclear activities, potentially bringing it closer to weapons-grade material. This scenario would dramatically heighten Geopolitical Risk in the Middle East and globally, potentially leading to regional conflict or further international isolation of Iran. Such outcomes are precisely the kind of events that can send jitters through financial markets, contributing to Global Uncertainty and potentially influencing the Crypto Market Impact . Historical Perspective: Geopolitical Events and Market Reactions History provides numerous examples of how geopolitical events have impacted markets. While the crypto market is relatively new compared to traditional finance, it has shown sensitivity to major global shocks: The COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 caused a significant, albeit temporary, crash across global markets, including cryptocurrencies, as initial Global Uncertainty peaked. Regional conflicts or significant political crises in the past have often correlated with increased volatility in oil prices and stock markets, effects that can spill over into other asset classes. Even events like major elections or policy shifts in key global economies can introduce uncertainty that affects investor sentiment worldwide, influencing decisions related to assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. The current situation with the Iran Nuclear Deal , while not an immediate crisis, is a persistent source of Geopolitical Risk that market participants monitor. A sudden negative turn could trigger risk-off sentiment, potentially affecting the Bitcoin Price and the broader market. What Are the Challenges and Risks Ahead? Reviving the Iran Nuclear Deal faces significant challenges: Trust Deficit: Deep mistrust exists between Iran and the U.S., making direct negotiation difficult. Sanctions vs. Nuclear Steps: Disagreements persist on the sequencing and extent of U.S. sanctions relief and Iran’s return to nuclear compliance. External Pressure: Regional adversaries of Iran lobby against the deal’s revival. Escalation Risk: Continued failure to find a diplomatic path increases the risk of escalation, either through further Iranian nuclear advancements or regional tensions. These challenges perpetuate Global Uncertainty and underscore the ongoing nature of Geopolitical Risk associated with this issue. For market participants, this means this is not a ‘one-off’ event but a situation that requires ongoing monitoring due to its potential for sudden shifts that could have a Crypto Market Impact . Actionable Insights for Navigating Uncertainty While it’s impossible to predict market movements based solely on geopolitical news, understanding the potential impact of events like the stalled Iran Nuclear Deal is crucial for informed decision-making. For those interested in the crypto market, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of major geopolitical developments, even those seemingly unrelated to crypto. Understand how events causing Global Uncertainty have historically affected markets. Recognize Interconnectedness: Appreciate that the Crypto Market Impact can be influenced by macro factors, including Geopolitical Risk , not just internal crypto news. Monitor Sentiment: Observe how traditional markets (stocks, oil, gold) react to such news, as this can sometimes provide clues about broader risk appetite that may affect the Bitcoin Price and altcoins. Risk Management: Ensure your investment strategy accounts for potential volatility driven by external factors. This might involve diversification or setting clear entry/exit points. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility can be triggered by news events, the long-term trajectory of the crypto market is driven by fundamental adoption and technological progress. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on single news items. Understanding the landscape of Geopolitical Risk helps investors contextualize market movements and make more resilient decisions in the face of Global Uncertainty . The situation with the Iran Nuclear Deal is a prime example of an external factor that contributes to this complex global backdrop. Conclusion: Monitoring the Horizon Iran’s decision to skip scheduled nuclear talks with the U.S. is a significant diplomatic setback that elevates Geopolitical Risk . While the direct, immediate Crypto Market Impact might not be apparent, this development contributes to the overarching climate of Global Uncertainty that influences all financial markets. The future of the Iran Nuclear Deal remains precarious, and potential escalations or resolutions will continue to be watched closely by global observers and market participants alike. For those navigating the crypto space, recognizing that events far beyond the blockchain can create ripples is key to developing a robust and informed approach to investment in assets like Bitcoin Price and beyond. Staying informed about such critical global developments is an essential part of understanding the broader forces that can shape the market landscape.

By mixing blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, Lightchain AI introduces the best solutions that set it apart in the competitive crypto industry. Currently, its presale has seen the project secure funding of about $18.4 million, with its token priced at $0.007, showing that investors trust the project. With its special technology and forward-thinking move, Lightchain AI is set to outperform other meme coins by 2025. Drawbacks of Meme Coins Such as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have been seeing a lot of attention in the crypto market. Nevertheless, there are few of the well-known tokens in the market. One of the major disadvantages of these tokens is their sharp movements in price. For example, these coins see quick movements in prices, with a sharp decline translating to losses for investors. This unstable movement is caused by social media and trends. Sometimes, it is also caused by celebrity endorsements. Moreover, most of the meme coins are not supported by the best fundamentals, with community hype and speculation causing their value to rise or drop. This unknown behavior has led to investors complaining about their long-term growth. The meme coin market can also be easily manipulated e.g. pump and dump schemes where projects cause their tokens to rise using artificial mens later to sell them for profit and leave investors hanging. Secondly, regulations for meme coins are still unclear and as a result, investors are taking on big risks by being in the sector. This means that investors need to be careful when dealing in this sector, carrying out the needed research before choosing to invest in any token in the meme coin sector. What Sets Lightchain AI Apart from Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) Lightchain AI sets itself apart from Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) with the best technologies, better tokenomics, and security measures. While SHIB and DOGE rely on community hype, Lightchain AI has an ecosystem that offers real-world utility. The project’s tokenomics is clearly defined, with its token supply fixed at 10 billion LCAI tokens. 405 of these are allocated to the presale, while 28.5% are allocated to staking rewards. 15% is allocated to liquidity, while the rest is shared across marketing, treasury, and members of the team. This encourages adoption and ensures growth inside the ecosystem. Lightchain AI also stands out due to its low latency performance, and parallel execution that allows real-time response. These features are important for AI-powered decentralized applications. It also uses the Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) framework for its security and decentralized storage to ensure data privacy and protection. These features make Lightchain AI the best project for investors looking for new platforms with functionality. Why Play It Safe When You Can Aim for Greatness? While meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are good because of their short profits, that is not enough for investors looking at the long term. Lightchain AI ensures the best opportunity with real long-term potential. With the best technology and solid tokenomics, Lightchain AI reduces risks by ensuring its platform is stable and sustainable. This is not just another crypto project, it is a bold step into the decentralized world. It also wants to change the future of decentralized finance by blending blockchain with artificial intelligence. So, why settle for short-term profits when you can invest in something better?

Right now, Worldcoin (WLD) is heading toward resistance, and Sui (SUI) recently showed a breakout pattern, suggesting wider momentum in the sector. With that movement, another project is gaining serious attention, BlockDAG. This guide explores the fastest growing cryptos in 2025, covering BlockDAG , TAO, ALGO, and TIA, and why each deserves a closer look in this current cycle. 1. BlockDAG: US-Based Sponsorship Hype Builds BlockDAG continues to show strong presale growth. The project has now raised $299.6 million and sold 22.4 billion coins across 29 batches. The current price in batch 29 is $0.0276. Since batch 1, early holders have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds. With expectations of a $0.05 launch price, there’s strong attention building around the project. Unlike most presales, BlockDAG brings more than hype, it’s backed by working features and strong tech.

A recent alert from a reputable source like VanEck carries significant weight, especially when it concerns announcements that could mislead investors. VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets, Matthew Sigel, has issued a pointed VanEck crypto warning regarding certain corporate pronouncements in the digital asset space, specifically targeting small-cap firms making grand claims about XRP treasury plans and Solana treasury plans. Understanding the VanEck Crypto Warning VanEck is a well-established investment management firm with a growing focus on digital assets. When a figure like Matthew Sigel, who leads their digital asset strategy, speaks, the market listens. His recent comments highlight a critical concern: the potential for low-market-capitalization companies to exploit the hype around cryptocurrencies like XRP and Solana for less-than-legitimate purposes. The core of the VanEck crypto warning is skepticism towards announcements from companies, particularly those listed on exchanges like Nasdaq but possessing market caps under $100 million. These firms are reportedly announcing intentions to raise substantial amounts – potentially hundreds of millions of dollars – specifically for purchasing digital assets like XRP and SOL to hold in their corporate treasuries. Sigel’s concern, as reported by The Block, stems from the sheer scale of the proposed crypto acquisitions relative to the size and financial capacity of these micro cap crypto companies. Raising hundreds of millions typically requires significant institutional backing, proven track records, or substantial existing assets. Without these elements, such ambitious funding goals for speculative asset purchases appear questionable. What Makes These Micro Cap Crypto Announcements Suspicious? Let’s break down why these specific announcements raise red flags, according to the VanEck crypto warning: Disproportionate Scale: A company with a market capitalization of, say, $50 million, claiming it will raise $500 million to buy crypto is a massive mismatch. This implies raising capital ten times their current valuation solely for a volatile asset class. Lack of Credible Backing: Large capital raises usually involve investment banks, venture capital firms, or strategic investors who conduct thorough due diligence. The absence of announced major backers for these micro-cap plans is suspicious. Asset Choice: While XRP and Solana are prominent cryptocurrencies, announcing massive XRP treasury plans or Solana treasury plans without a clear, compelling business rationale tied to the company’s core operations can seem opportunistic. Unlike a tech company needing Bitcoin for payments or reserves, a tutoring company (like Classover) or a digital services firm (like Trident Digital) announcing huge crypto buys lacks obvious synergy. Timing: Such announcements often coincide with periods of increased crypto market volatility or interest, potentially aimed at capturing market attention rather than reflecting a sound corporate strategy. The Mechanism: Potential Crypto Pump and Dump Matthew Sigel explicitly labels these types of announcements as potentially being crypto pump and dump schemes. But how would that work in this context? A classic crypto pump and dump involves inflating the price of an asset through misleading positive statements or hype, then selling off holdings once the price rises, leaving others with devalued assets. In this corporate version: A micro cap crypto company announces massive XRP treasury plans or Solana treasury plans. This news creates excitement, suggesting significant institutional demand for XRP or SOL is coming. Crypto investors, and potentially even stock investors in the micro-cap company, buy the assets or the stock based on this perceived future demand or strategic shift. This ‘pumps’ the price. The company or associated insiders, who may have acquired the crypto or stock cheaply beforehand, sell their holdings into the inflated market. This is the ‘dump’. The announced capital raise or crypto purchase may never fully materialize, or if it does, it might be on a much smaller scale, leaving investors who bought on the hype holding the bag as prices inevitably fall back down. This scheme leverages corporate announcements to manipulate market perception, distinct from a typical project-based crypto pump and dump but with a similar harmful outcome for unsuspecting investors. Case Studies: Trident Digital and Classover Holdings Sigel specifically mentioned companies like Trident Digital and Classover Holdings as examples exhibiting these concerning patterns. While specific details of their announcements would need independent verification, the pattern described fits: Both are described as having market caps under $100 million. Both reportedly announced plans to raise hundreds of millions for crypto purchases. The scale of the proposed raise relative to their size is the primary red flag. These examples serve as cautionary tales, illustrating the types of announcements that prompted the VanEck crypto warning. Investors should look beyond the headline and scrutinize the details, especially the financial viability of the announced plans for companies of this size. Risks for Investors: Navigating Micro Cap Crypto Announcements For both stock market investors considering these micro-cap companies and crypto investors trading XRP or SOL, these announcements present significant risks: Stock Valuation Risk: The company’s stock price might artificially inflate based on the crypto hype. If the plan fails or is revealed as disingenuous, the stock price could collapse. Furthermore, pursuing highly speculative XRP treasury plans or Solana treasury plans with shareholder funds might indicate poor corporate governance or a lack of focus on the core business. Crypto Market Volatility: While a large buyer *could* theoretically impact XRP or SOL prices, the impact of a potentially fake or exaggerated announcement is different. It creates artificial demand that evaporates, leading to potential price corrections that harm those who bought during the ‘pump’. Liquidity Issues: Micro cap crypto stocks can be illiquid, making it hard for investors to sell shares quickly if news turns negative. Fraud Risk: At worst, these could be outright fraudulent schemes designed to enrich insiders at the expense of public investors. The VanEck crypto warning serves as a timely reminder that not all corporate crypto adoption announcements are created equal. Actionable Insights: How to Spot Dubious Treasury Plans Given the potential for crypto pump and dump schemes dressed up as corporate strategy, how can investors protect themselves? Here are some actionable insights: Check the Company’s Market Cap: Compare the announced capital raise amount to the company’s current market capitalization. If the raise is many times larger than the company itself, be extremely skeptical. Identify Funding Sources: Does the announcement name specific, reputable investors or investment banks providing the hundreds of millions? Generic statements about ‘raising capital’ without specifics are a red flag. Evaluate the Business Rationale: Why does this specific company need XRP treasury plans or Solana treasury plans? Is there a clear strategic link to their existing business model, or does it seem like a speculative pivot? Research Management and Track Record: Look into the history of the company’s leadership. Do they have experience managing large sums or operating in the digital asset space legitimately? Be Wary of Hype: Announcements focused more on generating buzz than explaining the financial and strategic details warrant caution. Diversify and Don’t Bet on Single Announcements: Avoid making significant investment decisions based solely on a single company’s announcement, especially from a micro-cap firm. Treat announcements from micro cap crypto firms claiming massive treasury plans with extreme caution. Due diligence is paramount. Conclusion: Heeding the VanEck Crypto Warning Matthew Sigel’s VanEck crypto warning about potentially fraudulent XRP treasury plans and Solana treasury plans from micro cap crypto companies is a crucial alert for the market. While corporate adoption of crypto is a significant trend, not all announcements are genuine or well-founded. The pattern of small companies claiming they will raise vast sums for crypto purchases, without credible backing, strongly suggests the possibility of a crypto pump and dump scheme designed to manipulate stock or crypto prices. Investors must remain vigilant, look beyond sensational headlines, and conduct thorough research into the companies and the feasibility of their announced plans. The promise of large institutional buys can create powerful hype, but as VanEck suggests, sometimes that hype is just a cover for something far less legitimate. Stay informed, question ambitious claims from small players, and prioritize sound investment principles over speculative excitement.

A significant proposal has emerged that could fundamentally change how the network operates, aiming for unprecedented levels of efficiency and scalability. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a potential architectural shift that could redefine the future capabilities of the platform. Why is Vitalik Buterin Proposing a Major Change? During the recent Protocol Berg event, part of Berlin Blockchain Week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin dropped a compelling idea: potentially replacing the network’s core execution engine, the EVM ( Ethereum Virtual Machine), with a new architecture called RISC-V . This proposal stems from the ongoing need to improve the network’s ability to handle more transactions and complex operations without increasing costs or compromising decentralization. While Ethereum has made significant strides with upgrades like The Merge and ongoing work on sharding, execution layer efficiency remains a key area for improvement. The EVM has served the network well since its inception, acting as the decentralized computer that executes smart contracts. However, as the demand on Ethereum grows, its limitations in processing speed and cost become more apparent. This is where the vision for a more powerful, flexible, and potentially faster execution environment comes into play. What Exactly is RISC-V and How Could it Benefit Ethereum ? RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA). Unlike proprietary ISAs that require licensing fees and have closed specifications, RISC-V is free to use and modify. This open nature aligns well with the decentralized and open-source ethos of the Ethereum community. Buterin highlighted several potential benefits of transitioning to RISC-V : Massive Execution Capacity Increase: The most striking claim is the potential for a 100x increase in execution capacity. This means the network could theoretically process significantly more complex smart contracts and transactions simultaneously, dramatically boosting throughput. Lower Transaction Costs: Higher efficiency and capacity typically translate to lower computational costs per operation. For users, this could mean substantially reduced gas fees, making the network more accessible and affordable for a wider range of applications and activities. Broader Developer Adoption: RISC-V is a well-established architecture in the general computing world. Shifting to it could potentially lower the barrier to entry for developers who are already familiar with RISC-V tools and environments but are new to blockchain-specific virtual machines like the EVM . This could attract a larger and more diverse pool of talent to build on Ethereum . Improved Flexibility and Innovation: As an open standard, RISC-V allows for greater flexibility in implementation and optimization compared to the more fixed design of the current EVM . This could pave the way for future innovations in how smart contracts are executed. Think of it like upgrading from an older, custom-built engine to a modern, standardized, and highly optimized one that’s used across various high-performance systems. While the custom engine worked, the standardized one offers significant performance gains and is easier for more mechanics (developers) to work with. Understanding the Difference: EVM vs. RISC-V To appreciate the significance of this proposal, it helps to understand the core difference between the current EVM and the proposed RISC-V . Both are virtual machines designed to execute code in a sandboxed environment, but they differ fundamentally in their instruction sets and design philosophies. Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) RISC-V Architecture Type Stack-based Register-based (RISC – Reduced Instruction Set Computing) Instruction Set Custom, designed specifically for Ethereum Standardized, open-source, widely used in general computing Complexity Relatively simple, optimized for blockchain state transitions More complex but highly optimized for general computation Performance Potential Limited by design; scaling improvements often involve layer 2 or sharding High; designed for performance in various computing environments Developer Familiarity Requires specific EVM knowledge Familiar to developers with general computing background The move from a stack-based EVM to a register-based RISC-V is a technical leap that leverages decades of optimization work done in the broader computing industry. This is a key reason why such significant performance gains are even considered possible. What Does This Mean for Blockchain Scaling ? Blockchain scaling is one of the most critical challenges facing decentralized networks like Ethereum . The current limitations on transactions per second and high gas fees during peak demand hinder mass adoption and the development of complex decentralized applications (dApps). While Layer 2 solutions like rollups are currently the primary strategy for scaling, improving the base layer’s execution capacity could significantly enhance the overall scalability picture. A 100x increase in execution capacity at the base layer, as proposed by Vitalik Buterin with the RISC-V shift, wouldn’t necessarily mean 100x more transactions directly on Layer 1 overnight. However, it could: Enable more complex and gas-intensive operations to run more efficiently on Layer 1. Potentially reduce the computational cost of Layer 2 operations that settle on Layer 1. Provide a stronger foundation for future scaling technologies. Make Layer 1 more viable for certain types of applications that are currently priced out. This proposal is a long-term vision for achieving sustainable, high-throughput blockchain scaling directly on the main network, complementing the ongoing work on Layer 2 solutions. Is This Upgrade Happening Soon? While the proposal is exciting, it’s crucial to note that this is still in the early discussion stages. Vitalik Buterin himself indicated that preparing for such a significant architectural shift could take around 18 months. This involves extensive research, development, testing, and community consensus. Replacing the core execution engine of a multi-billion dollar, globally distributed network is no small feat. It would require careful planning to ensure compatibility, security, and a smooth transition for existing applications and users. The potential challenges include: Complexity of Transition: Migrating existing smart contracts and infrastructure from the EVM to a RISC-V based environment would be a massive undertaking. Security Audits: A new execution environment introduces new potential vulnerabilities that would require rigorous auditing. Tooling and Ecosystem Development: A new ecosystem of development tools, debuggers, and libraries would need to be built or adapted for the RISC-V execution layer. Community Consensus: Like all major Ethereum upgrades, this would require broad support from the core developers, researchers, validators, and the wider community. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits outlined by Vitalik Buterin make this proposal a significant topic of discussion within the Ethereum community. It represents a bold vision for addressing the network’s long-term scalability and efficiency needs. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Ethereum ‘s High-Performance Future Vitalik Buterin ‘s proposal to explore replacing the EVM with RISC-V is a testament to Ethereum ‘s commitment to continuous improvement and innovation. While still a long-term prospect requiring significant development and community alignment, the potential benefits – including a dramatic increase in execution capacity, reduced costs, and broader developer appeal – could solidify Ethereum ‘s position as a leading platform for decentralized applications and drive significant advancements in blockchain scaling . This ambitious vision underscores the dynamic nature of blockchain technology and the ongoing efforts to build a more efficient, accessible, and scalable decentralized future.

Dogecoin has spearheaded a meme coin revolution, and Chainlink now boasts a reputation for being one of the most popular smart contract networks. Polkadot has also come a long way as an open-source blockchain platform. However, a new wave of emerging tokens, such as Remittix’s (RTX) , is taking center stage. RTX’s ongoing presale has grabbed the attention of investors who have raised over $15.6 million in a brief spell. Can RTX surpass DOGE, LINK and DOT this season? Dogecoin dips 14% as bullish sentiment wanes Dogecoin’s price has shed nearly 15% of its previous gains in the last 30 days, signaling a pullback after Dogecoin’s surge to highs of $0.24. This rebound is backed by a descending support triangle that is now forming, albeit with a rising macro trendline. At its current price of $0.19, DOGE is showing signs of strength for a long-term uptick despite the recent pullback. With DOGE’s price approaching a zone that could trigger serious buy-side interest, onlookers anticipate an uptick if the bulls hold support. Image Source: Coinmarketcap Chainlink confirms breakout despite an 11% pullback Just like Dogecoin, Chainlink has seen its price dip of around 21% in the last month despite clear signals of a breakout forming at the $15.36 barrier. Chainlink saw its price surge from lows of $12.93 to highs above $15, but only a consolidative pattern ensued as LINK failed to hold support above $15. Image Source: Coinmarketcap Currently priced at around $13.54, LINK’s bullish sentiment is buoyed by recent enhancements that could see Chainlink become the main chain for the Hong Kong-Australia pilot CBDC project . Chainlink has also partnered with banks around the world to integrate a decentralized oracle for financial compliance. Could these advancements re-ignite a bullish uprising for LINK? Polkadot’s price plummets after SEC delays ETF approval The bearish wave sweeping across legacy altcoins has not spared DOT, whose price has dipped 16.3% in the last month, adding to an annual downturn of over 35%. Previously, DOT was on the rise, with its price surging to highs of $10 at the tail end of 2024. As 2025 began, DOT’s pullback saw its price rebound around the $3.2 mark. Anticipation for a favorable SEC decision concerning DOT ETFs brought about a wave of excitement, although short-lived. The SEC’s decision to delay DOT’s ETF approval could spell more doom, leading to a prolonged downturn. Remittix’s RTX presale set to surpass DOT , LINK and DOGE While legacy altcoins struggle to regain previous popularity, emerging tokens such as Remittix’s RTX are taking center stage. Remittix is reinventing cross-border payments with a service that enables crypto holders to send funds directly from their crypto wallet to a recipient’s bank account. The entire process obscures the complexities of crypto wallet making it easy for recipients anywhere in the world to receive funds across 30+ fiat currencies. Remittix is on track to lead a potential $250 trillion remittance market thanks to its PayFi platform’s speedy and affordable transactions. While the likes of XRP and XLM focus on institutions, Remittix facilitates near-instant crypto-to-fiat transactions for both individual users and small businesses, leading expert analysts to predict a 3,00% uptick for RTX at launch.

Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, is reportedly taking a significant step into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Sources indicate that Coinbase is planning a major Coinbase DEX integration directly into its popular mobile application. This move aims to bring the power of decentralized trading closer to millions of users, potentially reshaping how people interact with DeFi on their smartphones. What is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX)? Before diving into the specifics of the DEX on Coinbase , let’s quickly touch upon what a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is. Unlike centralized exchanges (CEX) like Coinbase itself, DEXs operate directly on a blockchain. This means: No Intermediary: Trades happen peer-to-peer using smart contracts. User Control: Users retain custody of their private keys and assets throughout the trading process. Transparency: All transactions are recorded on the public ledger of the blockchain. Wide Asset Range: Often lists a broader range of tokens, especially newer or smaller cap ones, compared to CEXs. Think of it this way: a CEX is like a traditional bank or stockbroker holding your assets, while a DEX is more like a direct peer-to-peer marketplace where you trade directly from your own wallet. Why is Coinbase Integrating a DEX? This reported Coinbase DEX integration is a fascinating development. Coinbase has historically been a gateway for retail users into crypto through its centralized platform. By adding a DEX, they are essentially bridging the gap between the centralized and decentralized worlds. Here are a few potential reasons and benefits: Meeting User Demand: Many crypto users are increasingly exploring DeFi for staking, yield farming, and accessing a wider variety of tokens. Integrating a DEX makes these activities more accessible within a familiar interface. Leveraging the Base Ecosystem: The initial integration is planned to support trading on Coinbase’s own Base blockchain . This move will significantly boost activity and liquidity on Base, attracting more developers and users to their layer-2 network. Expanding Revenue Streams: While DEXs typically have lower fees than CEXs, facilitating trading activity within their app could generate revenue through various means, such as integrating with specific DEX protocols or potentially offering enhanced features. Staying Competitive: As the crypto landscape evolves, centralized platforms need to adapt. Offering access to DeFi capabilities helps Coinbase remain a comprehensive platform for all types of crypto users. Onboarding DeFi Users: Millions of Coinbase users who might find navigating separate DEX interfaces complex could easily try decentralized trading within the app they already use. Initial Focus: The Base Blockchain The report specifies that the initial DEX support will be for trading on the Base blockchain . Base is a Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution built by Coinbase, designed to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications. Focusing on Base first makes strategic sense: It allows Coinbase to dogfood its own network, drive adoption, and ensure a smooth user experience within a controlled environment before potentially expanding to other chains. Trading on Base is generally faster and cheaper than on the Ethereum mainnet, offering a better entry point for users new to DEX trading. While the initial focus is on Base, the plan is to support other blockchains in the future. This indicates a long-term vision of making Coinbase a hub for accessing decentralized liquidity across multiple networks, further solidifying its position as a leading Crypto Mobile App . What Does This Mean for Users? For the average Coinbase user, this integration could be a game-changer. Accessing a Decentralized Exchange often requires setting up external wallets, bridging assets, and navigating unfamiliar interfaces. Bringing this functionality directly into the Coinbase app simplifies the process significantly. Imagine being able to trade tokens available on Uniswap or other DEXs operating on Base directly from your Coinbase account, without leaving the app. However, it’s important to remember that using a DEX still comes with responsibilities and risks inherent to DeFi: Benefits for Users: Simplified Access: Trade directly from your Coinbase wallet interface. Wider Token Selection: Access tokens typically found only on DEXs. Potential for Lower Fees: Trading on L2s like Base is generally cheaper than Ethereum mainnet. Non-Custodial Trading: Maintain control of your assets during the trade (assuming the integration uses a non-custodial method within the app). Potential Challenges and Considerations: User Experience Complexity: While simplified, DEX interfaces and concepts (like slippage, gas fees on L2s) can still be more complex than CEX spot trading. Security Risks: Smart contract risks and potential vulnerabilities on the DEX protocol itself remain. Liquidity: While Base is growing, liquidity for certain pairs might be lower than on major CEXs initially. Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for DEXs is still evolving, which could impact how these features are offered globally. Learning Curve: Users new to DeFi will still need to understand concepts like transaction signing and network fees. Coinbase will likely need to provide clear educational resources within the app to guide users safely through their first DEX trades. Coinbase’s Strategy: Bridging CeFi and DeFi This move is part of a broader trend where centralized crypto companies are embracing decentralized technologies. By integrating a Decentralized Exchange , Coinbase isn’t just adding a feature; it’s acknowledging the growing importance of DeFi and positioning itself as a bridge between the two worlds. This strategy could attract DeFi natives who also use CEXs and introduce CEX users to the possibilities of decentralization. Examples of this trend include other platforms adding DeFi features or building their own blockchain networks. Coinbase’s approach, focusing initially on their Base blockchain , allows them to control the core experience while tapping into the decentralized ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Users and Developers For Users: Keep an eye out for official announcements from Coinbase regarding the DEX feature rollout. Educate yourself on how DEXs work, including concepts like liquidity pools, slippage, and network fees (gas). Start exploring the Base ecosystem if you’re interested in getting ahead. Understand the difference between custodial (CEX) and non-custodial (DEX) trading within the app’s implementation. For Developers on Base: This integration could bring significant new user traffic to protocols built on Base. Ensure your DApps are robust, secure, and provide a good user experience, anticipating potential influx from Coinbase users. Explore ways to integrate or be discoverable within the new Coinbase DEX interface (if applicable). The Future of the Crypto Mobile App The integration of a Decentralized Exchange into a major Crypto Mobile App like Coinbase signals a maturing market. It suggests that the future of crypto access might involve seamless transitions between centralized services for ease of use and decentralized protocols for control and innovation, all within a single application interface. As Coinbase plans to support other blockchains, its mobile app could become a universal portal to various DeFi ecosystems. This move could accelerate mainstream adoption of DeFi by lowering the technical barrier to entry for millions of users. It highlights the increasing demand for decentralized services and the willingness of major players to adapt their models. In Conclusion The reported Coinbase DEX integration is a monumental development. By bringing a Decentralized Exchange onto its platform, starting with the Base blockchain , Coinbase is poised to introduce a vast user base to the world of decentralized trading. While challenges related to user education and interface complexity remain, the potential benefits in terms of access to a wider range of assets and participation in the growing Base ecosystem are significant. This step reinforces Coinbase’s position as a leading Crypto Mobile App and represents a key moment in the convergence of centralized and decentralized finance. It’s a revolutionary step that could redefine mobile crypto trading for years to come.

These issues erode trust, inflate costs and hinder innovation. DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), powered by blockchain technology, offer a transformative approach to addressing these problems by fostering transparency, patient empowerment and community-driven governance. This article explores how DAOs could reshape healthcare, diving into their mechanics, applications, real-world examples, challenges and future potential. What are DAOs DAOs are entities governed by smart contracts – self-executing code on a blockchain – rather than traditional hierarchical management. DAOs operate without centralized control, relying instead on token-based voting systems where stakeholders (token holders) collectively make decisions. These tokens represent voting power or ownership in the DAO, ensuring democratic governance. Key features of DAOs include the following. Transparency – All transactions and decisions are recorded on an immutable blockchain, publicly verifiable by all members. Decentralization – No single entity controls the organization, reducing risks of corruption or mismanagement. Automation – Smart contracts enforce rules and execute decisions, minimizing human error and bureaucracy. Community governance – Stakeholders vote on proposals, from funding allocation to operational changes, aligning incentives. In healthcare, these characteristics make DAOs uniquely suited to tackle systemic issues by empowering patients, providers and researchers to collaborate in a trustless, transparent ecosystem. Addressing healthcare’s core challenges with DAOs Transparent medical research funding Medical research, particularly pharmaceutical development and clinical trials, often suffers from opaque funding processes and conflicts of interest. Funding decisions may prioritize profit over patient needs, and lack of transparency can erode public trust. DAOs offer a solution by decentralizing and democratizing research funding. Crowdsourced funding – DAOs allow stakeholders – patients, researchers, healthcare providers or even the public – to pool resources and vote on which research projects to fund. This ensures funding aligns with community priorities, such as rare disease research or underserved populations. Immutable accountability – All funding decisions and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making it impossible to manipulate or hide allocations. This transparency builds trust and ensures funds are used as intended. Accelerated innovation – By involving diverse stakeholders, DAOs can prioritize innovative projects that might be overlooked by traditional funding bodies, potentially speeding up breakthroughs in treatments or diagnostics. For example, a DAO could enable patients with a specific condition to fund research directly, ensuring their needs are addressed while giving researchers access to a transparent funding pool. Patient data ownership and privacy Fragmented patient data is a major barrier to efficient healthcare. EHRs (electronic health records) are often siloed across providers, making it difficult for patients to control or share their data. This fragmentation hampers care coordination and limits the data available for research. DAOs can empower patients through decentralized data management. Patient-centric data control – Using blockchain, DAOs can create secure, decentralized platforms where patients own their medical data. Patients can grant or revoke access to specific providers, researchers or institutions via smart contracts, ensuring explicit consent. Enhanced privacy and security – Blockchain’s cryptographic protocols protect sensitive health data, reducing risks of breaches common in centralized systems. Patients can share anonymized data for research without compromising privacy. Data monetization and research – DAOs can facilitate data marketplaces where patients voluntarily contribute anonymized data to research initiatives in exchange for tokens or other incentives. This fuels data-driven discoveries while rewarding patients for their contributions. For instance, a patient could use a DAO to share their genetic data with a research institute studying cancer, receiving tokens in return while maintaining control over who accesses their information. Decentralized health insurance models Traditional health insurance systems are plagued by high administrative costs, opaque claims processes and slow payouts. DAO-based insurance models can streamline operations and enhance fairness. Community-driven pools – DAOs can create peer-to-peer insurance pools where members contribute premiums (in tokens or cryptocurrency) and vote on claims. Smart contracts automate payouts based on predefined criteria, reducing overhead and delays. Transparency in claims – All claims and payouts are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring members can verify fairness and track fund usage. Lower costs – By eliminating intermediaries like insurance companies, DAOs reduce administrative fees, making coverage more affordable and accessible, particularly for underserved communities. A DAO-based insurance model could, for example, provide affordable coverage for chronic disease management, with members collectively deciding coverage terms and claims criteria. Community-driven health initiatives Healthcare needs vary widely across communities, yet centralized systems often fail to address localized priorities. DAOs enable grassroots health initiatives by empowering communities to pool resources and make decisions. Localized funding – Communities can create DAOs to fund local health projects, such as building clinics, supporting mental health programs, or providing vaccinations in underserved areas. Incentive alignment – DAOs align incentives by giving community members a stake in outcomes. For example, a DAO could reward participants for preventive health measures, like regular checkups, with tokens redeemable for services. Global collaboration – DAOs can connect communities worldwide, enabling knowledge-sharing and resource pooling for global health challenges, such as pandemics or climate-related health crises. A rural community, for instance, could establish a DAO to fund a mobile clinic, with residents voting on its services and operations to ensure it meets local needs. Real-world examples of healthcare DAOs Several projects are already exploring DAO applications in healthcare, demonstrating their potential, including the following. Healthereum – This platform uses blockchain and DAO principles to enhance patient engagement. Patients receive tokens for adhering to treatment plans or attending appointments, incentivizing proactive health management. Providers benefit from streamlined workflows and transparent patient interactions. Robomed network – This DAO integrates blockchain to automate healthcare processes, such as patient-provider agreements and care delivery. It aims to improve efficiency and reduce costs through decentralized governance and smart contracts. Molecule – A DAO focused on decentralized biotech research, Molecule enables communities to fund and govern drug development projects. It connects researchers, patients and investors to accelerate innovation transparently. These projects illustrate how DAOs can bridge gaps between stakeholders, creating more equitable and efficient healthcare systems. Challenges and barriers to adoption Despite their potential, healthcare DAOs face significant hurdles. Regulatory compliance – Healthcare is heavily regulated, with strict laws like HIPAA (in the US) governing data privacy and medical practices. DAOs must navigate these regulations to ensure compliance, which may limit decentralization or require hybrid models. Technological complexity – Blockchain and DAOs require technical expertise, which can be a barrier for patients, providers or communities unfamiliar with the technology. User-friendly interfaces and education will be essential for adoption. Scalability and adoption – Blockchain networks can face scalability issues, such as slow transaction speeds or high costs, which could hinder large-scale healthcare applications. Widespread adoption also requires buy-in from stakeholders accustomed to traditional systems. Equity concerns – Token-based governance risks excluding those who cannot afford tokens or lack access to blockchain infrastructure, potentially creating new disparities. Addressing these challenges will require collaboration between technologists, healthcare professionals, regulators and communities to balance innovation with practicality. The road forward The potential of DAOs to revolutionize healthcare lies in their ability to create a transparent, patient-centric and collaborative ecosystem. As blockchain technology matures and adoption grows, DAOs could do the following. Empower patients – By giving individuals control over their data and healthcare decisions, DAOs shift power from institutions to patients. Foster innovation – Transparent funding and data-sharing accelerate research and development, addressing unmet medical needs. Reduce costs – Decentralized models eliminate intermediaries, making healthcare more affordable and accessible. Build trust – Immutable records and community governance restore confidence in healthcare systems. To realize this vision, stakeholders must invest in user-friendly platforms, regulatory frameworks and education to bridge the gap between blockchain’s potential and real-world implementation. Pilot projects, like those mentioned, will serve as critical testing grounds for refining DAO models. Conclusion DAOs represent a paradigm shift for healthcare, offering solutions to inefficiencies, opacity and disempowerment. By leveraging blockchain’s transparency and decentralization, DAOs can create a future where patients control their data, communities drive health initiatives and research aligns with public needs. While challenges remain, the growing interest in blockchain and decentralized governance signals a promising path forward. As DAOs evolve, they could redefine healthcare as a collaborative, equitable and innovative ecosystem, putting power back into the hands of patients and communities.

33767162,[object Object],1749873601,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin As World Reserve? Coinbase CEO Says It’s Inevitable,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-world-reserve-coinbase-ceo/,"Coinbase co-founder and chief executive Brian Armstrong used the company’s annual State of Crypto Summit on 12 June to advance his most ambitious thesis yet: that Bitcoin could ultimately displace the US dollar as the planet’s reference asset. “Bitcoin could be the reserve currency of the world,” Armstrong wrote on X as he retweeted a clip of his on-stage remarks, amplifying words he had delivered only minutes earlier to several hundred policymakers, investors and developers gathered in Lower Manhattan. Bitcoin Could Become The World’s Reserve Currency On stage, Armstrong reminded the audience that money serves as both medium of exchange and store of value, praising dollar-pegged stablecoins for accomplishing the first task “beautifully” while arguing that fiat currencies are failing at the second. “Democracies around the world are really struggling to get their deficit spending under control,” he said, before offering what he called “my crazy little bit-out-there idea.” If public finances deteriorate further, he continued, “I think Bitcoin is going to provide an important check and balance on deficit spending. And if it gets out of control too much, people will flee to it in times of uncertainty. And it could actually end up that Bitcoin is the new reserve currency of the world.” Armstrong’s reasoning rests on Bitcoin’s algorithmically fixed 21 million-coin limit, which in his view provides an external brake on governments accustomed to monetising deficits. The subtext was the United States’ debt load, now hovering near $37 trillion, a figure that has swollen by almost $4 trillion in the last eighteen months alone. Armstrong has been warning for months that such fiscal trajectories, if left unaddressed, could trigger a global flight from sovereign currencies. In January he published a blog post urging Washington to build a “strategic bitcoin reserve,” and in March he joined other industry leaders at a White House for the first crypto round-table. Armstrong’s forecast landed on fertile ground. Only minutes earlier the summit’s surprise keynote—a prerecorded message from President Donald Trump—had underscored how far Bitcoin has travelled from outsider code to headline macro policy. “My administration is working with Congress to pass the GENIUS Act supporting the creation of dollar-backed stablecoins, and we also will be working to create clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and Bitcoin,” Trump declared, calling it “an honor” to be regarded as the first “crypto president.” The White House has already put hard muscle behind those words. On 6 March Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a US Digital Asset Stockpile, directing the Treasury to consolidate forfeited BTC and buy more coins, subject to budget-neutral conditions. Recently, Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets of the White House Bo Hines disclosed that the Trump administration will unveil the architecture of its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve “in short order.” At press time, BTC traded at $104,876.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Brian Armstrong|btc|BTC news|btc price|Coinbase CEO,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-14 04:00:01

This latest movement signals a potential shift in short-term market momentum, with traders increasingly opting to exit positions. While the broader cryptocurrency market has experienced similar pullbacks, Bitcoin’s trajectory is attracting closer scrutiny due to its influence on overall sentiment and market structure. Analysts are looking into how external factors, particularly geopolitical developments, are impacting trading behavior. One such development is the reported military engagement between Israel and Iran on June 13, which triggered sell pressure across high-risk assets, including digital currencies. Amid these events, key metrics on Binance, particularly Net Taker Volume, are showing increased sell-side dominance, suggesting short-term volatility may continue. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as Whale Behavior Suggests Further Upside Binance Net Taker Volume Hits Multi-Week Low Amid Bitcoin Panic Selling According to on-chain analyst Amr Taha on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, Bitcoin’s Net Taker Volume on Binance fell to -$197 million, the most negative reading since June 6. This metric, which compares aggressive selling to aggressive buying, indicates heightened urgency among traders to sell at market prices, bypassing limit orders. The seven-hour moving average (7HMA) has remained in negative territory since June 12, reinforcing the current downward pressure. Historically, such extremes in net taker volume have been linked to local price bottoms, as they often signal panic-induced capitulation by retail and overleveraged traders. Taha highlighted that a similar event occurred on June 6, followed by a 4% rebound in Bitcoin’s price within 24 hours. The implication is that, while aggressive selling may signal weakness, it also presents conditions that have previously preceded price reversals. Geopolitical Shock Triggers Liquidation Cascade, May Signal Local Bottom Taha also pointed to the geopolitical backdrop, specifically the sudden escalation between Israel and Iran, as a major catalyst for recent market behavior. News of the strike led to a surge in liquidation activity, especially among long-leveraged positions. The correlation between the timing of the conflict and the spike in Binance sell volume suggests that traders are reacting to broader market uncertainty, contributing to downward momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rate Flips Again And History Says A Rally Is Around The Corner Despite this, Taha still views these conditions as potentially bullish in the medium term. Heavy selling often flushes out weaker hands, creating opportunities for long-term holders or institutional participants to accumulate positions at lower prices. Taha suggests that while the short-term outlook remains volatile, the current setup resembles previous recovery phases, marked by contrarian buying and reduced selling pressure.

MiCA, which came into force earlier this year, allows EU member states to issue licenses that grant crypto companies access to all 27 member countries. However, sources familiar with the matter say the licensing process has sparked internal disputes among regulators, with concerns raised over the pace and standards of approvals in some jurisdictions. Two individuals briefed on the discussions, who requested anonymity, noted growing unease in private talks about inconsistent regulatory approaches. Malta’s quick approval process sparks debate in the regulatory landscape The supervision of the multi-trillion-dollar crypto industry is at risk. Regulators have repeatedly warned that this industry could lead to fraud, market instability, and illegal financial activities without proper oversight. As a result, MiCA is seeking to bring crypto under the same regulatory roof as traditional finance. However, some people worry that uneven enforcement might weaken its objectives. Meanwhile, Gemini, an American cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is set to obtain a license to trade from Malta, the smallest country in Europe, two people familiar with the matter said. Malta previously granted licenses to OKX and Crypto.com just weeks after unveiling its new regime. OKX said it went through a rigorous application and that compliance is extremely important to the company. The speed at which Malta is granting these approvals has caught the attention of other national regulators who gather under the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). France’s AMF has expressed concern that ESMA’s lack of direct power might result in a “regulatory race to the bottom.” Moreover, a senior regulatory official, who asked to remain anonymous, mentioned worries about accepting licenses from countries with fewer regulatory staff, using Malta as an example. According to one source, ESMA is currently examining Malta’s licensing process, and a report on this will be shared soon. Malta Financial Services Authority officials said that they have four crypto licenses . According to the representative, they can act quickly because of their experiences and the expedited processing they learned over the years. The authority emphasized that its local money laundering regulations are stringent. ESMA chose not to comment on the matter. Coinbase nears Luxembourg license as EU expansion plans accelerate Talks of regulation have gained momentum now that Coinbase is on the verge of getting licenses, allowing it to do business in the European Union. One of the people said that the regulatory debate has intensified with expectations that Luxembourg will soon grant a license to Coinbase, the first US crypto-focused company to join the S&P 500 . While Coinbase had been working on its application for several months, another source said that the size of Coinbase’s intended operations in Luxembourg is relatively minor. Still, Coinbase already has a notable presence in Luxembourg, where it incorporated Coinbase Luxembourg SA in late 2024 with a share capital of €30,000. According to business registry filings, the subsidiary is overseen by four directors, including Caroline Tarnok, Coinbase’s US Head of Financial and Operational Risk, and David Farmer, VP of Products. All directors are currently based in Luxembourg. The company plans to expand its European workforce by at least 20 roles this year on top of its 200 employees across the continent.

Those keeping track of growth trends are now looking beyond just brand names and into real-time performance, functionality, and consistent development. This article focuses on the highest potential cryptos in 2025 that are either already performing well or showing strong indications of future success. With Solana advancing in transaction capability, Kaspa introducing faster mining processes, Bittensor mixing blockchain with AI, and BlockDAG drawing traction through its presale and unique approach, these coins deserve your attention. Let’s explore these four highest potential cryptos in 2025 based on utility, price trends, and upcoming developments. 1. BlockDAG – Gaining Global Attention as Presale Funds Hits $299.6M BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly becoming one of the most discussed names in the crypto space. Its price has jumped from an initial batch rate to $0.0276 in the current batch 29, which represents a 2,660% rise since batch 1. With the final listing set at $0.05, current contributors still have room to benefit. The presale has reached $299.6 million in total, and more than 22.4 billion coins have been sold. Over 1 million users are already active with its mobile mining app. Devices like the X1, X10, X30, and X100 are being used globally, showing the project’s reach. What makes BlockDAG (BDAG) stand out beyond numbers is its accessible mining setup, smart contract support with low-code tools, and EVM compatibility. It has passed CertiK audit checks and is building a user-focused blockchain network. Along with that, the mobile app and competitive referral system called “Buyer Battles” are helping spread it fast. With a US-based sponsorship in the works, visibility is expected to grow significantly. All these factors make BlockDAG one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025 for those looking to enter before full platform rollout. 2. Solana – Performance-Based Scalability Solana (SOL) remains a strong choice for those valuing transaction speed and low fees. As of June 11, 2025, Solana trades at about $156.75 with a market cap of over $70 billion. Its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second while keeping network fees low has helped it keep user engagement even during weaker market phases. Recent upgrades to its system, including fee restructuring and validator improvements, have made it even more efficient. The growing DeFi and NFT ecosystems tied to Solana add to its daily use appeal. Developers continue building on the network due to its scalability and consistent user base. With notable collaborations that link it to financial service platforms, Solana stands tall as one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025, especially for those seeking established performance and future utility. 3. Kaspa – Advancing Proof-of-Work Through Speed Kaspa (KAS) has created its own path by modifying how proof-of-work systems function. Rather than traditional one-block-at-a-time models, Kaspa uses a blockDAG structure that allows simultaneous block creation. This model has boosted its speed without sacrificing decentralization or trust. On June 11, 2025, its price hovered near $0.163, and the market cap was approaching $3.8 billion. The network is energy-conscious and was launched without any pre-mining or ICO phase. This openness and its strong coding base have attracted a dedicated miner community. Its forward-looking scalability and growing developer interest make Kaspa one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025 for those who prioritize transparency and reliable technology. 4. Bittensor – Where AI Joins Decentralization Bittensor (TAO) has taken a unique route by building a decentralized AI model exchange. Its current price is about $343.10 as of June 11, 2025. The system allows developers to train and run AI models within a shared network and earn TAO in return. It supports decentralization in machine learning without needing to rely on corporate cloud models. One strength of Bittensor is that it promotes constant model improvement. Developers join the system to train models that get better through feedback and ranking systems, and TAO acts as a reward tool. As AI tools become more important across sectors, Bittensor has placed itself firmly among the highest potential cryptos in 2025. It opens a new layer of earning for contributors while advancing AI use cases. Final Takeaway! The crypto field is shifting. It’s not only about popularity anymore; tech strength, user growth, and real functionality are getting more attention. Solana keeps the lead on performance, Kaspa offers better mining structure, and Bittensor delivers utility through AI. But BlockDAG, priced at $0.0276 with over $299.6 million raised, is gaining fast traction. Its 2,660% ROI since batch 1, a fast-selling presale, global mining tools, and the upcoming US-based sponsorship add up to a strong case.

The innovative way Cardano works and its rapid expansion present intriguing potential in the cryptocurrency market. Will ADA surge above $5 as expected? Or could you gain more by investing in a different altcoin? Read on to find out how these changes could change the future of Cardano and the crypto sector. Cardano integrates Bitcoin DeFi Cardano has made news by integrating Bitcoin into its DeFi ecosystem. With the Cardinal Protocol, those who own Bitcoin (BTC) can now use Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem directly. This means that Bitcoin’s safety and ability to be traded are the same as Cardano’s ability to be programmed and its smart contract features. Source: CoinBureau on X The integration uses MuSig2 technology, which lets Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) be wrapped and used in Cardano’s ecosystem without the need for middlemen. This method keeps Bitcoin safe and in the hands of its owner and it also lets people utilize it in Cardano’s powerful DeFi apps. The new feature has made Bitcoin more like Cardano’s decentralized apps, which are a key part of DeFi. Experts say that this will get more people to utilise Cardano because it mixes Bitcoin and Cardano in a way that hasn’t been done before. This connection lets those who own Bitcoin join Cardano’s developing ecosystem without giving up their Bitcoin. Experts tip ADA price to eclipse $5 in 2025 Many experts believe that ADA, Cardano’s native token, might achieve new highs in 2025 now that Bitcoin is part of Cardano’s DeFi. Some predictions suggest that the price could increase significantly, potentially reaching $5 by the end of 2025. ADA is more appealing to investors since it links Bitcoin’s liquidity to Cardano’s ecosystem. ADA is a popular choice for people who want long-term growth because of its unique consensus method and its platform that can grow and use less energy. ADA’s price could surge due to the momentum from Bitcoin’s integration into Cardano. Source: Coinglass via CoinCentral Analysts are sure that Cardano will have a great year in 2025. ADA’s value could increase significantly with the Bitcoin DeFi integration, potentially surpassing $5, which has never been achieved before. Experts believe Remittix has a higher growth rate than ADA While Cardano’s future looks promising with Bitcoin DeFi, some experts believe that Remittix, a new altcoin, could experience higher growth rates than ADA in the coming years. Remittix aims to revolutionize cross-border payments by offering a platform where users can send crypto directly to bank accounts in fiat currency. Remittix has already raised over $15.6 million in its presale, showing strong investor interest. Many view Remittix as a solution to the pain points that traditional financial systems and even Bitcoin face in everyday transactions. As Remittix continues to develop, it could offer more immediate utility than ADA. While ADA focuses on long-term development with its smart contract system, Remittix has already begun making waves in the real-world market. This practical utility could drive demand for the token, making it a strong contender for growth. Experts are particularly excited about Remittix’s potential to disrupt the payments market. Suppose the project can execute its goals and capture the attention of businesses and consumers. Conclusion Cardano’s integration of Bitcoin into its DeFi ecosystem is an exciting new step that could potentially push the price of ADA above $5 by 2025. The Cardinal Protocol’s technology has made Bitcoin and Cardano more important in decentralised finance. Cardano is now a major participant in this field. However, Remittix has considerable room to expand, and it may become a more effective version of ADA by providing investors and customers with real-world use cases that they can relate to. While ADA and Remittix have good chances of growth as the cryptocurrency world evolves, experts expect Remittix to guarantee a higher ROI than ADA.

In a joint move, Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have asked a New York court to release $125 million in escrow funds, marking the end of a long fight. Meanwhile, XRP is no longer seen as a security in the secondary market, giving a boost to XRP price , which is now trading around $2.15. Joint Filing By Ripple & SEC What started in December 2020 as a case in which the U.S. SEC first sued Ripple, accusing the firm of raising $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP sales. Now, after several key rulings and appeals, both Ripple and the SEC have come to a final agreement. According to their joint filing , $50 million from the escrow account will go to the SEC as a civil penalty, while Ripple will receive the remaining $75 million, pending court approval. In their letter to the court, the parties said this move avoids further appeals and officially brings the lengthy lawsuit to a close. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Ripple About to Dominate Stablecoins with USDC on XRPL? , XRP’s Legal Status Now Clear This motion follows Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 ruling , which clarified that XRP is not a security when traded on secondary markets. That judgment gave Ripple and the broader crypto industry a huge boost in credibility. However, the court had also found that early XRP sales to institutional investors did qualify as securities. Even Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed the SEC’s decision to drop its appeal, calling it a “milestone moment” for the entire industry. XRP Price Holds Steady Following the news, XRP has shown signs of recovery despite the recent market dip. The token is currently trading at around $2.16, reflecting a jump of 2.45% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, experts see a key resistance at $2.35, with potential upside toward $2.44–$2.60 if momentum builds. On the downside, support lies near $2.05. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This usefulness is what contributes to demand, and analysts believe that XRP may reach $5.70 in 2028, which is a 148 percent increase. In addition, XRP ETFs are on the verge of being accepted, which could trigger a massive price rally, just like Bitcoin enhanced by 136% after its ETF was accepted. The future of XRP is further brightened by increased interest by investors due to the trading of its futures in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Besides that, its use in tokenizing assets such as digital commercial paper indicates an increasing usage. Mutuum Finance presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in phase 5 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.03, a 200% increase from the opening phase’s $0.01.

This follows a strategic hiatus since April, undertaken to stabilize supply and calibrate with market demand . The mint came shortly before the US Senate votes on the GENIUS Act, a bill introducing a federal regulatory regime for stablecoins, on June 17. The timing indicates a strategic play by Ripple to build more liquidity for RLUSD before impending regulation. The blockchain digital payment company stopped issuing its stablecoin in April in hopes that the token would maintain its market standing and they could regulate the circulating asset count. The firm last issued its RLUSD stablecoin on April 25, releasing two tranches of about 23 million tokens. So far, around 425.74 million RLUSD tokens are presently in circulation, per CoinMarket cap analysis. Ripple burned some of its RLUSD tokens in May Ripple’s decision to mint more tokens just before the GENIUS Act vote on June 17 hints at the company’s confidence in the bill’s approval and a bullish stablecoin market . In the last few months, the firm has consistently put effort into checking its stablecoin supply. The platform burned roughly 4 million RLUSD tokens in May, taking them out of the circulating supply. Plus, it stopped minting, striking a balance between supply and demand in the market. The company has also been working on infusing its stablecoins on several platforms. RLUSD has already been listed on several exchanges and financial platforms, including Bitget, Gemini, and Revolut, to enhance its accessibility and utility. The GENIUS Act’s supporters believe it would encourage stablecoin issuance If the GENIUS Act is approved, it would set regulatory frameworks for stablecoins and help provide clarity to companies like Ripple in the stablecoin market. If the bill wins the key vote on June 17, the bill will move to the US House of Representatives, and eventually, the bill may just be passed into law. Nic Puckrin, a crypto analyst, investor, and founder of The Coin Bureau, believes the bill would make stablecoins more mainstream and encourage more companies to venture into stablecoins. So far, Puckrin sees the stablecoin market as a duopoly, mainly controlled by Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT. Puckrin commented, “Since the bill will create a clear pathway for banks and other entities to begin issuing stablecoins. We’ll likely see a flood of them rush into the market at the start.” He added that banks are preparing to create their own tokens, and although not all will succeed, they will expand consumer choice in finding a stablecoin and issuer that fits their preferences. Senator Bill Hagerty, who introduced the bill to the Senate, is urging his fellow lawmakers to vote on it, claiming that without regulation, stablecoin innovation will only continue internationally, excluding America, and they would fall behind in global competitiveness. Puckrin also suggested that Congress is beginning to realize the positive effect stablecoins can have on the nation’s position in the world, as USD backs the majority of stablecoins. He thinks the GENIUS Act may be the answer the USD needs to hold on to global power. Other bill champions have recognized that the legislation may not be perfect but believe that passing it is better than having no stablecoin regulation at all. Bezalel Eithan Raviv, CEO of the blockchain security firm Lionsgate, shares a similar view, saying that having the bill is better than what’s currently being done. Those opposing the bill have argued that it threatens the decentralized nature of crypto and could open the door to corruption, including regulators showing favoritism toward certain stablecoins.

It reveals that Trump earned over $57 million from World Liberty Financial , a crypto firm linked to his family, and holds a huge amount of WLFI tokens. The report also lists several other sources of income, showing just how much Trump is profiting across various ventures. Here’s a breakdown of the key earnings. Trump’s Stronghold In Crypto The disclosure , made public by the Office of Government Ethics, revealed that Trump earned $57.35 million from selling tokens linked to his family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. He also holds 15.75 billion governance tokens, making this one of his biggest income sources so far. Apart from this, last week Forbes reported that Donald Trump’s net worth has climbed to $5.6 billion. Interestingly, nearly half of his liquid assets are now tied to crypto. In less than a year, Trump has made over $1.2 billion from crypto-related ventures alone. Donald Trump is cashing in on crypto. Over the last nine months, beginning slightly before the election, he has stirred up new ventures, new coins, new noise. All of it makes the president money, but how much? (Photo: Jamel Toppin for Forbes) https://t.co/eJWOWiwM8M pic.twitter.com/XsBFINCpa0 — Forbes (@Forbes) June 6, 2025 Interestingly, Trump’s involvement here shows a change in attitude. He was once critical of digital currencies, but now seems to be embracing them, especially when the profits are this high. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Media Gets SEC Nod for Bitcoin Treasury Filing: What Next? , Big Profits Beyond Crypto Apart from crypto, Trump continues to make millions from his well-known real estate empire. His Florida properties—including Mar-a-Lago, Doral, and Jupiter—brought in over $217 million. He also cashed in on his brand name. The disclosure shows: $3 million from a coffee table book. $2.8 million from Trump watches. $2.5 million from Trump-branded sneakers and fragrances. $1.15 million from NFT licensing and royalties. $1 million from collectible guitars. Add to that another $700,000+ from speaking gigs—and it’s clear Trump’s income streams remain diverse and many more. Debts and Legal Troubles Still Loom The filing also lists over $100 million in unpaid real estate loans. Trump is still battling several legal cases, including the $454 million civil fraud judgment and $88 million defamation payout, though both are currently paused due to appeals. Despite these liabilities, Trump’s crypto earnings stand out. They show that even traditional political figures are now diving into digital assets, and walking away with millions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Currently priced at just $0.0781, this lesser-known altcoin is rapidly gaining traction and attracting attention for its speed, user-friendliness and ability to tackle real issues that XRP has yet to address. With both racing toward the $15 mark, the question on everyone’s mind is simple: can the underdog pull off the upset or will Ripple stay on top? Remittix Could Be Your Gateway To A World of Huge Crypto Gains Remittix is quietly gaining recognition as a payment-focused protocol that doesn’t rely on hype to drive interest. Analysts monitoring wallet flows have noticed consistent accumulation by addresses typically associated with long-term holding strategies. These addresses are moving RTX into cold storage, reducing circulating supply and signaling confidence in the asset’s utility. Ultimately, Remittix’s goal is to shake up the $190 trillion cross-border payments market. The project makes it easy to send crypto like Bitcoin or Ethereum and have it show up as real money in someone’s bank account. This transaction happens very fast and without any sketchy exchanges, high fees and long waiting period. Remittix also plays fair with its holders. There are zero buy or sell taxes on the token, so what you earn is yours to keep. The project’s security framework is also robust; Remittix has successfully undergone a full audit by BlockSAFU, alleviating some concerns for investors. The team is committed to long-term success, not a quick exit. If adoption continues at this pace, some analysts argue the current supply structure gives RTX enough scarcity to challenge the $15 mark in 2025. Market depth, of course, will play a huge role, but the infrastructure and positioning suggest the forecast isn’t without merit. Is XRP Set To Touch The $15 Mark Soon? Ripple is back in the spotlight as traders keep a close eye on its price. Nasdaq is preparing to offer bigger exposure through its upcoming Crypto Index. According to a filing dated June 2, 2025 , the American Stock Exchange has submitted a rule change request to the SEC under rule 19b-4. The proposed change would allow the Hasdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ) to adjust its benchmark. This means adding major altcoins like XRP, SOL, ADA and XLM to its portfolio. At the moment, XRP is holding steady above the key support level of $2.14. This price point is drawing interest from XRP buyers, especially as the growing excitement around the potential approval of the Nasdaq crypto index is also boosting momentum for the altcoin. Current resistance levels for XRP sit at $2.50 and $2.94. If bullish trends continue, the price could push toward $3 within the month. Many believe increased adoption and the chance for Nasdaq exposure could drive Ripple to new heights. In fact, some crypto enthusiasts like CW on X , believe that XRP could hit prices as high as $4.5. With such predictions, there is a strong possibility that XRP’s long-awaited target of $10 and even $15 is achievable. Source: Coinmarketcap Conclusion XRP still has significant upside potential, with major catalysts that could drive its price much higher. However, reaching targets like $15 won’t be easy, as it continuously faces market challenges and regulatory pressures.

But some regulators are worried that things are moving too fast. According to Reuters , Gemini, the crypto platform founded by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is about to receive a license in Malta, the EU’s smallest country. This would give them the green light to operate across all 27 member states. This comes shortly after Malta approved licenses for OKX and Crypto.com, just weeks after MiCA came into effect. Malta’s Fast-Track Approvals Face Scrutiny Malta’s fast approvals are raising eyebrows among EU regulators, especially under the watch of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). France’s AMF has warned that weak oversight could lead to a “race to the bottom.” One official even raised concerns over whether countries with smaller regulatory teams, like Malta, can provide adequate oversight. ESMA is now reviewing Malta’s process and is expected to release a report soon. In response, Malta’s regulator said that it has issued four licenses so far, and credited its speed to its past experience and the “in-depth understanding acquired over the years.” Malta’s regulator said it follows strict anti-money laundering rules. OKX also called the process rigorous and said that compliance is a top priority. Coinbase Eyes Luxembourg License Elsewhere, Luxembourg is soon expected to approve a license for Coinbase, the first U.S. crypto firm in the S&P 500. While its team there may be small, Coinbase has 200 staff in Europe, and it plans to hire 20 more in Luxembourg by the end of the year. Luxembourg pushed back on claims that it is being too lenient on crypto. It suggested that other countries might just be trying to win over crypto firms. Notably, Coinbase’s move is seen as a setback for Ireland, whose central bank once compared crypto to a Ponzi scheme. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Czech Opposition Pushes No-Confidence Vote Over $45M Bitcoin Deal Scandal , EU Split on MiCA Enforcement At the centre of the issue is keeping the multi-trillion-dollar crypto market in check. MiCA is designed to bring crypto under the same regulatory standards as traditional finance, but if countries apply the rules differently, it could weaken MiCA’s overall impact. Countries are still divided in the EU over how to enforce crypto rules. There are ongoing talks about giving more power to ESMA. ESMA’s chief Verena Ross wants stronger oversight, but some countries are hesitant to increase their authority. How these early licenses are handled will likely set the tone for how the EU balances crypto growth and investor protection going forward. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It is currently trading at $42.18, up 6.5% in the last 24 hours. It is up 23% this week, 68% over the past month, and an impressive 1200% in the last six months. Its technical indicators show a neutral sentiment with a slightly bullish tilt. Momentum indicators like MACD and Momentum show upward strength, while most moving averages are strongly bullish. Overall, the trend looks positive but cautious. HYPE’s Explosive Growth Hyperliquid has pulled in $64.8 million in revenue over the past 30 days, outpacing major players like Ethereum and Tron. What truly sets it apart is that 97% of its revenue goes into buying back HYPE tokens, directly rewarding holders. But despite its strong fundamentals, there could be a possible short-term pullback around $36 or even $30. After HYPE’s recent move to $44, the unstaking on Hyperliquid remained low. MetamateDaz noted that the holders stayed calm and confident, which is rare during a price jump. Analysts note that HYPE is showing signs of a short-term pullback, and the dip could be a healthy reset after the recent run. With strong fundamentals, even if HYPE cools off, a quick recovery is likely. despite the recent move to $44 on $HYPE The unstaking queue on Hyperliqud remains relatively quiet low convictions holders are running out of tokens pic.twitter.com/BFXLRi9Fi3 — daz.hl (@MetamateDaz) June 12, 2025 Experts predict HYPE could break past its previous high of $43.86 and hit $90.72 by year-end. This is due to the rising platform usage, smart mobile app upgrades, and Hyperliquid’s dominant 70% share in the global DEX derivatives market. Hyperliquid Is Becoming a Major Player Hyperliquid recorded $11B daily volume in late May and recently hit $10.1B open interest. It is now the 5th biggest in derivatives trading and could soon rival top exchanges. Binance recently mentioned Hyperliquid’s performance, which fueled listing rumors. This boosted HYPE’s trading volume by 20%. With growing interest and a fast, low-cost ecosystem, HYPE is quickly gaining traction. Long-Term Price Predictions HYPE may dip to around $32 this month, but the upside remains strong. CoinCodex predicts a rise up to $103 by 2026, with big gains likely by March. CoinDCX is even more bullish, expecting $43–$45 this week and a rise to $85 in 2025, possibly hitting $125 by 2026.

Ethereum Spot ETFs Have Seen 154,000 ETH In Inflows This Week In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the netflow related to the US-based Ethereum spot ETFs. The “spot ETFs” refer to investment vehicles that allow an alternate means of exposure to a given asset. This means that with a spot ETF, a trader can ‘invest’ into an asset without having to directly own it. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this is especially relevant, as the ETFs trade on traditional platforms. Some investors may not want to fiddle with digital asset exchanges and wallets, so the ETFs offer them a familiar path into cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Tron Has Plenty Of Room For A 2025 Bull Run, Risk Metric Signals The option of the spot ETFs is a relatively recent one in the sector, with Bitcoin’s version gaining approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the start of 2024 and Ethereum’s in mid-2024. Below is a chart that shows how the netflows related to the latter’s spot ETFs have looked during the past month. From the graph, it’s visible that the Ethereum US spot ETFs have been witnessing net inflows for the last few weeks, a sign that there has been demand for the coin from the traditional investors. “This week alone, they’ve seen 154K ETH in inflows – 5x higher than their recent weekly average,” notes Glassnode. “For context: the biggest single-day ETH inflow this month was 77K ETH on June 11th.” While the trend has been that of growth for Ethereum, it has looked a bit more mixed when it comes to the number one digital asset, Bitcoin. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin US spot ETFs have also seen positive netflows this week. The scale of the inflows, however, hasn’t been anything impressive, as only around 7,800 BTC has entered into the ETFs. This is above average, but far lower than the highs witnessed in May, when at one point the daily inflow had reached a peak of 7,900 BTC, more than the inflows for the entire current week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet—But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos Last week, the Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed an outright negative netflow, so it seems the momentum has recently just been slower for the asset. In contrast, things have looked much more green for Ethereum indeed. ETH Price While Ethereum has been seeing consistent ETF inflows, its price has still underperformed against Bitcoin over the past day as it has dropped to $2,540, a decline of 7% compared to BTC’s 2% loss.

This bold action suggests a possible fresh chance with even more returns. Could XYZVerse really be the next major breakthrough? What observations he has about it? XYZVerse ($XYZ) price prediction shows a 30x jump possible XYZVerse joined the meme coin market at a period when community-driven tokens still rule speculative trading. The emergence of meme coins such as PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk shows how powerfully community involvement, viral marketing, and strong branding can propel enormous increases. XYZVerse’s potential is much influenced by the general state of the market as well. Lower-cap meme coins are attracting more interest as the altcoin season gets underway. XYZVerse might profit from this wave if it gets strategic exchange listings and keeps community buzz post-launch, since it is still in presale. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Hyperliquid: A New Era of Fast and Free DeFi Trading Hyperliquid is making waves in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). It’s a new blockchain platform built to make DeFi apps faster and more efficient. Unlike others, Hyperliquid has its own Layer 1 blockchain. This means it’s built from the ground up for top performance. A key part of this is HyperBFT, its special system that keeps transactions speedy and secure. One thing that sets Hyperliquid apart is its focus on perpetual futures trading without any gas fees. Traders can buy and sell these futures directly on the platform, saving money and time. Plus, Hyperliquid uses an on-chain order book, which is rare among decentralized exchanges. This means all trades are transparent and can be checked on the blockchain. The team behind it comes from top schools like Harvard and MIT, bringing strong expertise. In today’s market, where speed, low costs, and transparency are crucial, Hyperliquid stands out as an attractive option. As DeFi continues to grow, platforms like this could play a big role in the future of finance. Conclusion Coins like HYPE are good, but XYZVerse stands out by uniting sports fans in a community-driven memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth and becoming the GOAT of all memecoins.

According to an SEC filing dated June 13, the agency “declared effective” TMTG’s Form S-3 registration statement, which the company filed on June 6. This form allows U.S. corporations to register a variety of securities, including stocks, options and different debt instruments. On the same day, TMTG also filed its final prospectus with the SEC. As outlined in the filing, TMTG registered the resale of roughly 56 million shares, along with another 29 million shares tied to convertible notes. These debt and equity agreements involved about 50 investors and generated the full $2.3 billion that the company plans to hold in Bitcoin. The registration statement also establishes a universal shelf, giving TMTG added flexibility to raise funds or issue securities in the future. Despite this, the firm has stated it has “no immediate plans” to sell any securities under the shelf. Chief Executive and President Devin Nunes commented on the filing, saying, “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities.” He further added, “By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our fintech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy.” TMTG’s stock dipped on the same trading day On the same trading day, TMTG’s shares dipped 2.06 percent, closing at $19.52, according to Google Finance data . Stock price of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. Source: Google Finance This move follows TMTG’s May 27 announcement that it had raised $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin, a deal the company had initially denied in earlier reports. Nunes described Bitcoin a financial freedom instrument at that time, adding that Trump Media would keep the cryptocurrency as a key asset. He said, “Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets.” Beyond its treasury holdings, TMTG is also pursuing a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Blockchain analytics firm Arkham noted in a May 28 post on X that “Donald Trump’s company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?” Later on June 5, TMTG filed the launch of a Bitcoin ETF with the SEC, stating, “The assets of the Trust consist primarily of Bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust. The Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of Bitcoin.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/wealth-manager-pretty-soon-there-wont-be-any-xrp-left-to-dca-with-heres-why/,"Matthew Snider, Chief Investment Officer at Digital Wealth Partners, has issued a cautionary statement to XRP retail investors following a significant development involving Trident Digital. The financial firm recently disclosed its plan to build a $500 million XRP reserve, a move that could impact the availability of XRP in the broader market. Trident Digital’s XRP Reserve Strategy Trident Digital, a Nasdaq-listed company, announced its intention to raise $500 million through a combination of stock offerings and financial instruments. The funds will be used to establish a substantial XRP treasury, with implementation scheduled to begin in the latter half of this year, pending regulatory clearance. At present, the firm is engaging with institutional investors and other stakeholders to determine the optimal approach for acquiring XRP and managing the reserve infrastructure. With this move, Trident joins the ranks of other publicly traded companies that have announced similar plans to hold XRP in their corporate treasuries. These companies include Webus International, Wellgistics Health, and VivoPower, among others. Implications for Retail Access to XRP In light of the growing institutional interest, Snider warned that the supply of XRP available for individual investors could face increasing constraints. He highlighted that sustained corporate accumulation could restrict the effectiveness of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) , a method in which investors buy an asset at regular intervals to reduce price volatility over time. Snider’s concern is rooted in the possibility that large-scale purchases by corporations might remove significant quantities of XRP from the circulating supply. If institutional reserves continue to grow, the availability of XRP on public exchanges may decline, limiting opportunities for everyday investors to accumulate the token steadily. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While such a supply restriction could positively influence XRP’s price trajectory, Snider noted that retail participants may be priced out or unable to maintain consistent accumulation. His statement implies that investors considering XRP should act sooner rather than later, before institutional interest accelerates further. XRP Holding Benchmarks Remain Debated As the conversation around XRP adoption intensifies, discussions have also emerged regarding the ideal quantity of XRP to hold for long-term financial benefit. The XRP community remains divided on what constitutes a meaningful amount for personal investment. Edo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, suggests that holding at least 1,000 XRP could be a reasonable benchmark for retail investors aiming to benefit from future growth. In contrast, other voices in the community, such as King Vale, argue that a minimum of 50,000 XRP is necessary to achieve financial success. At current prices, that would require an investment of over $100,000, a threshold many consider unrealistic. This has led to criticism from some community members, including commentator Xena, who argues that such figures are arbitrary and often serve to inflate investor egos rather than offer practical guidance. According to critics, individual investment goals and risk tolerance should dictate how much XRP one holds, not broad community speculation. The announcement from Trident Digital marks another step in the growing trend of institutional involvement in XRP. As more corporations express interest in integrating the asset into their financial frameworks, retail investors may face new challenges in accessing XRP through traditional accumulation strategies. Snider’s warning underscores the urgency for those considering investment to reassess their plans before broader market dynamics shift further out of reach.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Little Pepe is emerging as 2025’s leading meme contender; fast, tax-free, and Layer 2 powered. Table of Contents Shiba Inu’s momentum is slowing: Here’s why that matters Enter Little Pepe: The next meme king is in the womb The verdict: Buy before the meme becomes a movement Nothing captures attention in the crypto world like a memecoin turning rags into riches. Shiba Inu (SHIB) did precisely that, riding a tidal wave of hype, community fervor, and speculative energy to generate jaw-dropping returns. But as 2025 draws near, one pressing question dominates investor circles: What’s the next SHIB? The answer, increasingly clear to those in the know, is Little Pepe , a high-speed, tax-free, Layer 2 meme juggernaut that blends meme culture with next-gen blockchain performance. For those who missed the early days of SHIB, LILPEPE could be a golden ticket to generational wealth. Let’s dive into why this under-the-radar gem is the most promising SHIB replacement for 2025. You might also like: Shiba Inu price outlook: double bottom pattern signals a rebound Shiba Inu’s momentum is slowing: Here’s why that matters SHIB’s recent price action shows a market in limbo. Despite recovering from May’s lows, SHIB has struggled to break above key moving averages decisively. It currently trades just above the $0.000012 support level, but technical indicators, such as the RSI and low trading volume, hint at waning investor conviction. Even worse, SHIB remains trapped below its EMAs, all of which are trending downward. For many seasoned traders, that’s a red flag indicating a potential momentum loss. The window for exponential SHIB gains may have closed. Its community remains loyal, but its utility and excitement are diminishing. This is precisely the environment in which the next breakout coin thrives, and that coin is LILPEPE. Enter Little Pepe: The next meme king is in the womb While most memecoins rely solely on hype, Little Pepe is backed by a comprehensive Layer 2 blockchain ecosystem. The whitepaper positions LILPEPE not as a derivative of the original Pepe meme but as a rightful heir to the throne, a new-age, frog-powered warrior of crypto innovation. Here’s what makes LILPEPE a serious SHIB contender: Ultra-fast layer 2 tech Built as a Layer 2 Ethereum solution, Little Pepe offers lightning-fast speeds and ultra-low fees, all while maintaining Ethereum compatibility. Unlike SHIB, which remains a standard ERC-20 token with limited technical differentiation, LILPEPE is its own Layer 2 chain, capable of handling smart contracts, dApps, and meme magic — at warp speed. 0% tax policy One of LILPEPE’s standout features is its zero-tax trading model. This is a breath of fresh air in a DeFi space filled with stealth taxes and liquidity traps. Every cent you invest works for you: no fees, no games, just pure upside potential. Tokenomics that reward early believers Unlike many memecoins that flood the market with supply, Little Pepe’s distribution is carefully structured. With only 26.5% allocated to presale participants, early backers are protected from oversaturation. Add to that 13.5% reserved for staking and rewards, and what stands tall is a system designed for long-term diamond hands, not pump-and-dump speculators. Massive marketing + community engine LILPEPE doesn’t leave community growth to chance. With 10% of the total supply dedicated to marketing, expect a blitz of influencer partnerships, viral campaigns, and meme warfare. This isn’t a hobby project, it’s a meme empire in the making. Presale advantage: Where 21,830% gains begin With the presale currently in Stage 1 at just $0.001 per token, LILPEPE is at the perfect entry point. Investors who jumped into SHIB early turned $600 into six figures. Now, history is poised to repeat itself, only this time with stronger fundamentals, better technology, and a more precise roadmap. If LILPEPE reaches a $1 billion market cap — a goal openly stated in the project’s roadmap — early presale investors could see up to 21,830% ROI. That turns $600 into over $130,000. Ambitious? Maybe. Impossible? Not even close. Let’s not forget: Dogecoin once seemed like a joke. SHIB was dismissed as a copycat. And PEPE? Born out of chaos, it skyrocketed 100x in under 60 days. Little Pepe has the ingredients of all three, plus actual blockchain innovation. Roadmap that makes sense Most memecoins fumble when it comes to execution. Not LILPEPE. Its three-phase roadmap is both fun and focused: Pregnancy: Strategic presale, key partnerships, and community formation. Birth: Exchange listings (Uniswap, major CEXs), full-scale marketing blitz. Growth: Layer 2 rollout, utility-driven ecosystem expansion, CMC Top 100 target. It’s rare to see a memecoin with a defined path to actual use-case delivery and that’s where Little Pepe rises far above SHIB’s shadow. The verdict: Buy before the meme becomes a movement In crypto, timing is everything. SHIB was a generational wealth opportunity for those who got in before it gained mainstream popularity. Today, Little Pepe is at that same precipice: Early-stage presale, explosive upside, and a viral meme ready to take over the internet. What could be the best Shiba Inu replacement in 2025? The answer is clear: Little Pepe is not just next. It’s better. Before the masses discover it, before CEX listings ignite the charts, and before the memes flood feed, there’s still time. But not much. Claim a share of LILPEPE at the official website before it becomes the next $SHIB. For more information about Little Pepe , visit Telegram and X .

What’s grabbing everyone’s attention is the timing, as the U.S. Senate gets ready to vote on the GENIUS Act , a key bill that could shape the future of stablecoins, on June 17. Does it mean ripple planning for something big? Why Ripple Minted 12M Tokens Now According to the Ripple Stablecoin Tracker Ripple minted 12 million new RLUSD tokens in the last 24 hours. This sudden minting comes after Ripple had paused new RLUSD creation for about a month. 12,000,000 #RLUSD minted at RLUSD Treasury. https://t.co/uVwOFwgZYQ — Ripple Stablecoin Tracker (@RL_Tracker) June 13, 2025 In April and May, they issued large amounts, 38 million in a day at one point, before taking a break to keep the supply in check. It was seen as a move to stabilize the market, giving RLUSD time to settle into its role as a reliable digital dollar. So, why start minting again now? The answer may lie in an upcoming U.S. Senate vote on the GENIUS Act, happening on June 17. This bill is expected to set clear rules for stablecoins like RLUSD. Ripple’s move could be seen as a show of confidence, suggesting they believe the bill will pass, and the stablecoin market will finally get the legal clarity it’s been waiting for. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP and Solana Treasury Plans Are Likely Scams, Warns VanEck , What is RLUSD? For those unfamiliar, RLUSD is Ripple’s own stablecoin, designed to always hold the same value as the U.S. dollar. It’s meant to help people send money faster, trade more easily, and use crypto without worrying about price swings. Most RLUSD tokens live on the Ethereum blockchain, but some are also on Ripple’s XRP Ledger. RLUSD Volume Up by 30% The return of RLUSD minting has already pushed trading volume up by 30%, reaching $179 million in a single day. As of now, RLUSD has a total supply of about 405 million tokens . Around 70% of these exist on Ethereum, while the rest are on Ripple’s chain. If the GENIUS Act becomes law, it could mark a turning point for U.S. crypto regulation , and Ripple is preparing for that moment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This shakeup came after Meta announced it would acquire a 49% stake in the startup. Google planned to spend about $200 million on Scale this year for human-labeled training data, which is needed to train its Gemini AI model. Reuters ‘ sources familiar with the matter said Google has already begun talks with other companies this week, aiming to move much of its workload away from Scale AI. The change comes just as Meta’s investment lifts Scale’s value from roughly $14 billion to $29 billion. Despite the upheaval, Scale AI plans to carry on. Its CEO, Alexandr Wang, and a few employees will move to Meta, while everyone else stays. But losing Google, one of its biggest clients, could seriously cut its revenue. A spokesperson for Scale AI said that its relationships with large corporations and government agencies are solid and that it remains dedicated to safeguarding client information. They declined to address Google’s decision directly. In 2024, Scale AI brought in $870 million in revenue. Sources say Google accounted for about $150 million of that last year. Other leading tech firms are also cutting back One source said Microsoft is rethinking its work with Scale, and Elon Musk’s xAI plans to leave. OpenAI reduced its use of Scale several months ago, though its finance chief recently said the company still uses Scale as one of multiple data vendors. Rival AI developers worry that sending their data to Scale could reveal strategic plans. When companies contract Scale, they often hand over prototype tools and private datasets for labeling. With Meta now owning nearly half the business, competitors fear their research road maps and technical details could be exposed to a chief rival. Most of Scale AI’s revenue comes from services for generative AI firms. It connects these companies with experts such as PhD-level scientists, who work with datasets to “post‐train” models. As AI systems have grown more capable, the need for such detailed human input has soared. Scale also labels data for self-driving car makers and U.S. government agencies, clients expected to stay. Yet its largest income still comes from teaming up with generative AI developers. Rivals gain demand as AI Firms push for neutrality after Meta deal Sources say Google has been diversifying for over a year. Meta’s recent investment has prompted Google to switch all key agreements away from Scale. Thanks to built-in clauses in many contracts, the shift could occur rapidly. This transition opens doors for Scale’s rivals. “The Meta-Scale deal marks a turning point,” said Jonathan Siddharth, CEO of Turing. “Leading AI labs are realizing neutrality is no longer optional, it’s essential.” Meanwhile, some AI labs are choosing to hire in-house data-labelers to keep their information secure. “Many AI labs now want to hire in-house data-labelers, which allows their data to remain secure,” said Brendan Foody, CEO of Mercor, a startup that also offers automated tools to recruit and vet labeling experts quickly.

The revelation comes from his official 2025 public financial disclosure filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on June 13. Holding Billions of Governance Tokens According to the filing, Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in WLFI, which also grant him voting rights within the crypto enterprise. The nature of these tokens and whether they were monetized or simply valued at a high internal rate is not detailed in the document. It simply lists the income as “$57,437,927” without specifying whether the figure stems from token sales, staking rewards, or another method of realization. Massive Fundraising Effort Launched in September 2024, World Liberty Financial has rapidly scaled its capital base. The company raised $200 million in its initial public token sale and an additional $250 million in its second sale. Combined, these rounds brought in approximately $550 million. The firm’s mission is focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions and dollar-pegged stablecoins, aiming to challenge existing financial infrastructure. High-Profile Backers The crypto venture has drawn support from major investors in the digital asset space. Tron founder Justin Sun invested $30 million in November 2024, receiving 2 billion WLFI tokens at the discounted early price of $0.015. Web3Port followed with a $10 million contribution in January 2025. Oddiyana Ventures also participated, though the amount was not disclosed. Trump’s Larger Digital Asset Involvement Trump’s involvement in digital assets extends beyond WLFI. Previous filings revealed his earnings from NFT-based products like the Trump Digital Trading Cards collection. However, the latest disclosure does not show any new income from NFTs. Additionally, Trump maintains affiliations with other crypto-related companies, including CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC. These entities were also included in the latest filing, although they appeared inactive or generated minimal income during the reported period. Official Ethics Statement As per U.S. law, the President’s disclosure must be certified as “true, complete, and correct” and is subject to review by the Office of Government Ethics. This filing adds further clarity on the extent of Trump’s crypto dealings and the financial impact they’ve had in recent months. Conclusion Trump’s substantial earnings from World Liberty Financial highlight his deepening involvement in the cryptocurrency space. With over $57 million reported and a large shareholding in the platform, his crypto footprint could become a significant aspect of his post-presidency financial legacy.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-14 06:51:48

The asset’s price experienced some notable volatility as of late, not just because of the ongoing geopolitical tension but also due to Hoskinson’s latest proposal. Whales Sell CryptoPotato reported at the start of the business week that large ADA holders, those with investments of somewhere between 100 million and a billion tokens, have continued to accumulate. In the span of just 48 hours, they expanded their holdings by 120 million ADA. However, they seem to have changed their attitude once again since then. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez informed that these large entities have disposed of more than 270 million ADA in just a week. In terms of USD value, this stash is worth over $170 million. Whales have sold over 270 million #Cardano $ADA in the past week! pic.twitter.com/SKd94mj99J — Ali (@ali_charts) June 13, 2025 Such big sell-offs increase the selling pressure of the underlying asset and are typically followed by smaller investors doing the same. ADA’s price felt the consequences in the past few days as it plunged from $0.71 to under $0.62 before it recovered some ground to the current $0.636. Some analysts warned that ADA could drop further to around $0.5 if it doesn’t invalidate a head and shoulders pattern that it’s currently breaking down. While the most evident reason behind this price crash could be related to the escalating geopolitical tension between Iran, Israel, and the US, there’s another possibility that involves more internal changes. ADA for BTC? Charles Hoskinson, the brain behind the Cardano ecosystem, proposed earlier this week that the treasury should exchange $100 million worth of ADA for BTC and stablecoins to enhance the network’s DeFi capabilities. The responses were mixed, with some praising the move, while others warned that it could increase the selling pressure on ADA even more. However, Hoskinson was quick to refute these rumors, indicating that there’s enough OTC demand from institutions for ADA to cover any potential pressure. “The belief that Cardano DeFi is improving will offset the sale volume of ADA from a modest divestment (and yes, this is modest.)” This is the madness of trying to do anything with the treasury. People who have never traded large amounts of Ada presume that any trade will result in catastrophic harm to the price, using ChatGPT as the source for their claims.

Related Reading: ONDO To Repeat 2024’s ‘Parabolic’ Run? Analyst Anticipates 130% Rally Soon Bitcoin to Continue Choppy Performance On Thursday afternoon, Bitcoin dropped 5.5% to the $102,000 support fueled by the news of the Iran-Israel conflict. Amid the market pullback, the flagship crypto failed to hold its $108,000-$110,000 three-day range, falling to the mid-zone of its post-November breakout range. Notably, BTC had just recovered from last week’s retest of the $100,000 level, reclaiming the key $106,800 area as support earlier this week. Daan Crypto Trades noted that the cryptocurrency “saw a clear trigger on that retest of the range high,” driven by the headlines of the Middle East turmoil, as it is “still quite a volatile and headline-driven market currently.” Bitcoin took the liquidity above and below its local price range, the analyst explained, adding that it is “already starting to trade more like the choppy (pre) summer environment” he had forecasted. Despite the drop, the analyst highlighted that the range high remains the key level for a larger move up: I think the range high is a key area for the Bulls to hold on to. If not, I think there’s a case to be made for a local high to be put in and for the market to move back further within this range. At this point, I’m fairly certain that if price breaks either the current monthly high or low, it will keep trending that direction for the rest of June (and possibly beyond). However, he suggested investors be cautious until BTC price breaks back above the range high convincingly and holds it as support on the higher timeframes. “Don’t chop yourself up in the next few weeks/months,” he warned. Volatility Could Send BTC To Range Lows Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show highlighted a potential double top pattern forming on BTC’s 4H chart, noting that if the price didn’t bounce from the previous descending resistance, reclaimed a week ago, it could further drop into the mid-zone of its range. According to the analysis, if it loses the mid-range, BTC could risk a retest of the range lows, around the $90,000-$92,000 area. Similarly, market watcher Merlijn The Trader suggested that Bitcoin could fill the lower CME gaps if the war narrative intensifies. BTC opened two CME gaps between the end of April and the start of May, situated at the $92,500 and $97,300 levels, respectively. Nonetheless, the trader considers that this could serve as a discount entry for investors, as BTC “already left higher CME gaps open,” signaling that a rebound to the levels is likely. Moreover, he noted that Bitcoin is displaying the same structure as last year, which could hint at a massive rally brewing. In 2024, the cryptocurrency faced rejection from a multi-month descending resistance following its all-time high (ATH) rally, which set the Range high level. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For Massive Run After $2,800 Reclaim – ‘Up Only’ Ahead? According to the post, after the liquidity grab, BTC broke out of the key downtrend line, was rejected from the range high, and retested the descending resistance as support before a new rally. In 2025, Bitcoin appears to be following this path, currently retesting the descending resistance after the breakout. “If you know the pattern, you know what comes next,” he concluded.

She warned of a potential volatility driven by rising funding rates without a significant price rally. The analysis, shared on June 11, highlights the growing risk conditions emerging within XRP’s ongoing consolidation phase. According to the post, XRP is nearing the apex of its macro consolidation zone, with price trading just above key support levels. Despite this support holding for now, funding rates are gradually rising without confirmation of any meaningful breakout. At the time of the analysis, the XRP perpetual futures funding rate had reached 0.01% per eight hours, a subtle but important metric suggesting increasing leverage on the long side. CasiTrades cautions that if funding continues to rise toward 0.02% or higher while price remains stagnant, a downside liquidity event becomes increasingly likely. XRP Funding Rising, While Prices Stall We’re just days away from the apex of #XRP ’s macro consolidation and price is hovering above support, while funding quietly climbs. That’s a dangerous combo. As of this morning, funding rates are ticking up to 0.01%/8h without any… pic.twitter.com/bjKCYk3PiZ — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 11, 2025 Support Levels at Risk as Liquidity Threatens Longs The core of the concern lies in the disparity between increasing open interest and flat price action. Algorithms and market makers closely monitor these conditions, and when long positions become overcrowded and under-protected, it often leads to a rapid downside move designed to flush leveraged positions. In such a scenario, XRP could test lower support levels. The chart attached by the analyst outlines $2.25 as a critical support zone. A failure to maintain that level would expose XRP to deeper pullbacks, with targets at $2.01, $1.90, and potentially $1.55. These levels align with key Fibonacci retracement zones and past liquidity pools, as shown on the 4-hour chart.

Instead, the analysis suggests that such a liquidity sweep could generate the necessary momentum for a significant breakout in what appears to be an emerging Wave 3 of a larger Elliott Wave structure. The chart illustrates a projected wave path extending from current consolidation toward higher Fibonacci extensions, notably the 1.618 level at approximately $3.77, and ultimately targeting a wave (4) peak above $4.00. Technical Indicators Signal Caution Ahead While the market remains in a holding pattern, the analyst emphasizes that volatility is “nearly inevitable.” Whether this comes in the form of a final downward flush or a direct breakout from current levels, the implication is that XRP’s next major move could define the trajectory for the remainder of the summer. A potential bearish divergence was also noted in the RSI indicator on the lower panel of the chart, further supporting the case for caution in the near term. This divergence, coupled with rising funding and stagnant price movement, forms the technical basis for the warning issued. CasiTrades’ analysis reinforces the importance of closely monitoring funding rates, support levels, and market positioning in the days ahead. Traders are advised to remain cautious as XRP approaches the climax of its consolidation, where the outcome could dictate both near-term corrections and the start of a new impulsive phase.

Buffett, who plans on ending his legendary 60 year tenure at the end of 2025, has placed more than 70% of the firm’s assets into just seven stocks. The stocks reflect Buffett’s time-tested method of handpicking assets for their resilience and consumer appeal – while Berkshire continues to hoard a staggering $347.7 billion in cash. Here’s a look at where the Oracle of Omaha is placing his bets before the curtains on his legendary career close. • Apple ($58.9 billion allocated): Apple remains Berkshire’s top holding, although Buffett has sold more than half of the firm’s stake in the tech giant since 2023. • American Express ($43.6 billion allocated): A bet on the financial giant’s premium customer base and payment network. • Coca-Cola ($28.4 billion allocated): A longtime Buffett favorite with global brand recognition and consistent dividends. • Bank of America ($27.8 billion allocated): A top holding despite Buffett significantly trimming his stake and reducing bank investments overall. • Chevron ($17.3 billion allocated): An energy giant offering strong dividends, aligning with Buffett’s love for reliable cash flows. • Occidental Petroleum ($12.3 billion allocated): Buffett’s longstanding bet on energy continues with this oil and gas leader. • Kraft Heinz ($8.4 billion allocated): Another consumer goods giant and longtime Buffett favorite.

A significant update from UBS, a major player in investment banking, has caught the attention of market watchers. UBS recently shared its view on the GBP/USD exchange rate , predicting a notable move towards the 1.38 level. This forecast offers valuable insights into potential shifts in the Forex forecast landscape, impacting not just traditional traders but also providing context for those navigating the interconnected financial ecosystem. What is the UBS Forecast for GBP/USD? UBS analysts have indicated their expectation that the GBP/USD pair will strengthen, targeting a move towards 1.38. This is not just a random guess but is based on their analysis of various economic indicators, central bank policies, and market sentiment surrounding both the British Pound (GBP) and the US Dollar (USD). A move from current levels towards 1.38 represents a significant appreciation for the Pound against the Dollar. Such forecasts from major institutions like UBS are closely watched because they can influence market expectations and trading strategies across the board. Why Does UBS See GBP/USD Moving Higher? Several factors likely underpin the UBS forecast for the GBP/USD pair. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone involved in currency trading or simply monitoring global economic health. Economic Outlook Differences: Analysts often compare the economic health and growth prospects of the UK and the US. Differences in GDP growth, employment figures, and consumer spending can influence currency strength. If UBS sees relative strength or improving prospects in the UK economy compared to the US, it could support a stronger Pound. Monetary Policy Divergence: The actions and forward guidance of the Bank of England (BoE) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) are paramount. Interest rate differentials and expectations about future rate hikes or cuts significantly impact currency valuations. If UBS anticipates the BoE maintaining a tighter policy stance or the Fed potentially easing sooner than expected, this could favor GBP over USD. Inflation Trends: Inflation levels and how central banks are responding to them play a critical role. Persistent inflation in the UK, requiring the BoE to keep rates higher for longer, while US inflation moderates more rapidly, could provide support for the Pound. Political Stability and Risk Appetite: Geopolitical events and political stability within the UK and the US also influence investor confidence and capital flows. A period of perceived stability or increased risk appetite globally can sometimes benefit currencies like the Pound. What Are the Implications of This Exchange Rate Forecast? For traders and investors, a forecast like the one from UBS has several implications: Trading Opportunities: Traders specializing in Forex might look for opportunities to buy GBP/USD, expecting the price to rise towards the 1.38 target. Hedging Strategies: Businesses or individuals with exposure to both currencies might adjust their hedging strategies based on the expected movement in the exchange rate . Portfolio Allocation: Investors with global portfolios might consider how this forecast impacts assets denominated in GBP or USD. Broader Market Sentiment: Currency movements can reflect underlying economic sentiment. A strengthening Pound against the Dollar might signal positive views on the UK economy or shifting expectations about US economic performance. Are There Challenges or Risks to the UBS Forecast? No forecast is guaranteed, and the path to 1.38 for GBP/USD faces potential hurdles. Market conditions are constantly evolving. Risks include: Unexpected shifts in central bank policy from either the BoE or the Fed. Release of economic data that contradicts the underlying assumptions of the forecast (e.g., weaker UK growth, stronger US inflation). Major geopolitical events that increase demand for safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar. Significant changes in global risk sentiment. Monitoring these factors is essential for anyone relying on the Forex forecast . Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Given the UBS forecast , what steps can market participants consider? Stay Informed: Keep track of key economic releases from both the UK and the US (inflation data, GDP reports, employment figures). Watch Central Bank Commentary: Pay close attention to speeches and statements from BoE and Fed officials. Their words often provide clues about future policy direction, which is critical for the exchange rate . Monitor Technical Levels: While fundamental analysis drives the forecast, technical analysis can help identify potential entry and exit points for trades. Look at charts for support and resistance levels around the 1.38 target. Manage Risk: If trading based on this forecast, use appropriate risk management tools like stop-loss orders. Consider the Broader Context: Understand how this specific currency forecast fits into the larger global macroeconomic picture and how it might indirectly affect other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Engaging in currency trading requires careful analysis and risk management. Conclusion: Navigating the Path to 1.38 The UBS forecast for GBP/USD targeting 1.38 highlights a potentially significant shift in this major currency pair. Driven by expectations around economic performance and central bank policies in the UK and US, this outlook provides a roadmap for traders and investors. While challenges exist, staying informed about economic data, central bank actions, and market sentiment will be key to navigating the potential move in the exchange rate .

For those in the cryptocurrency space, while focus often remains on digital assets, recognizing broader macro trends, particularly in the currency market , is crucial. These trends can indirectly influence investor sentiment and capital flows across various asset classes. A recent highlight gaining attention is the reiterated UBS forecast for the EUR/USD forecast pair, suggesting continued upward momentum. What is Driving the UBS EUR/USD Forecast? Major financial institutions like UBS employ extensive research teams to analyze a multitude of factors influencing currency valuations. Their positive outlook on the Euro US Dollar pair isn’t pulled from thin air; it’s based on a rigorous assessment of economic indicators, central bank policies, and geopolitical developments. Understanding these drivers is fundamental for anyone involved in Forex trading . Several core elements typically underpin a bullish view on EUR/USD: Monetary Policy Divergence: Central banks, specifically the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed), play a pivotal role. If UBS anticipates the ECB maintaining a relatively tighter stance or the Fed signaling potential easing sooner or more aggressively, this can strengthen the Euro against the Dollar. Interest rate differentials are a primary driver of short-to-medium term currency flows. Higher relative interest rates in the Eurozone would attract capital, boosting the Euro’s value. Conversely, expectations of Fed rate cuts tend to weaken the Dollar. Analyzing the nuances of their forward guidance and reaction functions to inflation and growth data is critical. Economic Performance: The relative health and growth trajectories of the Eurozone and US economies are key. If the Eurozone economy shows signs of resilience or improvement compared to the US, or vice versa, it impacts currency strength. Stronger economic data points, such as GDP growth, employment figures, and manufacturing indices, can bolster confidence in a currency. UBS’s analysis likely weighs these relative performances and their potential future paths. Inflation Dynamics: How inflation evolves in both regions is closely watched by central banks. If inflation proves stickier in the Eurozone than the US, or if disinflation proceeds faster in the US, it can influence policy expectations and thus currency valuations. Central banks are mandated to maintain price stability, and their actions to combat or manage inflation directly impact interest rate policy. Capital Flows and Investor Sentiment: Global risk sentiment and capital flows into or out of the Eurozone and US assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) can significantly impact the currency market . If global investors perceive greater opportunities or stability in the Eurozone, increased investment can drive up demand for the Euro. Geopolitical stability, trade relations, and overall market confidence all play a part in directing these flows. Fiscal Policies: Government spending, taxation, and debt levels in both the Eurozone member states and the US can also have an impact. Sustainable fiscal policies and manageable debt levels can enhance a country’s economic stability and currency appeal. Navigating the Currency Market: What Does This Mean for Traders? A positive EUR/USD forecast from a major institution like UBS provides a potential directional bias for traders. However, it’s not a guarantee. For those engaged in Forex trading , this outlook suggests considering strategies that benefit from a rising EUR/USD pair. This primarily involves taking long positions (buying Euro, selling Dollar). Here are some implications and considerations: Opportunity Identification: Traders might look for entry points to buy EUR/USD, perhaps on dips or pullbacks, anticipating the pair will trend higher towards targets potentially outlined by UBS. Risk Management: No forecast is infallible. Implementing robust risk management techniques, such as setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the market moves against the forecast, is paramount. Position sizing should also be carefully considered based on capital and risk tolerance. Confirmation with Other Analysis: Relying solely on one forecast is risky. Traders often combine institutional forecasts with their own technical and fundamental analysis. Looking for chart patterns, key support/resistance levels, and confirming economic data releases can strengthen a trading plan. Understanding Volatility: The Euro US Dollar pair is the most traded currency pair globally, known for its liquidity but also subject to significant volatility around major economic news releases and central bank announcements. Traders must be prepared for potential sharp movements. Understanding the potential benefits of a rising EUR/USD involves recognizing the profit potential from long positions. The challenge lies in timing entries and exits effectively and managing the inherent market volatility and the risk that the forecast may not materialize. Can the UBS Forecast Be Wrong? Exploring Challenges Absolutely. Even the most sophisticated models and experienced analysts can be incorrect. The future is inherently uncertain, and unforeseen events can rapidly alter market dynamics. Several factors could challenge or invalidate a bullish EUR/USD forecast : Unexpected Economic Data: A sudden downturn in Eurozone economic indicators or a surprisingly strong resurgence in US data could shift the narrative and central bank expectations. For example, persistently high US inflation could force the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, supporting the Dollar. Conversely, a sharp recession in the Eurozone would likely weaken the Euro. Central Bank Policy Shifts: Central banks might pivot faster or slower than anticipated based on evolving data. A hawkish surprise from the Fed or a dovish turn from the ECB would directly contradict the conditions favoring a stronger Euro. Geopolitical Shocks: Major global events, such as conflicts, political instability in key regions, or unexpected policy decisions by major economies, can trigger risk-off sentiment, often benefiting safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar, regardless of fundamental forecasts for pairs like the Euro US Dollar . Market Sentiment Swings: Broad shifts in investor confidence or risk appetite can override fundamental drivers in the short term. Therefore, while the UBS forecast provides a valuable perspective, it’s crucial for those involved in Forex trading to remain adaptable and monitor incoming information constantly. Actionable Insights for the Euro US Dollar Trader For those looking to potentially act on the UBS forecast for EUR/USD forecast , here are some actionable steps: Educate Yourself: Deepen your understanding of the economic factors driving the currency market , particularly those specific to the Eurozone and the US. Follow economic calendars and central bank communications closely. Develop a Trading Plan: Based on your own analysis, decide on potential entry and exit points, stop-loss levels, and profit targets. This plan should incorporate the potential upside suggested by UBS but also account for downside risks. Start Small (If New): If you are new to Forex trading , consider starting with a demo account or trading small position sizes to get comfortable with execution and market volatility before committing significant capital. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor news related to Eurozone and US economics, politics, and central bank statements. Be prepared to adjust your view or trading plan if the fundamental picture changes. Diversify: Do not put all your capital into one trade or currency pair. Diversification across different assets or trading strategies can help mitigate risk. Examples of how traders might use this information include setting limit orders to buy EUR/USD at a specific price level, or using technical indicators like moving averages or Fibonacci retracements to identify potential support areas where the price might bounce before moving higher, aligning with the UBS forecast . In Summary: Weighing the EUR/USD Outlook UBS’s continued positive stance on the EUR/USD forecast signals their conviction that underlying economic and policy factors favor further appreciation of the Euro against the US Dollar. This outlook is likely predicated on anticipated monetary policy paths, relative economic performance, and capital flow dynamics between the Eurozone and the US. For participants in the currency market , especially those engaged in Forex trading , this provides a potential directional cue. However, a forecast, even from a reputable institution, is not a certainty. The path of the Euro US Dollar pair will ultimately be determined by the complex interplay of real-time economic data, central bank actions, and global events. Traders should view such forecasts as one input among many, combining them with their own thorough analysis, rigorous risk management, and a flexible approach to navigate the inherent uncertainties of the financial markets. Whether you are directly trading Forex or simply monitoring macro trends from the crypto world, understanding the rationale behind forecasts like the UBS forecast for EUR/USD forecast offers valuable insight into the broader economic landscape.

This enhanced selling pressure transpired during the darkest hours of the global trade war started by US President Donald Trump. Although that political tension has improved a lot since then, with the US striking deals with many countries, including its main rival, China , there’s more uncertainty that has blown off in the past few days. This time, it’s a lot more harmful and has already taken many lives. Operation Rising Lion, launched by Israel on June 13, targeted more than 100 strategic military and nuclear sites in Iran, including facilities in Natanz and Fordow. The most recent reports suggest that the number of killed is nearing 100, which includes senior commanders and scientists, while the injured list is well above 300. Iran responded with Operation Vow of Truth 3, firing countless waves of missiles last night at central Israel, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and some targets north. The reported casualties are at least three, while dozens have been injured. While Israel and US President Trump categorized the initial strike as “ preemptive ,” aiming to disrupt Iran’s nuclear progress as the country refuses to sign such a deal, Tehran described its retaliation as defending its sovereignty against direct aggression. Impact on Bitcoin As it happened during the trade war, BTC’s price reacted immediately yesterday to Israel’s attack. In a matter of hours, it plunged from a daily peak of $108,500 to under $103,000. It has recovered some ground and now trades around $105,000, and it hasn’t been significantly influenced by Iran’s response. However, uncertainty persists, and the situation could escalate, potentially leading to further trouble. As such, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez warned that bitcoin needs to stay within a six-digit price territory; otherwise, it risks plummeting back to under $80,000. #Bitcoin $BTC needs to hold above $100,000 to stay on track for a breakout from this channel.

As reported earlier this week, some of the long-term BTC investors had started to dispose of small portions of their holdings, but that was even before the attacks occurred. Martinez noted after the first strike that some of the largest BTC whales—those with more than 1,000 bitcoins—have begun “trimming” their positions. If these sell-offs continue or intensify, they will not only increase the selling pressure on BTC but can also be mimicked by smaller investors.

Following last week’s market recovery from a correctional phase, which was majorly triggered by Bitcoin’s bounce, several altcoins with Aero regained strength and posted notable gains after 7 days of buying. Unfortunately, the buying cooled off due to a new sell order days back. That caused a serious reduction in the past days, and the market is now bleeding out again, following a negative sentiment. The bleeding came as a result of Bitcoin’s drops, and as we can see, it has shown no signs of stopping yet. However, altcoin like Aero defies the odds and is now posting gains on the day. It currently appears strong and shows signs of bullishness on the daily chart with a higher high and higher low pattern in the past months. The latest bullish signal is supported by the $0.47 level. If it continues to play out, we can expect a major increase in the coming days. Surpassing the previous high should validate a big price movement in the future. Inversely, if Aero fails to advance higher, a dip below last week’s low could trigger a fresh breakdown to the yearly low before deciding where to head next. For now, the market is still in favour of the bulls. AERO’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The immediate resistance level for buying right now is $0.8. If Aero breaks above it, the next line of resistance would be $1, along with the $1.5 resistance level. There’s room for a pullback at $0.56.

While it enjoys widespread recognition, observers have noted that Dogecoin lacks substantial utility, relying instead on community support and social media hype. Enter Ruvi AI , a blockchain and AI-powered project that analysts believe could rival Dogecoin—not with memes, but with innovation and real-world use cases. With its AI-driven utility, structured growth model, and an impressive ongoing presale, Ruvi AI presents a compelling alternative for investors looking for significant returns without relying solely on hype. Why Analysts Are Comparing Ruvi AI to Dogecoin The comparison between Ruvi AI and Dogecoin is rooted in their potential to disrupt markets. Dogecoin captured attention because of its simplicity and viral growth. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to deliver real-world applications that resonate across industries, making it more than just a speculative purchase. Ruvi AI offers an entry price of just $0.015 per token during its Phase 2 presale , providing early adopters a chance to secure tokens at a fraction of Dogecoin’s current price. What sets Ruvi AI apart is its practical utility, transparency, and built-in growth model. These features appeal to investors who are searching for sustainable and scalable projects rather than fleeting hype. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success and Future Valuation Ruvi AI’s presale numbers underscore its strong market appeal. The project has already raised over $1.7 million and sold 145 million tokens , demonstrating confidence in its strategy. After the presale, Ruvi AI will transition to a price of $0.07 per token , as outlined in its roadmap, and analysts project that this valuation could climb to $1 post-listing . This 66x ROI potential has caught the attention of savvy investors seeking explosive growth opportunities. Maximize Returns With Ruvi AI’s VIP Tiers Ruvi AI encourages early adoption through its VIP tier system , which substantially rewards participants with extra tokens. Here’s a summary of the investment tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These unparalleled bonuses help investors maximize their returns while Ruvi AI’s presale price remains accessible. Transparency and Security Through Strategic Actions Ruvi AI has taken significant steps to promote transparency and security , two areas where cryptocurrency projects often face skepticism. The platform is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a well-regarded blockchain security firm, to enhance investor confidence. This audit will verify Ruvi AI’s infrastructure, ensuring it adheres to industry standards and best practices. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange ensures global liquidity and seamless token trading for investors. This accessibility solidifies Ruvi AI’s reputation as a legitimate and scalable project in the crypto market. Real-World Applications Set Ruvi AI Apart Unlike Dogecoin, which has limited functionality outside of tipping and payments, Ruvi AI integrates AI technology to address challenges in multiple sectors, driving real impact. Key applications include: Marketing: Businesses can leverage Ruvi AI’s AI capabilities to enhance customer targeting, optimize campaigns, and increase engagement.

These industry-relevant applications ensure Ruvi AI’s utility-driven growth and long-term appeal. Why Ruvi AI Is Standing Out in 2025 For investors seeking a balance between innovation and potential ROI, Ruvi AI delivers. Its structured growth , utility-focused model , and transparent approach make it a top contender in a market often defined by volatility. Ruvi AI offers a chance to secure high returns while participating in a project with meaningful real-world applications.

Two of these appointments are experienced in digital assets, a move seen as a strong signal that the SEC is taking a friendlier approach to cryptocurrencies. As of June 17, Jamie Selway will assume the role of Director of the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets. On July 8, Brian T. Daly will begin as Director of the Division of Investment Management. Selway most recently worked as a partner at Sophron Advisors, where he advised on capital markets. He has previously advised a number of financial technology companies and served as global head of institutional markets at the Blockchain firm from 2018 to 2019. “Chairman Atkins is ushering in a ‘new day’ at the SEC. I thank him for entrusting me with the leadership of the Trading and Markets division during this exciting and critical time. We will support the SEC’s mission and drive innovation for the benefit of our investors,” Selway said in a statement.

Daly previously spoke to the Financial Times about the withdrawal of SAB 121 guidance implemented by the Biden administration, which required digital assets to be shown as liabilities on banks’ balance sheets. Daly said that this practice “makes it impossible for responsible banks, brokerages and financial intermediaries to provide crypto custody services,” adding that custody services are essential for financial institutions to provide crypto services. *This is not investment advice.

45985754,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746474,1749886200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45985754.jpeg,3 Altcoins Ready to Pop Before July – Summer’s Sleeper Picks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/3-altcoins-ready-to-pop-before-july-summers-sleeper-picks/,"Amid the heightened volatility in the crypto market, many cryptocurrencies have been experiencing wild swings in price. However, the storms present the perfect opportunity to find promising altcoins that could experience turbo-charged growth in the summer of 2025. The altcoins have the potential to deliver massive wins for holders. The most interesting of them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which analysts forecast could rise 2,765% after it goes live. Let us take a close look at the most promising altcoins of June 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) is a dog-themed meme coin that can be a fun diversion from the serious stakes in the crypto sector. However, it is still up by huge numbers in the past five years. Despite this, past success is not proof of future success with meme coins. Like all meme coins, it is always a toss-up whether DOGE will rise or fall. For more reliable and sustainable gains, you should opt for presale projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that have real prospects for growth. Sui (SUI) SUI is the native token of the Sui ecosystem, which was designed for fast speeds and low costs. It has made some technical achievements that aim to set it apart from leading blockchains. One of the main downsides to Sui is that it is prone to centralization due to its consensus mechanism. Another glaring problem is that Ethereum (ETH) already exists. Consequently, SUI will have a hard time trying to replace Ethereum when it comes to blockchain use cases. Nevertheless, holders can expect some potential gains when they add SUI to their portfolio. However, SUI is already trading at the top of its valuation. Consequently, a better alternative would be a project like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is still on the ground floor. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Real Gainer Of This Summer Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project powered by powerful technical prowess that aims to transform the Defi industry into the powerhouse it was meant to be. The project has at its core a powerful lending protocol and the native MUTM token. On Mutuum Finance (MUTM), users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. When they participate as lenders, they deposit their funds into an audited smart contract and start to earn interest. The interest rate they get on their assets is based on the pool utilization rate. To determine the utilization rate, the protocol measures the assets that are being actively borrowed in the pools against the total assets deposited in the pool. When the utilization rate rises, the interest rate rises, which encourages borrowers to pay back their loans. It also encourages lenders to deposit more funds in a pool, which raises the liquidity of the pool and lowers the interest rate. The Mutuum Finance lending protocol is thus designed to achieve perfect balance on its own, leading to optimal capital efficiency. Borrowers in the protocol can choose between stable and variable lending rates. When they pick the stable interest rates, they have the benefit of predictable repayments. How Liquidity Is Managed On Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Proper liquidity management is critical to the long-term success of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project. To start with, the protocol always vets assets that are added to the pools. That means that the team will first check the volatility, trading volume, liquidity, centralization, and the fidelity of its price data oracles. Depending on the outcome of the betting process, a token may be barred from the protocol to protect the liquidity of the platform, or it could be added in a restricted mode. For instance, some tokens may have a high level of centralization and poor blockchain design that could expose the protocol to infinite minting. That could quickly be used to siphon all liquidity from the pools. If the protocol detects any problems with a token’s price data, all activity for the token is stopped until the code can be carefully examined. This proactive approach will ensure that the protocol does not suffer any reputational damage that has been the death knell of so many protocols in the past. The team will also launch a bug bounty program as a protection measure. These programs will be open to all security experts and blockchain developers, giving them an opportunity to identify and report any vulnerabilities in the system. As such, it will ensure that at any moment, there are thousands of experts analyzing the code independently and nipping issues in the bud before they balloon into a problem. The MUTM Token Presale: Progress Update So far, over $10.6 million has been raised in the ongoing presale, from around 12,000 unique buyers. The token presale is in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. In the previous phase of the presale, the tokens were going for $0.025 and have since increased in price by 20%. The token presale has experienced an acceleration in the current phase, with over 35% of the tokens already sold barely two weeks after it began. One of the main catalysts for this fast pace is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway , where the team plans to give ten lucky winners $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. To participate in the giveaway, you only need to purchase at least $50 in the ongoing presale. A massive giveaway, coupled with the positive analysts’ forecasts for returns of over 2,700%, this is one presale you do not want to miss. MUTM tokens could be your biggest win of the current bull run.

It has been a year marked by new highs and extreme market volatility. Additionally, it has seen an increased rate of institutional adoption of crypto, with a major bank now planning to offer loans backed by crypto. With June promising to be yet another exciting year for crypto, here are the top three crypto picks you should choose. Amongst this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers some of the biggest returns of 2025. According to analysts, it could explode in price by 2,455%. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is a proof-of-stake blockchain built for fast speeds and low transaction costs. Unlike most other blockchain platforms, Cardano uses a peer-reviewed approach to development. One of the downsides of Cardano is that its peer-reviewed approach to development has sidelined most of the crypto industry. It has been slow to release upgrades, and it is too sophisticated for most people to understand. As such, Cardano (ADA) is forecast to grow solely compared to the rest of the crypto market. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM) is a project launched back in 2014 as a means of fast cross-border payments. It is used to facilitate transactions in different currencies quickly. Stellar (XLM) is intended to be a bridge currency between fiat and crypto. One of the main downsides of XLM is that there is no use case outside of cross-border payments. Its use case is also constrained in that it has not been able to compete with the legacy financial system. As such, it has remained a fringe service. For massive growth powered by utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be your best option. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a revolutionary DeFi ecosystem that aims to redefine the financial sector. The protocol is decentralized and non-custodial, and users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders can deposit their assets in the protocol to receive passive income as annual percentage yields, while borrowers can deposit overcollateralized collateral to get a loan. The percentage yield that lenders can earn from a pool is based on the pool utilization rate. Protocol Safeguards For Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has numerous protocol safeguards that are meant to protect all users, ensuring they can continue to make a profit. One of the safeguards is the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, which is a cap on how much users can borrow relative to the value of the collateral. For instance, if ADA has an LTV of 75%, it means that when a user pledges 1 ADA of collateral, they can borrow up to 0.75 ADA worth of a given asset. The effective LTV ratio is always fluctuating in line with the asset price. The other protocol safeguard is the liquidation trigger, which establishes a threshold at which a debt position is considered undercollateralized. If the borrowed amount surpasses the threshold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) considers it unsafe, and it is liquidated. A liquidation is carried out by liquidators, who acquire the collateral for a loan position at a discount. Their actions help to keep bad debt off the protocol and maintain overall ecosystem health. Once a position is liquidated, the borrower is charged a liquidation penalty, a portion of which goes to the treasury, while the rest goes to the liquidators. To determine how much liquidators and the treasury get, an allocation factor is used. It aims to balance between ensuring fast liquidations and protecting the long-term solvency of the ecosystem. Finally, there is a reserve factor, which collects a fraction of the borrower’s interest via the reserve factor. These funds go into an aggregate pool and offset potential defaults due to extreme market events. Tokens with a higher stability are often assigned a smaller reserve factor of around 10%, while those assets that are considered more unstable get a bigger reserve factor of up to 35%. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is currently in phase 5 of the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, over $10.55 million has been raised in the ongoing presale from around 12,000 unique buyers. The current phase of the presale is around two weeks old, and over 35% of the tokens reserved for the phase have already been sold. That signals a high level of participation, much faster than phase 1 when the tokens were going for $0.01. One of the biggest catalysts for this current phase of the presale is the ongoing giveaway. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $100,000 giveaway in which it plans to give away $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens to ten lucky winners each. To participate in this giveaway, all you need to do is participate in the presale with a minimum of $50. With the MUTM tokens expected to explode in price, coupled with this massive giveaway, there is no reason you should miss this opportunity. It could be one of your biggest in the crypto world in 2025, and beyond.

According to reports, the 73-year-old man was first contacted over the phone, with the scammers luring him into making investments in digital assets, presenting an enticing opportunity. However, things did not go as planned, as the elderly man fell into the hands of scammers, losing £14,500 to them. After a while, the man received a call from someone, claiming they could help him get his money back. According to authorities , the caller pretended to be from a genuine financial services company and told the man that they had already traced the funds he lost, noting that there was still a crypto account in his name. Elderly man loses £65k to crypto scammers According to the man, he was at an all-time low around when the representative from the financial services firm called him, highlighting that the caller, calling himself Gabriel, was ringing him nonstop, encouraging him to use their fraud recovery services. “He persistently chased me and chased me,” said the grandfather-of-three. “He even contacted me when I was on holiday in Gran Canaria.” The elderly man said after the calls became disturbing, he had to block the caller, but then, he was still able to contact him using another phone number. “I should have just hung up, but I didn’t. He sounded so professional, almost to the point of being totally arrogant. I ended up believing him,” the victim said. Eventually, the scammer was able to convince the man, pushing him to agree to use his company’s services to withdraw his lost funds, which he said were sitting in a crypto account untouched. However, things were not meant to be, because instead of helping the elderly man recover his lost funds, the crypto scammers carried out another elaborate scam that saw him send over £66,500 from his business account to them between December 2024 and January 2025. According to the victim, he was asked to make payments between £7,500 and £18,500 over three weeks before he could withdraw his funds from the crypto account. Gabriel mentioned that the payments were tied to anti-money laundering regulations and a failed verification process, among other lies he was fed. The elderly man said he received fake emails from a bank and crypto exchange, noting how far the scammers went to make their con appear legitimate. “He said I needed to do this and do that, and I said ‘I can’t keep sending money if you’re not giving me any back’,” the victim said. In January, he was asked to make a final payment of £7,500 and all of his funds will be released, making the first half in a day, and another half the next day. National Fraud Helpline solicitors recovered the funds According to the elderly man, he didn’t get the money on Friday, as promised by the criminals. He even waited to see if he would get it over the weekend, but nothing came. On Monday, the victim said he made a WhatsApp call to Gabriel, and that was when he realized he had been scammed. “So I sent them a message via WhatsApp , very short and sweet, and told him what I thought of him. Then I never heard anything else,” he said. The victim added that he had invested so much in the hopes that he would get his funds back, but didn’t. “I still get so upset about this. It was an extremely worrying time. Mentally, I was in a bit of a mess, but I couldn’t tell anybody from sheer embarrassment,” he added. He said he took out four loans to pay the scammer’s fees, noting that he promised an unsustainable monthly repayment plan totaling £1,250. He added that during his ordeal, his bank never queried any of the payments he made to the firm to check if it was a legitimate financial firm or not. However, luck smiled on him after he contacted the National Fraud Helpline solicitors to help recover his money from Co-Op Bank. NFH was able to recover all his funds, which have now been refunded. He said he was amazed when he got the call telling him about the good news. “I thought I’d lost the lot, I’d rearrange my finances and do what I could,” he said. “Then I saw about National Fraud Helpline solicitors and thought ‘I’ve got nothing to lose’.

He proposed using $100 million worth of ADA to strengthen stablecoin liquidity and bring Bitcoin into the Cardano DeFi ecosystem. Low Stablecoin Liquidity Holds Cardano Back He started off by pointing out that Cardano does not have enough stablecoin liquidity. There is only about $33 million in stablecoins supporting over $330 million in total value locked (TVL). In comparison, Ethereum and Solana have way more stablecoin support, and Cardano is falling behind. “We have a treasury with about $1.5 billion of ADA, and yet there’s only about $30 million of stablecoins in the entire Cardano ecosystem,” he said. “That’s a problem.” Cardano Decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund https://t.co/8RIELNl872 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 13, 2025 Hoskinson Proposes Bold Move- To fix this, Hoskinson is proposing a bold move: take 5–10% of the $1.2 billion Cardano treasury and convert it into a mix of native stablecoins like USDA, USDM, iUSD, and even some Bitcoin to help start Bitcoin-based DeFi on Cardano. The goal here is to generate yield from these assets like a sovereign wealth fund (like Norway or Abu Dhabi) and reinvest the profits back into ADA. This move could boost yields, improve liquidity, and speed up stablecoin adoption on Cardano. It may also help native stablecoins get listed on more exchanges and position Cardano as a strong player in the DeFi space. Will This Hurt ADA? Hoskinson believes that the $100 million move will not hurt ADA’s price. “Hundreds of millions of dollars of ADA change hands daily without visibly affecting the cryptocurrency’s price,” he said. He says that the market is strong and liquid enough to handle it, especially if done gradually using time-weighted average price algorithms and OTC trades. Governance in Progress Cardano is still figuring out how to handle governance. Charles wants the treasury fund plan ready for discussion at the Rare Evo Conference in August. He has already written a 40-page document outlining the idea and shared it with internal teams. Further, the team will gather feedback from Cardano’s DeFi projects and prepare a full proposal, possibly by the conference. Cardano Aims for Cross-Chain Growth and $1B Treasury Hoskinson says Cardano’s treasury will eventually become multi-asset. As more chains connect to Cardano, their fees could also flow into the treasury, building a large, diverse portfolio to support cross-chain growth. If the strategy works out, it could be a game-changer for Cardano. Stablecoin liquidity could rise to 33–40% of TVL, making the ecosystem much healthier.

South Africa’s crypto laws are a balance of innovation and security, as the country prioritizes protecting investors. Now, with new rules and regulations, South Africa is soon to emerge as a crypto leader on the African continent.

Crypto Tax in South Africa Crypto License in South Africa Crypto Adoption Rate in South Africa Endnote FAQs Crypto Regulations in South Africa 2025 May 15, 2025- ( 047643/2023) [2025] ZAGPPHC 481 (Standard Bank vs SARB) Pretoria High Court handed down a judgment in Standard Bank of South Africa vs South African Reserve Bank and others, ruling that cryptocurrencies do not constitute “capital” in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations , 1961. Crypto assets are not subject to a country’s strict exchange control regime, offering long-awaited clarity for the crypto industry. May 6, 2025- Directive 9 for CASP and Travel Rule The approach covers all Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASP) acting as originators, beneficiaries, or intermediaries. It applies to entities involved in crypto-to-fiat exchanges, wallet custody services, crypto assets transfers, and the provision of crypto-related financial services. CASP to implement travel rules in line with FATF recommendations 16; non-compliance can result in administrative sanctions under Section 45C of the Act . April 30, 2025- Travel Rule The Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) mandated this travel rule , which applies to transactions exceeding ZAR 25,000 (approximately US$1,500). Details from all CASPs are required to collect information about the sender and the receiver, including names, account numbers, and identification details, to promote transparency and reduce risks. This aligns with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations aimed at complying with anti-money laundering rules. What is The South African Government Saying About Crypto? The South African government does not consider crypto as a legal tender, but it is actively regulating the industry and recognizing it as a financial product. So far in 2025, its primary approach has been integrating crypto assets into existing financial frameworks rather than creating new legislation for digital assets. The government’s current priorities are: Evolution in the crypto landscape Enhancing the anti-money laundering compliance framework Integrating international standards in the country’s national system Fostering a secure environment for crypto regulations Crypto Tax in South Africa Is crypto taxable? Yes, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) treats cryptocurrencies as “assets of intangible nature,” which are subject to capital tax gains and income tax. Reporting and Penalties: All crypto losses and gains are required to be annually reported; non-compliance can lead to a penalty imposed by SARS. Transaction type Tax type/ Rate Details Long-term investment (capital) CGT up to 18% (on 40% of gain) Annual exclusion of 40,000 ZAR Frequent trading/ business income Income tax 18%-45% Taxed at the marginal rate Company gains Corporate tax 27% (on 80% of gains) Gains exceeding 40,000 ZAR credit Mining, staking, airdrops, DeFi Income tax 18%-45% Guidelines are evolving Buying/ holding/transferring crypto Exempted Not taxable Crypto License in South Africa Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) operating in South Africa are required to obtain a Financial Services Provider (FSP) license from the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA). Crypto assets were considered as financial products by the FSCA in 2019, and since then, the licensing has become mandatory. CASPs must register as “accountable institutions” with the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) under the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA). The licensing involves demonstrating compliance with regulations related to anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT). It requires strict adherence to Travel Ryle. Crypto Adoption Rate in South Africa Users rate: Approximately 10.49% of the internet users are using cryptocurrency, and it is expected to rise to 10.77% by 2026. South African crypto user estimates are expected to reach 7.05 million by 2026. Crypto Revenue: The current South African cryptocurrency market revenue is approximately US$615.5 million, with the average revenue per user expected to be US$90.7 in 2025. The revenue is growing annually at the rate of 3.63%, resulting in a total of US$637.9 million by 2026. Governments’ Crypto Holdings: No public disclosure yet; no evidence that the government owns crypto assets in official reserves. It rather focuses on private ownership and crypto market growth. Endnote In 2025, the South African government showed its support for blockchain and cryptocurrency through a complex regulatory framework. While the country does not consider crypto as a legal tender, it has legalized the trading of crypto as a legal financial product. The crypto regulatory agencies, such as SARB and FSCA, are moving towards a robust regulatory framework to create an enhanced crypto landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yes, crypto trading is legal in South Africa. The government actively regulates it as a financial product, and a recent court ruling clarified it’s not subject to strict exchange controls. Is South Africa crypto-friendly? South Africa is considered crypto-friendly due to its progressive regulatory framework that recognizes crypto as a financial product and aims to foster a secure environment for its growth. How is Crypto Taxed in South Africa? SARS treats crypto as “assets of intangible nature,” subjecting it to capital gains tax (up to 18% on 40% of gains, with an R40,000 annual exclusion) or income tax (18%-45%) depending on the transaction. Which government body handles crypto operations in South Africa?

45986608,https://nulltx.com/?p=150414,1749887435,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Hyperliquid EVM Surges to $1.7 Billion TVL with 337% Year-to-Date Growth,https://nulltx.com/hyperliquid-evm-surges-to-1-7-billion-tvl-with-337-year-to-date-growth/,"Hyperliquid EVM has had an extraordinary growth spurt this year, with its total value locked (TVL) shooting up to $1.7 billion. That is a mind-boggling 337% increase from the $400 million it had at the start of the year, and it puts Hyperliquid firmly among the top DeFi protocols in terms of TVL. What this growth reflects, what it is sourcing itself from, is certainly the desire in the market for innovative DeFi infrastructure that commands the attention of developers and users alike. Hyperliquid’s total value locked now makes it a top DeFi protocol by that metric. 1/ Hyperliquid EVM has reached $1.7B in TVL, representing a 337% YTD increase from $400M. Breaking down the Hyperliquid ecosystem protocols leveraging programmable finance primitives: builder codes, auctions, and Hypercore/EVM composability, only possible on @Hyperliquidx : pic.twitter.com/JZZvcWzeyy — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) June 12, 2025 Hyperliquid is an ever-growing ecosystem that attracts a variety of projects. These projects develop new financial products and services, taking full advantage of Hyperliquid’s programmable architecture. There is a new surge in adoption that is resulting from this. More sophisticated DeFi building blocks are being demanded that go beyond what conventional smart contracts can deliver. Hyperliquid is a prime testing ground for what decentralized protocols can achieve. Innovative Protocols Powering the Ecosystem Hyperliquid’s success is built on a code architecture that allows protocols to do the kinds of things Hyperliquid needs them to do to succeed, like routing trades through Hypercore orderbooks, for instance. And this is quite modular; you could even say it’s a set of Lego bricks. So if you’re a protocol developer, or an orderbook developer, or mind-melding to do both, you can use it at varying levels of depth, like with good ol’ Lego. Pvptrade uses this same architecture, but through a Telegram bot interface, provides an accessible and innovative trading experience. Redacted similarly, Axiom Exchange has built a trading terminal that captures value by using Hyperliquid’s flexible infrastructure and providing users with an experience that is quite unlike that which is found at most other centralized exchanges. Another vital stroke of genius is the auction mechanism of HIP3, which currently resides in testnet, enabling builders to create bespoke markets with configurable fees not exceeding 50%. This framework has already pulled in dedicated projects like Hyperunit, testing leveraged equity products, and Ethena Labs, doing their work with USDe trading pairs. Allowing these sorts of structures and configurations is simply a giant leap in the path toward even more innovative DeFi applications catering to an ever-diverse set of trader needs. Cross-Layer Composability Unlocks New Financial Architectures One of the most groundbreaking features of Hyperliquid is the profound composability of the Hypercore and Hyperliquid EVM, which partake in the shared state of the protocol. This architecture allows reading and writing of data at the layer between the Hypercore and the Hyperliquid EVM with the same fluidity and coherence with which data is handled at the layer between two Hyperliquid EVMs. Why is that important? Because it permits seamless transactions that can span not merely multiple smart contracts but also multiple blocks. This composability’s power is demonstrated in several protocols already. Hyperlendx offers liquid perpetual positions by allowing users to borrow and lend against leveraged Hypercore positions. Felix Protocol extends capital efficiency by facilitating stablecoin borrowing against Hypercore positions. Liminal Money spotlights the cross-layer synergies available in the DeFi ecosystem. Liminal Money is an automated delta-neutral farming strategy. It operates from the EVM layer, accepting deposits in USDC. It interacts with Hypercore to do spot purchasing. And it uses the equivalent short positions to maintain market neutrality. You could say that Liminal Money is a dynamically layer-crossing strategy. But to be honest, it is also good practice to avoid buying the top and selling the bottom. The capabilities of builder codes, HIP3 auctions, and the composability of Hypercore/HyperEVM are enabling protocol architectures that, until now, were impossible within classical DeFi frameworks. Lending, options, liquid staking tokens (LSTs), and dApps are going to be integrated into an ecosystem where these primitives interact with Hypercore’s deep liquidity pools. The financial ecosystem that results from this integration will be both fully integrated and highly efficient. A borrowing and lending ecosystem doesn’t work if you can only borrow from one set of liquidity pools; it only works if you can borrow from many pools and many different kinds of lenders. Liquidity is the Cooper Union of financial investigations. Conclusion: Toward a Unified DeFi Financial System Decentralized finance has reached a new significant milestone with the rapid ascension of Hyperliquid EVM and its ecosystem. The rise of Hyperliquid EVM marks yet another step in the march of decentralized protocols toward providing programmable, permissionless, and composable financial services to all. What is happening around Hyperliquid EVM is no longer just an experiment; it is clearly a viable, real-world chapter in the DeFi universe. As adoption accelerates and fresh protocols appear, Hyperliquid is making itself into a base element of the pending next wave of DeFi innovation. The vision of a fully integrated financial system—where lending, trading, and asset management share liquidity layers and thus if not converge, then alternate seamlessly—is an emerging reality, one that with each passing day seems to promise to unlock new possibilities for traders, developers, and investors.

In the past few months, the asset has been stuck in a consolidation phase within a tight range between $2.1 and $2.4, with a few brief and unsuccessful breakout attempts in both directions. However, more recent data from Glassnode indicates that XRP is once again in the driver’s seat in terms of capital rotation, at least when compared to SOL, which could trigger a substantial shift in the narrative around the asset and potentially impact its price movements. Realized Cap Changes $XRP is pulling ahead again. Its 30D % change in Realized Cap just hit +4.2%, outpacing $SOL modest +1%. Capital is rotating faster into #XRP , hinting at stronger short-term conviction: https://t.co/cOSVts1PMm pic.twitter.com/W0eub7oGTe — glassnode (@glassnode) June 13, 2025 The analytics platform’s graph shows that XRP dominated SOL in terms of 30D Realized Cap changes until the end of March. At the beginning of that month, Ripple’s token flew past $3 briefly, and even though it corrected slightly in the following weeks, it still stood above $2.6-7 for the most part. However, then came the trade war escalation, and XRP’s price tumbled, alongside Glassnode’s metric. The situation changed briefly in early May as XRP was recovering from a plunge to $1.6 and returned above $2. SOL performed a lot better in the following month, but XRP has regained its lead in the past few days. Consequently, Glassnode determined that this growing capital rotation into XRP hints at “stronger short-term conviction.” Why So? The primary narrative supporting XRP’s improving position is the renewed hope for spot Ripple ETF approvals. Most recently, the SEC greenlighted a Nasdaq crypto US settlement price index, which included Ripple’s token. Many analysts believe this opened the door even more for an XRP ETF in the States. Polymarket’s current data shows a 89% chance for such a product to be approved in the US this year. Although SOL’s percentage is quite high as well, other experts noted that Ripple continues to expand its DeFi ecosystem, including the recent introduction of USDC on XRPL, which could further enhance its position. Additionally, some noted that XRP is holding better because capital “chases regulatory clarity and event-driven hype, while SOL’s bounce potential is hampered by recent drawdowns and meme rotation fatigue.” The post Ripple Is Pulling Ahead Again as Capital Is Rotating Fast Into XRP: What Does This Mean? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-14 07:51:47

Ethereum ETFs saw inflows of 154,000 ETH over the past week, which is five times their previous weekly average. If investors—including institutions—were not paying attention to Ethereum before now, they certainly are now. $ETH spot ETFs are heating up. This week alone, they’ve seen 154K #ETH in inflows – 5x higher than their recent weekly average. For context: the biggest single-day $ETH inflow this month was 77K #ETH on June 11th. pic.twitter.com/8Xlerbc6GX — glassnode (@glassnode) June 13, 2025 The standout moment was June 11, the day on which ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of ETH for the month, with 77,000 ETH poured in. Not only was the scale of the figure quite notable, but it also suggested something interesting: A rebalancing in the ETF world between Bitcoin and Ethereum. For the longest time, Bitcoin has been the ETF darling, with inflows flowing to the tune of tens of thousands of BTC. But suddenly, it looks like Ethereum has caught up quite nicely. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have not seen nearly the same level of reception. This week’s total of 7,800 BTC inflows—while somewhat above average—pales in comparison to the peak we saw in May, when daily inflows reached as high as 7,900 BTC on May 23. Though Bitcoin reigns as the dominant asset in the world of crypto investments, Ethereum’s recent performance hints at rising interest in its broader ecosystem and long-term utility. Ethereum Futures Open Interest Tops $20 Billion In a further show of strength for Ethereum, cash-margined ETH futures open interest hit a record high this week, sailing past 20 billion dollars. This development indicates an upsurge in not-so-subtle trading activity, and an uptick in trading that Ethereum is a Thriving market for futures and options trading that the platform Ethereum is a park for possibilities that is often seen as a precursor to the implementation of the shift to Ethereum 2.0. Open interest is rising, and that signals the traders are gearing up for future moves. More and more, those moves don’t seem to involve direct ownership of ether, and in fact, traders appear to be perfectly content gaining exposure via stablecoins and other collateralized forms of banking. This aligns with another trend: the rise of derivatives in crypto trading. These are becoming a key short-term market driver. The increase in leverage does not seem to be an isolated or speculative occurrence. The concurrent upsurge in ETF inflows indicates that both institutional investors in the Ethereum spot market and traders in the futures market who are using leverage have a high level of confidence in Ethereum’s performance in the near term. Bitcoin Maintains Stability But Loses the Spotlight Despite Ethereum’s explosion of activity, Bitcoin ETFs continue to perform, if not steadily, then without much drama. This week, the ETFs reported inflows of 7,800 BTC, which is just an eyebrow-raising number without the context of what it means. The context is that these inflows are pretty much the same as what we saw last week and the week before that, at least in terms of not having any kind of noticeable increases or decreases. $ETH futures open interest (cash-margined) just hit a new all-time high – topping $20B. Despite a slight pullback from the $2.8K levels, leverage continues to build as traders load up using stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/XP3KmhkdJ1 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 12, 2025 Certainly, Ethereum ETF potential chatter is way more exciting than anything directly linked to Bitcoin, but that doesn’t mean Bitcoin ETFs aren’t doing their own exciting things, at least in a sense that it’s almost as if they’re functioning like a stablecoin at this point. Bitcoin still commands the lion’s share of attention among traditional financial players, not surprisingly because it is the original and, by far, the most recognized cryptocurrency. That said, Ethereum’s wider and more dynamic range of use cases—something that spans decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and infrastructure for layer-2 solutions—seems to be grabbing the notice of institutions that are looking for an even broader base of exposure to blockchain applications. Inflow data may also show a difference between ETH and BTC because of the larger market cycles and portfolio strategies—part of the natural evolution of an investable asset. Bitcoin, having already undergone a significant rotation of capital earlier this year post-ETF approval, was already benefitting from a more apparent positioning by institutional investors. Meanwhile, Ethereum is apparently only starting to see this same effect and benefit. Conclusion: A New Phase for Ethereum on Wall Street The sharp increase in inflows into ETH ETFs, together with inflows into futures that are setting all-time records, indicates that Ethereum is generating interest among a diverse array of investors. Whether these investors want longer-term exposure via a spot ETF or to express a directional view using high-leverage futures contracts, Ethereum is emerging as a go-to asset for many. Although Bitcoin is still the foundation for getting exposure to the world of cryptocurrencies, it is becoming increasingly clear that Ethereum is the true value proposition. Institutional investors now understand that Ethereum is not simply a representative alternative to Bitcoin. This is partly because the regulatory situation for cryptocurrencies has improved, and products like Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have matured. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In just the last three months, the supply of stablecoins issued by American companies—such as USD Coin (USDC) and PayPal USD (PYUSD)—has more than doubled, up 104 percent, to reach a total market value of $67.5 billion. Offshore stablecoins still dominate, but U.S. growth is accelerating Over the past year, U.S.-based stablecoins like $USDC and $PYUSD have more than doubled in supply, growing +104% to $67.5B. Meanwhile, non-U.S. stablecoins, led by $USDT , $USDe , $DAI , and $USDS , showed more… pic.twitter.com/GGLHim43CA — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 12, 2025 This growth is in contrast with the moderate expansion seen among offshore jurisdiction stablecoins, which include the long-standing leaders Tether (USDT), Ethena’s USDe, MakerDAO’s DAI, and Stably’s USDS. These offshore stablecoins grew by 41 percent over the same period—still remarkable, but clearly not on par with the pace of growth seen among U.S. stablecoins. The numbers show a change in market dynamics. For most of the past decade, the stablecoin sector was dominated by non-U.S. issuers, who operated under very little regulatory oversight. But the past year has seen a recalibration of sorts, as U.S. issuers have found their footing and confidence in the rapidly evolving legal and compliance landscape. Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Confidence Drive U.S. Growth The recent surge in stablecoins based in the U.S. is closely linked to the growing clarity of the regulatory approach to digital assets. What is becoming clearer is that U.S. financial regulators expect firms to register with them and follow the rules. Lawmakers have also signaled that new legislation could be on the way to provide more guidance and cover for firms that seek to operate in the digital asset space. USDC from Circle has become a go-to option for organizations, fintechs, and DeFi apps that want a digital dollar that’s overseen and operates in a clear, trustworthy manner. Meanwhile, it’s important to note that PayPal’s own stablecoin—PYUSD—has managed to crank the dial up even further in terms of mainstream visibility and accessibility. A retail user can now also satisfy their on-chain dollar desire via PayPal. This trend is significant because it is happening at a time when stablecoins are assuming a greater role in the global payments landscape. From crypto exchanges to decentralized applications, having access to reliable, compliant, dollar-pegged assets is actually kind of crucial. And within this context, the digital asset space is exhibiting a pronounced preference for U.S.-based stablecoin issuers. These are deemed more secure and more regulated (even if the jury is still out on the overall regulatory framework). These stablecoins have seen a substantial increase in the pace of their supply growth. This not only shows us that more and more people are converting fiat into tokenized dollars, but also that these dollars are being actively used in DeFi applications. A large portion of this is likely being used in cross-border payments, which we know is one of the major use cases for stablecoins. Trading platforms are also a big part of this, as evidenced by the recent conversations around stablecoin market making. Offshore Stablecoins Still Lead, But the Gap Is Narrowing Even with the recent increase in stablecoins from the U.S., the global market is still largely in the hands of stablecoins from outside the U.S. Tether (USDT), which is mostly an outside-the-U.S. operation, still is the largest stablecoin by market cap and also by daily trading volume. It’s available on just about every exchange you can think of and is a go-to choice for a lot of users because of that and also because of its cross-border applications. Especially in emerging markets, USDT is a default choice. DAI and algorithmic models like USDe represent decentralized alternatives that give users opportunities to prioritize decentralization or sidestep regulatory scrutiny. Stablecoins issued from offshore jurisdictions, when taken in aggregate, represent the lion’s share of the total global supply of stablecoins. The gap is closing, though. Stablecoins based in the U.S. are growing at more than double the rate of their offshore counterparts. Market share is likely to shift further in the coming years. And if this trend continues, stablecoins issued in the U.S. could, in some sense, be as big as Tether. Slipping in market share as we go forward, Tether could become, in some context, a non-factor. How digital assets are regulated is an evolving story in the United States. This includes legislation around stablecoin reserves, that they should be backed by a currency, a commodity, or some combination thereof. The regulators want to know if the reserves are there when we say they are, and if the tokens are being issued in a way that is safe and sound. If we get to a place that is described in a way such that we think it is secure, then we think more capital could flow into U.S.-issued stablecoins. Although the U.S. may lag in the issuance of stablecoins, the U.S. stablecoin market is rapidly growing, and American stablecoins could play a significant role in the next phase of the digital currency ecosystem. Clearer regulation, stronger institutional demand, and surging adoption are propelling U.S. stablecoins to potential leadership in the next phase of the digital currency evolution. Non-U.S. stablecoins are in the lead today, but U.S. stablecoins are potentially next. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The pullback comes during a broader market correction that seems to be affecting speculative, tech-driven areas of the market, including blockchain-based AI projects. The sharp decline highlights how vulnerable the budding AI agent economy is to overall macro conditions and investor mood. The AI agent category—stocked with autonomous and semi-autonomous digital agents, living in decentralized environments—has enjoyed rapid growth over the past year, but it’s too early to say if that will continue. Of course, with any new technology segment, we can expect some volatility, but this feels like a big drop. $VIRTUAL Token Falls Nearly 11% But Holds Market Leadership The recent market turbulence has not spared the Virtuals ecosystem. The native $VIRTUAL token fell by 10.95%, bringing its current trading price to 1.8461 dollars. Despite this price correction, though, Virtuals still occupies a solid stronghold in the AI agent space, commanding a market cap of 1.21 billion dollars and 46.18% mindshare. Those figures are strong enough to maintain its position as the leading project in this sector. Virtuals Daily Update | June 13th, 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/2Z4rL70ERw — Graeme (@gkisokay) June 13, 2025 The Virtuals ecosystem now has a total valuation of $2.31 billion, which unfortunately reflects a decline of 7.79% over the past 24 hours. The figures are clearly down across the board. However, something positive emerged from this latest debacle: Our mindshare—percentage of sector-related activity and attention we command—actually ticked up 1.02%. That puts us at an all-time high in that metric. Even with the price falling, it looks like traders, developers, and users keep seeing Virtuals as a foundational platform in the AI agent economy. This growth in mindshare suggests that we are taking the current downturn in stride, seeing it as a temporary dip rather than a total rethink of the foundational prospects of the Virtuals ecosystem. Mindshare Milestone Reflects Strong Community and Ecosystem Growth A clear development—and a notable one at that—is the continued growth in mindshare for Virtuals. Mindshare might offer a clearer picture of the project’s resilience than price metrics alone. In tech markets, especially those as multifaceted as AI and blockchain, mindshare tends to precede market share and price recovery. It is significant that Virtuals managed to expand its influence in the discussion surrounding AI agents—even while its token slipped almost 11%—because it shows how tough their platform is. It shows how strong their community is and how much people believe in the perceived usefulness of the technology. Moreover, the toolkit of the Virtuals ecosystem is all but ensuring its hold as a top choice among developers and users. Decentralized AI agents, customizable virtual assistants, and identity layers native to Web3 are just a few of the tools that programmers can employ to create projects that can compete in an increasingly cluttered space. And as these projects vie for our attention, the mental space they occupy becomes a powerful indicator of which are the most likely to endure. Project users and backers are still urged to take part and broaden the ecosystem, and many are directly bringing in new users via the platform’s referral system, which you can access from app.virtuals.io/referral. Looking Ahead: A Short-Term Dip or a Long-Term Opportunity? Even though the statistics from June 13th may appear alarming at first, they are not viewed as such by astute analysts of the crypto and Web3 worlds, who see them for what they really are—corrections that happen all the time. For Virtuals, the token price slump is clearly not the whole story. The platform seems primed for a rebound; after all, with its decentralizing aura, all’s well in the Virtuals ecosystem. As the AI agent economy keeps growing and maturing, Virtuals remains a key entity to monitor. It offers infrastructure, community, and tools that go well beyond mere token speculation. Whether this current dip is just a temporary setback or the start of a longer consolidation phase is still unclear. But Virtuals seems to be holding steady and might even be expanding its influence as it moves through this storm. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

But this isn’t just another potentially profitable coin that’s been added to the list of all the coins that Coinbase handles; this is a much bigger deal. Integrating $S into Coinbase’s infrastructure means integrating an entirely new blockchain network. In contrast to Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens or Solana’s SPL tokens, which Coinbase natively supports, integrating $S involves much more. When will we see $S in the Coinbase wallet? Currently, it isn’t in the roadmap for 2023. Adding it would require a full-stack integration of the entire Sonic network, which is much more than token support. This opens the possibility for including not just $S but also other Sonic-native assets, like $USDC, within the Coinbase platform. Expect that sometime after 2023. Why is getting $S listed on Coinbase such a big deal? Unlike ERC20 tokens from Ethereum or SPL tokens from Solana, getting $S on Sonic listed involves support of a totally new network. This network integration isn't a simple token listing, its a full stack integration that… — assistant.sonic (@SonicAssistant) June 13, 2025 This move shows that Coinbase is becoming more open to not just onboarding new tokens, but also new blockchains that could have a lot of potential. And it isn’t doing it for just any blockchain; it’s choosing ones that meet very strict criteria in terms of scalability, developer activity, and compliance—things that the Sonic network and its backers are surely hoping to be validated for. Key Advantages of the Coinbase Listing For the Sonic ecosystem, getting $S onto the Coinbase roadmap opens up a broad range of strategic opportunities, and it all has to do with how you access markets and how you build credibility in them. First off, Coinbase has awesome access: it’s a top place to trade for a massive audience, both in the U.S. and around the world, and that audience is a good mix of both retail and institutional investors. Maybe the more significant point about being on Coinbase is that and it makes available access to something called Coinbase Custody, which is a platform for institutional-grade custody of assets. It is something that 9 of the 12 Bitcoin ETF issuers use as their custody solution. If S continues to meet the compliance and regulatory requirements that these institutional players require, then it seems to me like there’s a pretty good shot at something approaching real institutional involvement. To be a constituent on Coinbase also bears an important signal that carries a certain level of compliance, security, and, most importantly, reputability. The tokens that are not only vetted but also make it onto the Coinbase exchange tend to be viewed as safer and more stable by not just retail investors but also institutional ones. And that is an important line for $S to have skated across. It carries with it the signals of safety and respectability that make it so much more likely that large, even public entities, could end up involved with that token. Furthermore, $S will gain from direct fiat onramps—users can purchase it with USD, EUR, and other key currencies. This substantially lessens the usual resistance to entry associated with newer ecosystems and allows for greater accessibility to Sonic by the average retail user who may have little knowledge of DeFi protocols or cross-chain swaps. Institutional and Retail Doors Swing Open for Sonic Sonic is also likely to become a much more attractive network for wallet providers, custodians, and institutional service firms, many of whom wait for signals from big platforms like Coinbase before extending support to new tokens, to do business with. And why is that? Because Coinbase lists that token. Compared with some other crypto exchanges, Coinbase’s involvement signals that a new network is a safe choice. The rapidly growing web3 wallet and DeFi-friendly product suite of Coinbase will soon provide native support for $S and Sonic’s related tokens, which will allow users to interact with Sonic’s decentralized infrastructure in a seamless manner. Sonic’s recent partnership with Coinbase marks a significant step for the scalable network toward mainstream relevance. For Sonic, this is more than just a tech integration. The network, which has been gaining traction among developers for its scalable architecture and user-friendly tools, is now about to find itself on a mega stage. With the credibility and exposure that Coinbase brings, $S and the broader Sonic ecosystem are positioned to attract many new participants, from institutional investors to retail traders. In the fast-changing crypto world, where being visible and trustworthy usually makes the difference between adoption and non-adoption, seeing Sonic included in the Coinbase listing roadmap could just be what Sonic needs to be taken seriously as a next-generation blockchain platform that plans to stick around for a while.

After about three years of construction and several months of operation, the team behind Solsniper said they can no longer sustainably run the platform and will be eliminating access to their NFT marketplace as of Friday. The announcement sent ripples through the Solana NFT community, largely because few people saw it coming. Solsniper set out 3.5 years ago to become a data and analytics tool for active NFT traders on Solana. The platform, however, has expanded quite a bit since then and now also offers a mobile application, serves as an NFT aggregator, and has a launchpad for new projects. And, Solsniper has an actual NFT marketplace, which it calls “full-fledged.” That said, the team and I are really excited for the next chapter of their story as Solsniper has increasingly found it difficult to sustain the marketplace operationally. “We were unable to run the NFT marketplace in a sustainable way,” the Solsniper team said in a statement. “We’re closing this chapter, but we are still on our journey.” Marketplace Shutdown, NFT Delisting, and User Refunds Solsniper is doing several things as part of the shutdown process to make sure the transition for its users goes smoothly. Effective immediately, any NFTs listed on the Sniper Marketplace will be delisted, and any active bids will be canceled. Thank you everyone for the last 3.5 years. We started Solsniper as an analytics tool for NFT traders and over the years we've built a mobile app, an NFT aggregator, as well as an NFT marketplace and launchpad. Unfortunately over the last year we have not been able to… — Solsniper (@solsniperxyz) June 12, 2025 Order and bid balances will be refunded directly to users’ wallets. Based on the platform’s announcement, there is no need for users to do anything. Solsniper provided the community with a continued assurance that all assets will be returned by June 13, 2025, at 12 PM PST, and that any issues arising afterward should be dealt with via support ticket in their Discord server. Many in the community regard this proactive approach to shutting down as a responsible, user-focused exit. In an industry where sudden closures often lead to lost assets or incomplete processes, Solsniper’s effort to ensure full refunds for users and a clear, transparent timeline has earned them praise—even in the midst of disappointment. The group further noted that they have kept the data of users who took part in their rewards leaderboard, and this may be used in any future reward programs the company decides to create. A Thank You to the NFT Community and Hints at Future Projects The end of the Solsniper marketplace marks the closing of a chapter, but the Solsniper team is not leaving the Web3 space altogether. In their farewell message, they extolled gratitude toward the NFT community for building and supporting their platform, saying, “Without NFTs, we wouldn’t be here today.” The team expressed gratitude to their users, “We’re grateful for your trust and support over the years. We don’t plan to stop building anytime soon and hope that you’ll continue to support us in future endeavors.” While not specifying what might come next, the message indicates that the Solsniper team plans to keep working in the still-broad blockchain or decentralized application space. If their next project is in that realm, they’ll be able to apply the lessons (or whatever they dream up to call them) from this chapter of their collaboration. Solsniper shutting down again reminds us how manageable yet volatile the NFT and Web3 space is. Even with innovation and growth apparent in the NFT space on Solana, operational sustainability is clearly a hurdle that a not-yet-overcome assembly of Solana NFT teams faces. Solsniper had community ties and was an apparently technically advanced platform; why was it unable to achieve the same kind of sustainable operational success that Magic Eden and Hey, NFT !? have? Solsniper’s cautionary tale will likely be remembered in the maturing Solana ecosystem for two reasons: It shows the not very distant downside of the financial strains of Web3 startups, and it can be seen as a testament to what responsible project management looks like in the often unpredictable world of Web3.

By 2028, SPX may achieve a peak price of $4.55 and an average trading price of $4.27. In 2031, the target price for SPX is between $6.83 and $7.40, with an average price of $7.12. SPX6900 (SPX) functions primarily on the Ethereum network. The token was created as a meme to entertain wider audiences. It has no real connection with stocks, equities, or securities. SPX6900 generates interest through spot trading, market speculation, or perpetual and leveraged trading, the latter are not recommended for non-professionals because of their high risk. Early users confess to its credibility and remarkable price performance; however, the meme token still holds the interest of many investors. Starting as a non-serious venture, the SPX6900 coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024. It was initiated as a useless token but ultimately ended up earning profits in the millions. For example, over a month, SPX earned up to 9000% of return following its ascent through September 2024. What’s next for the meme token SPX6900 in 2025 and beyond? Let’s get into the SPX6900 price prediction and technical analysis.

Cryptocurrency has lost 4.52% of its value. SPX coin prices target the next support at $1.42. On June 14, 2025, SPX6900 price analysis revealed a decreasing trend for the cryptocurrency. The coin value dived to $1.482 during the last 24 hours. From an overall perspective, the cryptocurrency has suffered a loss of 4.52%. Yesterday, the altcoin plunged to $1.30 for some time but closed at $1.54, and today it is again covering a downward range. However, a correction is natural, as the token marked a new all-time high on June 11, 2025, at $1.73. SPX6900/USD analysis on the 24-hour timeframe The one-day price chart of SPX6900 coin confirmed an upward trend in the market. The SPX/USD value has stepped down to $1.482 in the past 24 hours. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify a rising bearish pressure. SPX descends to $1.111 The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening, leading to higher volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $1.67. Whereby its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.73. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present close to the overbought area. The indicator’s value has dipped to index 69.24. The descending curve on the RSI graph signifies rising bearish momentum, which was expected as the token was in an overbought status. However, the correction has brought instability for long traders. SPX6900 analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of the SPX6900 coin also confirmed a downward trend in the market. The SPX/USD value has deteriorated to $1.48 in the past few hours. The higher volatility signifies relatively more market unpredictability. Selling pressure returns for SPX6900 The Bollinger Bands are widening, leading to increasing volatility. This increase in volatility signifies relatively higher signs of a reversal or further price deterioration. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $1.755, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $1.33, securing the support. The RSI indicator is hovering within the neutral area for now. Its value has dropped down to index 50.67 in the day. This decline is represented by a descending RSI slope. If the selling activities continue to grow, further imbalance in the trading setup is possible.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $$104,232.70 and $106,203.76 today. Table of Contents Story Highlights Bitcoin Price Today CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 Bitcoin Crypto Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 BTC Price Forecast 2026 BTC Price Prediction 2027 Bitcoin Predictions 2028 BTC Price 2029 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2030 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Bitcoin Prediction: Analysts and Influencer’s BTC Price Target FAQs Bitcoin Price Today Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $ 104,952.20364289 -0.22% Market cap $ 2,086,239,904,013.42 Circulating Supply 19,878,000.00 Trading Volume $ 49,405,884,751.4169 All-time high $109,114.88 on 20th January 2025 All-time low $0.04865 on 15th July 2010 CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Firstly, at CoinPedia, we feel optimistic about Bitcoin’s price increase. Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2, especially in April and May 2025. Bitcoin saw a strong and steady rally, driven by easing trade war tensions, pushing the price to a new all-time high of $ 112 K. Now, the question remains, Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June?. In early June, BTC is trying to hold support near the previous swing low of May after pulling back from its peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks sparked a short-term bounce from the 50-day EMA’s dynamic support. But on June 10th, momentum was halted, linked directly to rising geopolitical tensions, especially between Israel and Iran . However, Bitcoin is still facing resistance from a multi-month supply block, and is once again inching towards support near the previous swing low of May. if bearish pressure increases, the swing support zone becomes critical. A breakdown below this level could drag the price down to the $100K–$95K range in the near term. On the flip side, if it reverses from the swing support zone and manages to break June’s swing high, then the odds of clearing $112K are possible, and above this level, a certain strong momentum could take BTC price to a new high towards $120K by the end of June. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC.

According to an official statement from the firm, it acquired 10,387 HYPE tokens, which priced out at an average of $42.24 each, for a nearly $438,828 total investment. The transaction was executed via WonderFi Technologies, a digital asset platform regulated in Canada, that marks a compliant and carefully structured entry point into the decentralized trading world. For Tony G Co-Investment Holdings, this was not just a compliant entry point; it was an expression of support for next-generation blockchain infrastructure. I would say that our sorry trio represents Canada quite well. LATEST: Tony G Co-Investment Holdings purchases 10,387 $HYPE tokens worth around $438,829 as part of its long-term digital asset strategy. pic.twitter.com/IhzdZ9deO1 — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) June 13, 2025 The HyperLiquid platform, which is the basis for HYPE, is constructing a truly impressive blockchain. HyperLiquid is a high-performance infrastructure that is specifically designed to scale decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. And with DeFi still early in its evolution, HyperLiquid’s engineers are betting that the DeFi space is going to need lots of liquidity (and trading). If they are right, and if these engineers deliver on their vision, an impressive virtual ocean of liquidity is going to materialize in the blockchain space. 加拿大上市公司Tony G Co-Investment Holdings购入约44万美元的HYPE代币 据官方消息，加拿大上市投资公司Tony G Co-Investment Holdings宣布以均价42.24美元购入10,387枚HyperLiquid平台原生代币HYPE，总价值438,828美元。 此次收购通过加拿大合规数字资产平台WonderFi… pic.twitter.com/XLNjpE7McF — PANews (@PANewsCN) June 13, 2025 Tony G’s Growing Interest in Digital Asset Innovation This first marks the HyperLiquid ecosystem’s public interaction with the HyperLiquid ecosystem. If anything, it further solidifies HyperLiquid’s deep liquidity as a DeFi platform. It makes sense then that Tony G Co-Invest Investment Holdings makes direct and focused bets with decentralized finance. Known for their broad and innovative investment strategies, they are actualizing moves within the blockchain space—all good signs for the HyperLiquid community. The HYPE token purchase is part of a broader strategic initiative, said company leadership, to allocate capital to the kinds of basic infrastructure projects that create a solid foundation for the crypto industry. As for why the company even went public with the HyperLiquid investment, its CEO said something related to the investment’s significance for their company and the kind of DeFi space they wish to embrace. That institutional investors are seeking to blend innovation with the compliance of existing financial standards is underscored by the fact that they facilitated the trade through WonderFi, a regulated platform. This path that the trade took may—along with the use of well-known counterparties—be a signal from institutional investors to their peers that the move into decentralized finance (DeFi) can be undertaken with due regard for safety and soundness. HyperLiquid: A Rising Star in DeFi Infrastructure Established to accelerate the decentralized trading movement, HyperLiquid is gaining notice as a blockchain infrastructure project whose technical innovations and developer-friendly architecture make it a fast, cheap, and—increasingly vital—as DeFi scales, a performant place for makers and takers to do business. Within the HyperLiquid ecosystem, the HYPE token serves as the native asset. It is used for governance, staking, and funding network operations. The project has seen substantial capital inflows from institutional investors like Tony G Co-Investment Holdings. This impressive backing is likely to lure even more retail and institutional market participants to further engage with HyperLiquid. Furthermore, this investment might herald even larger moves ahead. Analysts point out that Tony G’s capital deployment, when considered in relative terms, is pretty modest. But it might well be the first of many strategic moves he makes into DeFi projects. “We’re seeing more and more institutional investors dip their toes into the space in a compliant, controlled manner,” a Toronto-based blockchain analyst tells me. “This isn’t just about buying tokens—it’s about understanding and shaping the infrastructure of the next financial era.” The decentralized finance sector is maturing, and as it does, we are increasingly getting a sense of what it will look like when everything sorts out and the crypto world finds its regulatory footing. Moves like this one from Tony G may become the norm rather than the exception. For now, this investment—$440,000—in HYPE represents a meaningful and very traditional-seeming vote of confidence in HyperLiquid and in the potential of DeFi to remodel the financial world.

The announcement, which came just hours after the company’s stock crashed 66% during pre-market trading, has sent ripples through the financial and crypto communities. SharpLink stands now as one of the most significant corporate holders of ETH. Comparisons have been immediately drawn between SharpLink and MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin in 2020 and 2021. Even though the earlier collapse of SharpLink’s share price was eyebrow-raising, their ETH acquisition should be taken seriously. For one thing, it adds an intriguing twist to SharpLink’s long-term strategy to transform itself into a player in the digital assets space. Observers have noted that the timing of the acquisition—in the same week that SharpLink’s stock was getting docked for perceived shortcomings—might just be an instance of management trying to shore up an under-heralded story. Or it might just be an instance, as we often see in crypto, of centralization (hi, holding 38 million ETH!) breeding a not very good idea (hi, trying to be a player in a decentralized space). A Billion-Dollar War Chest and More ETH Likely on the Way SharpLink’s move is growing even more significant when viewed in the broader context of what the company is doing. SharpLink is currently in the process of raising a $1 billion funding round. It has already deployed into Ethereum nearly half of that total. Still, with over $500 million to play with, it could shift even more capital into expanding its Ethereum holdings. The Microstrategy moment for Ethereum has finally happened. Just now, SharpLink Gaming has announced an acquisition of 176,271 ETH worth $463 million. Interestingly, SharpLink Gaming crashed today 66% in pre-market and now they have come up with an announcement. Don't forget… pic.twitter.com/DR6Hlv2EdT — Cipher X (@Cipher2X) June 13, 2025 Speculation has now begun among analysts as to whether this is just the first step in a multi-phase acquisition strategy. If Ethereum’s price rises to the $2,800-$3,000 range over the next few weeks, as many bullish traders anticipate, it could well validate SharpLink’s gamble and maybe even kick off a broader trend among mid-cap tech companies to look for alternative reserve assets. SharpLink’s somewhat less publicized ETH play still has the potential to set off a second wave of institutional crypto accumulation. SharpLink might be too small a player in the Ethereum space for its investment to truly impact the trajectory of institutions accumulating ETH, but if it were to somehow wind up with either an obscene amount of ETH or some Ethereum-based technology, it could potentially affect the accumulation curve. This development also raises questions about SharpLink’s long-term intentions. Is the company pivoting toward a become Ethereum-centric financial entity, or is this simply a high-risk, high-reward treasury strategy to recover from market realities? As of now, the firm hasn’t put any bigger plans on the table, but its ETH buying spree suggests a strong conviction in Ethereum’s viability as a future fine tech. A Turning Point for Corporate Crypto Strategy? SharpLink’s shift might signal a fresh new look at an overarching crypto strategy among corporates—one that stretches beyond Bitcoin. Up until now, Bitcoin has largely dominated institutional treasuries, thanks to its perceived “digital gold” status and its first-mover advantage. But now, Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance, smart contracts, and emerging “Web3” technologies have more and more institutions looking its way. Following SharpLink’s buy-in, if Ethereum’s price were to appreciate considerably, other companies might start seeing ETH as more than just an asset for speculation, but rather as a serious component of a well-diversified corporate treasury. This could have some pretty earth-shattering effects on Ethereum—more corporate procurement, for one thing, makes ETH less available and more desirable, and that can take price appreciation not just to new highs but also into the next bull cycle. The speculation has already started in the market over which companies might follow the lead of SharpLink. Prospective candidates range from tech startups with loaded balance sheets to gaming firms, to fintechs. The door has now been opened for Ethereum to play a much larger and more impactful role in corporate finance strategies. Similarly to MicroStrategy’s experience with Bitcoin, SharpLink’s Ethereum investment will ultimately play out based on three factors: execution, timing, and market conditions. But one thing is certain: the game has changed, and Ethereum just had its “MicroStrategy moment.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Many altcoins have started to recover from the Friday crash, including HYPE, which has risen back above $42. BTC Calm Despite Attacks The business week started on the right foot for BTC as the asset broke out of last weekend’s consolidation range and shot above $110,000 on Monday. Although it was stopped there, it managed to remain close to that level for the next couple of days. More positive news emerged on Wednesday, including a trade deal between the US and China as well as better-than-expected CPI data, but BTC failed to maintain its run. Just the opposite, it lost some ground and went back down to under $107,000. The bulls took it north to $108,500 on Thursday, but the geopolitical tension in the Middle East skyrocketed that night as Israel fired countless missiles against Iran, killing over 70 people in the process. Bitcoin’s prices reacted immediately with a price plunge that drove it south by over five grand since Thursday’s peak to under $103,000. Nevertheless, it recovered some ground on Friday and even challenged $106,000 at one point. It couldn’t breach that level but still trades above $105,000 now, which is somewhat surprising as Iran retaliated against Israel last night. Still, there are some warning signs about its future price trajectory if it fails to remain above $100,000. For now, though, its market cap has jumped to almost $2.1 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is at 61.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Rebound Most altcoins suffered yesterday but are with minor gains on a daily scale. Ethereum has returned above $2,500 after a small increase, while Ripple’s cross-border token has defended the $2.15 support. SOL, DOGE, ADA, and AVAX are also slightly in the green, while BCH and SHIB have posted more impressive gains. However, HYPE has stolen the show once again from the larger-cap alts, having surged by almost 8%. As a result, the asset now trades close to its all-time high of roughly $43. Other notable gainers from the past day include WBT, Fartcoin, PI, and ICP. The total crypto market cap has recovered over $60 billion and is back to $3.4 trillion on CG.

In a tweet that included an excerpt from a published academic or policy-oriented text, SMQKE highlighted a quote stating: “XRP is not just an asset, but a switch that modulates the XRP Ledger.” The excerpt provided by SMQKE delves into the integral role XRP plays in the XRP Ledger’s operational structure and the complex dynamics that surround it. XRP as a Required Component for Ledger Interaction The text, likely from an industry analysis, positions XRP at the center of a multi-faceted system. It points out that to activate an account on the XRP Ledger and participate in the distributed currency exchange, users must hold XRP in reserve, open a trust line, and issue offers. This requirement effectively makes XRP a necessary component for activity on the ledger, functioning as more than a store of value or speculative asset. In this sense, the description of XRP as a “switch” speaks to its technical necessity in initializing and maintaining functions within the ledger’s ecosystem. XRP IS NOT JUST AN ASSET—ITS A SWITCH THAT MODULATES THE XRP LEDGER This is documented. https://t.co/xP9VOrWISP pic.twitter.com/OnHIxjuaeg — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 11, 2025 Competing Interests in the XRP Ecosystem The passage goes on to highlight the competing interests among various user groups within the system. LETS (Local Exchange Trading Systems) supporters, according to the text, prefer XRP to be inexpensive to minimize the cost of opening trust lines and conducting transactions. Traders, in contrast, benefit from price volatility, which creates arbitrage opportunities. Meanwhile, payment providers seek price stability to reduce exchange rate risk when using XRP as a bridge asset for cross-currency transfers. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Escrow Strategy and Shifting User Base The excerpt also notes Ripple’s strategic response to these tensions. In 2017, Ripple locked 55 billion XRP into a cryptographically secured escrow account , with a mechanism to release only 1 billion XRP per month . This measure was designed to assure market participants that XRP’s supply would remain predictable and controlled, thus attempting to address concerns from various stakeholders who relied on the token in different capacities. SMQKE’s tweet underscores that this operational role of XRP is not speculative but supported by documentation. The phrase “switch that modulates the XRP Ledger” carries specific technical implications, suggesting that XRP functions not just as a token but operates as a prerequisite mechanism within the ledger’s infrastructure. This statement offers a different perspective than viewing XRP purely through the lens of its market price or liquidity profile.

Buy Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Early for a Bigger Discount Pepe (PEPE) Shows Signs of Potential Recovery Amid Market Fluctuations Pepe (PEPE) is trading between $0.00001038 and $0.00001296. After a period of volatility, the coin is stabilizing within this range. The recent price movements suggest that PEPE is finding its footing in the market. In the past week, PEPE's price has risen by 4.61%. This uptick indicates a possible short-term uptrend. However, over the last month, the coin's value has decreased by 9.11%. Looking at the six-month data, PEPE has dropped by 50.01%, highlighting a significant long-term decline. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.56. This level suggests that PEPE is neither overbought nor oversold. The nearest resistance is at $0.00001424. Breaking above this point could lead to further gains. The nearest support is at $0.00000909. Falling below this level might result in additional losses. Based on the current data, PEPE may be poised for a gradual recovery. If the price moves past the resistance level, it could see an increase of over 10%. Conversely, if it dips below the support level, the price might decrease by around 15%. Traders are watching these levels closely to anticipate PEPE's next move. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Tests Critical Price Levels Shiba Inu's price is currently between $0.00001178 and $0.00001333. This range shows a period of consolidation as traders watch for the next move. The coin is approaching a key resistance level at $0.00001416. Breaking this level could determine its short-term direction. If SHIB rises above the $0.00001416 resistance, it might start a bullish trend. This could lead to a price increase of about 6% to 8% from its current position. Such a move might attract more investors and increase market momentum. On the other hand, if the price can't overcome the resistance, it may fall toward the nearest support at $0.00001107. This drop would be around 15% to 17%. Traders should keep an eye on these levels. Overall, SHIB's recent performance suggests it's at a crossroads. The upcoming moves toward resistance or support will be crucial. A clear direction could set the tone for the coming weeks. BONK Shows 4.65% Recovery Bonk (BONK) is currently trading between $0.00001390 and $0.00001788. Recent movements have caught the eye of many in the crypto community. In the past week, BONK's price has risen by 4.65%, showing a slight uptick. However, over the last month, it has dropped by 27.74%. Looking back six months, the price has decreased by 57.66%. This long-term decline indicates significant downward pressure. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00001998. If BONK breaks above this point, it could signal a potential move upward. The closest support level is at $0.00001202. Falling below this may lead to further declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 35.85. An RSI below 30 often suggests that an asset is oversold. Since BONK's RSI is approaching this mark, it might indicate that the coin is nearing a point where buyers could become more interested. Conclusion In conclusion, while PEPE, SHIB, and BONK have gained attention in the meme coin market, their short-term potential appears limited compared to AGNT. AGNT, known as Codename:Pepe crypto, brings genuine artificial intelligence to the table, aiming to maximize profits in the chaotic meme coin arena. By leveraging AI to identify promising coins, predict market trends, and provide automated trading, AGNT offers advantages that other meme coins lack.

This project stands against dubious AI claims while positioning itself as a serious player. Its mission combines community strength with advanced trading strategies, hoping to replicate past successes in the meme coin arena. Is Codename:Pepe the Next Top 10 Meme Coin?

Hold Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) and Get Ahead of the Market with Early Signals From Meme to Mainstream: The Rise of Shiba Inu Shiba Inu started in 2020 as a meme coin aiming to ride the wave of Dogecoin's popularity. It quickly gained traction, catching the attention of high-profile figures like Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk. Built on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-20 standard, SHIB was initially a simple token for payment and investment purposes. As its popularity soared, the creators expanded SHIB's ecosystem. They launched a decentralized exchange and introduced an NFT project, attracting even more users. These developments helped Shiba Inu stand out from other meme coins by offering real utility beyond being a digital joke. The token experienced a meteoric rise in its early days but later settled into a more stable price range. Despite volatility, the community remained active, and the project continued to grow. New initiatives like a metaverse, games, and merchandise were introduced, laying the groundwork for future expansion. Shiba Inu's market position strengthened over time, reflecting its dedicated community and evolving ecosystem. The infrastructure built around SHIB suggests potential for growth, especially if external factors like a crypto bull market come into play. New users entering the crypto space might find SHIB's products appealing, possibly driving increased adoption. While predicting exact price movements is challenging, some analysts believe that technical indicators point toward a positive outlook for Shiba Inu. The token's ability to differentiate itself and evolve may play a crucial role in its long-term prospects. As the crypto landscape changes, SHIB's continued innovation could make it an attractive option for investors and enthusiasts alike. PEPE Coin's Leap: Is the Meme Coin Set for a Big Future? Matt Furie's cartoon frog, Pepe, became an internet hit in the early 2000s. This meme inspired PEPE Coin, a deflationary token on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. Embracing its playful origins, PEPE focuses on simplicity and community. PEPE Coin's goals are clear: Phase 1 is the meme, Phase 2 is vibe and HODL, and Phase 3 is meme takeover. It avoids complicated promises, staying true to its fun roots. The strong community and transparency set it apart. In December 2024, PEPE hit an all-time high of $0.00002825 before dropping about 68%. This was likely due to investors taking profits. Such swings are common in crypto, especially with meme coins. PEPE's future depends on market sentiment. Some experts are bullish. Valdrin Tahiri predicts a ""meme coin season"" could lift PEPE. Others, like Steven Walgenbach, warn that selling pressure may continue. Long-term predictions vary. By 2025, PEPE could reach between $0.000014 and $0.000055. Estimates for 2030 range from $0.00003015 to $0.000159. These predictions show the potential many see in PEPE. Conclusion In conclusion, coins like SHIB and PEPE have seen significant growth but may offer less immediate potential in the current market surge. Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a compelling alternative, aiming to deliver maximum profits through genuine intelligence powered by advanced AI. By utilizing AI to identify promising meme coins and predict market trends, Codename:Pepe crypto sets itself apart. Its community-driven approach, capped token supply, and exclusive features like a top-secret DAO membership position it as a noteworthy contender in the ongoing bull run.

Recently, a significant development caught the attention of market watchers: Meta’s substantial investment in the AI data-labeling space. This move, alongside intriguing shifts in the public offering landscape, offers key insights for anyone tracking the pulse of innovation and investment. The Bitcoin World Equity podcast recently delved into these topics, providing a deep dive into what these developments signal for the future. Meta AI Investment: A Bold Move in the AI Race? Meta Platforms has reportedly made a significant Meta AI Investment , committing a substantial $14.3 billion to Scale AI, a leader in data labeling. However, this isn’t a straightforward acquisition. Meta is taking a 49% stake in the company and bringing Scale AI’s co-founder, Alexandr Wang, onto their team. This strategic partial ownership and talent acquisition highlight Meta’s urgency to accelerate its position in the competitive artificial intelligence landscape. The move signals Meta’s determination to keep pace with AI heavyweights like OpenAI and Google, although the exact strategy for leveraging this investment remains a subject of discussion. The Equity podcast hosts explored whether this Scale AI Deal represents a genuine game-changer for Meta’s AI capabilities or if it’s primarily aimed at adding a well-connected figure like Wang to their ranks at a time when Meta’s internal AI progress faces scrutiny. Navigating the Fintech IPO Market Beyond the realm of artificial intelligence, the financial technology sector continues to see activity in the public markets. The discussion turned to the Fintech IPO Market , specifically examining recent performance. A notable example is Chime’s initial public offering, which reportedly priced above initial expectations at $27 per share and saw a positive jump in early trading. This performance offers potential signals for the broader tech IPO landscape. Anthony Ha, one of the Equity podcast hosts, shared his perspective, offering some “not-so-hot takes” on what Chime’s IPO signals for overall Tech IPO Trends . The conversation explored whether this indicates renewed investor appetite or if specific sector strength is driving these outcomes. Understanding these nuances is crucial for evaluating the health and direction of technology companies seeking public funding. The Rise of Agentic AI Startups The podcast also touched upon emerging trends within the AI sector itself, particularly focusing on the types of companies gaining traction. Y Combinator’s recent Demo Day reportedly showcased a significant number of “agentic” AI Startups . These companies are focused on building autonomous software agents capable of performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention. This focus on autonomous AI aligns with broader discussions around AI-driven task automation. A recent conversation with Fiverr’s CEO provided further context on how AI is impacting the gig economy and potentially transforming how tasks are assigned and completed. The rise of agentic AI startups suggests a future where software agents play an increasingly central role in both business processes and potentially, personal productivity. Beyond AI and IPOs: Other Tech Highlights The Equity podcast episode covered additional fascinating developments in the tech world: An archival interview with Scale AI co-founder Alexandr Wang offered insights into his early predictions for the future of artificial intelligence. A look at the quiet 18-month collaboration between Jony Ive’s design firm LoveFrom and electric vehicle maker Rivian on their first electric bike product, confirming its bike-like form factor. These diverse topics underscore the dynamic nature of the technology sector, where innovation spans from complex AI investments to consumer product design collaborations. Conclusion The recent news cycle, as discussed on the Bitcoin World Equity podcast, highlights pivotal moments in the tech and financial markets. Meta’s significant Meta AI Investment in Scale AI demonstrates the ongoing intensity of the AI race. Simultaneously, the performance of recent offerings in the Fintech IPO Market provides valuable data points for understanding current Tech IPO Trends . The emergence of agentic AI Startups from accelerators like Y Combinator points towards the next wave of AI-driven innovation. Staying informed on these key developments is essential for navigating the future of technology and investment.

Claiming that current market conditions support Bitcoin’s upward surge, Kang argued that a deep correction is unlikely before the largest cryptocurrency reaches at least $140,000 to $160,000.

The fact that cryptocurrencies are seen as volatile and risky assets in times of uncertainty has triggered investors to turn to safer havens. The escalation of tensions between the two countries has also raised concerns that Iran could close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation. According to the US Energy Information Administration, 20% of global oil transportation takes place through this strait. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to retaliate against Israel in a message published on X, writing that the country “must be ready for a harsh punishment.” *This is not investment advice.

Why This Analyst Claims BlockDAG Is Faking Its Raise,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/blockdag-a-scam-why-this-analyst-claims-blockdag-is-faking-its-raise,"BlockDAG claims to be the next big Layer-1 blockchain, boasting nearly $300 million raised and major brand partnerships. But growing doubts suggest the project may be more hype than substance—anonymous team, recycled whitepaper, and no on-chain proof. Meanwhile, XYZVerse quietly offers what BlockDAG lacks: audits, KYC, real utility, and transparent fundraising. Here’s why investors are starting to question the noise—and look elsewhere. Is BlockDAG Faking Its $300M Presale? BlockDAG has captured crypto headlines with a presale claiming nearly $300 million in funds—yet many in the space now question whether that number is real or simply inflated marketing. Positioned as a hybrid Proof‑of‑Work/DAG Layer 1 with EVM compatibility, audits from Halborn and CertiK, and partnerships from Inter Milan to NBA hints, its hype is growing. But skeptics argue that behind the noise lies little transparent substance. The red flags are troubling: A seeming mismatch between big advertising budgets and minimal GitHub activity. Repositories are near-empty, and real infrastructure progress is hard to track. Elements of the whitepaper appear nearly identical to Kaspa’s, hinting at recycled documentation rather than true innovation. Surge of impersonator and scam presale sites, which security experts say can drain wallets upon connection. Reddit users have also sounded the horn. One wrote: “No legit company forces you to pay a ‘fee’ or ‘taxes’ to withdraw money. That's just a scam to suck more money out of you.” Source: https://www.reddit.com Another observed that: Source: https://www.reddit.com These comments suggest that much of the presale’s claimed funding may be hype-fueled rather than backed by real investor capital. By contrast, XYZVerse (XYZ)—a sports-themed presale—has amassed around $14 million, completed smart contract audits, passed KYC, and tied itself to a working dApp ecosystem like bookmaker.XYZ, along with clear tokenomics and burn schedules. That presale feels far more grounded and transparent than BlockDAG’s, despite commanding a much smaller scale. Still, BlockDAG has some checkboxes ticked: audit reports, a testnet, and hardware prototypes. Supporters highlight these as signs of a serious project. But without public on-chain fundraising proof, live token listings, or reusable code, investors remain rightly cautious. BlockDAG isn’t proven to be a scam, but its massive presale raise is unverified and the project appears to lean heavily on marketing. Until we see active code, token launches, and on-chain funding, it's a speculative gamble at best. For a more credible presale example on a much smaller scale, look to XYZVerse—with its completed audit, real ecosystem integration, and orderly tokenomics, it reads far more transparently. Why XYZVerse Feels Safer and More Transparent Than BlockDAG In the crowded and often chaotic world of crypto presales, XYZVerse stands out as a rare example of a project that actually delivers transparency, security, and real utility—something that BlockDAG, despite its massive marketing push, consistently fails to prove. Let’s start with verifiable trust. XYZVerse has completed full KYC verification and smart contract audits through respected firms like SolidProof and Pessimistic. These aren't just badges for show—both firms confirmed the absence of critical vulnerabilities and validated the legitimacy of the team behind the project. BlockDAG, in contrast, remains faceless. No team disclosures, no audit transparency, no GitHub development that shows active or meaningful progress. Another critical difference is utility. XYZVerse is already integrated with a functioning on-chain sportsbook—bookmaker.XYZ—that’s handled over $100 million in betting volume and currently serves more than 20,000 users. BlockDAG has no live dApps, no user base, and no proof that anything outside its testnet and promotional pages actually works. Then there’s tokenomics. XYZVerse has released a detailed, structured breakdown: Total supply: 100 billion tokens Presale allocation: 17.9% Burn reserve: 17.1% Liquidity and CEX allocation: 15% Team and development: 10% Staking and ecosystem growth: 10% These numbers are public, documented, and tied to wallet addresses. BlockDAG, on the other hand, offers no visible supply breakdown, no vesting schedules, and no transparency on how presale funds are being used. Fundraising is another key point. XYZVerse has raised over $14 million in a multi-stage, trackable presale, with each price increase documented and reflected in the live dashboard. BlockDAG claims to have raised nearly $300 million—but provides no blockchain receipts, no wallet proofs, and no third-party confirmation. The scale of that number, unsupported by visible market traction, raises more questions than confidence. Finally, there’s the roadmap. XYZVerse has committed to a Token Generation Event (TGE) in the second half of 2025, followed by listings on centralized and decentralized exchanges at a projected $0.10 launch price. These steps are documented, with stage-based progress leading up to launch. BlockDAG continues to delay major roadmap milestones, including token release and listing plans, without offering firm deadlines or accountability. Bottom Line BlockDAG may talk big—with flashy partnerships and a $300 million headline—but its lack of transparency, anonymous team, and unverifiable funding raise serious doubts. The absence of working products, clear tokenomics, and public code only adds to investor skepticism. In contrast, XYZVerse is quietly building trust the right way: with completed audits, a fully KYC’d team, live utility through bookmaker.XYZ, and a structured, public presale. It doesn’t promise the moon—it delivers verifiable progress. Until BlockDAG proves its claims with on-chain proof and product delivery, it remains a marketing-driven gamble. For investors looking for credibility, accountability, and real-world application, XYZVerse is the safer, smarter choice. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Google, a major player in information access, is constantly innovating how we consume information. For those following the intersection of technology and finance, understanding these shifts is crucial. Google Search is now experimenting with a feature designed to change how you interact with search results: Audio Overviews. What are Audio Overviews in Google Search? Google announced it is testing Audio Overviews for specific Search queries. This feature offers users a new way to quickly grasp the main points of a search result without needing to read text. It leverages Google’s advanced artificial intelligence to generate a concise audio summary. The concept of Audio Overviews isn’t entirely new within Google’s ecosystem. It was initially introduced in NotebookLM, Google’s AI-powered research tool, allowing users to create audio summaries from their documents. Google also brought this capability to its Gemini AI interface in March, expanding its reach. Powered by Advanced Gemini Models Google states that these new Audio Overviews for Google Search are powered by its latest Gemini models. This highlights the increasing integration of sophisticated AI into core Google products. Using Gemini models allows the system to understand complex queries and synthesize information into a coherent, easy-to-listen audio format. The goal is to provide an alternative method for users to absorb and understand information, catering to different learning preferences and situations. Benefits and How to Access Audio Overviews Google explained the primary benefit: “An audio overview can help you get a lay of the land, offering a convenient, hands-free way to absorb information whether you’re multitasking or simply prefer an audio experience.” This makes information more accessible, especially when you’re on the go, exercising, or simply prefer listening over reading. The feature is currently available in Google Labs, the company’s platform for testing experimental features. Here’s how it generally works: When you perform a Google Search query, if Google’s system determines an Audio Overview would be useful, it will offer the option to generate one. Clicking the option generates a short audio summary. An audio player appears with standard controls: play/pause, volume adjustment, and playback speed options. Importantly, Google displays links within the audio player, showing the sources of the information. Users can click these source links to dive deeper into the topic after listening to the overview. Users participating in the Labs experiment can provide feedback (thumbs up or down) on individual Audio Overviews and the experiment as a whole. Audio Overviews vs. AI Overviews Audio Overviews build upon the concept of AI Overviews, the text-based AI-generated summaries that Google has been providing for certain Search queries. While AI Overviews offer a quick written summary at the top of the search results page, Audio Overviews provide the same concept in an auditory format. This expansion into audio reflects Google’s effort to make information retrieval more flexible and accessible, particularly targeting auditory learners or those seeking hands-free information access. Implications and the Future of Search Queries This development comes at a time when the impact of AI-powered search features on content publishers is a subject of discussion. Recent reports have noted that AI Overviews and similar tools can potentially reduce traffic to news websites by providing summaries directly in the search results. Audio Overviews continue this trend of providing synthesized information directly within Google Search. While beneficial for user convenience, the long-term effects on the broader web ecosystem and content creators remain a key consideration as Google AI features become more integrated into everyday search experiences. The introduction of Audio Overviews powered by Gemini models is a significant step in how Google is rethinking the presentation of Search queries. It underscores the growing role of AI in making information more accessible and adaptable to different user needs and situations, pushing the boundaries of traditional text-based search.

However, the absence of crucial evidence such as a visible team, a verified whitepaper, and on-chain validation raises significant skepticism about these claims. In contrast, XYZVerse presents a starkly different narrative. With its adherence to audits, a clear KYC process, and a tangible utility in the blockchain space, it stands out as a beacon of transparency and investor confidence. Analyzing BlockDAG's Claimed Innovations and Market Presence BlockDAG’s marketing campaigns boast an extensive $300 million presale influx and strategic partnerships, purportedly setting it apart in the competitive blockchain landscape. However, several indicators suggest these claims might not hold water: Minimal activity on development platforms like GitHub contrasts sharply with their claimed technological advancements. Duplicated content in their whitepaper, similar to that of Kaspa’s, raises questions about the authenticity of their documentation. The emergence of related scam sites, as highlighted in online forums, further tarnishes its credibility. Source: Reddit Discussion on BlockDAG Scams These concerns are echoed by the community on platforms like Reddit, where users express doubt over the legitimacy of BlockDAG's fundraising and operational practices. Comparative Analysis: Why XYZVerse Outshines BlockDAG Unlike BlockDAG, XYZVerse has carved a niche in the blockchain market through genuine and verifiable strides: XYZVerse underpins its market claims with concrete evidence, including $14 million raised from a fully audited presale and a functional dApp ecosystem that confirms its utility and investor appeal. Source: Reddit Analysis of XYZVerse The clear, documented tokenomics and operational transparency of XYZVerse present a reliable and structured investment opportunity, starkly different from the speculative and unverified propositions of BlockDAG. Conclusion: Evaluating the Trustworthiness of Blockchain Innovations While BlockDAG continues to make headlines with its high-profile claims and partnerships, the lack of foundational transparency and verifiable data casts a shadow over its legitimacy. On the other hand, XYZVerse’s approach of maintaining open audits, clear financial handling, and live product deployments positions it as a more reliable and trustworthy venture in the blockchain space.

In a new interview on CNBC, Novogratz says Bitcoin has become an “institutionalized macro asset” just like gold or silver. According to Novogratz, the rising number of institutional investors putting money into Bitcoin will further draw more investors into an asset with a fixed supply. “More and more people are realizing this is a story that they want to care about. And so once Larry Fink said BlackRock’s getting behind this, all that pushing the snowball uphill, it started rolling downhill. And now we’ve got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we’ve got sovereign wealth [funds] buying Bitcoin, we’ve got retail investors buying Bitcoin, there are easier ways to get it. And so the adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset, as an asset to save money in, I think that’s now a ball rolling downhill.” The Galaxy Digital CEO says Bitcoin could go up by over 9x from the current level as it increasingly becomes accepted as a store of value by younger generations. “The bull case becomes that over time, young people care about it more than old people. And so gold slowly gets replaced by Bitcoin. If you look at gold’s market cap and Bitcoin’s market cap, Bitcoin has a long way to go – 10x. And so that’s a $1 million Bitcoin just to be where gold is. And I think gold should go from $3,000 to $10,000.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,662 at time of writing.

The “initiation” ceremony took place Friday, one day before the Army’s 250th birthday. The four tech leaders, Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth, OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil, Palantir Chief Technology Officer Shyam Sankar, and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab and former Chief Research Officer at OpenAI, have enlisted in the Executive Innovation Corps under the Army Reserve. Their mission is to make technological advancements like artificial intelligence “more familiar” to the military while working part-time and as civilians. Officials did not disclose the planned size of the detachment. According to an Army statement , Detachment 201 is designed to “bridge the commercial-military tech gap” by adding the input of private-sector leaders directly into military projects. Each executive will serve as a senior advisor for approximately 120 hours annually. Tech executives training military to be ‘combat-ready’ According to the Wall Street Journal, the executives will be responsible for advising the Army on AI-powered systems, drones, and battlefield robotics. “Det. 201 is an effort to recruit senior tech executives to serve part-time in the Army Reserve as senior advisors,” the Army stated in a press release. “In this role they will work on targeted projects to help guide rapid and scalable tech solutions to complex problems.” Andrew Bosworth, 43, who leads Meta’s hardware and XR initiatives, said he had a personal desire in joining the program as it could honor his family’s military legacy. “ It’s possible I watched too much ‘Top Gun ,’” he joked. At over six feet tall, Bosworth once aspired to fly fighter jets but was told he was too tall for the cockpit. Now, he sees this opportunity as a meaningful way to serve. The company he works for is behind the Maven Smart System and the AI-powered TITAN vehicle currently in development for the Army. The announcement comes against the backdrop of the Army Transformation Initiative, launched and led by Secretary Daniel Driscoll and Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George. The initiative is meant to get rid of obsolete systems and take up “dual-use” commercial technology. Driscoll has asked the US Department of Defense to increase the procurement of commercial off-the-shelf solutions and make reforms to acquisitions. Solutions to the military-tech divide The Army says Detachment 201 will contribute to projects like the Army Transformation Initiative, that could make the force more technologically advanced . “ We need to go faster, and that’s exactly what we are doing here ,” said Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George. He joked about making the tech leaders nervous about physical training, saying he had “been giving them a hard time” about the difficulty of the tests. Brynt Parmeter, the Pentagon’s chief talent management officer, has led the formation of the new program since 2023. He hopes Detachment 201 will open doors for other branches of the military to create similar initiatives. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The ongoing debate around TikTok’s legal status in the United States isn’t just about national security—it’s about control. With millions of creators relying on TikTok for visibility and income, the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the platform’s future highlights the significant impact centralized platforms can have on creators’ livelihoods. In these environments, key aspects of a creator’s presence—from monetization to content accessibility—are shaped by decisions that may not always align with their interests. You might also like: Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion TikTok’s situation highlights a broader issue. In recent years, creators on web2 platforms have faced abrupt policy shifts that have significantly impacted their earnings and reach. The YouTube ‘Adpocalypse’ of 2016-2017, for example, saw a wave of videos demonetized due to revised advertising policies. Likewise, Patreon’s fee structure changes in 2017 raised concerns among smaller creators. In 2018, platform-wide content policy updates on Tumblr disrupted longstanding communities. Even changes to Instagram’s algorithm have altered how and whether creators’ content reaches their audiences, often without transparency or recourse. These examples reflect a recurring pattern: creators on centralized platforms often have limited control over the environments in which they operate. In such systems, policies, algorithms, and monetization options are subject to frequent change, and creators rarely have a say in the process. While decentralized platforms have yet to become mainstream alternatives, they offer a promising path forward. Historically, challenges such as cost, performance limitations, and clunky interfaces have hindered adoption. But many of these issues are being actively addressed, especially in how data is stored and accessed. Decentralized platforms can offer creators greater control over their content and its management. Permanent storage is ideal for preserving essential content such as posts and profiles, while temporary storage enables fast, flexible delivery of dynamic or short-lived data. By combining both models, creators can optimize their digital presence for speed, accessibility, and resilience. The next generation of platforms must prioritize user experience, offering seamless integration with familiar tools, intuitive interfaces, and the reliability that users have come to expect. Web3 won’t displace web2 overnight, but it can offer creators an empowering alternative built on transparency, autonomy, and sustainability. Decentralized storage solutions, such as Arweave, enable creators to maintain long-term access to their content while reducing their dependence on centralized gatekeepers. This model not only increases resilience against censorship or algorithmic suppression but also opens up new opportunities for monetization that are not tied to the priorities of large tech corporations. To succeed, web3 solutions must go beyond ideology. They need to deliver concrete improvements, such as more efficient uploads, scalable storage, and interfaces that fit into creators’ existing workflows without forcing them to start from scratch. As someone working directly in the digital media industry, I’ve seen how vital it is for creators to have true ownership over their work. Decentralization and free speech are not just ideals—they are practical foundations for building more sustainable and creator-centric ecosystems. What sets decentralized platforms apart is their transparency and openness. Features like open-source software, decentralized provider networks, user-driven storage options, and transparent pricing models reduce the risk of sudden, opaque policy shifts. These design choices offer a degree of protection and predictability that centralized systems often lack. The ongoing legal uncertainty around TikTok is just the latest chapter in an ongoing story: centralized platforms can be unstable ground for creators. It’s time for a shift. The promise of decentralization—when paired with well-designed systems for both permanent and temporary storage—offers creators a real opportunity to regain control over their content, distribution, and earnings. The time to build that future is now. At Odysee, we’re committed to giving creators genuine ownership over their work and a platform that respects their autonomy. With the integration of permanent storage networks like Arweave, we are taking decisive steps toward a more open, resilient, and creator-first digital economy.

In fact, for investors who can spot well-structured projects with clear roadmaps and credible development teams, presales remain one of the few entry points where significant upside is still possible. With many established tokens already priced at multi-billion-dollar valuations, presales offer a rare chance to get in early—before listings, before hype peaks, and before retail waves arrive. The five projects in this list represent some of the more compelling cases for why this route still matters in 2025. In a crowded presale market where many projects focus on infrastructure, AI, or asset tokenization, XYZVerse introduces a different kind of narrative. Rexas Finance is bringing real estate on-chain, Unilabs is leveraging AI for DeFi portfolio tools, Solaxy is refining Solana’s scalability with a Layer‑2 approach, and BlockDAG is exploring mobile mining through a DAG-based framework. XYZVerse (XYZ): The Sports Meme Coin Aiming to Redefine Fan-Based Crypto XYZVerse is positioning itself as the first-ever sports-themed memecoin, aiming to bridge fandom—from football to esports—with meme culture. The presale price has soared from $0.0001 at launch to ~$0.003333 in later stages, and over $14 million has already been raised. Organizers anticipate the final presale price to reach $0.02, with a target listing around $0.10, hinting at potential multiple-fold returns. Tokenomics include deflationary mechanics: a notable portion of tokens are burned during the presale, portions are reserved for liquidity, and community airdrops are planned—designed to reward early supporters. The project has secured smart contract audits and incorporated community-driven initiatives like ambassador programs and decentralized betting features. Analysts have compared its growth and investor appeal to other meme tokens, with some suggesting XYZVerse may outperform established players in the under‑$1 meme-token space. Rexas Finance (RXS): Tokenizing Real Estate and Hard Assets for On-Chain Ownership Rexas Finance focuses on tokenizing real-world assets—like real estate—targeting institutional and retail investors. The presale has advanced to Stage 12, with each RXS priced at $0.20; the planned listing price is around $0.25. From an initial round at $0.03, the project has achieved a roughly 6x increase and raised approximately $49–51 million. Scheduled to close June 19, 2025, Rexas offers governance token utility for platform decisions. It supports payment via ETH and USDT, though critics have raised concerns about regulatory uncertainty, competition from more established platforms, and the risk that early presale holders may sell after launch. Unilabs Finance (UNIL): AI-Powered DeFi Portfolio Management for the Next Cycle Unilabs combines AI-driven portfolio management with DeFi. With over $30 million in assets managed, the token began at $0.004 and is now selling for approximately $0.0051 in its current stage, with a projected listing around $0.05—potentially offering a 10× return. The presale has raised between $2–3 million, and analysts highlight its advanced AI tools for asset selection and fee redistribution to token holders. Some forecasts predict continued mid-term growth into 2026. However, the competitive landscape and dependence on timely platform delivery are key risks to monitor. Solaxy (SOLX): A High-Speed Solana Layer‑2 With Testnet and Cross-Chain Potential Solaxy presents a Layer‑2 solution built on Solana, focusing on speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. The testnet is underway, and the presale has collected roughly $43–48 million. Token pricing started around $0.001626 and has risen to approximately $0.00179. The presale is concluding on June 16, 2025, with expectations of strong exchange interest. It includes staking options offering attractive APRs (86–112%) and a bridge to Ethereum utilizing Hyperlane, underscoring a focus on interoperability. Institutional interest appears significant, although the broader Layer‑2 sector is crowded and execution will be critical. BlockDAG Network (BDAG): Mobile-Mining Layer 1 With Massive Fundraising Momentum BlockDAG is a hybrid blockchain/DAG protocol targeting mobile mining and rapid scalability. Its presale has raised over $291 million, with more than 22 billion tokens sold. Current presale pricing is around $0.018–0.026, with an intended listing near $0.05—suggesting a potential 2,500–2,700% return. The project allows users to mine via mobile app, with staking and security features embedded, and ambitious plans to launch a mainnet within six months. While fundraising has been record-breaking, the long-term value depends heavily on executing on fast delivery timelines . Summary & Considerations XYZVerse stands out for its sports‑focused memecoin model, presale performance, deflationary approach, and clear roadmap toward listing and on-chain utility. Rexas Finance offers real-world asset access and governance participation, with strong financial momentum but also regulatory and competition challenges. Unilabs Finance delivers AI‑DeFi innovation and revenue-sharing structures, though it must navigate a crowded space and ensure platform delivery. Solaxy provides a technically solid Layer‑2 solution with a testnet and staking features, but faces stiff competition. BlockDAG has raised massive capital and combines mobile mining with scalability, though its prospects rely on speed of execution. Final Note Presales may not grab headlines like major token listings or billion-dollar market cap rallies, but they continue to offer one of the few remaining frontiers for outsized returns—especially for early, informed participants. The five projects explored here—ranging from cultural plays like XYZVerse to infrastructure-focused platforms like BlockDAG and Solaxy—demonstrate that innovation is still happening at the ground floor. As always, due diligence is critical. Roadmaps can shift, teams must deliver, and market conditions can turn quickly. But for those willing to do the work, the presale market in 2025 remains very much alive—and, for the right picks, still full of possibility.

Despite the crowded landscape, projects like XYZVerse, Rexas, and BlockDAG stand out, providing promising prospects before they even hit mainstream exchanges. Among the myriad of projects focusing on diverse areas such as AI integration, infrastructure enhancement, and asset tokenization, certain initiatives like XYZVerse have carved distinct niches. These projects are not only redefining the standard presale model but are also setting new benchmarks for success and investor engagement. The Dynamic Appeal of XYZVerse With an innovative approach to integrating sports and meme culture, XYZVerse has captivated a broad audience, elevating the concept of fan-based cryptocurrencies. This project began its journey at a mere $0.0001 per token and witnessed a remarkable surge to about $0.003333, raising over $14 million in the process. Featuring a deflationary token model, the platform has introduced mechanisms such as token burns and community airdrops to sustain growth and reward early adopters. The projected final presale price aims at $0.02 per token, with aspirations to reach $0.10 post-listing, suggesting a lucrative potential return for initial investors. Rexas Finance and the Future of Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance has significantly influenced the real estate and hard asset sectors by introducing tokenization to a wider audience. Starting from a humble $0.03, it has escalated to $0.20 in its latest presale stage, amassing between $49 and $51 million in investor funds. Despite facing regulatory challenges and stiff competition, Rexas maintains its allure through its innovative governance model, allowing token holders to steer platform decisions, an appealing feature that enhances its investment case as the project nears its presale conclusion on June 19, 2025. Emerging Trends: AI-Driven DeFi and Advanced Blockchain Solutions The presale landscape is also enriched by projects like Unilabs and Solaxy. Unilabs is pioneering AI-driven portfolio management within the DeFi sector, managing assets worth over $30 million, with its presale phase drawing keen interest from tech-savvy investors. Similarly, Solaxy leverages Solana’s infrastructure to enhance blockchain scalability and speed, attracting a substantial $43 to $48 million in investments during its presale. The Revolutionary Potential of BlockDAG Network In the landscape of mobile mining and scalability, the BlockDAG Network emerges as a formidable contender. Its presale phase has been a record-breaking success, amassing over $291 million, with plans to launch a mainnet within the next six months. Summary The highlighted projects showcase the diversity and innovation still prevalent in the cryptocurrency presale arena. Each offers unique features, from XYZVerse's fan-centric approach to BlockDAG's mobile mining capabilities, painting a promising picture for early investors in 2025.",More News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MINING|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-06-14 09:19:05

Key Takeaways: The SEC approved Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin-linked registration, covering 85 million shares. TMTG says it has no immediate plans to issue new securities despite gaining shelf flexibility. CEO Devin Nunes says the firm aims to grow its media, fintech, and Bitcoin holdings in parallel. The decision, revealed in a June 13 filing , marks a major regulatory step for the company behind Truth Social, the platform founded by President Donald Trump and partially owned by him. According to the filing, the SEC declared effective TMTG’s S-3 registration statement, initially submitted on June 6. Trump Media Registers 85M Shares Linked to $2.3B Bitcoin Deal: SEC The document outlines the registration of roughly 56 million shares and an additional 29 million shares tied to convertible notes, forming part of the firm’s broader equity and debt agreements with approximately 50 investors. The total proceeds from these arrangements amount to $2.3 billion. Although the registration includes a universal shelf to allow TMTG greater capital-raising flexibility, the company said it has “no immediate plans” to issue new securities under the provision. The move appears more strategic than urgent, aligning with TMTG’s stated ambition to evolve beyond its media roots. TMTG President and CEO Devin Nunes said the company is now pushing forward on multiple fronts. “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities,” Nunes said. “By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our fintech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy.” SEC APPROVES TRUMP MEDIA’S BITCOIN TREASURY DEAL pic.twitter.com/bybvEZ5TjS — Kyle Chassé / DD (@kyle_chasse) June 13, 2025 Despite the regulatory win, TMTG shares dropped 2.06% on the day of the announcement, closing at $19.52. TMTG Confirms $2.5B Capital Raise to Buy Bitcoin The SEC’s green light comes just weeks after TMTG confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to accumulate Bitcoin, following earlier denials. In that May 27 announcement, Nunes characterized Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” asserting that it would become a core part of the company’s asset base. On May 28, Arkham Intelligence posted on X, “Donald Trump’s company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?” — referencing MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and his aggressive Bitcoin strategy. TMTG isn’t stopping there. On June 5, the company filed for approval to launch its own Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), signaling even deeper ambitions in digital assets. According to the filing, the ETF would hold Bitcoin in custody and aim to mirror its market performance.

Founded by Sunny Lu, former CIO of Louis Vuitton China, VeChain moved from Ethereum to its own blockchain, VeChainThor, in 2018. It introduced a dual-token system with VET for value transfer and VTHO for transaction fees. Its proof of authority mechanism enhances transaction validation. With partnerships like PricewaterhouseCoopers, Walmart China, and BMW, VeChain demonstrates practical use cases. In the current market cycle, VET looks attractive due to its unique focus on supply chain solutions. While staking rewards are low, the potential for growth and passive income is promising. Compared to other coins, VeChain’s real-world utility sets it apart, making it a noteworthy player in the blockchain industry. Stellar Lumens: Bridging the World’s Financial Systems Since 2014, Stellar (XLM) has been on a mission to make money transfers faster and cheaper. It’s a decentralized network that uses blockchain to move funds quickly. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that aim to replace traditional finance, Stellar wants to improve it. With Stellar, you can send any type of currency—dollars, euros, or even Bitcoin—across borders with ease. Its own cryptocurrency, Stellar Lumens, helps make these transactions smooth. Big companies have noticed; Stellar has processed billions of transactions and partnered with major firms to connect different financial systems. Stellar’s potential lies in uniting diverse financial networks. People can use Stellar apps to send money globally, and businesses can build blockchain tools or handle payments on the network. The Stellar Development Foundation, backed initially by Stripe, is pushing its use for things like NFTs and smart contracts. In today’s market, where speed and low fees matter, Stellar stands out. While some cryptocurrencies struggle with slow or costly transactions, Stellar offers a practical solution that’s already making a difference. As global finance evolves, Stellar Lumens looks like a promising player to watch.

This development is particularly relevant to the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, which often intersects with cutting-edge technology and its regulatory landscape. The recently passed bill, known as the RAISE Act, aims to establish guardrails around powerful frontier AI models developed by major players like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. What is the New York AI Bill All About? The core purpose of the New York AI bill is to prevent future disaster scenarios potentially fueled by advanced AI systems. The bill specifically defines a disaster as an event causing death or injury to more than 100 people, or resulting in over $1 billion in damages. This focus on tangible, high-impact harm distinguishes the bill’s scope. The passage of the RAISE Act is seen as a notable victory for the AI safety movement. This group, which includes prominent figures like Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton and AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio, advocates for prioritizing caution and safety measures as AI technology rapidly advances. Their support highlights the bill’s alignment with calls from leading researchers for responsible AI development. Boosting Transparency Among Leading AI Labs A key component of the RAISE Act is its requirement for enhanced transparency from major AI labs . Should the bill be signed into law by Governor Kathy Hochul, it would mandate that the world’s largest AI companies publish detailed safety and security reports on their frontier models. This would be America’s first set of legally required transparency standards for such advanced AI. The bill also includes provisions requiring these companies to report safety incidents. This could involve disclosing concerning behaviors exhibited by an AI model or reporting instances of bad actors attempting to steal or misuse an AI system. Failure to meet these standards could result in significant civil penalties, potentially up to $30 million, enforceable by the New York Attorney General. Comparing New York’s Approach to Previous AI Regulation Efforts The RAISE Act shares many goals and provisions with California’s earlier attempt at AI regulation , SB 1047, which ultimately faced a veto. However, sponsors of the New York bill, like state Senator Andrew Gounardes, emphasize that they deliberately designed the RAISE Act to avoid stifling innovation, particularly among startups and academic researchers. This was a common criticism leveled against the California bill. Senator Gounardes noted the urgency of implementing safeguards, stating, “The window to put in place guardrails is rapidly shrinking given how fast this technology is evolving.” He added that even experts familiar with AI express alarm about the likelihood of these risks, underscoring the motivation behind the bill. Addressing Industry Concerns and the Scope of the Bill The RAISE Act is specifically designed to regulate the world’s largest companies whose AI models were trained using more than $100 million in computing resources and are available to New York residents. This includes tech giants based both domestically and internationally, such as OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, and Alibaba. Despite this focused approach, the bill has faced pushback from Silicon Valley. New York state Assemblymember Alex Bores, a co-sponsor, acknowledged this resistance but maintained that the bill would not hinder innovation. Even Anthropic, an AI safety focused company, expressed some reservations, with co-founder Jack Clark noting concerns that the bill might be too broad and potentially impact smaller companies, a criticism Senator Gounardes disputed, reiterating the bill’s narrow focus on large entities. Another common concern raised, similar to debates around European tech regulations, is that AI model developers might simply choose not to offer their most advanced models in New York. Assemblymember Bores countered this, suggesting the regulatory burden is light enough that withdrawing from the state wouldn’t be economically justified, especially given New York’s significant GDP. He expressed confidence that while there might be “political pettiness,” there are no strong economic reasons for companies to withhold their services from New York residents. The Path Forward for the RAISE Act With passage in the state legislature, the RAISE Act now awaits review by New York Governor Kathy Hochul. She has several options: signing it into law, sending it back for potential amendments, or vetoing it. The tech and safety communities will be closely watching her decision, as signing it would make New York the first state in America with legally mandated transparency standards specifically for advanced AI labs . Summary: A Step Towards Accountable AI The passage of the RAISE Act in New York marks a significant legislative effort to proactively address the potential catastrophic risks associated with powerful frontier AI models. By focusing on transparency, incident reporting, and civil penalties for the largest AI labs , the bill aims to establish a framework for accountability. While facing industry pushback and comparisons to previous regulatory attempts, sponsors argue the bill is narrowly tailored to promote AI safety without stifling innovation, particularly for smaller entities. The fate of this potentially landmark AI regulation now rests with the Governor. To learn more about the latest AI regulation trends, explore our article on key developments shaping AI policy .

Amid this new cycle, investors are looking for the gem that gives them massive returns in the ongoing altcoin boom. In every cycle, there is always one hidden token that surprises everyone after going live. Such a token always starts small, raising a bit of excitement amongst smart investors who take time to study the market, before it explodes onto the scene. In the current bull cycle, that coin is shaping up to be Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Investors are scrambling to secure a massive haul before the latecomers find out about it on CoinMarketCap, when the price goes parabolic. A Deep Dive Into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the latest entrant into the crypto space that is causing excitement all over. It is built as a decentralized, non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. Lenders provide liquidity in the pools for a chance to earn passive income through an annualized percentage yield. The interest that they earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate. As more borrowers join a pool, the interest rate rises, which encourages them to repay their loans. Meanwhile, more lenders join the pool to benefit from the higher yields. The positive feedback loop ensures that a pool attains optimal capital utilization. As borrowers, the goal is to get loans using overcollateralized collateral. The loan can be used to take advantage of market opportunities without having to spend your collateral. As the value of the collateral rises, you can repay the loans and get back your full amount. Borrowers can choose between stable and variable interest rates. A stable interest rate allows borrowers to make predictable repayments. To maintain the health of the protocol, the stable rate is only available to assets that have high levels of liquidity and low volatility. How High Could MUTM Tokens Rise? According to analysts, the price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens could rise as high as $2 when they go live. The Mutuum Finance project is currently in the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 in the current phase 5 of the presale. So far, over $10.6 million has been raised in the ongoing presale, with over 35% of the tokens allocated for the current phase sold, barely two weeks after launch. The presale has seen massive participation numbers, which currently stand at around 12,000 unique buyers. In the upcoming phase of the presale, the token price will rise by 16.67% to $0.035. This will also see the guaranteed ROI, based on the $0.06 listing price, fall from 100% to 71.43%. Based on the analysts’ forecast of a price of $2 when the tokens go live, that is a 6566.67% increase for those who buy their tokens in the presale at the current price of $0.03. For a clearer view of this increase, let us take the example of a buyer who purchases $1,345 worth of MUTM presale tokens. At the projected increase to $2 when the tokens go live, the buyer would see their investment grow to just over $89,666. That is a massive return that should not be ignored. While that might seem like a lot, it is quite common in the crypto sector. For instance, since DOGE launched, its price has grown by 33686.14%. While the MUTM token may not offer the same returns as DOGE a few days after launch, the gains will be more sustainable. A major downside to meme coins like DOGE is that they are prone to wild market swings, which makes it difficult to accurately plot an exit. Maintaining Positive Price Pressure One of the most notable aspects of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the buy and distribute program. In this program, protocol profits are used to purchase MUTM tokens off the open market and distributed to mtToken holders. That encourages more people to join the protocol, while also boosting the price of MUTM tokens on the open market. Since the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is listed on CoinMarketCap, these price increases will be visible to the masses, which will boost interest in the tokens. CoinMarketCap has over 350 million monthly visitors, and this could prove to be one of the biggest sources of growth for the token price. This program will ensure long-term sustainable returns for early investors. Coupled with various protocol safeguards that include careful vetting of new tokens, this could make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the most valuable tokens of the new age of crypto. Massive Giveaway To reward early investors in the protocol, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized a $100,000 giveaway . This ongoing giveaway will reward ten lucky winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The giveaway is open to everyone who participates in the presale with a minimum $50 purchase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a new era for the crypto sector, built on sustainable returns and long-term value increase. You have a chance to be part of this exciting new future at the low price of $0.03 per token in the ongoing presale.

While the crypto market often grabs headlines, traditional Forex markets continue to influence global economics and investment strategies. Recently, Bank of America (BofA) released its latest Swedish Krona forecast , offering a compelling view on its potential performance, particularly when stacked against its Scandinavian neighbor, the Norwegian Krone. Why the Swedish Krona Forecast Looks Positive to Bank of America Bank of America analysts have pointed towards several key factors underpinning their optimistic outlook for the Swedish Krona. Their analysis suggests that fundamental economic shifts and central bank policy trajectories are creating a favorable environment for SEK relative to NOK. Key reasons cited by BofA include: Economic Resilience: Despite global headwinds, the Swedish economy is showing signs of resilience in specific sectors. BofA believes this underlying strength provides a better foundation for the Krona compared to Norway’s economy, which is heavily influenced by oil price volatility. Central Bank Divergence: The Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) and Norges Bank (Norway’s central bank) are on potentially different paths regarding monetary policy. BofA’s BofA currency view takes into account anticipated interest rate decisions and quantitative easing/tightening measures that could widen the yield differential in favor of the Krona. Relative Valuation: The Krona may be undervalued relative to the Krone based on long-term economic fundamentals. BofA’s models suggest a potential correction in this valuation gap. Inflation Dynamics: Differences in inflation trends and how central banks are tackling them play a crucial role. BofA assesses that Sweden’s approach and inflation trajectory could be more supportive of currency strength moving forward. This confluence of factors forms the basis of BofA’s prediction that the Swedish Krona is likely to outperform the Norwegian Krone in the near to medium term. Understanding the SEK NOK Forecast Dynamics The relationship between the Swedish Krona (SEK) and the Norwegian Krone (NOK) is often closely watched due to their geographical proximity and intertwined economies. However, despite similarities, key differences drive their respective currency values. The SEK NOK forecast from institutions like BofA highlights these divergences. Norway’s economy, and consequently the Krone, is significantly impacted by global energy prices, particularly oil and gas. As a major energy exporter, higher oil prices generally support the Norwegian Krone, while lower prices can weaken it. Sweden, on the other hand, has a more diversified industrial and service-based economy, making its currency less directly tied to commodity fluctuations. Here’s a simplified comparison of factors influencing each currency: Factor Swedish Krona (SEK) Norwegian Krone (NOK) Economic Base Diversified industry, services, exports Heavily reliant on oil & gas exports Commodity Sensitivity Lower Higher (especially oil prices) Central Bank (Monetary Policy) Riksbank Norges Bank Key Risks Global demand for exports, housing market Oil price volatility, global energy demand BofA’s analysis suggests that current conditions, including potential shifts in energy markets and differing central bank responses to inflation and growth, favor the structural position of the Swedish Krona over the Norwegian Krone. What Does This Norwegian Krone Forecast Imply for the Market? A bearish outlook on the Norwegian Krone relative to the Swedish Krona has direct implications for Forex traders and investors with exposure to these currencies. The Norwegian Krone forecast from BofA suggests that positioning for SEK strength against NOK could be a profitable strategy. Actionable insights derived from such a forecast might include: Trading the Pair: Traders might consider going ‘long’ SEK and ‘short’ NOK, effectively betting on the SEK/NOK exchange rate to rise. Portfolio Hedging: Businesses or investors with significant exposure to Norway (e.g., receiving payments in NOK) might consider hedging this risk by buying SEK or other stronger currencies. Investment Decisions: For those looking to invest in Scandinavian assets, a stronger SEK could make Swedish assets relatively more attractive or Norwegian assets less so, depending on the investment goal and currency exposure. It is crucial, however, to remember that currency markets are volatile, and forecasts are not guarantees. Geopolitical events, unexpected economic data, or sudden shifts in commodity prices can quickly alter currency trajectories. Broader Implications for the Forex Market Forecast While the SEK vs NOK prediction is specific, it fits into the broader picture of the current Forex market forecast . Currency analysts globally are grappling with the effects of persistent inflation, varying paces of post-pandemic economic recovery, and the tightening (or potential easing) of monetary policies by major central banks. The BofA view on SEK vs NOK highlights a theme seen in other currency pairs: the divergence in economic fundamentals and central bank reactions is becoming a primary driver of exchange rates. Instead of broad market movements, we are seeing more pair-specific dynamics based on relative strengths and weaknesses. This means that for those involved in Forex, whether trading directly or managing international finances, a granular understanding of individual country economics and central bank intentions is more critical than ever. The SEK/NOK example serves as a micro-level illustration of these macro-level forces at play in the global currency markets. Challenges and Risks to the Forecast No financial forecast is without its risks. The BofA Swedish Krona forecast is subject to potential disruptions. Key challenges or events that could invalidate or alter the prediction include: Unexpected Riksbank/Norges Bank Policy Shifts: A sudden change in interest rate plans or quantitative measures by either central bank could quickly reverse currency movements. Commodity Price Swings: A significant and sustained rally in oil prices could provide unexpected support for the Norwegian Krone, challenging the forecast. Global Economic Shocks: A severe global recession or a major geopolitical event could impact both economies and currencies in unforeseen ways, potentially affecting their relative performance differently than anticipated. Swedish Housing Market Issues: Concerns about Sweden’s housing market have been a long-standing vulnerability for the Krona. A crisis in this sector could outweigh positive factors. Therefore, while BofA’s analysis provides a strong case, market participants should remain vigilant and monitor incoming data and events. Conclusion: Navigating the SEK and NOK Outlook Bank of America’s analysis presents a clear case for the Swedish Krona likely outperforming the Norwegian Krone, grounded in differing economic structures and central bank outlooks. Their BofA currency view provides valuable insight for anyone tracking Scandinavian currencies or looking for relative value opportunities in the Forex market. The prediction hinges on Sweden’s economic resilience and the Riksbank’s potential policy path offering more support for the Krona compared to Norway’s oil-dependent economy and the Norges Bank’s stance. However, like all financial forecasts, this outlook is subject to global economic shifts, commodity price volatility, and unexpected policy decisions. For traders and investors, this suggests paying close attention to the SEK/NOK pair and the underlying economic data from both countries. While the path may not be linear, BofA’s forecast provides a compelling narrative for potential SEK strength ahead.

This makes the system secure and resistant to fraud. About every four years, the reward miners get is cut in half in an event called ""halving."" There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, making it scarce like gold. In the current market, Bitcoin remains strong compared to other cryptocurrencies.

The exchange-traded fund will also include staking options for users. Fidelity isn’t the only firm eyeing a SOL ETF, with a flurry of companies issuing SOL ETF S-1 amendments on Friday, including VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, Grayscale, Canary Capital, and Franklin Templeton. VanEck was the first U.S. company to file for a spot Solana ETF in June 2024 and was also the last to submit its amended S-1 filing for the day. Fidelity advances toward a spot SOL ETF Fidelity submitted its S-1 statement Friday to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The firm acknowledged that the proposed Fidelity Solana Fund would operate as a Delaware statutory trust. The ETF’s goal is to mirror SOL’s performance based on the Fidelity Solana Reference Rate Index, which calculates price data using a volume-weighted median price after 15 seconds. The index aggregates prices from eligible spot markets and reflects the real-time value of SOL in U.S. dollars. The ETF issuer revealed that the fund aims to keep SOL in custody and earn extra yield by staking some of its holdings through vetted providers. The resulting staking rewards will be treated as income and distributed accordingly. Fidelity has named a custodian who will store all SOL in segregated accounts on behalf of the trust. According to the company, most assets will be held in cold storage with limited SOL in hot wallets for transactions. The firm also plans to list shares on the Cboe BZX Exchange, though the ticker symbol remains undisclosed. According to Fidelity, shares will be created and redeemed in large blocks called Baskets, mainly by authorized participants using either SOL or cash. The asset management firm added that daily net asset value (NAV) will be calculated using the same index method applied to SOL pricing. The filing also revealed an annual sponsor fee tied to the fund’s SOL assets, though the percentage remains undisclosed. Fidelity said the fee will cover most standard operating expenses, except for unusual costs and a separate staking-related fee paid to the custodian from staking rewards. Fidelity’s affiliate, FD Funds Management LLC, will sponsor the product. The firm said the Trust will not use leverage, derivatives, or complex instruments, keeping the structure simple for traditional investors. According to the asset management company, the custodian will control all private keys, and the sponsor will oversee staking activities and manage security. The Trust’s assets, including staked SOL, are not protected by the FDIC or SIPC insurance. To initiate the momentum, a sponsor affiliate purchased a single Seed Share to set up the fund. Fidelity also clarified that the trust isn’t registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which means investors won’t receive the same regulatory protections given to traditional mutual funds or ETFs that fall under that law. The trust needs registration approval from the SEC before sales can commence. Fidelity has labeled the trust as an emerging growth company, allowing it to follow scaled-back reporting rules initially. SEC urges ETF issuers to update their S-1 filings by June The latest filing follows the U.S. SEC’s directive last week for spot Solana ETF issuers to update their S-1 filings by June. Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said at the time that the agency’s request indicates it’s more likely than before to approve some of the products, giving a timeline of two to four months for spot SOL ETFs to go live. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart doubts the Solana ETF approval will come as soon as next week. “I think there needs to be a back and forth with the SEC and issuers to iron out details, so I doubt it. If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were a lot of filings over the preceding couple months before launch.” – James Seyffart , ETF Analyst at Bloomberg The regulator also reportedly asked issuers to update language surrounding in-kind redemptions and how issuers would approach staking. Firms have been advocating for the agency to approve Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs, which would earn holders staking yield. The SEC has approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as well as several blended crypto-equity funds. ETF issuers, including VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, recently urged the agency to practice a first-to-file approach, where the SEC prioritizes greenlighting financial products based on the order of arrival Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Big news dropped recently concerning one of the most prominent players in the digital asset space: Coinbase. If you’ve been keeping an eye on Coinbase stock (COIN), you’ll want to pay close attention to this development. A major financial services firm , Cantor Fitzgerald, has just updated its outlook on Coinbase, and it’s looking decidedly bullish. This isn’t just a minor tweak; they’ve significantly increased their Coinbase price target , signaling strong confidence in the company’s future trajectory. Why is Cantor Fitzgerald Bullish on the Coinbase Price Target? Let’s dive into the specifics of what the analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald are seeing. According to reports, they’ve upped their 12-month price forecast for Coinbase shares from a solid $253 to an impressive $292. That’s a notable jump and reflects a positive sentiment towards the company’s operational performance and strategic direction. Their reasoning centers on a couple of key areas: Strong Trading Operations: The analysts believe Coinbase is making significant headway in its core trading business. Continued progress here is seen as a primary driver for increasing its market share within the competitive crypto exchange landscape. As market conditions improve or volatility rises, Coinbase’s robust trading platform is well-positioned to capture more volume. Growth Beyond Trading: Perhaps more interestingly, Cantor Fitzgerald is also factoring in Coinbase’s initiatives outside of its traditional trading services. While these new ventures might not be massive revenue generators right now, they are expected to gradually reshape how investors perceive the business, moving beyond just a simple trading platform. This two-pronged view suggests that while current performance is strong, the long-term potential lies in Coinbase’s ability to diversify and innovate. Exploring Coinbase’s Non-Trading Growth Drivers What exactly are these ‘initiatives beyond trading’ that Cantor Fitzgerald is highlighting? Coinbase has been actively expanding its offerings to become a more comprehensive crypto financial institution. These include: Staking Services: Allowing users to earn rewards by holding certain cryptocurrencies. Custody Solutions: Providing secure storage for institutional and high-net-worth investors. Web3 & dApp Integration: Making it easier for users to interact with decentralized applications and the broader Web3 ecosystem. International Expansion: Entering new markets to capture a global user base. Layer 2 Solutions: Investing in or supporting scaling technologies to reduce transaction costs and increase speed. These efforts are crucial for Coinbase’s long-term strategy. They aim to create multiple revenue streams, reduce reliance solely on trading fees (which can be volatile), and build a sticky ecosystem that keeps users engaged even when trading volume is low. While the analysts don’t expect these new products to yield significant returns this year, their potential is clearly a factor in the revised Coinbase price target for the future. When Can Investors Expect a Shift in Sentiment? Timing is everything, and the Cantor Fitzgerald report offers a specific timeline for when these non-trading initiatives might start meaningfully impacting investor perception and, subsequently, the Coinbase stock price. They anticipate a significant shift in sentiment beginning in the second half of 2026 and continuing into 2027. Why the later timeline? Developing and scaling new financial products, especially in a nascent and regulated space like crypto, takes time. Building user adoption, proving profitability, and gaining regulatory clarity are processes that unfold over years, not months. The analysts’ forecast suggests they believe these efforts will reach a critical mass and start demonstrating tangible value to the market around that period. What Does a $292 Coinbase Price Target Mean for You? A raised Coinbase price target from a respected financial services firm like Cantor Fitzgerald is certainly positive news for existing shareholders and potential investors. However, it’s essential to view this within the broader context of market analysis and investment strategy. Benefits Highlighted: Validation of Coinbase’s strategic direction, particularly its diversification efforts. Potential for significant upside from the current trading price if the target is met. Indication of growing institutional confidence in the long-term viability of major crypto players. Potential Challenges & Considerations: Price targets are forecasts, not guarantees, and are subject to market volatility, regulatory changes, and execution risks by the company. Competition in the crypto exchange space remains fierce, with both centralized and decentralized platforms vying for market share. The broader crypto market’s health significantly impacts Coinbase’s performance. A downturn could negate positive company-specific developments. The timeline for sentiment shift (H2 2026/2027) is still several years away, requiring patience from investors. Actionable Insights: For investors, this report can serve as one data point among many. It reinforces the narrative that Coinbase is not standing still but is actively building for the future. However, any investment decision should be based on thorough personal research, understanding your own risk tolerance, and considering your overall portfolio strategy. Don’t rely solely on one analyst’s target, no matter how positive it seems. Comparing Analyst Views It’s also helpful to see how Cantor Fitzgerald’s target compares to others. While a comprehensive list is beyond the scope here, analyst ratings for Coinbase stock vary, reflecting different models, assumptions, and views on the crypto market’s future. Some analysts may have higher targets, others lower, and ratings range from ‘Buy’ to ‘Hold’ to ‘Sell’. The $292 target places Cantor Fitzgerald among the more optimistic outlooks currently reported. Understanding the range of analyst opinions provides a more balanced perspective on the potential paths forward for COIN. The Road Ahead for Coinbase and COIN Stock Coinbase operates at the intersection of traditional finance and the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. Its success is tied not only to its own execution but also to the broader adoption and regulation of cryptocurrencies globally. The endorsement from a financial services firm like Cantor Fitzgerald , with its increased Coinbase price target , underscores the growing mainstream attention and potential seen in this sector. The journey to $292 (or beyond, or below) will likely involve navigating complex regulatory landscapes, fending off competitors, and successfully launching and scaling those non-trading initiatives. The analysts’ belief in a sentiment shift by late 2026/2027 suggests they see these foundational efforts paying off and the market beginning to value Coinbase more like a diversified financial technology company than purely a transaction-based exchange. In Conclusion: A Bullish Signal Amidst Evolving Markets Cantor Fitzgerald’s decision to raise its Coinbase price target to $292 is a significant vote of confidence in the company’s operational strength and future growth potential, particularly its efforts to expand beyond core trading. While the anticipated major impact from new initiatives is still a few years out, the revised target provides a compelling outlook for the Coinbase stock . This move by a major financial services firm highlights the increasing maturity and complexity of the crypto market and the businesses operating within it. For investors, it’s a reminder that while volatility is inherent in the crypto space, many believe there is substantial long-term value to be unlocked by key players like Coinbase as the ecosystem continues to evolve.

The figure was revealed in Trump’s 2025 public financial disclosure, filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on June 13. The filing notes that Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in World Liberty Financial, which grants him voting rights within the organization. However, the document does not provide the market value of these tokens or whether the income was generated from token sales, staking rewards, or other mechanisms. The income is listed as “$57,437,927” with no further breakdown. A Bold Entry into the Crypto World World Liberty Financial, which launched in September 2024, is marketed as a decentralized finance (DeFi) initiative focused on dollar-pegged stablecoins and challenging traditional financial structures. Since its debut, WLFI has raised a total of $550 million —$200 million from its first public token sale and $250 million in the second, as disclosed in March 2025. The project has attracted attention from prominent crypto investors. Tron founder Justin Sun invested $30 million in November 2024, receiving 2 billion WLFI tokens at $0.015 each. In January, Web3Port invested $10 million, while Oddiyana Ventures joined as a strategic partner, though the amount of their investment remains undisclosed. Although the governance structure and utility of WLFI tokens remain vaguely defined in the filing, the reported income implies that Trump may have monetized part of his holdings or valued them based on high internal metrics. Trump and Digital Assets This is not the president’s first foray into digital assets. Previous disclosures revealed income from NFT-based ventures , including the Trump Digital Trading Cards collection. However, the latest filing shows no new earnings from NFTs. The president also retains titles in companies such as CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC, which are linked to digital ventures. While he still maintains positions in these entities, the filing indicates little or no income from them in the past year. The ethics disclosure concludes with Trump certifying that the information is “true, complete, and correct,” and it will now undergo review by the Office of Government Ethics.

The journalist laid out a valuation scenario originating from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s remarks about XRP capturing 14% of SWIFT’s global volume. At the 2025 APEX developer summit, the CEO predicted that XRP would capture 14% of SWIFT’s transaction volume in the next five years. Fruition Productions noted that capturing this portion of SWIFT’s $150 trillion in annual settlements would represent $21 trillion in value flowing through the XRP Ledger (XRPL). In that scenario, the asset could reach a price of $357 from a cross-border payment utility. If BRAD GARLINGHOUSE is right about $XRP taking 14% of the SWIFT network (150 trillion a year) then you would get 21 trillion in value on the XRPL network. That’s a $357 XRP price based on cross boarder payment utility. — Fruition Productions (@Fruition_Films) June 12, 2025 Increasing Utility and Adoption The calculation assumes XRP’s adoption in institutional financial networks and envisions a direct correlation between settlement volume and price. Fruition Productions clarified that this projection reflects utility-based pricing and is not dependent on speculation. This distinction separates the estimate from typical market-driven price targets. A follow-up post by the same account made an important point about Garlinghouse’s communication style, noting that CEOs tend to be conservative when speaking publicly. This suggests that XRP could play a more significant role in the global financial ecosystem, potentially capturing a larger portion of SWIFT’s transaction volume and reaching higher targets. Other Ripple executives have emphasized that the company is focused on driving real-world utility and long-term adoption rather than short-term price fluctuations. Gaining a dominant position in the cross-border payments market is a critical milestone in enhancing XRP’s functional value and broadening its global adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Institutional Strategy and Market Impact Brad Garlinghouse has long emphasized Ripple’s ambition to serve as a global payments infrastructure provider. His cautious approach in public statements is consistent with corporate leadership, but Fruition Productions’ posts suggest there’s room for optimism beyond what is publicly stated. With the XRPL offering fast, low-cost, and scalable settlement options, and given Ripple’s growing involvement in central bank digital currency (CBDC) development and enterprise integrations, the possibility of XRP exceeding a $357 valuation may not be entirely speculative. Ripple has been building partnerships with financial institutions across several regions, and XRP has already been integrated into payment corridors in Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East. Should XRP’s share of SWIFT-like traffic increase beyond 14%, the price ceiling could rise substantially, particularly if transactional demand drives daily usage volumes.

The outlook comes as Bitcoin stabilizes, following a pullback triggered by uncertainty tied to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. As of press time, BTC was trading at $105,124, down about 0.3% in the past 24 hours and more than 2% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, Bitcoin is trading above the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $103,326 and the 200-day SMA of $87,532, a sign of strength in both the short and long term. On the other hand, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 54.22, indicating neutral momentum, with room for further upside without immediate correction pressure. ChatGPT predicts Bitcoin price Regarding the price outlook, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s ChatGPT to gauge where Bitcoin might head over the next two weeks. According to the model, BTC could trade around $114,000 by July 1, likely between $111,000 and $117,000. The forecast is based on solid technical momentum, favorable historical trends, and steady institutional inflows. ChatGPT noted that 2025, a post-halving year, often brings Bitcoin gains. With continued ETF demand and institutional inflows, upward pressure will be seen throughout Q2. It also flagged $102,000 as key support. A drop below could lead to $98,000, while strong momentum could drive BTC to $120,000. Bitcoin AI price prediction.

Based on the current consolidation between $102,000 and $108,000, Grok projects Bitcoin will reach around $111,500 by July 1. The model noted Bitcoin’s tendency to post short-term gains after periods of sideways movement, especially in a supportive macro environment with continued ETF inflows. Assuming no major disruptions, Grok sees a reasonable 6% climb from current levels. However, Grok also outlined alternative scenarios: If resistance at $108,000 holds, a pullback to $103,000 could occur. Conversely, a breakout could push the price up to $116,000. In summary, both AI models remain bullish heading into July. The key focus is whether Bitcoin can hold the $105,000 level, a critical point for sustaining its upward momentum.

Price predictions for 2025 range from $300 to $710, with strong support at $300. By 2030, BCH could reach highs of $2,675, driven by increased adoption and transaction activity. With Bitcoin smashing through the $100K barrier, all eyes are now on Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as traders wonder— will BCH price follow with a banana move of its own? Beyond hype, Bitcoin Cash is proving its value in the real world. Ranked 4th on Crypwerk’s global adoption list, BCH is gaining traction for its speed, low fees, and merchant-friendly design. If you’re searching for answers to “ Will Bitcoin Cash go up further? ” — you’re not alone. In this Bitcoin Cash price prediction 2025–2030 , we dive into the technicals and adoption trends shaping the next big BCH Price Prediction . Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview CoinPedia’s Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction BCH Price Prediction 2025 Bitcoin Cash Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Bitcoin Cash Price Forecast 202 6 BCH Price Prediction 2027 Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2028 BCH Price Analysis 2029 Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Cash Token BCH Price $ 432.26845238 4.14% Market cap $ 8,594,978,703.6407 Circulating Supply 19,883,428.1250 Trading Volume $ 432,015,786.0378 All-time high $4,355.62 on 20th December 2017 All-time low $75.08 on 15th December 2018 CoinPedia’s Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction Coinpedia’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin Cash could potentially emerge as a more affordable version of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin Cash gains some hype in the coming months, then the BCH price can reach $701 in 2025. On the flip side, the BCH price can drop to $507 during that year. We expect the BCH price to create a new 2025 high of $701 during the upcoming altcoin season. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $507 $605 $701 BCH Price Prediction 2025 BCH’s price action has shown that, over the long term, it follows a multi-year trendline. Historically, during every bull run, the price has reversed after touching this long-term resistance line. In 2025, this pattern remains evident on the chart. The price lacked the strength to break above the multi-year trendline and reversed the strong gains seen on May 8th, even before reaching the dynamic trendline. After a failed breakout attempt on May 8th, BCH price consolidated and made another attempt in the third week. However, the momentum once again fell short, with the price getting rejected near the $433 resistance zone. In May’s final week, the crypto market shattered, and the BCH crypto market dipped significantly by June 1st week. The short-term crash lasted for 13 days before taking support from the dynamic 200-day EMA band. In the second week of June, the BCH price has jumped nearly 15% and trades near an important resistance zone. If Bullish momentum continues, then multi-year trendline resistance could be flipped by June end with $522 in sight, only if bullish momentum supports. Therefore, as seen in the past, if BCH fails to break out again, the $300 support level could step in to defend the decline, just as it has consistently done before. Furthermore, if BCH successfully breaks above the multi-year resistance trendline, then in the long term it would be a breakout from multi-year descending triangle formation, and the breakout could come big. As for this year, it could aim for a target of $710 by the end of 2025. On the other hand, if the breakout fails, the $300 support is expected to absorb the downside once again.

Understanding the prevailing sentiment is crucial for investors and traders alike. One of the most popular tools for gauging this collective mood is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Recently, this index has shown a significant shift, rising to 63 and firmly positioning itself within the ‘Greed’ zone. What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a unique tool designed by Alternative.me to visualize the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It aggregates various data points to produce a single number between 0 (Extreme Fear) and 100 (Extreme Greed). The core idea is that extreme fear can indicate a potential buying opportunity for those brave enough to enter a falling market, while extreme greed can signal that the market is due for a correction. Why does this matter? Because human psychology plays a massive role in financial markets. Fear can lead to panic selling, driving prices down further than fundamentals might suggest. Greed can lead to irrational exuberance, FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), and speculative buying, pushing prices into bubble territory. The index provides a snapshot of this emotional temperature, helping participants potentially make more rational decisions by understanding the crowd’s current mindset. Breaking Down the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Score The index categorizes sentiment across a spectrum: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed A reading of 63, as recently reported, falls comfortably within the ‘Greed’ category. This indicates that market participants are feeling optimistic, perhaps even euphoric, about current and future price movements. While not yet in the ‘Extreme Greed’ territory, it suggests a strong positive bias is currently dominating the Crypto Market Sentiment . Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have often coincided with market bottoms, presenting opportunities for long-term investors. Conversely, periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ have sometimes preceded market tops or significant pullbacks, as speculative excess becomes unsustainable. How is the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index Calculated? While often referred to in the context of the broader crypto market, the index is heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance, given its market dominance. The calculation incorporates six key factors, each weighted differently: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to average values. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): Compares current market volume and momentum to historical averages. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greedy or optimistic behavior. Social Media (15%): Analyzes tweets and posts for specific terms related to crypto, tracking sentiment and engagement speed. High interaction and positive sentiment can indicate growing greed. Surveys (15%): Polls users about their market sentiment. (Note: As mentioned in the source, surveys are currently paused, which might slightly affect this component’s input, although the weighting is applied to the remaining active factors). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Rising dominance can indicate fear (as investors move to the perceived ‘safer’ asset, BTC) or simply strong performance in Bitcoin itself. Falling dominance can signal increasing greed as altcoins rally more aggressively. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest, especially for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin bubble’, can signal fear, while terms related to buying or specific projects might suggest greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a more holistic view of the underlying Crypto Market Sentiment than simply looking at price charts alone. What Does Being in the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’ Mean for You? A reading of 63 in the ‘Greed’ zone carries several implications for those involved in the market: Potential Implications: Increased Optimism: Participants are generally feeling positive about the market’s direction. Higher Risk Appetite: Investors may be more willing to take on risk, potentially moving into more speculative altcoins. FOMO Setting In: The fear of missing out on potential gains can drive impulsive buying. Potential for Overheating: Markets driven purely by emotion and speculation can become detached from underlying value, increasing the risk of a sharp correction. While ‘Greed’ isn’t ‘Extreme Greed’, it serves as a yellow flag. It suggests caution is warranted. Prices may continue to rise, but the probability of a significant downturn increases as sentiment moves higher into the greed spectrum. Using the Crypto Fear and Greed Index in Your Crypto Investing Strategy The index is best used as one tool among many, not as a standalone signal. Here’s how it can fit into a broader Crypto Investing Strategy : Benefits: Sentiment Check: Provides a quick, aggregated view of market mood. Contrarian Indicator: Can help identify potential opportunities during ‘Extreme Fear’ (buy when others are fearful) or warn of potential tops during ‘Extreme Greed’ (be cautious when others are greedy). Historical Context: Comparing current readings to historical levels can offer perspective on where the market might be in its cycle. Challenges & Limitations: Not a Crystal Ball: The index cannot predict future price movements with certainty. A high greed score doesn’t guarantee an immediate crash, nor does a high fear score guarantee a bottom. Lagging Indicator: It reflects *current* sentiment, which is often a reaction to recent price action, not necessarily a predictor of future action. Component Reliance: Changes in the calculation method or data sources (like paused surveys) can affect its reliability. Bitcoin-Centric: While indicative of the overall market, it’s heavily weighted towards Bitcoin. Altcoin sentiment might differ. Actionable Insights: Combine with Analysis: Use the index alongside technical analysis (charts, patterns), fundamental analysis (project utility, adoption), and macroeconomic factors. Manage Risk: High greed scores are a good time to review your portfolio, potentially take some profits, set stop-losses, or reduce leverage. Avoid FOMO: When the index is high in the greed zone, resist the urge to chase rapidly rising prices. Stick to your predefined investment plan. Look for Opportunities in Fear: Conversely, low fear scores can signal potential buying opportunities if fundamentals remain strong. Think of the index as a temperature gauge for the market’s emotional state. It tells you if people are hot (greedy) or cold (fearful), but it doesn’t tell you *why* or *how long* that temperature will last. Historical Examples and the Greed Zone Looking back, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index has often provided interesting insights. For instance, during the peak of the 2017 bull run and the late 2020/early 2021 rally, the index consistently registered in the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone (often above 90). These periods were followed by significant market corrections. Conversely, during major crashes, like March 2020 or the bear market lows of 2022, the index plummeted into ‘Extreme Fear’ (sometimes below 10), which in hindsight, represented strong accumulation zones for long-term holders. Being in the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’ at 63 isn’t as extreme as those historical peaks, but it places the market firmly in a state where caution should start outweighing excessive optimism. It’s a reminder that trees don’t grow to the sky and corrections are a natural part of market cycles. What Could Shift the Crypto Market Sentiment? The index is constantly reacting to market forces. Several factors could cause the Crypto Market Sentiment to shift from its current greedy state: Significant Price Drop: A sharp decline in Bitcoin or other major cryptocurrencies would quickly inject fear into the market. Negative News: Regulatory crackdowns, exchange hacks, or major project failures can trigger widespread panic. Macroeconomic Changes: Shifts in global interest rates, inflation data, or recession fears can impact risk-on assets like crypto. Positive Developments: Conversely, positive news like institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, or technological breakthroughs could push the index further into Extreme Greed. Monitoring these external factors alongside the index provides a more robust understanding of potential future movements. Conclusion: Navigating Greed with Caution The rise of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 63 signifies that optimism and confidence are currently the dominant forces in the market, placing it firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone. While this reflects positive price action and momentum, it also serves as an important reminder to temper enthusiasm with prudence. The index is a valuable sentiment tool, helping investors gauge the emotional temperature of the market and potentially act as a contrarian signal. However, it is not a standalone predictor. Successful navigation of the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’ requires combining this sentiment insight with thorough research, technical analysis, fundamental understanding, and disciplined risk management as part of a well-defined Crypto Investing Strategy . Stay informed, stay cautious, and avoid letting greed dictate your decisions.

Bitcoin Solaris (BTC‑S), now in Phase 7 of its presale at $7, replicates that momentum with updated fundamentals and broader accessibility. Forecasts set token value at $20 at listing — an almost certain 186% return — while deeper growth potential lies ahead. The mechanics that drove TRON’s early success are now fueling BTC‑S. Tokenomics Designed for Value Retention BTC‑S operates on a hard cap of 21 million tokens, with only 4.2 million made available during presale. Every token allocation and phase detail is public and verifiable — no hidden vaults, no stealth minting. This transparency ensures that each BTC‑S token purchased today keeps its value intact as supply remains fixed. Early buyers who secured tokens at $5 or $7 locked in positions under material scarcity. The fewer tokens available, the stronger each remaining one becomes. Mining Participation Without Barriers TRON’s rise leaned heavily on network activity. BTC‑S goes further by enabling participation through ordinary smartphones. Through the Nova App beta, users verified that idle device resources — storage and CPU — generate BTC‑S smoothly and sustainably. That means network contributors aren’t limited to technical insiders; anyone with a compatible phone can earn rewards and help secure the system. This widespread participation model mirrors TRON’s early engagement — except it’s built on everyday hardware. Trusted Transparency Through Audits Trust in presale tokens hinges on early verification. BTC‑S has met this requirement. A smart contract review by Cyberscope confirmed token logic aligns with stated rules. Mobile mining infrastructure received additional vetting from Freshcoins , confirming functionality and reliability. Developer identities passed a full KYC verification , eliminating the anonymity common in early-stage tokens. These layers of verification elevate BTC‑S from speculation to substance. Crypto strategist Ben Crypto recently analyzed BTC‑S, drawing lines from TRON’s early model to Bitcoin Solaris’s structural setup. His insights highlight the capped token supply, mobile-first mining, and audit-backed confidence as reliable signals for future gains. He projects BTC‑S could reach $100 within a year of listing — suggesting gains beyond the initial 186% jump. Real Participation Builds Real Value At $7, BTC‑S offers access comparable to TRON’s early phases, but with improved infrastructure. Pricing is set before the public market opens, establishing a baseline for early return. If listing occurs at $20, investors see an automatic 186% gain. If utility and adoption follow, the climb to $100 becomes realistically attainable. That’s more than speculation — it’s calculated outcome based on adoption and demand. In both TRON and BTC‑S cases, the key driver is user-led action. TRON grew through developer backing and community engagement. BTC‑S adds a layer of passive user contribution via mobile mining. Every device added, every token mined reduces circulating supply and raises demand. The result is value generated from activity, not just hype or media buzz. As more people download and use the Nova App, the demand curve grows organically. That’s a self-reinforcing loop rarely found in token models. Accelerated Wealth: A Rare Opportunity Bitcoin Solaris has drawn over 11,000 investors and raised more than $3.8 million to date. Social channels are active. Mobile mining is live. Audits and KYC are in place. In a single stage, the project blends structural opportunity with execution. TRON’s early backers benefited from low entry points in a rising ecosystem. BTC‑S now delivers a comparable setup — with added certainty and accessibility. With Phase 7 nearing conclusion, final presale tokens remain limited. After that, tokens shift into public trading, which introduces volatility, broader buy-in, and reduced rewards for contributors. Early participants enjoy both pricing advantage and mining participation ahead of public launch. History shows that this timing matters — TRON’s early investors saw outsized returns because they acted before market tides shifted. BTC‑S offers the same timing advantage, modernized with structural clarity.

Price action remained relatively tight, with BTC moving within a $2,090 range from $104,220 to $106,135. The largest moves occurred overnight in Asia trading, where Bitcoin briefly dipped below $104,200 before rebounding on high volume. Much of the recent volatility has been driven by developments in the Middle East. The Israel-Iran war, which some analysts fear could spread to other parts of the Middle East, combined with trade tensions between the U.S. and some of its key trading partners, has unsettled risk markets. More than $1.1 billion in crypto liquidations were recorded during the initial wave of conflict headlines, though bitcoin has shown resilience in the aftermath. Traders appear to be leaning bullish in the medium term, as BTC continues to hold a pattern of higher lows despite intraday wobbles. Profit-taking near $106,000 capped upside momentum, but support near $105,000 continues to draw buyers on dips. Market participants are watching this range closely, particularly as safe-haven demand and risk sentiment remain intertwined. While short-term headlines continue to drive volatility, the broader structure suggests BTC is consolidating rather than reversing. If support around $104,950 holds, Bitcoin may attempt another push above $106,200. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC traded in a $2,090 range from $104,182 to $106,272 over the past 24 hours. A key bounce occurred at $104,182 with 15,342 BTC traded during the recovery. Resistance formed near $106,200 amid consistent profit-taking. A rising trendline of higher lows remains intact. Psychological support at $105,000 is holding for now. Recent price range: $104,875 to $105,202 in the last hour. A sharp dip below $105K at 07:19 reversed quickly, with $105,200 acting as near-term resistance. Final 15-minute candles showed minor exhaustion, but volume patterns suggest accumulation on dips.

This latest news about Clay, a sales automation firm, securing a substantial funding round is a prime example of where significant capital is flowing in the current tech environment. Significant Venture Capital Fuels Clay’s Growth Clay, a company focused on sales automation, has reportedly finalized a Series C startup funding round. According to sources familiar with the transaction, the round values the company at approximately $3 billion. The investment was led by Capital G, Alphabet’s independent growth fund. Neither Clay nor Capital G have publicly commented on the deal when asked. This new development follows closely on the heels of another significant event for the New York-based startup. Just a month prior, Clay announced a tender offer, allowing many employees to sell a portion of their shares at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sequoia spearheaded this secondary transaction, committing to purchase up to $20 million in employee stock. While employees who participated in the tender offer sold shares at half the reported new valuation, Clay’s co-founder and CEO, Kareem Amin, indicated in a previous interview that the company intends to conduct tender offers annually. This suggests future opportunities for employees to liquidate equity at potentially higher valuations. The Power of AI in Sales Automation Founded in 2017, Clay’s trajectory saw a significant acceleration a few years ago after a strategic pivot. CEO Kareem Amin decided to refocus the company on leveraging artificial intelligence to empower sales and marketing professionals. This shift aimed at helping teams efficiently discover key data points and automate their go-to-market strategies. Clay’s platform is designed to streamline core sales tasks. It assists salespeople in finding and updating lists of prospective customers and automating the process of writing personalized outreach emails. This focus on applying AI in sales processes has been a key driver of their recent growth and investor interest. Market Position and Competition in Sales Automation Today, Clay’s tools are utilized by thousands of customers. This includes large, well-known technology companies such as OpenAI, HubSpot, and Canva. Additionally, over 100 smaller consulting agencies use Clay to assist their own clients with go-to-market efforts. The sales automation market is competitive. Clay operates alongside established platforms and newer entrants, including companies like ZoomInfo, Lusha, Apollo.io, Unify, and Common Room. The substantial venture capital investment suggests that investors see Clay as having a strong position and significant potential within this crowded space, likely due to its specific AI-driven approach. Key Investors in the Series C Round and Beyond The latest Series C round was led by Capital G. This investment builds upon support from existing investors who have participated in previous funding rounds. Notable existing investors in Clay include: Sequoia Meritech Capital Boldstart Ventures Maple VC First Round Capital Box Group The participation of these prominent firms across multiple rounds underscores continued investor confidence in Clay’s business model and growth prospects in the competitive sales automation sector, particularly as it leverages AI in sales . Summary: A Significant Milestone Clay’s reported $3 billion valuation in its latest startup funding round, led by Capital G, marks a significant milestone for the sales automation company. This rapid increase in valuation, coming shortly after a tender offer at a lower price, highlights the intense investor interest in companies effectively applying AI to solve real-world business problems like sales and marketing efficiency. The substantial capital infusion positions Clay to further develop its platform and expand its reach in the dynamic sales automation market, fueled by continued venture capital support and the successful execution of its AI in sales strategy.

45993052,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746602,1749895221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45993052.jpeg,Hackers use Discord invite links to deliver malware,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/discord-invite-link-malware-crypto-wallets/,"A new campaign of malware targeting crypto users via Discord invite links has been uncovered. According to information, the new malware exploits a weakness in Discord’s invitation system to deliver an information stealer known as Skuld and the AsyncRAT remote access trojan. In a report by Check Point, the platform mentioned that the attackers hijack the links through vanity link registration, which allows them to easily redirect users from trusted sources to malicious servers. “The attackers combined the ClickFix phishing technique, multi-stage loaders, and time-based evasions to stealthily deliver AsyncRAT, and a customized Skuld Stealer targeting crypto wallets,” Check Point said. According to the platform, one of the uses of Discord’s invite mechanism is that it allows attackers to hijack expired or deleted invite links and secretly redirect unsuspecting users to different malicious servers under their control. This means that a Discord invite link, which was previously shared for a legitimate purpose on social media and other forums could be used to lead users to their malicious servers and platforms. Discord invite link hijacked for malicious purposes This development comes a little over a month after the cybersecurity firm revealed another sophisticated phishing campaign that hijacked expired vanity links to entice users into joining a Discord server, instructing them to visit a phishing site to verify ownership. The malicious actors eventually used the platform to gain illegal access to the users’ digital wallets and drain their wallets after connecting them. While users are allowed to create temporary, permanent, or custom invite links on Discord, the platform does not allow other legitimate servers to reclaim a previously expired or deleted invite link. However, if a user creates a custom link, they can reuse the expired invite codes and even some deleted permanent invite codes in some cases. This ability to reuse expired or deleted codes when creating custom vanity invite links allows criminals to abuse it, with most of them claiming them for their malicious servers. “This creates a serious risk: Users who follow previously trusted invite links (e.g., on websites, blogs, or forums) can unknowingly be redirected to fake Discord servers created by threat actors,” Check Point said. According to the report, Discord invite link hijacking involves using a legitimate invite link shared by communities to redirect users to a malicious server. Victims of this scheme are asked to complete a verification stamp, which involves entering several details to gain full access to the server. This is done by authorizing a bot, which leads them to a fake website where they are mandated to verify the information provided. After this, the scammers use a social engineering tactic to trick users into infecting their systems. Malicious actors steal wallet seed phrases with malware According to the report, the Skuld malware is capable of harvesting crypto wallet seed phrases from the Exodus and Atomic crypto wallets. It carries out this activity using an approach called wallet injection, replacing the original version of the application files with versions loaded with trojans downloaded from GitHub. Another payload is a Goland information stealer that can be downloaded from Bitbucket. It is used to steal sensitive data from Discord, various browsers, crypto wallets , and gaming platforms. Check Point added that it also identified another malicious campaign being carried out by the same threat actor where it distributed the loader as a modified version of a hack tool for unlocking pirated hams. The program, according to the report, has been downloaded 350 times on Bitbucket. Victims of these campaigns are primarily located in the United States, France, Slovakia, the Netherlands, Austria, Vietnam, and the United Kingdom. The findings show the latest example of how cybercriminals have been targeting the platform. “This campaign illustrates how a subtle feature of Discord’s invite system, the ability to reuse expired or deleted invite codes in vanity invite links, can be exploited as a powerful attack vector,” the researchers said. “By hijacking legitimate invite links, threat actors silently redirect unsuspecting users to malicious Discord servers.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

A Chicago trading firm put up $100 million to buy 4 million shares in Trump Media & Technology Group. That move comes just nine weeks after US regulators closed a probe into the same firm. Based on reports, the deal is tied to TMTG’s plan to buy over $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin.

The company – founded and controlled by trading mogul Don Wilson – said it has been active in crypto for more than a decade. It sees value in holding Bitcoin on its balance sheets. Buying into TMTG was, in its view, a straightforward way to back that idea.

Grumbach (@JakeMGrumbach) June 14, 2025 Institutional Backers Rally Jane Street leads the pack with a $375 million stake in the Trump Group. That makes it the largest backer so far. Other investors are also lining up. Based on reports, TMTG’s goal is to raise $2.5 billion and use much of that cash to buy Bitcoin. If all goes to plan, the firm could hold over 140,000 BTC at current prices. Regulatory Milestone Achieved On Friday, June 13, the SEC declared TMTG’s registration statement for its Bitcoin Treasury offering effective. That covers 56 million new shares of equity and 29 million in convertible notes. Clearing this step means the company can sell shares and raise the cash it needs. It also subjects TMTG to ongoing SEC reporting and oversight. Voice Of The Crypto Industry Meanwhile, a DRW spokesperson called for a fresh look at the SEC and CFTC. The firm argued that the current regulators don’t match the pace of global market changes. Over the years, DRW’s crypto arm, Cumberland, bought 70,000 BTC in a US government auction of Silk Road assets. That stash is worth about $7.7 billion today. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million?

Currently, the gaming sector commands a market capitalization of $17.75 billion, marking a 5.03% increase — a clear sign of rising adoption and investor interest. Gaming tokens are no longer just in-game assets; they’ve become strategic investment engines. Leading the charge are tokens like FLOKI (3.94%), VIRTUAL (1.93%), SAND (1.72%), MANA (1.67%), and RENDER (1.07%), each contributing to the sector’s growing dominance and market share. As adoption accelerates, these tokens are poised for potential value appreciation. To help navigate this high-growth niche, CoinPedia’s expert panel has compiled a well-researched guide covering the top 10 gaming tokens with massive potential for gains in 2025. ImmutableX (IMX) Claimed as the first Layer-2 scaling solution for the NFTs built on the Ethereum ecosystem, ImmutableX focuses on increasing efficiency, user experience, liquidity, and scalability. Through it, users can create large quantities of ERC-20 & ERC-721 tokens and distribute them. Despite recording a drop of ~74% YTD, IMX is one of the most-valued gaming projects in the crypto-verse. With a market capitalization of $871.23 million, this altcoin has secured the 75th position in the global cryptocurrency list. Render (RNDR) Render is a decentralized GPU rendering network that allows users to contribute unused GPU power to help render digital content such as 3D models, animations, and virtual effects. With a primary focus on visual effects, motion graphics, and 3D rendering, Render has contributed immensely to the blockchain gaming sector. Ranked 48th in the global crypto market, RNDR boasts a market capitalization of $1.79 billion and holds a 1.07% share of the gaming sector. Decentraland (MANA) Another successful project built on the Ethereum ecosystem, Decentraland boasts a decentralized metaverse that is built, owned, and governed by its users. Similar to other gaming platforms, Decentraland offers plots called “LAND” that participants can buy and access. Notably, “ MANA ” is the native token of Decentraland and is used as an in-game transaction medium. The growing adoption of Decentraland could push the token toward a new high during this altcoin market. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Virtuals Protocol ranked 63rd in the global crypto market, with a market cap of $1.21 billion. Positioned as a foundational layer for AI-driven, co-owned gaming agents, this network bridges the gap between AI and immersive virtual environments. It empowers dynamic, plug-and-play gaming AIs to improve user engagement across Metaverse platforms. With staking activity on the rise, the project has drawn increasing attention from both developers and gamers. As the Metaverse evolves, Virtuals Protocol stands out for enabling next-gen virtual interactions and concreting its role as a key infrastructure player in blockchain-powered gaming. Floki (FLOKI) Created on the Ethereum chain, the Floki memecoin is inspired by Elon Musk’s dog. This Shiba Inu-themed meme is also a part of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community. Moreover, this was one of the first people’s crypto tokens to be introduced in the cryptocurrency market . Primarily used as a native token in the NFT gaming metaverse called “Valhalla.” Floki has successfully partnered with giant crypto projects such as Chainlink, Trader Joe, and ApeSwap for its “FlokiFi Locker” digital asset locker protocol. With a market cap of $764.4 million, this gaming token has secured the 85th position. Axie Infinity (AXS) Axie Infinity is a pioneer in blockchain-based play-to-earn games, which allows players to collect, breed, battle, and trade in-game creatures called Axies. AXS, the native token of the network, empowers its users through governance voting, staking for passive rewards, and in-game functionalities like breeding and event participation. Once a lagship GameFi project during the 2021 boom, AXS now holds a market capitalization of $379.63 million and ranks 135th in the global crypto market. We can expect this token to perform well once the bullish momentum kicks off. The Sandox (SAND) The Sandbox project with a unique approach of allowing its users to create their own games with the application of their visual scripting tools. Notably, these games require no prior coding and development knowledge. Moreover, players can also make games and store assets on LAND (digital real estate). “SAND” tokens act as the mode of payment for the Sandbox ecosystem. With newer partnerships and increased adoption, this altcoin has recorded impressive growth in 2024. With a maintained bullish sentiment, this project may head toward a new high in 2025. MultiversX (EGLD) MultiversX is a unique blockchain protocol that offers a variety of services to its users. Reportedly, with its true horizontal scalability and sharding, it offers an efficient and secure network and transaction chain. By including decentralized finance, real-world assets, and the Metaverse, this project is a marvel of the gaming industry. Moreover, its users pay transaction fees in “EGLD”, and validators participate in the consensus process. The EGLD allows developers to deploy smart contracts, protocols, and dApps on the platform. Further, it empowers participants to perform uninterrupted and open network action. Through its staking, validation rewards, and transaction fees, the EGLD token has borne all the load of the MultiversX network. Beam (BEAM) Built by the Merit Circle DAO, the Beam project is a gaming application. The ecosystem’s native token, “BEAM”, also acts as a mode of payment. The Beam SDK, its core component, is a “flexible software development kit” that helps game developers access various tools to structure their in-game blockchain elements. With a potential Altcoin season around the corner, the gaming sector is prepared to mirror the 2021 rally and potentially achieve a new high during 2025. This makes this budding gaming project a potential pick for an investor’s gaming portfolio. Gala Games (GALA) Built by a Layer-1 blockchain, GalaChain , the Gala project is a unique Web3 model. Primarily built to power the Gala entertainment, this ecosystem initially included the Gala Games, Gala Music, and Gala Film. Notably, it is now accessible to external developers across industries. With the idea of empowering visionaries and creators across global industries, this project aims to become the world’s first billion-user blockchain. By allowing assets built on its chain to be bridged to other blockchains, across the crypto-verse, this altcoin has gained the attention of top investors and institutes. With a market cap of $689.1 million, this project continues to play a key role in the gaming segment. Disclaimer: As the cryptocurrency market has turned highly volatile, investing under such conditions can be extremely risky. Make sure to understand the market sentiments, trends, and risks involved before investing in any digital asset. It is highly suggested that stop-loss be applied to reduce the risk of a complete liquidation-like situation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Small recoveries, rising price patterns, and renewed interest in major names are back. Pi Network has gained 15% recently. Uniswap (UNI) has also jumped 28%, showing strong momentum for well-known projects. Each one is getting attention for different reasons. Pi is in the spotlight for its long-awaited changes, while Uniswap is making headlines by reaching new highs. But beyond all these names, one project stands out more than any other: BlockDAG (BDAD) . With over $303 million collected in its presale and a current batch price $0.0276, BlockDAG is turning heads. More than 22.4 billion coins have already been sold. Its progress and energy in this early phase make it the most talked-about project. While others are still warming up, BlockDAG is already proving its strong position in the crypto market. Pi Network Shows Signs of a Comeback Pi Network is showing fresh signs of life. The price went up by 15% in early June. This came after a strong RSI signal, suggesting that the long, quiet phase could now be turning into an upward trend. However, most Pi trading is still limited to wrapped coins or placeholder versions. Full exchange listings have not yet happened. Even so, Pi’s global base of tens of millions of users stays active. Many traders are watching to see if a breakout above resistance levels will come next. But until a full mainnet and exchange use arrive, full value remains delayed. Uniswap Surges 28%, Nears All-Time High Uniswap (UNI) has recently gone up by 28%. This growth came after a wider 40% price increase. It brings the coin close to its all-time high. A report from buyX suggests this growth is tied to new interest in decentralised finance. Uniswap remains a top project in that space. The project benefits from strong protocol revenue and ongoing coin burns. Expected governance changes could also increase yields. Uniswap has also gained from better regulation in some key areas. But because of its large market size, future gains might be smaller than smaller, growing names. BlockDAG Presale Accelerates with $303M Raised and Growing Demand BlockDAG is moving fast and showing strong performance during its presale. It has now raised over $303 million and is currently in Batch 29. Each BDAG coin is now priced at $0.0276. From Batch 1 to Batch 29, the return on price has grown by 2660%. This strong growth is drawing attention. Over 22.4 billion coins have been sold so far. Buyers are continuing to join in every day. Along with coins, BlockDAG’s mining equipment is also in demand. The total amount made from miner sales is now over $7.2 million. More than 17,950 miners have been sold. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles is one of the main attractions. This feature gives the highest daily buyer the leftover coins from that day’s batch. These extra coins range between 25 million and 150 million BDAG. So far, over $1.26 million worth of bonus coins has been distributed through this system. This adds daily excitement and keeps users active. Unlike other projects that only make promises, BlockDAG has already built and launched tools. Its X1 mining app has over 1.5 million users. The app is mobile-friendly and allows mining without heavy hardware. This builds trust and encourages early use of the system. The presale has a total of 45 price rounds. With over 22.3 billion coins already sold, the window for early access is closing quickly. Final Verdict This year has been full of price rebounds and renewed hype, but BlockDAG is offering more than just talk. Pi Network is still relying on what could happen in the future. Uniswap is a well-known name, but it may not deliver big future jumps. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is showing real numbers and real usage. With more than $303 million raised, 22.4 billion coins sold, and daily buying rewards, it brings fresh energy to the crypto space. Its mobile app already has over 1.5 million users. Sales of mining machines have passed $7.2 million, and over 17,950 units have been sold. 28 out of 45 batches sold out, it’s a clear front-runner in crypto growth.

45992932,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70928,1749895258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"$1,000 in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Now Could Be $20,000 Later — Here’s the Case",https://timestabloid.com/1000-in-mutuum-finance-mutm-now-could-be-20000-later/,"In the ongoing dynamics of decentralized finance, opportunities to invest early in projects with massive upside are rare. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as one of those rare gems. With a current price around $0.03, a total supply of 4 billion tokens, and over $10.55 million raised during Phase 5 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building strong momentum. For anyone who invests $1,000 today, the road ahead promises a journey that will turn that modest hold into $20,000 or more as the platform scales and utility expands. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Demands Attention Now Unlike many projects that begin with sky-high prices and leave little room for growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trading below $0.03 despite generating significant capital—over $10.55 million—through its presale phases. Early investors who bought during Phase 1 paid even less, presenting a clear path for strong returns. The price gap between Phase 1 and the current price shows how users have already profited handsomely, yet a large portion of the token supply remains locked, promising greater demand as more tokens hit exchanges. With over 11,900 holders already participating, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a vibrant community, which adds social proof to its growing traction. The upcoming beta platform launch will be a crucial ignition point, driving adoption and unlocking the full potential of MUTM’s utilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed on Layer-2 blockchain technology, delivering fast and low-cost transactions. This technical edge resolves common DeFi problems such as network congestion and high fees, offering a smoother, more efficient user experience. This will attract a wider audience, from casual crypto holders to institutional players looking for reliable and scalable DeFi solutions. One of the most exciting features in development is Mutuum’s decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike traditional stablecoins that depend on centralized reserves, this stablecoin will be minted algorithmically using assets locked on the Mutuum platform. This design ensures full transparency and automatic supply adjustment, creating a stable borrowing asset that strengthens the entire ecosystem. This stablecoin will also recycle interest payments back into the platform, reinforcing Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s treasury and enabling new utility pathways for users, including staking rewards. How Users Benefit Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s native token, MUTM, plays a key role in the protocol’s ecosystem. Passive dividends will be distributed using a portion of protocol revenue, which is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market. These purchased tokens are then sent to participants who stake mtTokens in the protocol’s safety module. This compounding income model is designed to reward long-term holders and active participants, creating a steady growth cycle for capital invested in the ecosystem. The token also ties directly into Mutuum’s dual lending engine. In pool-based lending (P2C), users deposit popular assets like ETH or DAI into liquidity pools and earn annual interest rates that vary based on the pool’s utilization rate—these can range from moderate to attractive double-digit yields. For example, depositing $1,600 worth of ETH into the protocol at current rates could generate steady passive income on top of any price appreciation of MUTM tokens. In peer-to-peer lending (P2P), users will be able to lend and borrow less common tokens not usually available on pool platforms, such as memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB). This opens unique opportunities for higher returns and diversification, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a more versatile ecosystem than many competitors. Why $20,000 From $1,000 Is a Realistic Forecast The current MUTM token price sits at approximately $0.03. A rise to $0.60 per token—20X the current price—would make a $1,000 investment worth $20,000. This valuation is well within reach given Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s strong fundamentals, growing user base, and upcoming beta release that will begin unlocking the platform’s full functionality. Beyond $0.60, a price of $1.50 is not out of the question as the protocol expands its user base, rolls out Layer-2 speed advantages, and introduces its decentralized stablecoin. Such growth will multiply early investors’ gains by 50X, turning $1,000 into $50,000, underscoring the huge upside potential. The project’s CertiK audit, completed in May 2025, confirms strong contract security with a Token Scan Score of 80.00, reassuring investors that the platform is robust and ready for mainstream adoption. The price advantage that early investors in Phase 1 enjoyed is gradually narrowing, which means that waiting for later phases to join will likely offer less upside. The protocol’s roadmap reveals that major development milestones, including the beta launch, marketing campaigns, and ongoing $100,000 giveaway , are set to accelerate user acquisition and liquidity growth. As more tokens circulate, the demand effect and platform utility will push the price higher. The Bigger Picture: A $2.5 Billion Market Cap Within Reach DeFi projects with real use cases and scalable platforms can reach market capitalizations in the billions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s supply of 4 billion tokens and robust dual lending system, combined with the upcoming decentralized stablecoin, set the stage for a market cap exceeding $2.5 billion. This target is grounded in real utility, not speculation. As the platform gains traction through Layer-2 efficiencies and diverse lending options, MUTM’s token demand will rise accordingly. This makes the $20,000 return from a $1,000 investment a conservative estimate of what’s structurally possible. Delaying entry means missing the early phases’ price advantage and the compounding benefits of mtTokens and passive income streams. This is more than an investment—it’s a strategic move to capture value in the next wave of DeFi innovation.

Now serving his second term as the 47th President, Trump isn’t just making headlines in politics. His presence in the crypto world is growing too, with a digital asset portfolio valued at nearly $1.5 million. Crypto Whale in the White House According to Arkham Intelligence , Trump’s crypto holdings currently total $1,486,397.26. The standout in his wallet is TROG, a meme coin featuring a frog with Trump’s image, worth $948.7K. His portfolio also includes Ethereum, USDC stablecoin, and his own TRUMP meme coin. While his current holdings are impressive, they’re a big drop from their previous high of $32 million, showing just how unpredictable the crypto market can be. Billion-Dollar Crypto Profits Power Trump’s Empire Trump’s profits from crypto go far beyond what he’s currently holding. Forbes reports that he’s made over $1 billion from crypto-related ventures, adding to his estimated $5.6 billion net worth. Here’s a quick breakdown: His NFT collection earned $7 million, with $4 million after taxes. The Trump family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, is expected to bring in $390 million, with $246 million net. His TRUMP meme coin has generated $350 million in trading fees. Altogether, Trump’s estimated crypto stake stands at $1.2 billion. And with the market heating up again, many believe his portfolio could double in value in the next bull run. Cohen Proposes Budget-Friendly Birthday for Trump Not everyone is thrilled about the $45 million celebration. Congressman Steve Cohen (D-TN) introduced the HAPPY BIRTHDAY Budget Act (H.R. 2761), a light-hearted proposal suggesting a more modest celebration for Trump. Trump’s $45M birthday parade is days away—some estimates say $90M. A mountain of YOUR tax dollars wasted so one man can feel like a king. I introduced the HAPPY BIRTHDAY Budget Act to stop it. Not one Republican signed on.

While symbolic, it reflects the ongoing debate around public spending, especially when Trump’s crypto wealth is grabbing headlines. The Bigger Picture Donald Trump’s 79th birthday is a reminder of how deeply he’s involved in crypto. From meme coins and NFTs to billion-dollar profits, Trump is proving that digital assets are becoming a bigger part of political and financial influence. And with crypto markets showing signs of recovery, his holdings could play an even bigger role in the coming months.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-14 10:03:24

With market sentiment turning cautiously optimistic, savvy investors are scanning for tokens with strong narratives, rising adoption, and technical setups that echo previous bull cycles. In this piece, we spotlight five altcoins poised to explode in the coming quarter—projects that could deliver outsized returns just as legacy coins start to lag. SHIB Set for Big Gains as Crypto Market Eyes Bull Run Source: tradingview Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin known for its fun. It drew attention in 2021 with massive gains. Created initially as a “DogeCoin killer”, it's part of the Ethereum ecosystem. SHIB is affordable and has a strong community backing it. The team is working on Shibarium, a layer-2 solution aimed at faster and cheaper transactions. These innovations could boost its use and value. Patterns similar to 2021 show potential for another altcoin season. In this market, SHIB's low price and growing utility make it a tempting choice for investors looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Solana Shines Bright: The Next Big Bet in Crypto's Bull Run Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is grabbing attention as a rising star in the crypto space. It's a blockchain known for its fast and low-cost transactions, making it a worthy contender for the top spot. SOL's smart contract capabilities compete with Ethereum, but with greater speed and less fees. As the market looks for efficient platforms, Solana's potential grows. Many see its value surging in the next altcoin season. With more developers building on its network and a committed community, Solana is hard to ignore. Even after recent market dips, Solana's strong tech and growth signals make it an attractive pick in this cycle. Stellar (XLM): Bright Future Ahead Despite Market Dip Source: tradingview Stellar (XLM) is a digital currency designed for fast and low-cost international transfers. It allows users to send money across borders quickly using its cutting-edge blockchain technology. Even with recent market slumps, patterns reminiscent of 2021 suggest optimism. Stellar's focus on banking the unbanked and partnering with financial giants is promising. As major players embrace blockchain, XLM's utility may skyrocket. Its potential to streamline global payments makes it an exciting option in this cycle. Embracing decentralized financial solutions might be the edge investors are seeking, positioning XLM as a standout pick in the current market.

Each of these altcoins offers a compelling mix of community strength, utility, and market positioning—making them serious contenders for explosive growth in Q3 2025. For investors willing to pivot away from underperforming giants, these emerging players may offer the edge needed to stay ahead in an evolving market.

In 2028, the DGB price can reach a maximum price value of $0.0475 with an average value of $0.0396. The price of DigiByte is predicted to reach an average value of $0.0468 in 2030 DigiByte (DGB) is an open-source blockchain that was created in 2014 as a fork of Bitcoin, promising to be a faster and safer transaction. It is designed in a multi-layered architecture comprising a public ledger, a smart contract layer and a core protocol consisting of five mining algorithms. Developed by Jared Tate, DigiByte has continued to experience active development and a community-driven ecosystem under DigiByte Foundation and Awareness Team. In May 2021, DGB attained an all-time high of $0.1825, before dropping more than 95% below. This decline has not reduced the interest of long-term holders and developers in the project. DigiByte could be one of the coins that attract the attention of investors again, given its solid fundamentals, community, and emphasis on security in its design, particularly in the case of an improvement in market conditions. In this DigiByte price prediction, we take a look at the short-term price potential of DigiByte, areas of support, and the technical indicators in our price prediction to determine what will be a possible move in terms of price for DigiByte.

The resistance is positioned at $0.00830, where the price faced strong rejection. Key support now lies at $0.00800, marking an important level for potential bullish defence. As of June 14, 2025, DigiByte (DGB) has extended its downward trajectory, having a 0.40% decline in the past 24 hours. The price now trades at $0.00816, signalling sustained bearish momentum. Sellers continue to dominate the market, with minimal signs of buyer interest at current levels. This ongoing slide underscores prevailing market weakness and cautious investor sentiment. Digibyte 24-hour chart analysis shows price drop as bearish momentum takes Control On the 24-hour chart, DigiByte (DGB) has shown continued bearish pressure, trading at $0.00816. The price reflects a downward trend, marked by consecutive red candles and a failure to hold previous support levels. This shows an ongoing dominance by sellers and a lack of bullish momentum. DigiByte Price Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.96, moving just above the oversold zone of 30. Its position below the 40.34 moving average suggests weak buyer activity and reinforces the bearish sentiment in the market. RSI has remained subdued for several sessions, indicating sustained selling without meaningful recovery attempts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence remains in bearish territory. The line is at -0.000404 and sits below the signal line at -0.000325. This divergence between the two lines points to prolonged downside momentum. The histogram also reflects negative pressure, with no bullish crossover in sight. DigiByte 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, DigiByte (DGB) continues to show weakness, trading at $0.00816 with bearish pressure intact. The price attempted a recovery but was quickly rejected near the $0.00822 level, confirming a lack of bullish strength. Sellers remain in control, keeping the asset below key resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 28.99, in oversold territory and below its moving average of 32.92. This indicates that despite being oversold, there is still no strong buying activity emerging to reverse the trend. RSI conditions suggest the asset may stay suppressed unless momentum shifts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also supports the bearish outlook. The MACD line is at -0.000239, while the signal line follows at -0.000215. Though the histogram shows a slight easing in bearish strength, the MACD has not yet crossed above the signal line, signalling that selling pressure remains in place.

DigiByte holds the $0.00840 support level. A breakdown below this could lead to further downside pressure. Analysts will watch for an RSI move above 40 and a possible MACD crossover to signal a momentum change. Price movement toward the $0.00881 resistance will also be monitored closely. Volume trends will help confirm the strength behind any breakout or breakdown. Is DigiByte a good investment? DigiByte offers strong long-term potential due to its secure proof-of-work blockchain and fast 15-second block times. Transactions confirm in just 1.5 minutes, making it practical for everyday use. Its active community and committed developers continue to drive innovation. These features position DigiByte as a solid choice for investors seeking real-world utility and strong technology. Why is DigiByte up today? DigiByte’s 1.8% price rise over the past 24 hours appears to stem from a technical rebound rather than fresh fundamentals. The RSI14 climbed from near-oversold levels of 30.5 to 34.08, sparking short-term buying interest. At the same time, price was stable around the key $0.00787 low, with resistance at the 10-day SMA near $0.00882. The ongoing community initiatives around adoption and supply reduction may be improving sentiment, even as overall market liquidity remains down. Will DigiByte reach $1? Based on the recent upward trend, DigiByte’s price can reach $1 if positive market conditions and investor sentiment continue. Will DigiByte reach $10? Reaching $10 for DigiByte is highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term due to its current price levels and the significant market capitalisation required. Does DigiByte have a good long-term future? DigiByte has potential for a strong long-term future due to several key factors. Firstly, it boasts a robust, secure blockchain with a focus on speed and efficiency, making it one of the fastest and most decentralised blockchains in the market.

However, we expect DigiByte to start a cautious recovery. Throughout the year, the price is projected to trend upward. Will DGB manage to reach a new all-time high? In that case, the price of DGB could significantly increase. DigiByte Historic Price Sentiment DigiByte Price History: Coinmarketcap DigiByte’s native token, DGB, was introduced into the market back in 2014. DigiByte price remained at $0.01 for a couple of days before dropping even further towards $0.0003. The altcoin did not excel during its early days, and most investors opted to acquire other, more prominent digital assets. Nevertheless, the DigiByte cryptocurrency began to grow gradually and started amassing capital. Digibyte (DGB) hovered within $0.0003 for about three years before spiking during the spring of 2017. Investors who acquired DGB early made a threefold profit when the Digibyte price reached $0.001. For once, the DigiByte cryptocurrency market cap started to spell tens of millions of dollars. During the fall of 2017, a well-known payment platform, Paytomat, added support for DGB. On top of that, popular crypto exchanges listed the cryptocurrency. As a result, the DGB price started growing more resolutely. Early into 2018, the price of DGB reached a record high of 13 cents per DGB token and $1.2 billion in total market capitalization. Unfortunately, the pull-back phase knocked in and drove the cryptocurrency downwards. The sharp retracement transformed into a broad bearish trend, and indicators dropped. Another notable pricing event occurred when the price of DGB rose from $0.017 to $0.049 in April 2018, gaining more than 185 percent. Afterward, its price plummeted to a low of $0.004 in 2020. In January 2021, one DGB traded at $0.025 after a substantial rally. At the time of writing, one DigiByte token retails at $0.043. In October 2021 the price increased again to roughly $0.07. In Jan 2022 DigiByte’s price was around $0.05 and then price peaked again at approximately $0.125 in April the same year. In the year 2023 the price was around $0.02 in January and price range between $0.1 to $0.02 fo the rest of the year. DigiByte faced a slight increase to about $0.022 in January. Between June and July 2024,the price stabilized around $0.0076. In the following months, the price of DigiByte dropped sharply as it made a low below $0.006 in November. DGB price continued to consolidate below $0.009 in early 2025. As of June 2025, DigiByte trades at $0.00814, reflecting a modest rebound from its mid-2024 stabilization around $0.0076.",Crypto Price Predictions|altcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|LTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-14 10:10:00

Unpacking the Trump Financial Disclosure: $57.3 Million from Crypto According to a report by NBC News, citing President Trump’s 2025 financial disclosure released by the Office of Government Ethics, he earned approximately $57.35 million last year from his stake in World Liberty Financial. This significant sum primarily came from token sales associated with the project. The financial disclosure document itself is a hefty read, totaling 234 pages. A considerable portion, 145 pages, is dedicated to detailing Trump’s various stock and bond investments. However, it’s the mention of earnings from a digital asset project like WLFI that captures significant attention in the cryptocurrency space. Here are some key takeaways from the disclosure regarding this specific earning: Source of Income: World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Amount Earned: Approximately $57.35 million. Primary Method: Earnings derived mainly from token sales. Timeframe Covered: Calendar year 2024. What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and How Did it Generate DeFi Earnings? The report identifies World Liberty Financial (WLFI) as a DeFi project. For those new to the concept, DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, refers to financial activities conducted on a blockchain network without traditional intermediaries like banks. These projects often involve lending, borrowing, trading, and earning yield through smart contracts. The disclosure states that Trump’s earnings from WLFI were primarily from “token sales.” In the crypto world, token sales are a common way for projects to raise funds and distribute their native tokens to early investors or the public. The nature of Trump’s stake – whether he was an early investor, advisor, or held a different kind of ownership – is not explicitly detailed in the snippet, but the mechanism of earning was through the sale of these tokens. Understanding how DeFi earnings like this can materialize involves recognizing the potential value appreciation of a project’s native token. If a project gains traction and its token price increases, selling a large holding of these tokens can result in substantial profits, as appears to be the case here. Why Does a Political Figure’s Crypto Portfolio Matter? The financial activities of political figures crypto holdings are subject to intense scrutiny. Financial disclosures serve a crucial purpose: promoting transparency and identifying potential conflicts of interest. When a high-profile politician holds significant stakes in specific companies or projects, especially in emerging and less-regulated sectors like crypto and DeFi, it raises questions about: Potential influence on policy or regulation concerning that sector. How their public statements might impact the value of their holdings. The source and nature of the wealth being accumulated. President Trump has had a complex relationship with cryptocurrency, previously expressing skepticism but more recently showing openness and even launching his own line of NFTs and engaging with the crypto community. The TRUMP Memecoin: A Separate Story It’s important to note what this particular disclosure does *not* cover. The report explicitly states that the document, covering the calendar year 2024, does not include earnings from Trump’s popular memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP). Memecoins are a volatile and speculative class of cryptocurrencies often created around internet memes, cultural trends, or, in this case, political figures. The TRUMP memecoin gained significant popularity and saw considerable trading volume, particularly in late 2024 and early 2025. Any earnings Trump may have received from activities related to the TRUMP memecoin would fall under the financial disclosure covering the calendar year 2025, which will be released next year. This distinction highlights the different ways political figures are engaging with the digital asset space – from stakes in specific projects like World Liberty Financial to the creation or association with culturally driven tokens like memecoins. Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Politics and Digital Assets The revelation of such substantial Donald Trump crypto earnings from a DeFi project underscores the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance, reaching even the highest levels of political leadership. As the crypto market matures and adoption grows, we are likely to see more instances of public officials holding and reporting digital asset holdings. This trend brings both opportunities and challenges. For the crypto industry, it can signal growing legitimacy and adoption. For the political sphere, it necessitates clear guidelines, robust disclosure mechanisms, and careful consideration of potential ethical implications. The World Liberty Financial earnings, as detailed in the latest Trump financial disclosure , serve as a powerful example of the significant wealth being generated within the digital asset ecosystem and the importance of transparency as these assets become part of public officials’ financial portfolios. As the landscape continues to evolve, understanding the nature of these holdings, the mechanisms of earning (like token sales and DeFi earnings ), and the regulatory framework surrounding them will be crucial for both the public and policymakers. The involvement of high-profile political figures crypto investments ensures this remains a closely watched area. Summary: A Glimpse into High-Profile Crypto Wealth President Donald Trump’s 2025 financial disclosure has provided a rare glimpse into the significant crypto earnings being realized by high-profile individuals. The reported $57.3 million from his stake in World Liberty Financial, primarily through token sales, highlights the potential profitability within the DeFi space. This disclosure, while extensive, covers earnings only up to the end of 2024, leaving potential future revelations regarding other digital assets, like the TRUMP memecoin, for subsequent reports. It reinforces the growing presence of digital assets in political finance and the ongoing need for transparency and clear ethical considerations in this evolving domain.

Backed by growing institutional interest, regulatory clarity, and a dedicated community, XRP is emerging as a serious contender for the next major move—even as BTC hesitates. This article breaks down the technical signals, market behavior, and broader trends suggesting why XRP could surge ahead while the rest of the market treads water. Bitcoin Bulls Struggle as Battle Wages on Price Frontlines Source: tradingview Bitcoin wavers around one hundred five thousand, indicating a challenging period for bulls. Bears seem to have a slight edge with the price hovering below resistance at nearly one hundred eleven thousand. The coin's one-week rise of about three percent shows some potential, but the one-month gain is not as promising. The support sits close to ninety-eight thousand, providing a foundation to build on if bulls gather strength. As Bitcoin approaches its one-hundred-day moving average of one hundred eight thousand, breaking through could lead to growth. Achieving this could push the price towards the second resistance, translating to a potential gain of about ten percent. XRP Struggles as Bears Clamp Down, Eyeing Recovery to $2.68 Source: tradingview XRP teeters in a tight range between just over two to less than two and a half dollars, reflecting a market in a struggle between bulls and bears. Recent movements have pushed the price up by roughly two and a half percent this week, but it remains down nearly seventeen and ten percent in the last month and six months, respectively. Bulls aim for the first resistance at just over two and a half dollars, a leap of around nine percent from current levels. If momentum kicks in, XRP could aim for nearly three percent higher at the second resistance. Current indicators lean bearish, but eyes watch closely for signs of recovery. Why XRP Could Explode Here’s why XRP could outperform, even while Bitcoin struggles: Deep Liquidity Role vs. Messaging SystemsRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently stated that XRP could capture up to 14% of SWIFT's global liquidity volume within five years by serving as a bridge asset—not just a messaging tool. That’s a powerful long-term narrative for institutional investors. Speed & Cost Efficiency in Cross‑Border PaymentsXRP enables near-instantaneous currency conversions, reducing the need for pre-funded bank accounts and slashing intermediary costs—a stark contrast to the slower, fee-heavy SWIFT process. Tokenized Asset Growth PotentialRipple insiders at XRP APEX 2025 highlighted demand in the tokenized assets sector, suggesting XRP may serve as foundational liquidity for hundreds of billions of tokenized securities. Lower Correlation with BTCUnlike many altcoins that mirror Bitcoin’s price action, XRP often shows independent strength, making its recent consolidation a potential signal of bend—but-not-break resilience. Institutional Confidence & Community BackingRipple's proactive engagement with regulators, partners, and big‑name clients lends increasing credibility to XRP’s use-case, fueling renewed institutional interest and broader acceptance.
