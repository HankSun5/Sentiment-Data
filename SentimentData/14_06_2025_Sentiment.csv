Each is moving on strong catalysts, but FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out for its early-stage growth potential and explosive return forecasts. Dogecoin (DOGE) Poised for Momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) is flashing breakout signals as it climbs toward $0.20, with a 23.70% jump in daily volume confirming rising interest. Analyst Trader Tardigrade notes that Dogecoin (DOGE) has cleanly broken past a long-standing resistance trendline, with an impending MACD crossover further strengthening the bullish case. Adoption metrics are also turning heads. According to Santiment , the number of Dogecoin (DOGE) wallet holders has soared to 7.97 million. This surge reflects growing trust and reinforces Dogecoin (DOGE) as a top altcoin in terms of both reach and engagement. XRP Global Reset Narrative Gains Traction XRP is fueling global reset narratives as real-world use cases and institutional backing accelerate. Crypto educator Edo Farina reports that a Chinese firm, Webus International Limited, recently filed a Form 6-K with the SEC, revealing a $300 million XRP treasury management initiative. Furthermore, the approval of RLUSD under Dubai’s DFSA regime, as announced by Ripple, allows XRP-backed stablecoins to operate on XRPL and Ethereum, adding utility. Adding to its widespread acceptance, XRP’s recognition by the United Nations establishes it as a serious player in the future of regulated altcoins. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Altcoin Eyeing a Meteoric $4 Rally While Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP dominate headlines, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is generating buzz with a projected climb from $0.00000035 to $4. This price target signifies an ROI that is truly unparalleled in the current altcoin market, setting a new benchmark for potential gains. With the altcoin still in Stage 2 of its presale, the window presents a rapidly closing opportunity for early adopters to secure explosive upside. Investor activity backs the hype. Over $441,000 has already been raised in the ongoing Stage 2, following $2 million secured in Stage 1, signaling strong market demand. As the upcoming price increase nears, interest in FloppyPepe (FPPE) is surging. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Beyond the Hype – Utility and Trust FloppyPepe (FPPE) is building long-term value through utility. Its AI tools include FloppyAI for real-time market analysis, FloppyX for generating short-form videos, and Meme-o-matic for meme creation. These features put FloppyPepe (FPPE) at the intersection of crypto utility and culture. Investor confidence is further boosted by a smart contract audit completed by SolidProof. Its Floppynomics model also supports sustainability. A 1% transaction burn reduces the circulating supply, 1% rewards holders, and 1% supports wildlife conservation. Meanwhile, top crypto analyst Nass Crypto recently called FloppyPepe (FPPE) an AI gem to his audience of over 1 million, sparking a surge of organic attention. These credibility drivers are fueling its rise as a breakout altcoin. Positioning for Profit: Secure An 80% Token Bonus To incentivize new participants, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is offering an 80% token bonus, now available with the code FLOPPY80 at checkout. This bonus, combined with the deeply discounted entry price of FloppyPepe (FPPE), has ignited FOMO as more buyers rush to secure tokens. With presale progress moving quickly, the opportunity window is closing fast. Investors are urged to buy tokens now and capitalize on this time-sensitive bonus before it’s too late. The demand and FOMO for the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale is already skyrocketing, and only early investors will be able to make potential profits from this rival altcoin. Catch The Next Meme Coin Explosion With The FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale The altcoin and meme coin market is heating up, with Dogecoin (DOGE) showing signs of a breakout, XRP locking in key milestones, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) eyeing an explosive rally. These assets signal that capital is flowing back into crypto broadly. However, the true winner, though, is FloppyPepe (FPPE) , with its sky-high potential and amazing utility. Now is the moment to act. Early positioning in altcoins like FloppyPepe (FPPE) could define portfolios for years to come. As Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP move the macro needle, this rival AI meme coin might be the breakout story everyone wishes they had bought into sooner.

The plan seeks to address Cardano’s low stablecoin-to-TVL ratio. A sovereign-style fund structure and governance board are being considered. Charles Hoskinson , founder of Cardano and CEO of Input Output Global, proposed a plan to convert $100 million worth of ADA from the protocol’s treasury into a blend of stablecoins and Bitcoin. According to a video published by Hoskinson on June 13, Cardano’s current stablecoin-to-TVL ratio is lagging behind Ethereum and Solana, which exceed 100%. He argued that using a portion of the treasury to support stablecoin liquidity could strengthen Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem and attract broader participation. Cardano Decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund https://t.co/8RIELNl872 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 13, 2025 Hoskinson Suggests Treasury Diversification He suggested the converted funds could be allocated across existing assets within Cardano, such as stablecoins like USDA, USDM, and IiUSD, as well as BTC to support emerging Bitcoin DeFi products. “ADA does not have a liquidity problem, so no proposal’s been pushed yet,” Hoskinson said, adding that the network’s daily trading volume would be sufficient to absorb the proposed sale over time through OTC and TWAP mechanisms. He dismissed concerns that such a transaction would depress the price of ADA. The video introduced the idea of a sovereign-style fund structure for managing treasury assets. Hoskinson said this could involve the election of a governing board and partnerships with regulated Web3 asset managers to generate yield and reinvest proceeds into the ecosystem. He emphasized the need to prepare Cardano’s treasury for multi-asset holdings, noting upcoming features such as partner chains and native token support. “As we’re doing the post-mortem on the budget process, make some provisions in the Constitution for more granular treasury management on the portfolio allocation side,” he said. Cardano Joins Broader Push for Multi-Asset Treasury Governance Hoskinson said discussions are ongoing with DeFi projects and large token holders, with the goal of having a formal proposal in place before the Rare Evo conference later this year. “I would argue we need to enhance the voting system as well,” said Hoskinson. “I think the time has come to have some form of anonymous ballot for certain voting rounds so that people, especially smaller people, can vote without fear of retaliation.” Cardano is one of several networks exploring treasury diversification through multi-asset reserves and off-chain yield generation. These efforts follow the model of sovereign-style funds, where asset conversion and reallocation are managed to maintain spending capacity over time. Some DeFi ecosystems are also beginning to introduce formal oversight structures for protocol funds. Proposals under review include elected boards, third-party asset managers, and cross-chain capital deployment, marking a shift in how on-chain treasuries are structured and governed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does Cardano’s treasury compare with other blockchain protocols in size and structure? Cardano holds one of the largest protocol treasuries in crypto, with around 1.7 billion ADA. Unlike some competitors, it currently lacks a yield strategy or multi-asset diversification, which is what this proposal seeks to change. What are the risks of converting ADA to stablecoins and BTC? Risks include market exposure to external assets, execution slippage, and potential backlash from stakeholders concerned about deviating from ADA-only holdings. Regulatory classification of stablecoins could also affect strategy. Could this proposal affect ADA’s on-chain governance or community voting power? If treasury allocations shift to non-ADA assets, and yield returns are reinvested differently, governance weight tied to ADA holdings might dilute unless explicitly addressed in the system design. What precedent is there for treasury investment in crypto ecosystems? Projects like MakerDAO, Optimism, and Uniswap have begun exploring treasury diversification through RWAs, yield-bearing stablecoins, and partnerships with asset managers, but execution varies widely. Why might Cardano want to prioritize Bitcoin DeFi integration? Integrating BTC liquidity could attract new users, tap into dormant capital, and complement stablecoin growth, especially if paired with cross-chain yield strategies and institutional-grade custodial support.

However, the emergence of Ruvi AI , a blockchain-powered platform integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), is sparking conversations among analysts who believe it could surpass Ethereum in potential return on investment. With predictions of a $1 token valuation before the end of 2025 , Ruvi AI is quickly gaining traction as an innovative and lucrative opportunity. Can Ruvi AI Surpass Ethereum? Ethereum’s success is rooted in its early adoption of smart contracts and widespread usage in decentralized applications. Similarly, Ruvi AI is carving its own space in the crypto industry by merging blockchain and AI. This integration allows Ruvi AI to address real-world challenges in industries such as marketing , entertainment , and finance , something Ethereum initially lacked focus on. What makes Ruvi AI particularly attractive are its early-stage growth opportunities. Investors entering during Ruvi AI’s ongoing Phase 2 presale can purchase tokens at just $0.015 each . This low entry point provides a stark contrast to Ethereum’s current valuation, making Ruvi AI a more accessible option for those seeking high returns. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success and Projected Growth Ruvi AI’s presale performance speaks volumes about its market potential. The project has already raised an impressive $1.7 million and sold over 145 million tokens , reflecting growing investor confidence in its vision. By the time the presale ends, Ruvi AI’s token price will increase to $0.07 , a clear and transparent move outlined in its roadmap. This price adjustment is not speculation-driven but part of Ruvi AI’s deliberate strategy to ensure steady growth. Post-listing, analysts predict the token could hit $1 in valuation , representing a 66x return for those who invest early during the presale. Amplified Gains With Ruvi AI’s VIP Tiers For investors looking to boost their returns even further, Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers packed with significant bonuses. Here’s a detailed breakdown: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These tiers are designed to reward early participants, offering opportunities to multiply earnings as the token’s value grows. Building Trust Through Transparency and Security Ruvi AI is not just promising high returns but also focusing on investor reassurance. Its upcoming third-party audit by CyberScope , a leader in blockchain security, will provide a comprehensive review of the platform’s infrastructure. This audit aims to validate Ruvi AI’s codebase and security measures, further elevating confidence among potential investors. Furthermore, Ruvi AI has established a partnership with WEEX Exchange , ensuring global liquidity and smooth trading for its tokens. Such collaborations signify Ruvi AI’s commitment to creating a trustworthy, scalable platform. Real-World Applications That Scale One of Ruvi AI’s defining features is its focus on real-world utility , which sets it apart from speculative tokens. By leveraging AI and blockchain, Ruvi AI creates scalable solutions across key sectors: Marketing: AI-powered analytics empower businesses to refine customer targeting, enhance engagement, and improve campaign results. Entertainment: The platform enables personalized recommendations and integrates secure payment systems, strengthening the connection between creators and audiences. Finance: Ruvi AI applies blockchain for fraud prevention and transaction transparency, making financial operations more efficient and secure. These practical applications ensure Ruvi AI is not just a profitable investment opportunity but also a platform with staying power across industries. Why Ruvi AI Could Outperform Ethereum While Ethereum’s legacy remains strong, its growth potential is naturally limited due to market maturity. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, stands at the cusp of exponential growth with its low entry point , planned valuation increases , and real-world applications . With its $0.015 presale price , attractive VIP rewards , security measures like the CyberScope audit , and its WEEX partnership , Ruvi AI provides an enticing mix of affordability and long-term scalability. These factors make it a compelling option for investors seeking substantial returns before 2025 ends. For those ready to seize a groundbreaking opportunity, Ruvi AI is the rare project that combines innovation, practicality, and explosive growth potential. Secure your stake today and join a revolution that may one day rival, or even surpass, Ethereum’s massive success.

45961347,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70962,1749855638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Sends Urgent Warning to XRP and Crypto Holders,https://timestabloid.com/expert-sends-urgent-warning-to-xrp-and-crypto-holders/,"In a stark video message shared on X, Levi of Crypto Crusaders delivered a sobering warning to holders of XRP and other cryptocurrencies. Citing a statement from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Levi cautioned that the broader crypto market could face a brutal downturn if looming economic risks are not properly addressed. “If you hold any XRP or any other cryptocurrency, I need you to see what I’m about to show you,” Levi began. According to Levi, Secretary Bessent recently issued a dire assessment of the U.S. economy, warning that if the current debt ceiling impasse remains unresolved , the United States could face its worst financial crisis since the 2008 global meltdown. Levi described this as “the most shocking statement any Treasury Secretary has ever made,” emphasizing that the implications stretch far beyond traditional markets and could strike the heart of crypto investments. URGENT WARNING FOR #XRP & CRYPTO HOLDERS! pic.twitter.com/UhVCrUWxAI — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) June 12, 2025 Risk-Off Sentiment Could Trigger Selloffs The core of Levi’s warning is grounded in historical behavior during financial crises. As panic sets in and liquidity tightens, investors tend to abandon riskier asset classes, and crypto sits high on that list. Bitcoin may enjoy some hedge-like qualities in certain macro cycles, but Levi pointed out that altcoins, particularly low-cap and speculative tokens, are likely to face the brunt of the selloff. “During times of financial crisis, people sell their riskier assets,” Levi explained. “If we don’t see the interest rate being lowered by the Federal Reserve before the end of this year, it’s very likely a lot of altcoins, especially the mid to low caps, will get decimated — similar to how they got decimated back in 2021.” His reference to the 2021-2022 crypto crash is a sobering reminder of how quickly markets can unravel under economic stress. In that period, soaring inflation and tightening monetary policy led to a rapid collapse in token prices across the board. Levi’s forecast suggests that without decisive action from the Federal Reserve, the crypto market could be heading into a similarly turbulent phase. Why Interest Rates Matter for Crypto Levi’s concerns also highlight a crucial but often overlooked relationship between monetary policy and the health of the crypto market. When interest rates are high, capital becomes more expensive, borrowing slows, and risk appetite declines. Investors tend to favor safer, yield-bearing assets like government bonds over speculative plays like altcoins. Conversely, when interest rates are lowered, liquidity returns to the market, borrowing costs drop, and high-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, often rally as a result. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For XRP and other digital assets, lower interest rates could act as a tailwind, encouraging institutional investment and retail speculation alike. But with the Federal Reserve maintaining a cautious stance amid persistent inflationary pressures, the hoped-for pivot to rate cuts remains uncertain. If rates remain elevated, the outcome could be catastrophic for certain segments of the crypto market. A Call for Caution While Levi did not issue a blanket call to sell, his message was clear: investors should be prepared. A potential convergence of economic instability, regulatory uncertainty, and hawkish central bank policy poses a serious threat to crypto valuations in the coming months. In Levi’s words, “There’s a reason this warning is coming now. We could be on the edge of something bigger than we’ve seen since 2008.” As global markets hold their breath, crypto holders — particularly those invested in altcoins — would do well to stay informed, practice risk management, and monitor the economic landscape closely. In volatile times like these, even one policy decision or macro shift can reshape the future of digital finance overnight.

As a result, the Donald Trump-backed company has the agency’s greenlight to implement a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury plan . “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities. By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our FinTech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy,” Devin Nunes, Trump Media’s CEO and President, noted What the Approval of Trump Media’s Bitcoin Treasury Bid Means The adoption of Bitcoin by the Trump-backed company is a top gesture that the United States will continue to support the cryptocurrency industry in the long haul. The SEC and the Congress have been working towards ensuring a clear crypto regulatory landscape is implemented in the shortest time possible. As a result, more institutional investors will follow in the same direction of adopting Bitcoin to hedge against high inflation. At the time of this writing, data from BitcoinTreasuries suggest that 235 institutional investors currently hold over 3.4 million BTCs in their respective treasury accounts. The ultimate impact of the rising demand for Bitcoin is a further stress on the supply vs demand shock, which has fueled the BTC rally in the past year. From a technical analysis standpoint, BTC price will experience a parabolic rally before the end of this year catalyzed by institutional investors and clear regulatory frameworks.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 23:12:22

In addition to the direct donation, the foundation said it will match up to $750,000 in community contributions. Ethereum Foundation Steps in to Support Roman Storm as Tornado Cash Trial Looms Storm is set to stand trial on July 14, 2025, in Manhattan federal court. He is charged with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter, conspiracy to launder money, and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions. The Ethereum Foundation described its donation as a stand for privacy and open-source development. “Privacy is normal, and writing code is not a crime,” it wrote in a statement posted Friday on X . The EF is donating $500K to the legal defense of Roman Storm, and we will match up to a further $750K in donations from the community. Privacy is normal, and writing code is not a crime. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) June 13, 2025 Storm was indicted in August 2023 for his role in building and maintaining Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer accused of facilitating the laundering of over $1 billion in illicit funds. The service allegedly allowed users to obscure the source and destination of transactions, an activity that U.S. authorities say was exploited by hackers and criminal networks to move stolen assets . Storm’s trial comes as prosecutors and regulators increase scrutiny of crypto tools tied to privacy and decentralization. His defense has argued that the case threatens the foundation of decentralized finance (DeFi) by criminalizing open-source development. “In 31 days, I face trial,” Storm said in a Friday post on X. “The DOJ wants to bury DeFi, saying I should’ve controlled it, added KYC, never built it. SDNY is trying to crush me, blocking every expert witness. If I lose, DeFi dies with me.” His co-founder, Roman Semenov, was also charged in the case but remains at large, reportedly in Russia. A third developer, Alexey Pertsev, was convicted of money laundering by a Dutch court in May and sentenced to more than five years in prison. He is currently under electronic monitoring as his appeal progresses . Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2022 . The agency claimed the tool had facilitated over $7 billion in illicit transactions since 2019 and failed to adopt safeguards against criminal misuse. Storm’s legal team previously sought to dismiss the charges, arguing that OFAC overstepped its authority by sanctioning the mixer’s smart contracts. That motion followed a separate ruling in a related case that questioned the agency’s reach over decentralized code. With the trial approaching, the Ethereum Foundation’s contribution marks one of the most high-profile shows of support yet for Storm and raises broader questions about how far developers should be held responsible for permissionless code. Vitalik Buterin Donates $170K to Support Tornado Cash Developers Early This Year Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated 50 ETH, worth around $170,000 in January 2025 , to support the legal defense of Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev. @VitalikButerin has stepped forward with a substantial donation to support the legal defense of Tornado Cash developers. #Buterin #ETH https://t.co/b6gbH3KxZw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 1, 2025 The contribution was confirmed through the Juicebox project “Free Pertsev and Storm,” which has so far raised over $650,000 through JusticeDAO, a decentralized fund backed by the crypto community. Buterin’s support follows mounting legal pressure on the developers. In May, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed it would proceed with federal charges against Storm, including allegations of money laundering and sanctions violations. DOJ pursues federal charges against Roman Storm, cofounder of Tornado Cash, after dropping unlicensed money transmission charge. #TornadoCash #RomanStorm https://t.co/ZGXe7IGREZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 16, 2025 The charge relating to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business was later dropped . The legal campaign against Storm has also sparked backlash across the crypto space. In April, the DeFi Education Fund urged the Trump administration to step in , calling the DOJ’s actions a “lawless prosecution” of open-source software developers. The petition has since gained momentum, with signatures from key industry figures including Coinbase’s Fred Ehrsam, Paradigm’s Matt Huang, and Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko.

Curious investors and seasoned traders alike are eagerly eyeing certain coins with the potential for exponential growth. This brief exploration delves into three standout altcoins poised for impressive gains, capable of transforming modest investments into substantial wealth. Dive deeper to discover these promising digital assets. SUI Price Action: Analyzing Recent Trends and Current Dynamics In the past month, SUI recorded a sharp decline of approximately 25.42%, coupled with a six-month drop near 31.94%. This period highlighted significant downward pressure, with historical price movements showcasing both rapid recoveries and severe sell-offs. The momentum over the weeks was mixed, reflecting short-term upticks against a backdrop of overall weak performance. Notably, a 3.75% gain over the last week contrasts with the long-term bearish trend, indicating a phase of volatility that has tested both buyers and sellers. Currently, the price fluctuates between $2.77 and $4.01, with resistance levels identified at $4.77 and $6.01. Key support levels are found at $2.29 and $1.05. Current indicators reveal a bearish sentiment, with an Awesome Oscillator of -0.230 and a Momentum Indicator of -0.219, while the RSI is around 39.66. Although bulls have made some gains this week, the market sentiment remains predominantly bearish without a clear trend. Traders should monitor these levels for buying opportunities near support and consider profit-taking if resistance is breached, while acting cautiously in this volatile environment. Kaspa (KAS): Past Trends and Key Levels Shape the Near-Term Outlook Kaspa experienced a one-month decline of 37.3% and a six-month drop of 49.7%. The market has shown significant lows and steep falls, indicating a consistent bearish pressure. This performance highlights the challenges faced by investors and the overall sentiment in the market. The past weeks have reflected a struggle to regain stability, driven by negative trends and decreased interest among traders. The current price for Kaspa sits within a range of approximately $0.065 to $0.116, with support at $0.047 and resistance at $0.15. Bears continue to dominate, supported by negative momentum signals and a low RSI near 36. There is no clear upward or downward trend, allowing for trade opportunities based on price fluctuations. Short-term buying near the support level could be considered, while caution is advised regarding potential declines. A break above $0.15 may signal a shift that could favor bulls, suggesting the need for tight stop-loss orders to manage risks. Hyperliquid Shows Robust Growth and Bullish Potential Hyperliquid experienced substantial gains in recent periods, with a 16.05% increase over one week followed by a 52.88% rise in one month. Over the past six months, the coin advanced by 62.21%, showing vibrant investor interest and pronounced price expansion. Movements ranged from a low of $21.20 to a high near $42.08, reflecting dynamic market activity. These gains underline the asset’s evolving strength and momentum, highlighting consistent upward trends and bullish sentiment that encouraged traders to take strong positions. At present, Hyperliquid trades within a range between $21 and $42. The market has identified resistance at approximately $51 and support just under $10. A secondary target for upward movement exists near $72, suggesting additional gains may be possible if bulls can overcome current obstacles. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index near 63 show buying interest is sustained without reaching overbought territory. With technical signals favoring bulls while acknowledging potential pauses ahead, investors are closely monitoring these key levels. Strategies include entering near support to capture pullbacks and watching resistance for breakouts. Overall, the situation is balanced with bullish strength but still respects previous trading thresholds. Conclusion SUI , KAS , and HYPE are promising investments with potential for high returns by 2025. Their unique features and growing user base suggest significant growth opportunities. These coins have demonstrated strong performance and innovation in the crypto market. Keeping an eye on their development and market trends could prove beneficial. Investing in these altcoins could lead to substantial financial gains in the near future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Qubetics Could Be Among the Top Altcoins to Buy This Year,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-not-buying-chainlink-early-qubetics-could-be-among-the-top-altcoins-to-buy-this-year/,"The altcoin landscape in mid-2025 is once again shifting. As the broader market stabilizes, with Bitcoin maintaining its position above $70,000 and Ethereum holding near $3,700, market attention is turning to altcoins that offer real infrastructure value rather than speculative hype. Chainlink ($LINK)—one of the most pivotal DeFi infrastructure projects—continues to be a benchmark for long-term performance, having launched at just $0.11 in 2017 and now trading above $14. The protocol played a foundational role in connecting smart contracts to off-chain data, and its impact on the broader blockchain ecosystem remains significant. Yet, as market participants look for new opportunities with asymmetric upside, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged as a powerful contender among the top altcoins to buy. While Chainlink solidified its place in crypto history, Qubetics is building for the future—delivering solutions for one of blockchain’s most persistent challenges: cross-border transactions. Qubetics is gaining attention for more than just projections—it’s standing out for its bold approach to tokenomics, reduced total supply, and a focused commitment to solving real-world inefficiencies in cross-border value transfer. Unlike earlier blockchain initiatives that emphasized scalability without addressing end-user pain points, Qubetics is delivering practical infrastructure designed to streamline international payments across chains and currencies. Analysts have issued confident forecasts, with long-term valuations ranging between $10 and $15 following mainnet launch—highlighting the protocol’s potential to emerge as a dominant force in next-generation decentralized finance, making it the top altcoins to buy now. Qubetics ($TICS): Practical Solutions for Cross-Border Financial Connectivity Qubetics is entering the final stage of its crypto presale , but the traction it has achieved in just three months reflects more than market timing—it reflects market fit. The protocol’s core utility revolves around solving one of blockchain’s most under-addressed challenges: efficient cross-border transactions. Despite advancements across the industry, sending money across jurisdictions remains expensive, fragmented, and time-consuming. Qubetics is building infrastructure to make these transactions seamless, fast, and accessible across multiple chains and currencies. Traditional cross-border transactions often involve delays, high intermediary fees, and complex compliance checks. For businesses operating internationally—whether it’s an e-commerce brand in the US sourcing products from Southeast Asia or a European SaaS platform accepting payments from Latin America—these inefficiencies eat into profits and stall growth. Qubetics addresses this problem with its decentralised payment rails, allowing direct, peer-to-peer transfers validated on-chain without banks or intermediaries. This significantly reduces transaction costs, enables near-instant settlements, and ensures traceability and transparency without compromising security. With its native interoperability, Qubetics supports seamless asset flow across major blockchain networks, removing the need for wrapped tokens or centralised bridges. A logistics startup in Nairobi can pay suppliers in Tokyo using $TICS without worrying about currency exchange delays or hefty conversion fees. Similarly, freelancers in remote locations can receive payments securely, while platforms leveraging Qubetics can automatically comply with regional regulations using its embedded compliance modules. This makes Qubetics more than a payments tool—it becomes a real-world financial infrastructure for the decentralized age and the top altcoins to buy today. Use cases for Qubetics span a broad spectrum. Global freelancers, for example, face significant payment delays and excessive conversion fees—Qubetics enables instant, stablecoin-based payouts across borders. Small businesses managing international vendors or customers can settle invoices securely and immediately without third-party interference or the volatility of traditional remittance channels. Even nonprofits distributing aid to remote regions can benefit from transparent, traceable on-chain payments that reduce corruption and middlemen. Currently, Qubetics is in Stage 37 of its crypto presale. The token is priced at $0.3370, with 10 million tokens remaining before its public allocation closes. A listing price of $0.40 has been confirmed, providing a 20% ROI for final-stage buyers. Being one of the top altcoins to buy, this project has already raised over $18 million from more than 27,900 holders and has distributed over 515 million $TICS tokens, indicating strong early adoption. In a major shift toward scarcity and governance decentralization, Qubetics recently reduced its total token supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion and increased its public sale allocation to 38.55%. Analysts are taking notice, with price forecasts ranging from $1 shortly after listing to $10–$15 post-mainnet launch. For a strategic buyer, the numbers are compelling: an $18,000 investment at the current price secures approximately 53,414 $TICS. At $1, that value rises to $53,414. At $5, it reaches $267,070. And at $15, the projected high, it grows to $801,210. The Qubetics ecosystem is supported by real infrastructure tools. QubeQode, a proprietary development IDE, allows developers to build blockchain applications natively. TICSScan provides block-level transparency. This is not a marketing campaign in search of utility; this is a fully structured ecosystem aimed at driving long-term adoption in both enterprise and retail environments. Chainlink ($LINK): The Oracle Pioneer with Long-Term Stability Chainlink revolutionized the way smart contracts interact with external data, making it a cornerstone of the modern DeFi infrastructure. From its modest beginnings at $0.11 per token, Chainlink surged to over $50 during the 2021 bull run and currently trades in the $13–$14 range as of June 2025. Its decentralized oracle networks have been integrated across sectors ranging from decentralized finance and insurance to gaming and logistics, enabling smart contracts to execute with real-world information securely. The protocol’s development has not slowed. Recent launches such as Chainlink Functions and the continued rollout of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) are focused on enhancing developer tools and expanding cross-chain communication capabilities. Chainlink’s positioning today is less about explosive growth and more about sustained reliability. It has become a foundational layer for many applications, earning its status as a blue-chip asset within the digital asset class. However, the significant gains made in its early years have leveled off, and many in the market now view Chainlink as a long-term hold rather than a high-growth opportunity. For those seeking substantial near-term appreciation—especially among the top altcoins to buy—emerging Layer-1 protocols like Qubetics are generating more aggressive interest. Conclusion: Chainlink Holds the Past, Qubetics May Define What’s Next Chainlink remains an essential component of the blockchain data infrastructure. It continues to deliver reliable value for those seeking a secure and established asset. However, its growth is now measured and incremental. For buyers seeking dynamic upside, with direct application to real-world financial problems and a tokenomics structure designed for performance, Qubetics stands out as one of the top altcoins to buy in this cycle. The presale is nearing completion. The final $TICS tokens are in distribution. The listing price offers immediate upside, and the longer-term forecasts signal the kind of potential that early-stage backers seek. With global use cases, an aggressive development roadmap, and measurable demand, Qubetics offers more than narrative—it offers execution. For those who missed the earliest days of Chainlink, Qubetics may offer a comparable opportunity, backed by stronger fundamentals, a community-first distribution model, and real-world solutions.

Officials in the department’s antitrust division, who are probing the deal , have reportedly been examining the details of the Alphabet Inc. unit’s plan following its announcement in March, said the sources, who asked to be kept anonymous. Such inquiries include discussions with the merging companies as well as competitors and customers. The review, which is still in its early stages, is expected to last some months and will ultimately determine whether US officials let the deal proceed. The review is in its early stages and could take months Full-scale antitrust merger reviews are relatively rare compared to the number of deals announced each year, so the firms have been preparing for scrutiny . Google has agreed to pay Wiz a breakup fee of about $3.2 billion, or about 10% of the deal value, if it doesn’t close, which is a risk as the iconic company has been facing intense antitrust scrutiny from Washington. In the past year, federal judges found that it has illegal monopolies in online search and some advertising technology markets. As such, it is facing a potential breakup of large parts of its business, including its Chrome web browser and some advertising tools used to place display ads around the web. Google’s planned acquisition of Wiz is one of its largest purchases Wiz is not Google’s first large cybersecurity purchase. In 2022, it acquired Mandiant for $5.4 billion in an effort to bulk up its cloud computing business, which has historically lagged behind its peers. Google’s largest acquisitions by dollar value. Source: App Economy Insights If the deal goes through, it will have set a record as one of the company’s largest purchases, beating its Motorola purchase of $12.5 billion and the Mandiant acquisition of $5.4 billion. Mandiant and Wiz provide complementary services. However, while Mandiant specializes in threat intelligence and cyber breaches, Wiz’s tools do that and work to identify and block threats across organizations’ often-complex cloud environments. Wiz is also integrated with competing services from Amazon.com Inc., Oracle Corp. and Microsoft. While announcing the deal, Google touted the acquisition as a way to beef up its cloud security offerings and provide customers with new ways to keep their systems secure in a new era of AI. Both companies have said Wiz’s products will continue to work on major cloud platforms, including competing services. Google’s attempt to acquire Wiz is happening at a time when the cloud security market is booming. The market is already worth over $30 billion today, and that value is expected to triple by 2034.

With ADA currently trading near $0.69, backed by a strong ecosystem of smart contracts and DeFi integration, MUTM is turning heads thanks to its aggressive presale momentum, upcoming CertiK audit, and lean protocol design targeted at DeFi users. The project has gained more than 11,900 investors who have contributed $10.45 million during the ongoing presale. Investors taking part in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will see a 100% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Analysts highlight MUTM as one of the best new altcoins to buy now, citing its low entry price, scalable architecture, and potential to become the next big cryptocurrency. As investors ask what crypto to invest in before altcoins run full steam, MUTM’s positioning under $1 makes it a standout in today’s fast-moving market. Reimagining DeFi Lending with a Powerful Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders can depend on regular income, while borrowers find safe options when they borrow money. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance Presale Now Underway The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of risky meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $10.45 million total sales and attracted more than 11,900 token holders before the following price adjustment. Certified Secure: USD-Pegged Stablecoin Validated by CertiK Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin’s robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. Underpinned by open-source smart contracts and the success of a Certik audit, the platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem, charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. Early Investors Reap Rewards as Community Expands As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway prize, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. Cardano’s sluggish network activity and fading transaction volumes are casting doubt over ADA’s near-term prospects, prompting many investors to reassess their exposure. Meanwhile, smart money is pivoting toward high-utility projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as the best new altcoin to watch, with its presale already drawing in over $10.45 million from 11,900+ investors and delivering real utility at just $0.03 per token. With a launch price of $0.06, early participants are set to lock in a 100% ROI, and analysts are forecasting breakout potential that could rival or even surpass major players like Cardano.

45962792,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=771525,1749857435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45962792.jpeg,"XRP Has A 70% Shot To Beat Bitcoin, Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-70-shot-to-beat-bitcoin-says-analyst/,"A fresh XRP/BTC chart released on 12 June by the market technician known as Dr. Cat has injected new controversy into one of crypto’s most stubborn trading pairs. The analyst, posting to X, argues that despite a bruising six-week slide, conditions still favour an eventual breakout for XRP that would leave Bitcoin lagging. He assigns the scenario a formidable 70 percent probability. XRP Vs. Bitcoin: 70% Chance Of Breakout, But When? At the heart of Dr. Cat’s thesis is the 2,041-satoshi level, where three separate Ichimoku timeframes—monthly, bi-monthly and tri-monthly—intersect. “The price keeps eating support after support with no reaction from bulls at all as if supports don’t exist,” he concedes, but he stresses that this specific shelf is “the most important support.” Related Reading: XRP Could Crash To $1.55 Before Explosive Surge, Analyst Warns Candles on the attached one-month chart already hover fractionally below the line; a decisive monthly close beneath it, he warns, would flip the three-day structure fully bearish and scatter the pair into unpredictable, possibly chaotic ranges. Even so, the strategist insists history is on the side of XRP bulls. “Price has spent years performing very well and coiling up with higher lows for this attack now,” he writes, framing the past twelve quarters as a prolonged accumulation that has never surrendered its series of macro higher lows. That coiling, he believes, will allow XRP to mount at least a “minor … attack in August” toward the 3,000-satoshi region—roughly a 45 percent appreciation from current levels—and perhaps fuel a “much bigger attack” once the broader market cycle matures. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Flag Pattern Above Accumulation Zone That Points To $5 Target The optimism is not unqualified. Dr. Cat calculates a 30 percent chance of a complete flop if 2,041 sats fails on a monthly-close basis. Under that bearish branch, the cross could slice toward 1,800 – 1,900 sats, attempt a feeble rebound, or continue a “slow bleed all the way down to the bottom of the range where it started the monster move.” In such a setback, he would not expect the long-anticipated “monster bullish move” until Q4 2025 at the earliest. For the moment, therefore, the market hangs on a single number. Hold above 2,041 and Dr. Cat sees a clear shot at outperforming Bitcoin—first modestly, then dramatically.

Ethena is gaining momentum with strong technical signals and growing traction in the DeFi space. Pi Coin continues to generate buzz, but questions around its delayed mainnet and unclear roadmap are keeping some traders cautious. In the middle of this activity, BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging as a clear standout. Still in presale, it has already raised over $299.6 million and sold 22.4 billion coins. The current price of $0.0276, offering 2660% ROI from batch 1 to batch 29. What makes BlockDAG different is not just scale, but presence. With 1.5 million users mining through the X1 app, a CertiK audit, and a gamified ecosystem, the project is already making waves. Add in the rumoured US-based sponsorship, and BDAG is poised to leap from crypto circles into the cultural spotlight. Ethena Climbs Toward $0.50 as DeFi Momentum Returns Ethena is gaining attention after breaking past key resistance levels, with analysts now targeting a move toward $0.50. Rising total value locked across its ecosystem is fueling confidence, while its synthetic stablecoin, USDe, continues to attract new interest. This resurgence in utility is placing Ethena in the spotlight as a DeFi contender with serious upside. Technical indicators are flashing bullish signals. Surging volume and strong moving averages support the rally, but Ethena still depends on broader market strength. If sentiment holds, ENA could lead the next DeFi breakout. If not, the move may lose steam just as quickly as it started. Pi Coin Rally Watch Begins, But Uncertainty Lingers Pi Coin is testing resistance near $0.66 after bouncing off recent lows, and trading volume is on the rise. Market chatter is heating up, with some speculating a run to $1.20 or even $2 if momentum continues. Much of the buzz comes from Pi’s large user base and mobile-first promise. Still, big questions remain. The mainnet has seen repeated delays, and the lack of a clear KYC rollout adds to concerns. On-chain activity is minimal, making real adoption hard to measure. Pi Coin has potential, but its future depends on clearing the fog around its execution and roadmap. BlockDAG Redefines Presale Power with $299.6M Raised and Viral Reach BlockDAG is pushing boundaries and setting new records for what a presale crypto can achieve. With over $299.6 million raised and 22.4 billion coins sold, it has become one of the standout campaigns of the year. Priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, BlockDAG has already sold 22.4B coins and raised $299.6 million. Those who joined in Batch 1 have gained 2,660%. What separates BlockDAG from other early-stage projects is not just numbers; it is visibility. The project has leaned into bold branding moves and already secured partnerships with names like Inter Milan and UFC champion Alex Pereira. This strategy pushes BlockDAG beyond the crypto niche and into wider cultural relevance. At the core is real utility. The X1 Miner app is live and growing rapidly, now used by over 1.5 million people globally. The app rewards users daily for simple engagement, no hardware or deep technical skills required. Accessibility is converting casual users into consistent contributors. Backed by CertiK-audited security, an EVM-compatible DAG structure, and viral features like Buyer Battles and streak rewards, BlockDAG is not waiting for its launch to deliver. It is already building the kind of engaged ecosystem most projects only dream about. The Bottom Line Ethena is gaining traction and Pi Coin is stirring speculation, but BlockDAG is building something far more complete. BlockDAG is rolling through Batch 29 at $0.0276. It’s raised $299.6 million and sold 22.4 billion coins and crossed 1.5 million x1 app users. Batch 1 holders? They’re sitting on 2,660% gains. More than just numbers, BlockDAG is edging into mainstream visibility. Its expanding brand strategy and real-world presence are setting it apart from typical presale projects. For those watching closely, BDAG is emerging as a leading contender for the highest potential crypto of 2025.

If you’re an investor or simply curious about the future of digital assets, a recent report from a major player in the institutional finance world has just dropped some significant insights. Coinbase Institutional , the arm of Coinbase catering to larger financial entities, has shared its outlook, and it’s decidedly bullish, especially when it comes to Bitcoin and its potential to reach new all-time highs ( ATHs ). What Did the Coinbase Institutional Report Say About Bitcoin ATHs? According to analysis highlighted by The Block, Coinbase Institutional believes that the stage is being set for Bitcoin to potentially achieve fresh ATHs in the latter half of 2025. This isn’t just a hopeful guess; their report outlines several key macroeconomic and industry-specific factors that they see driving this potential surge. It’s a forecast rooted in observed trends and anticipated policy shifts. Their perspective offers a glimpse into how large financial institutions are viewing the digital asset space. While retail interest often grabs headlines, the flow of capital and strategic positioning by institutional players like those served by Coinbase Institutional can significantly impact market dynamics and contribute to price movements towards new ATHs . What Factors Are Driving This Optimism for the Crypto Market? The report from Coinbase Institutional points to a confluence of factors that could create a favorable environment for Bitcoin and the broader Crypto Market . Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the potential trajectory outlined in their analysis. Here are the primary catalysts identified: Stronger U.S. Economic Growth: A robust economy can signal increased investor confidence and potentially more disposable or investable capital looking for returns, including in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Potential U.S. Federal Reserve Rate Cuts: Lower interest rates typically make riskier assets, such as growth stocks and potentially cryptocurrencies, more attractive compared to traditional fixed-income investments. This shift in monetary policy could encourage capital flows into the Crypto Market . Rising Corporate Adoption: As more corporations begin to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, integrate blockchain technology, or offer crypto-related services, it lends legitimacy and increases demand, contributing to Institutional Adoption . Greater Regulatory Clarity: Uncertainty around regulations has long been a hurdle for the Crypto Market . Clearer rules of the road can reduce risk for institutional investors, making it easier and safer for them to allocate capital to digital assets. These points collectively paint a picture of a maturing market environment where external economic forces and internal industry developments align to support upward price potential for Bitcoin towards new ATHs . Considering the Risks: What Could Challenge Bitcoin’s Rise to New ATHs? While the outlook is optimistic, Coinbase Institutional ‘s report doesn’t ignore potential headwinds. A balanced view is essential in any market forecast. They specifically mention two key risks: Rising Yields: Conversely to rate cuts, if bond yields rise unexpectedly, traditional safe-haven assets become more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from the Crypto Market . Leveraged Corporate Crypto Buying: While corporate adoption is a bullish signal, excessive use of leverage by companies to acquire crypto assets could introduce instability. A market downturn could trigger liquidations, amplifying price drops. These risks highlight the inherent volatility still present in the Crypto Market and serve as important considerations for investors evaluating the potential path to new ATHs . Why Does Institutional Adoption Matter for the Crypto Market? The mention of rising corporate and Institutional Adoption is particularly significant. Historically, the Crypto Market was dominated by retail investors. However, as infrastructure has improved and regulatory landscapes have begun to clarify, larger financial institutions, asset managers, and corporations are increasingly exploring or entering the space. This inflow of significant capital and expertise provides greater liquidity, stability, and validation to the market. Coinbase Institutional is at the forefront of facilitating this trend, and their insights are valuable because they are directly engaging with this crucial segment of the market. Actionable Insights: What Can Investors Learn from This Forecast? While no market forecast is a guarantee, the perspective from Coinbase Institutional offers several takeaways for those interested in the Crypto Market : Long-Term Perspective: The focus is on H2 2025, suggesting that significant price movements towards new ATHs might not be immediate. Patience could be key. Macroeconomic Awareness: Pay attention to global economic indicators, particularly U.S. growth data and Federal Reserve policy decisions, as these are identified as major drivers. Regulatory Watch: Keep an eye on regulatory developments. Positive clarity could unlock further institutional capital. Risk Management: Be aware of the potential risks, such as rising yields and leverage, and incorporate risk management into your investment strategy. This isn’t financial advice, but rather a look at the factors a major institutional player believes will shape the market. In Conclusion: A Bullish Horizon for Bitcoin and the Crypto Market? The report from Coinbase Institutional provides a compelling case for optimism regarding Bitcoin ‘s potential to reach new ATHs by the second half of 2025. Their analysis, grounded in anticipated macroeconomic shifts, increasing Institutional Adoption , and potential regulatory clarity, suggests a favorable environment is developing for the Crypto Market . While acknowledging the risks, the overall sentiment is clearly positive, offering a potential roadmap for what the coming years might hold for digital assets. It underscores the growing influence of institutional players and the evolving narrative around cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class.

Following a surge in Middle East tensions, the market saw a brief but sharp reaction, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable dip. However, the story didn’t end there. Demonstrating remarkable resilience, the Bitcoin price quickly began to recover, leaving many investors pondering the implications of geopolitical events on the digital asset landscape. Why Did Middle East Tensions Impact the Bitcoin Price? Geopolitical events often send ripples through global financial markets, and the crypto market is no exception. When tensions escalate in significant regions like the Middle East, several factors come into play: Risk-Off Sentiment: Investors tend to move away from perceived riskier assets and towards safer havens like gold or government bonds during times of uncertainty. While Bitcoin is sometimes seen as digital gold, its relatively young age and volatility mean some investors still classify it as a risk asset, leading to sell-offs during global fear. Liquidity Crunch: Major global events can sometimes lead to a need for immediate liquidity. This can cause investors to sell assets, including cryptocurrencies, to cover potential losses elsewhere or meet margin calls. Market Psychology: Fear and uncertainty are powerful drivers in any market. News headlines about escalating conflicts can trigger panic selling, even if the direct impact on the asset’s underlying fundamentals is minimal. The recent tensions between Israel and Iran served as a clear catalyst, prompting a swift reaction across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin saw a drop of approximately 5.5% from its recent highs as the news unfolded. Understanding the Recent BTC Recovery What’s particularly striking about this episode is the speed and strength of the subsequent BTC recovery . Almost as quickly as it dipped, Bitcoin began to claw back its losses. According to reports, Bitcoin found support and bounced back significantly, illustrating the underlying demand and bullish sentiment that persists in the market. This bounce was reportedly supported by key technical levels, such as the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). For those less familiar with technical analysis, the 50-day SMA is a widely watched indicator that smooths out price data over the past 50 days, providing a dynamic support or resistance level. When price holds above this line, it’s often seen as a sign of underlying strength. The rapid recovery suggests that the dip was primarily driven by short-term panic or leveraged positions being liquidated, rather than a fundamental shift in the market’s long-term outlook. Once the initial wave of selling subsided, buyers stepped back in, eager to acquire Bitcoin at a discount. Historical Parallels: Learning from Past Shocks This isn’t the first time geopolitical events have impacted the crypto market , nor is it the first time Bitcoin has shown resilience in the face of such shocks. The market often looks back at previous instances for clues on how assets might react. A notable parallel mentioned in market discussions is Bitcoin’s reaction to events in October 2023. Following reports of missile attacks, Bitcoin experienced a decline of around 8.8%. However, this dip proved to be a short-lived correction before the price resumed a significant upward trajectory, preceding a rally that saw substantial gains. These historical examples suggest a pattern: while initial geopolitical shocks can trigger immediate negative reactions due to uncertainty and risk aversion, they often do not derail the longer-term trend for Bitcoin, especially if the underlying bullish catalysts remain intact. Instead, these dips can sometimes be viewed by long-term investors as buying opportunities. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Bitcoin’s ability to recover quickly from a dip induced by major global events sends a positive signal to the broader crypto market . It suggests that: Underlying Demand is Strong: Despite short-term volatility triggers, there is persistent buying pressure keeping the price supported. Market Maturity: While still volatile, the market is becoming more sophisticated. Investors are quicker to differentiate between fundamental shifts and temporary external shocks. Potential for Decoupling: While correlated with traditional finance in some ways, Bitcoin’s reaction patterns can differ, sometimes recovering independently or even acting as a hedge in the long run, although this is still debated. The recovery in Bitcoin often leads to a positive sentiment ripple effect across altcoins, as Bitcoin’s performance heavily influences the overall health of the digital asset space. Bitcoin Forecast: Eyes on $150k and Beyond Despite the recent volatility, the long-term Bitcoin forecast remains overwhelmingly positive among many analysts. The dip and subsequent recovery are viewed by some as merely noise in a larger bullish trend. Several key factors underpin this optimistic outlook: The Halving: The quadrennial Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, decreases supply and has historically been a significant catalyst for price appreciation. Spot ETF Inflows: The approval and success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the door for significant institutional and retail capital to flow into Bitcoin, providing sustained buying pressure. Increasing Adoption: Growing awareness and adoption of Bitcoin and blockchain technology by individuals, corporations, and even some nation-states contribute to its value proposition. Macroeconomic Factors: Ongoing concerns about inflation and currency devaluation in various parts of the world lead some to view Bitcoin as a store of value or a hedge against traditional financial instability. Given these strong tailwinds, analysts are predicting ambitious targets for the end of 2024 and beyond. Price targets ranging from $100,000 to $150,000, and even as high as $200,000, are frequently cited. The recent recovery from the geopolitical dip is seen by proponents as further evidence that short-term shocks are unlikely to prevent Bitcoin from reaching these higher valuations in the coming months. Navigating Volatility: Challenges and Actionable Insights While the quick BTC recovery is encouraging, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile. Geopolitical risks, regulatory uncertainty, and unexpected market shifts can always lead to further price swings. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this environment: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand what you are investing in. Don’t make decisions based solely on headlines or social media hype. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps average out your purchase price and reduces the stress of volatility. Focus on the Long Term: Short-term price movements, especially those triggered by external events, can be distracting. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, focus on the bigger picture. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders or diversifying your portfolio. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news and global events, but react thoughtfully, not impulsively. The recent dip and recovery serve as a powerful reminder that volatility is part of the journey in the crypto space. However, they also highlight Bitcoin’s growing maturity and its ability to bounce back from external shocks. Compelling Summary In conclusion, the recent episode where Middle East tensions caused a temporary drop in Bitcoin price , followed by a rapid BTC recovery , underscores the complex interplay between global events and the digital asset market. While geopolitical uncertainty can trigger short-term dips, Bitcoin’s quick bounce back, supported by technical levels like the 50-day SMA, demonstrates its underlying strength and resilience. This pattern echoes past instances where dips caused by external shocks preceded significant rallies. With strong fundamental drivers like the halving and ETF inflows, the long-term Bitcoin forecast remains bullish, with many analysts predicting substantial price appreciation towards and beyond $150,000. For investors, this event is a valuable lesson in market dynamics, highlighting the importance of staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective in the volatile yet promising crypto market .

What Did SharpLink Gaming Acquire? According to a recent GlobeNewswire press release, SharpLink Gaming has purchased a staggering 176,271 ETH. This acquisition comes with a hefty price tag, valued at approximately $463 million at the time of the purchase. This isn’t just a small dip into the crypto market; this is a substantial commitment. The company revealed that this significant ETH holding now constitutes over 95% of its total treasury reserves. This strategic shift positions ETH as the primary treasury reserve asset for SharpLink Gaming. To help finance this substantial purchase, SharpLink Gaming successfully raised $79 million through a share sale. This demonstrates a clear intent to back their new treasury strategy with fresh capital specifically allocated for this purpose. Why is SharpLink Gaming’s ETH Purchase Significant? This acquisition immediately propels SharpLink Gaming into a unique position within the publicly traded company landscape. By acquiring 176,271 ETH, SharpLink Gaming becomes the largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum globally. While other companies hold Bitcoin (BTC) as a treasury asset (like MicroStrategy), SharpLink’s move is particularly notable for its focus and scale within the Ethereum ecosystem. The decision by a Public Company listed on Nasdaq to allocate such a significant portion of its treasury to a volatile asset like ETH is a powerful indicator. It suggests a growing belief among some traditional companies in the long-term value and potential of decentralized technologies and specific digital assets like Ethereum. Furthermore, the press release highlighted that over 95% of their acquired ETH is being staked or used in liquid staking protocols. This is a crucial detail. Staking ETH allows holders to earn rewards by participating in the network’s security and validation process. Liquid staking provides similar yield-earning opportunities while maintaining liquidity. This suggests SharpLink isn’t just holding the asset; they are actively utilizing it to generate yield, potentially offsetting some of the risks associated with price volatility. Implications of Adopting ETH as a Treasury Asset Adopting ETH as a primary treasury asset presents both potential benefits and challenges for SharpLink Gaming: Potential Benefits: Yield Generation: Staking provides a passive income stream on their significant holdings. Potential Appreciation: Belief in Ethereum’s future growth and adoption could lead to substantial returns. Diversification: Offers diversification away from traditional fiat and financial instruments. Alignment with Technology: As an online technology company, embracing a leading blockchain asset could align with their business focus. Potential Challenges: Price Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for significant price swings, which could impact the company’s balance sheet. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Custody and Security Risks: Safely storing and managing such a large amount of digital assets requires robust security measures. Accounting Treatment: How cryptocurrencies are treated for accounting and tax purposes can be complex. This strategic decision by SharpLink Gaming could potentially pave the way for other publicly traded companies to explore similar moves into the Ethereum ecosystem, especially given the yield opportunities offered by staking. What Does This Mean for Ethereum? For the Ethereum network, this represents a significant vote of confidence from the traditional finance world. A Nasdaq-listed company making such a large-scale acquisition and adopting ETH as a core treasury asset adds credibility and visibility to the asset. It highlights Ethereum’s growing status beyond just a platform for decentralized applications to a store of value and yield-bearing asset for institutional players. The fact that the majority is staked also contributes directly to the security and stability of the Ethereum network, further strengthening its infrastructure. Looking Ahead SharpLink Gaming’s bold move to acquire 176,271 ETH and become the largest Public Company holder of Ethereum is a landmark event. It signifies a potential shift in how traditional companies view and utilize digital assets, moving beyond just speculative interest to integrating them into core financial strategies. While the volatile nature of the crypto market means this strategy isn’t without risk, SharpLink’s commitment, backed by capital raised specifically for this purpose and their focus on staking for yield, indicates a well-considered approach to leveraging their new Treasury Asset . This development will undoubtedly be watched closely by both the crypto community and the traditional finance world, potentially influencing future institutional adoption trends for Ethereum and other digital assets.

This strategic decision by a prominent company in Brazil underscores the growing interest from traditional businesses in leveraging digital assets for balance sheet management and investment. Why Méliuz is Doubling Down on Bitcoin Investment According to reports, Méliuz successfully raised $32.5 million with the explicit intention of using these funds to acquire more Bitcoin . This isn’t their first foray into the crypto market; as of May 31st, Méliuz already held a notable 320.25 BTC. The decision to raise capital specifically for this purpose signals a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Several factors likely influence companies like Méliuz to pursue a crypto investment strategy: Inflation Hedge: With global economic uncertainty, Bitcoin is often viewed as a potential hedge against inflation due to its finite supply. Store of Value: Bitcoin’s characteristics as a decentralized, immutable digital asset appeal to companies seeking a robust store of value outside traditional financial systems. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can diversify assets away from traditional fiat currencies and securities. Alignment with Customer Base: As a fintech company, Méliuz’s customer base is likely tech-savvy and potentially interested in cryptocurrencies, making this move align with their brand and future offerings. Potential for Appreciation: Despite volatility, the long-term growth potential of Bitcoin remains a key driver for corporate adoption . What Does This $32.5M Raise Mean for Méliuz and Corporate Adoption? Raising $32.5 million solely for Bitcoin acquisition is a bold statement. It indicates that Méliuz sees Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic component of its financial future. This move could potentially: Strengthen Balance Sheet: A significant BTC holding could appreciate over time, enhancing the company’s overall financial position. Attract Investors: Companies with a clear crypto strategy can attract investors interested in the digital asset space. Set a Precedent in Brazil: As a leading fintech in Brazil , Méliuz’s decision could encourage other Brazilian companies to explore similar strategies, boosting local corporate adoption . While the exact amount of Bitcoin Méliuz will acquire with the $32.5 million depends on the market price at the time of purchase, it will significantly increase their existing 320.25 BTC holdings. This represents a substantial commitment to the digital asset class. Brazil’s Growing Interest in Crypto Investment Brazil has emerged as a key player in the Latin American cryptocurrency market. Regulatory clarity is improving, and public interest is high. Méliuz’s move is not isolated but part of a broader trend of increasing crypto investment and adoption within the country, both at the individual and corporate levels. The country has seen increasing trading volumes on exchanges and a growing number of businesses integrating crypto payments or exploring blockchain technology. Méliuz, being a fintech, is well-positioned to navigate this evolving landscape and potentially integrate crypto services further into its platform in the future. Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Holders While the potential benefits of holding Bitcoin are significant, companies undertaking such a strategy must also consider the challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, potentially impacting the reported value of corporate holdings. Accounting and Tax: Navigating the accounting and tax implications of holding volatile digital assets can be complex. Security: Securely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols. Regulatory Uncertainty: While improving, the regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings can still present challenges in various jurisdictions. Méliuz, having already held Bitcoin, likely has some experience with these aspects, but scaling up their holdings will require even more rigorous management. Looking Ahead: Méliuz and the Future of Corporate Crypto Méliuz’s strategic decision to raise funds specifically for acquiring more Bitcoin is a powerful indicator of the growing institutional confidence in digital assets. It positions them among a growing list of public and private companies globally that are incorporating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. This development is particularly noteworthy for the Brazil ian market, potentially paving the way for further corporate adoption . As the line between traditional finance and digital assets continues to blur, companies like Méliuz are at the forefront, demonstrating how businesses can actively participate in the evolving financial ecosystem through strategic crypto investment . This move by Méliuz reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class, attracting serious capital from established businesses looking for long-term value and diversification in an unpredictable global economy.

Are you constantly on the lookout for the next big thing in the crypto space? Do you find yourself scouring various platforms hoping to discover promising early-stage crypto projects before they hit the mainstream? If so, you’re likely aware that spotting these gems early can be challenging, yet potentially rewarding. That’s where platforms designed specifically for discovery come into play. And the latest news from the Binance ecosystem is certainly buzzing with potential for those interested in new crypto projects . What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter? Before diving into the specifics of the recent announcement, let’s clarify what Binance Alpha actually is. Think of Binance Alpha as a dedicated showcase within the broader Binance Wallet ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to shine a light on innovative, early-stage cryptocurrency projects that are still developing and building their communities. It’s not the main Binance exchange where you trade established assets; rather, it’s a space for discovery and early engagement. This platform is significant because it leverages the massive reach and infrastructure of Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto platforms. By featuring projects on Alpha, Binance provides these nascent ventures with exposure to a vast audience of potential users, investors, and community members who are already active within the Binance Wallet environment. It’s a curated space, meaning projects aren’t just added randomly. They undergo a selection process. Why Roam Crypto ? Exploring the Selection Criteria The specific news generating interest is the addition of Roam (ROAM) to the Binance Alpha lineup. According to an official announcement shared via Binance’s X account, Roam crypto has been added to this early-stage showcase. But what makes a project like Roam crypto stand out enough to be featured on Alpha? While the exact internal criteria are proprietary, Binance has indicated that their selection process for Binance Alpha projects focuses heavily on two key areas: Community Engagement: Projects that demonstrate strong, active, and growing communities are often favored. A vibrant community signals genuine interest, potential network effects, and a solid foundation for future growth. Market Trends: Binance Alpha also looks at emerging market trends and innovative use cases. Projects that are building solutions relevant to current or future demands in the crypto landscape are more likely to be considered. The inclusion of Roam (ROAM) suggests that it has met these criteria, showcasing promising community activity and aligning with relevant market trends that Binance Alpha aims to highlight. Navigating Early-Stage Crypto Opportunities For users exploring Binance Wallet and the Alpha section, the addition of projects like Roam crypto presents an opportunity to get involved with potentially groundbreaking ventures from the ground up. Engaging with early-stage crypto can come with significant upsides if the project succeeds, but it’s crucial to understand the inherent risks involved. Projects featured on Binance Alpha are, by definition, early stage. This means they are still developing, may have smaller market caps, and could be more volatile than established cryptocurrencies. Due diligence is paramount. Users interested in exploring new crypto projects on Alpha should: Research the project’s whitepaper and technology. Evaluate the team behind the project. Understand the project’s tokenomics and use case. Assess the level and quality of community engagement. Binance Alpha serves as a discovery tool, but it doesn’t replace the need for individual research and risk assessment. The Role of Binance Wallet in Discovering New Crypto Projects It’s important to remember that Binance Alpha is integrated within the Binance Wallet . This integration makes it convenient for Binance users to discover and potentially interact with these new crypto projects without leaving the familiar Binance ecosystem. The wallet acts as the gateway to exploring these early opportunities, providing a potentially streamlined experience for users interested in diversifying their exposure beyond the main exchange listings. What’s Next for Roam (ROAM) and Other Alpha Projects? The big question often asked when a project appears on Binance Alpha is whether it will eventually be listed on the main Binance exchange. This is a critical point that Binance explicitly addresses: inclusion on Binance Alpha does NOT guarantee a future listing on the Binance exchange. Alpha is a platform for showcasing, not a pre-listing waiting room. While some projects that gain significant traction and meet Binance’s stringent listing requirements *might* eventually be listed on the main exchange, being on Alpha is not a direct path or promise of this. The journey from early-stage crypto on Alpha to a main exchange listing is long, uncertain, and depends on many factors, including continued development, community growth, regulatory compliance, and meeting Binance’s performance standards. Therefore, while the addition of Roam (ROAM) to Binance Alpha is certainly positive visibility for the project and an exciting discovery for users, it should not be interpreted as a signal of an imminent main exchange listing. It’s an opportunity to observe, engage, and learn about a promising new crypto project in its early phase. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Crypto The inclusion of Roam (ROAM) on Binance Alpha highlights Binance’s continued effort to support the broader crypto ecosystem by providing a platform for innovative, early-stage crypto projects to gain visibility. For users of Binance Wallet , Alpha serves as a curated window into the world of new crypto projects , selected based on factors like community engagement and market relevance. While this offers exciting potential for discovery, remember that being featured on Binance Alpha is distinct from a main exchange listing. It’s an invitation to explore the potential of Roam crypto and similar ventures at an early stage, requiring careful consideration and research before any engagement.

Donald Trump recently made a striking statement regarding the possibility of military action against Iran, suggesting it could actually benefit markets. This perspective, shared with the Wall Street Journal and reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, immediately sparked debate and analysis among investors and political observers alike. The core of his argument hinges on the idea that preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon would remove a significant long-term risk, thus creating a more stable environment for economic activity and investment. What Did Trump Say About Trump Iran Relations and Market Benefits? The specific comment from Donald Trump highlighted the controversial notion that military intervention against Iran, aimed at halting its nuclear ambitions, would be viewed positively by financial markets. According to reports, his reasoning was that the potential for a nuclear-armed Iran poses a greater, more destabilizing threat in the long run. By neutralizing this threat through military means, the argument goes, a major cloud of uncertainty would be lifted, allowing markets to react favorably. This viewpoint is significant because it directly links geopolitical strategy with economic outcomes in a way that is not always universally accepted. While preventing nuclear proliferation is a widely supported goal, the idea that military conflict—with all its inherent risks and humanitarian costs—could be a net positive for markets is highly contentious. It suggests a transactional view of international relations where security objectives are weighed against potential market reactions. Understanding the Potential Market Impact Iran Scenario Presents Analyzing the potential market impact Iran tensions and possible military action could have is complex. Financial markets inherently dislike uncertainty, and geopolitical risk is a major source of it. Historically, significant international conflicts or major escalations have often led to immediate market volatility, but the longer-term effects can vary widely depending on the nature, scale, and duration of the event, as well as the broader economic context. Here’s a breakdown of potential market reactions: Oil Prices: The Middle East is a critical region for global oil supply. Any conflict involving Iran, a major oil producer and situated near key shipping lanes like the Strait of Hormuz, would almost certainly lead to a sharp spike in oil prices due to supply disruption fears. This is typically negative for the global economy and stock markets, as higher energy costs impact businesses and consumers. Stock Markets: Initial reactions to military action are often negative, driven by fear and uncertainty. Defense stocks might see gains, but broader indices tend to fall as investors move to safer assets. The duration of any downturn would depend on the perceived scope and outcome of the conflict. Safe Havens: Assets traditionally seen as safe havens, such as gold, the U.S. dollar, and potentially certain government bonds, often see increased demand during periods of geopolitical stress. Cryptocurrencies: The reaction of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in such a scenario is less predictable. Some argue they could act as a digital safe haven outside traditional financial systems, while others believe they would fall along with other risk assets during a general market panic. Past events have shown mixed reactions. Trump’s argument implies that the negative reaction to the conflict itself would be outweighed by the positive reaction to the removal of the nuclear threat. This is a crucial point of contention. How Does Geopolitical Risk Influence Investment Decisions? Geopolitical risk is a constant factor that investors must consider. It refers to the risks associated with political events and decisions that could affect the stability of a country or region, potentially impacting economic and financial conditions globally. Events like wars, political instability, terrorism, and international disputes all fall under this umbrella. Investment managers and analysts constantly monitor geopolitical developments to assess their potential impact on portfolios. High geopolitical risk typically leads to: Increased market volatility. A flight to safety (moving investments into lower-risk assets). Reduced foreign direct investment in affected regions. Disruption of supply chains and trade routes. Changes in government spending priorities (e.g., increased defense spending). The potential for Iran Military Action is a prime example of a significant geopolitical risk event. Markets would attempt to price in the likelihood of such an event, its potential severity, and its possible outcomes. Trump’s statement can be seen as an attempt to frame one potential outcome (the removal of the nuclear threat) as the dominant factor for market reaction, downplaying the immediate disruptive impact of conflict. Exploring the Potential Economic Consequences Beyond Immediate Markets The economic consequences of military action extend far beyond the immediate fluctuations of stock and commodity markets. A conflict involving Iran could have wide-ranging effects on the global economy: Energy Costs: As mentioned, oil price spikes would increase costs for transportation, manufacturing, and consumers worldwide, potentially slowing economic growth and fueling inflation. Trade Disruption: Major shipping lanes could be affected, disrupting global supply chains and increasing shipping costs. Regional Instability: Conflict could spill over into neighboring countries, creating refugee crises, disrupting regional trade, and requiring international aid, all of which have economic costs. Government Budgets: Military action is expensive, potentially leading to increased government debt or cuts in other spending areas. Investor Confidence: Prolonged instability can erode investor confidence, leading to reduced investment and slower economic expansion. While preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons could arguably reduce a long-term existential risk, the short-to-medium term Economic Consequences of military intervention are almost universally viewed by economists as negative and disruptive. The destruction of infrastructure, loss of life, and regional instability associated with conflict have profound and lasting economic impacts that are difficult to quantify but undeniably significant. Historical Context: How Have Markets Reacted to Past Geopolitical Shocks? Looking at history provides some perspective, though every situation is unique. Markets have reacted differently to various geopolitical events: Event Date Initial Market Reaction (S&P 500) Medium-Term Reaction Key Economic Impact Invasion of Kuwait (Gulf War) Aug 1990 Significant decline Recovery once conflict outcome became clearer Oil price spike, brief recession in some areas 9/11 Terrorist Attacks Sep 2001 Markets closed for days, sharp decline upon reopening Recovery within weeks Increased security spending, disruption to travel/tourism Invasion of Iraq Mar 2003 Market rally (war had been anticipated) Continued rally Prolonged instability, impact on oil prices over time Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine Feb 2022 Initial decline, high volatility Markets fluctuated based on war developments, sanctions Major energy and commodity price shocks, supply chain issues, inflation surge As the table shows, there’s no single template. The invasion of Iraq in 2003, for instance, saw a market rally because the conflict’s commencement removed the uncertainty of *if* it would happen. However, the broader Economic Consequences and regional instability were significant and long-lasting. The key takeaway is that while markets might eventually recover or even rally after the initial shock or once an outcome is priced in, the underlying economic disruption caused by conflict is real and detrimental. Actionable Insights for Investors Amidst Geopolitical Uncertainty Given the ever-present potential for Geopolitical Risk and the specific concerns around Trump Iran dynamics and potential Iran Military Action, what should investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of geopolitical developments, but be wary of sensationalism. Understand the potential catalysts and consequences. Assess Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical events can cause significant volatility. Ensure your investment portfolio aligns with your comfort level for risk and your long-term financial goals. Diversification is Key: A well-diversified portfolio across different asset classes, geographies, and sectors can help mitigate the impact of localized or regional shocks. Consider Safe Havens (Cautiously): While gold or certain currencies can offer protection, their performance isn’t guaranteed, and timing entries/exits is difficult. Focus on the Long Term: Short-term geopolitical noise can be distracting. For long-term investors, staying focused on fundamental investment principles and goals is often the best strategy. Understand Specific Sector Impacts: Be aware that some sectors (like energy, defense, aerospace) are more directly affected by geopolitical events than others. Trump’s statement about the Market Impact Iran conflict could have is a reminder that political figures often frame complex situations in ways that support their objectives. Investors must look beyond simple pronouncements and conduct their own analysis of the multifaceted risks and potential outcomes. Conclusion: Navigating the Complex Interplay of Politics, Conflict, and Markets Donald Trump’s assertion that military action against Iran could be a market positive is a provocative statement that simplifies a highly complex reality. While preventing nuclear proliferation is a global priority that could, in theory, reduce a long-term risk, the immediate and medium-term Market Impact Iran conflict would create involves significant negative factors, including energy price shocks, trade disruption, and regional instability. The Economic Consequences of war are typically severe and widespread, impacting livelihoods and growth far beyond the trading floors. History shows varied market reactions to geopolitical events, demonstrating that context, anticipation, and the specific nature of the conflict matter. However, the human and economic cost of military action is undeniable. Navigating periods of heightened Geopolitical Risk requires investors to remain informed, diversified, and focused on their long-term strategy, rather than relying on simplistic predictions about market reactions to conflict.

But while Ethereum may be staging a strong comeback, a growing number of analysts are shifting their focus to what could be the best crypto to buy in 2025, a tiny, under-the-radar altcoin called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 11,900 investors. More than $10.45 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 100% profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. This DeFi token has been called the top crypto of the summer, with bullish predictions suggesting a staggering 8,000% return as early as Q3. For retail investors wondering what to buy before June ends, this could be the kind of once-in-a-cycle play that mirrors early successful rallies. Ethereum Holds Tight Near $2,680 as Summer Rally Builds Ethereum (ETH) is trading at approximately $2,676 after posting a modest intraday high of $2,720 and a low near $2,489. Over the past week, ETH has consolidated within a range of $2,400–$2,700, reflecting strengthened support zones and a narrowing volatility band that analysts view as a bullish signal. Recent inflows into spot ETH ETFs—surpassing $295 million in a single week highlight renewed institutional interest. These fundamentals place Ethereum firmly on traders’ radar, while fresh altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) begin to stir market excitement at much smaller price points. Mutuum Finance Presale Skyrockets: $10.45M Raised and 11,900 Investors Can’t Be Wrong Mutuum Finance is rapidly carving its place in the DeFi lending space, having already attracted over $10.45 million and built a thriving community of 11,900+ holders. Right now MUTM tokens are available at just $0.03 but in the next presale round prices will jump to $0.035 meaning anyone who buys now locks in an instant 16.67% profit. When Mutuum officially launches at $0.06 early investors could see a massive 100% gain. This is the kind of growth that DeFi investors dream about. The Power of Dual Lending: Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Models Changing the Game Mutuum Finance’s secret weapon is its hybrid lending system that blends: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Lock your USDT into smart-contract-driven liquidity pools and earn passive income, no hassle, all automated. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Cut out the middleman and lend or borrow directly, with full control and privacy over loan terms. This combination gives users unmatched flexibility, privacy, and competitive yields, putting Mutuum ahead of the pack. Built on Trust: Certik-Audited & Backed by a Stable USD-Pegged Coin Security is vital in crypto and Mutuum Finance delivers. Its open-source smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by Certik, one of the blockchain industry’s top security firms. On top of that, Mutuum is creating a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on Ethereum, designed to maintain long-term price stability and avoid the collapse risks that have tanked algorithmic stablecoins. Huge Rewards for Early Backers To reward its earliest supporters, the platform is hosting a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will each win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This is your chance to join a thriving community earn amazing rewards and ride the wave of what could be the next big DeFi success story. Ethereum may be eyeing a new ATH, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aiming for something far more explosive, analysts are forecasting up to 8,000% gains, and momentum is building fast. With over $10.45 million raised and 11,900+ early adopters, this under-$1 DeFi rocket is already rewriting the 2025 playbook. The next price jump is looming. The window to buy early is closing.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) shows signs of another rally, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is grappling with a price drop, making traders rethink their next move. But here’s where things get interesting: all eyes are now on Unstaked, a project that’s flipping the script. Unstaked is using AI to create real, on-chain utility that goes beyond hype. Imagine owning AI agents you can customize, run, and profit from. The potential? Huge. With over $9.7 million raised and more than a billion tokens sold, $UNSD is still in presale at just $0.011397. As the platform gears up to launch real tools and a deflationary token model, experts are eyeing a $5 target for $UNSD. That could mean a 3000x return, turning $100 into $300,000. Is this a hidden gem? You might be catching it at the perfect moment. How Unstaked’s AI is Changing the Game for Crypto Unstaked isn’t just launching another token; it’s crafting a game-changing product that’s built to last. At its core are AI agents that run autonomously on platforms like Telegram and X, handling everything from marketing to community growth around the clock and without human intervention. But these aren’t your typical bots. They’re powered by blockchain, customizable, and ready to use from day one. And here’s the kicker: they generate on-chain proof of work that drives token rewards. This isn’t just a presale token; it’s a new kind of utility in the crypto space. Every action, upgrade, and customization runs on $UNSD, ensuring the token remains in constant demand as the user base expands. With over $9.7 million raised and more than 1 billion tokens sold, the momentum is building fast. And with Stage 20 priced at just $0.011397, there’s massive room for growth. Forget the hype, this is utility-driven crypto at its best. Analysts are eyeing the potential: what happens when a functional AI product hits the market with a token still under two cents? With projections pushing $5 per token, a $100 investment today could explode into $300,000. For those seeking something more than the latest meme coin, Unstaked stands out as a real opportunity, backed by cutting-edge tech and an undeniable utility. If you’re looking for the next big thing in crypto, Unstaked could be it. Is Dogecoin on the Verge of a Major Rally? Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing strong bullish signals, with the price comfortably holding above the $0.17 breakout level. Analysts are now eyeing a double inverse head and shoulders pattern, which could signal a move toward $0.34, a 100% jump from here. The key test is the retest of $0.17. If DOGE bounces back cleanly, it could spark a rally, especially if meme coin interest picks up again. But that’s not all. Chart watchers are also spotting an ascending broadening wedge, which could send DOGE as high as $3.80 in the long run. With positive funding rates and long holders showing strong confidence, the bullish case for Dogecoin is becoming harder to ignore. The recent support zone is holding firm, adding to the momentum. For traders looking for a meme coin with solid structure and potential, DOGE is staying firmly on the radar. Whale Activity Sparks Hope for SHIB’s Reversal Shiba Inu (SHIB) has taken a hit, dropping over 7.5% in the last 24 hours, and now it’s testing key support at $0.00001240. If that level doesn’t hold, SHIB could slide another 18%, which has sent retail traders scrambling. Short positions are stacking up, with nearly $942K in short liquidations sitting near $0.00001306, adding to the downside pressure. However, while smaller investors are heading for the exits, whales are making their move. On-chain data reveals a big surge in SHIB transactions, with large transactions in the $100K–$1M range up by 175.86%. This suggests the bigger players are seeing this dip as a buying opportunity. Retail may be panicking, but the whales are positioning for a potential reversal. If SHIB can hold that $0.00001240 support, the rebound could be just as strong as the drop. The Bottom Line Dogecoin (DOGE) has been holding strong after breaking past $0.17, with charts suggesting a move towards $0.34. Shiba Inu (SHIB), on the other hand, has faced a price dip that’s rattled retail traders, though whale buying signals suggest a potential rebound if support holds. While both coins are catching attention, it’s Unstaked that’s creating a real buzz. With over $9.7 million raised and 1 billion tokens sold, $UNSD is picking up speed. Priced at just $0.011397 in Stage 20, it’s a steal with massive upside potential. The real draw? AI agents that users can own, deploy, and profit from, all supported by on-chain proof. If Unstaked delivers on its promise, it could be more than just another presale; it might be the best crypto to invest in right now. If $UNSD hits its projected $5, that $100 buy-in could grow into $300,000.

This marks a 1.8% dip over the past day and places the asset approximately 6% below its all-time high of over $111,000 reached last month. While the correction is not severe compared to historical volatility, it highlights ongoing uncertainty in the market as BTC consolidates near record highs without sustained upward momentum. One metric drawing attention amid this price movement is the Puell Multiple, a tool used to evaluate whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued relative to miner income. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Most Reliable Signal Just Flashed—Next Stop: $170,000 Bitcoin Puell Multiple Suggests Miner Revenues Have Yet to Catch Up CryptoQuant analyst Gaah highlighted that while prices recently surged above $108,000, the Puell Multiple remains below 1.40, a level typically associated with discounted or non-euphoric market phases. This decoupling between BTC price and miner revenue offers insight into how recent gains may be more demand-driven than organically supported by on-chain mining fundamentals. The Puell Multiple measures the daily issuance of BTC in USD terms relative to its 365-day moving average. Historically, readings below 1.0 are seen during market bottoms or accumulation phases, indicating undervaluation. Gaah points out that current readings hovering around 1.40 suggest miner profitability is still lagging, even as the asset trades near historic highs. This pattern contrasts with previous bull cycles where high prices were often accompanied by elevated miner earnings, driven by both network activity and block rewards. This disparity may be due in part to the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. While halving events typically drive price appreciation through reduced supply, they simultaneously put downward pressure on miner revenue. In this case, despite a climb in market price, the halving’s impact continues to suppress income for miners, implying that the price increase has not yet been accompanied by the kind of broader economic expansion that would traditionally drive a full-fledged bull market. Potential for Continued Growth as Institutional Forces Drive Demand Gaah also points to the possibility that external factors may be playing a more dominant role in driving recent price action. These include increasing institutional inflows through spot Bitcoin ETFs, as well as a tighter circulating supply as long-term holders reduce active selling. These forces could be supporting price without necessarily boosting miner profitability in the short term, especially if the uptick is concentrated in secondary market demand rather than new BTC issuance. The current environment may signal a unique window for participants analyzing Bitcoin’s valuation. A high market price combined with conservative fundamentals suggests the market is not yet in a speculative excess phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? If miner revenues eventually rise in line with growing demand, driven by either increased transaction fees or broader network usage, it could support further upside. As such, both technical and fundamental indicators may continue to evolve in the coming months, offering a clearer view of whether the current cycle has more room to run.

Visibility alone is no longer enough. Today’s top picks must deliver real-world value, clear roadmaps, and sustainable models to earn trust and attention. While new tokens continue to launch, only a few stand out as truly promising. These are the names gaining traction not through hype, but through measurable growth and active user engagement. The four projects highlighted here represent the most popular altcoins of 2025. Each offers a unique edge, but BlockDAG (BDAG) currently leads with its structured model and massive presale success. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Step-by-Step Growth with Presale Precision BlockDAG is emerging as one of the most popular altcoins of 2025, thanks to its unique approach to pricing and project development. Instead of following hype-driven patterns, BlockDAG has built a structured presale system that increases coin value across 45 predefined batches. This step-by-step method allows users to track progress while rewarding early participation with better entry prices. Currently in Batch 29, BDAG is priced at $0.0276, with more than 22.4 billion coins sold and nearly $300 million raised. These figures reflect not just strong demand but also the success of a system built around transparency and controlled growth. Each new batch signals fresh milestones, making the entire process more predictable and grounded in real traction. This batch-based model also reduces post-launch price instability by aligning token distribution with measurable market activity. BlockDAG’s focus on sustainable growth and user clarity is making it a standout option among altcoins, with strong appeal for those seeking long-term structure and value. 2. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise Powerhouse with Real-World Impact Hedera continues to rise in relevance as one of the most popular altcoins, driven by its hashgraph consensus model that supports fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. This unique structure sets it apart from traditional blockchain platforms and appeals to businesses looking for scalable and efficient systems. Its speed and energy efficiency give it an edge in enterprise use cases. HBAR powers applications in decentralized identity, payments, and supply chain solutions, creating tangible value for global users. Hedera’s governance model includes blue-chip corporations such as Google and IBM, ensuring stability and long-term strategy. With institutional support and enterprise-grade features, HBAR is gaining steady momentum across both retail and corporate markets. 3. VeChain (VET): Supply Chain Efficiency Meets Blockchain Utility VeChain has carved a strong niche for itself among the most popular altcoins by focusing on real-world supply chain management. Its blockchain enables businesses to verify and trace products at every stage, ensuring transparency and accountability in industries like food safety, healthcare, and luxury goods. VET plays a crucial role in running this ecosystem, while VTHO handles transaction fees. This dual-token structure keeps costs low and performance high. Enterprises can also build custom applications using VeChain’s tools, expanding its utility beyond logistics. With consistent updates and real-world partnerships, VeChain continues to prove that business-focused blockchain solutions can thrive. 4. Stellar (XLM): Bridging Currencies and Expanding Inclusion Stellar remains a strong contender among the most popular altcoins thanks to its mission of financial access and cross-border transaction efficiency. Its protocol enables fast and low-cost exchanges between fiat currencies, making it ideal for remittance services and global payment networks. XLM acts as the connecting layer between currencies, streamlining transfers across borders without reliance on expensive intermediaries. Stellar’s technology supports smart contracts and custom tokens, adding versatility to its core offerings. With ongoing partnerships involving banks, fintech firms, and even government initiatives, Stellar continues to build a reputation for practical utility and global reach. Key Insights As the crypto market matures, becoming one of the most popular altcoins now depends on more than hype. Projects must deliver real value, strong infrastructure, and user-focused design. BlockDAG meets this demand with its clear pricing strategy and record-setting presale, offering a rare mix of structure and momentum. Alongside it, HBAR, VET, and XLM continue to prove their relevance through practical use cases that solve real-world problems. From fast financial networks to supply chain transparency and global payments, these projects highlight the evolving criteria for success. In 2025, popularity comes from performance, and these altcoins are delivering.

Investment management giants Invesco and Galaxy Digital have taken a significant step towards potentially bringing a Solana ETF to the market. According to a recent report shared by @solidintel_x on X, these firms have officially registered a specific entity for a Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund within the state of Delaware. This development, while an early procedural step, is generating considerable buzz and speculation about the future of SOL ETF products in the United States. What Does This Invesco Galaxy Delaware Registration Signify? The registration of an entity in Delaware by Invesco Galaxy specifically for a Solana ETF is a standard, yet crucial, part of the process for launching investment products in the U.S. Delaware is a popular state for corporate registration due to its well-established corporate law and court system. This move doesn’t mean the ETF is approved or even formally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yet, but it indicates that Invesco and Galaxy are actively exploring and preparing for the possibility of launching a Solana-focused investment vehicle. Think of it like setting up the legal foundation before building the actual structure. Registering the entity provides the necessary legal framework under which a future ETF could operate. It signals serious intent from major players in both traditional finance (Invesco) and the crypto asset management space (Galaxy Digital). Why is a Solana ETF Important for SOL? The potential introduction of a Solana ETF is highly anticipated by the crypto community for several reasons. An ETF provides investors with exposure to the price movements of an underlying asset without requiring them to directly buy, store, or manage the asset itself. For Solana (SOL), an ETF could: Increase Accessibility: Make investing in SOL easier for traditional investors, financial advisors, and institutions who may be hesitant to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges or self-custody. Boost Liquidity: Potentially bring significant capital into the Solana ecosystem, increasing trading volume and market depth. Enhance Legitimacy: An SEC-approved ETF would lend further credibility to Solana as an asset class in the eyes of mainstream finance. Drive Demand: As seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the launch of such a product can lead to increased demand from a broader investor base. This Delaware registration by Invesco Galaxy is a tangible sign that major financial firms see potential in bringing such a product to market, reflecting growing institutional interest in assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Comparing the Solana ETF Path to Bitcoin and Ethereum The journey towards a Solana ETF is likely to follow a similar, albeit potentially faster, path to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Bitcoin spot ETFs were approved in the U.S. in January 2024 after years of applications and rejections. Ethereum spot ETFs received crucial initial approval in May 2024, with trading expected to begin later. These approvals have set precedents and potentially cleared some regulatory hurdles for subsequent Crypto ETF applications for other digital assets like Solana. However, regulators will still scrutinize any Solana application based on factors like market size, liquidity, potential for manipulation, and the underlying technology. While the path might be clearer, approval is far from guaranteed. What Are the Potential Hurdles and What Comes Next? While the Invesco Galaxy Delaware registration is positive news, several significant steps remain before a Solana ETF could potentially trade on a U.S. exchange: Formal SEC Filing: Invesco and Galaxy would need to file official applications (like a 19b-4 rule change proposal and an S-1 registration statement) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulatory Review and Approval: The SEC would then undergo a review process, which can take several months and involve public comment periods. Approval is not guaranteed and depends on the SEC’s assessment of market readiness and regulatory compliance. Market Conditions: Favorable market conditions and continued regulatory clarity would be beneficial for the approval process. Investors interested in a potential SOL ETF should closely monitor official filings with the SEC and regulatory announcements rather than solely relying on early-stage registrations like the one in Delaware. Actionable Insight: Staying Informed on the Potential SOL ETF For those tracking the development of a potential Solana ETF , the key action is to stay informed through official channels. Follow news regarding Invesco and Galaxy’s formal filings with the SEC. Understand that the Delaware registration is a preliminary step. While it signals intent, it doesn’t guarantee a product launch or regulatory approval. Diversifying information sources and understanding the regulatory process is crucial when evaluating the potential impact of such developments on the Solana market. Summary: A Promising Step for Solana’s Institutional Future The Delaware registration of a Solana ETF entity by Invesco Galaxy is undoubtedly a promising development for the Solana ecosystem. It underscores growing institutional confidence in SOL as an asset class and represents an initial, foundational step towards potentially offering a regulated investment product to a broader market. While significant regulatory hurdles remain, this move signals serious intent from major financial players and adds to the narrative of Solana’s increasing integration into traditional finance. The journey towards a U.S. SOL ETF is still ongoing, but this registration marks a notable milestone on that path, igniting hope for increased accessibility and adoption.

Dogecoin (DOGE) has shown strong technical signs, and ONDO’s rebound highlights growing demand for real-world asset-backed crypto. Yet, while both offer promising price action, Web3 ai is making progress on a different front. The project is drawing eyes thanks to its $0.000422 price, strong utility, and transparent AI-driven platform that has already crossed $7.8 million in raised funds. Web3 ai, now in Stage 08 of its presale, is proving it’s not just another trending coin. Its main feature is the ICO & Token Sale Advisor, a tool created to help users review early-stage crypto opportunities. While coins like DOGE and ONDO benefit from market speculation, Web3 ai offers a structured approach to evaluating new crypto launches. Dogecoin: Technical Chart Suggests Further Breakout Dogecoin (DOGE) has spiked by 25%, and analysts are tracking an uncommon triple bottom setup combined with bullish RSI divergence. CoinCentral noted that if DOGE breaks through current resistance, it could reach $0.25 soon and possibly $0.40 later on. These levels line up with predictions from earlier meme coin trends. This current Dogecoin chart pattern isn’t just a random setup. Similar formations in past cycles led to massive price runs. Traders are seeing renewed energy around DOGE, helped by stronger community backing and social media activity. However, the coin’s price remains reactive to outside forces like public figures or sudden market shifts. Still, from a technical angle, the breakout is valid. With MACD turning bullish and rising volume, DOGE could see more upside ahead. It’s shaping up to be a solid short-term contender among bullish crypto plays. ONDO: Strong Recovery Aims for $3 Mark ONDO has bounced back 55% from recent lows, showing strength in the tokenized asset space. TronWeekly reports that ONDO broke through its consolidation phase as buying pressure increased, pushing it into a breakout. This rally is being fueled by higher demand for digital treasury products. ONDO has now flipped the $0.90 resistance into support, clearing the way for possible targets of $1.80 and $3 if momentum holds. Analysts are also watching institutional interest rise, which could lead to long-term support. However, rapid price increases can invite corrections. And because ONDO works in the real-world asset sector, there’s always a risk from future regulatory changes. Still, in the current rotation, ONDO stands out as one of the most solid mid-cap DeFi options with bullish potential. Web3 ai: $7.8M Raised and 21B Coins Sold in Stage 8 Unlike the flashy gains seen with DOGE and ONDO, Web3 ai offers consistent progress through real-world features. The project has raised more than $7.8 million so far and sold over 21 billion coins in its presale. Now priced at $0.000422 in Stage 08, Web3 ai brings substance to the AI crypto space. At the heart of the platform is the ICO & Token Sale Advisor. This AI-backed engine reviews and ranks early crypto launches. Instead of listing ICOs by date, it assesses vesting terms, token supply, and other critical factors to highlight trustworthy projects. It spots red flags like unfair token allocations and risky unlock periods. The tool also checks GitHub codebases and team backgrounds. It monitors project milestones and checks user discussions across Telegram, X, Reddit, and other social platforms. Users can compare ICOs by development activity, sector, and security level through customizable filters. This AI tool gives users a better way to spot serious crypto projects, avoiding low-effort launches. Since access to this platform is tied to the $WAI coin, its value is directly connected to ongoing usage. With its $0.000422 price and AI tools already live, Web3 ai looks like a smart early entry for those focused on real crypto solutions. Which Crypto Path Makes the Most Sense? Dogecoin has made a 25% jump on a rare chart setup. ONDO has climbed 55%, fueled by strong interest in tokenized assets. Both show short-term strength. But for a deeper, more practical offering, Web3 ai leads the way with tools designed to reshape how people explore crypto projects. With over $7.8 million raised, 21 billion coins sold, and a price of $0.000422, Web3 ai is building more than hype. Its platform offers a structured way to assess crypto launches, which sets it apart as a long-term play worth noting.

If so, you’ve likely heard the buzz surrounding the potential for a significant shift in how investors access digital assets. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have grabbed headlines, the real excitement brewing right now is centered around the possibility of a broader wave of Altcoin ETF approvals. Altcoin ETF Filings See an Unprecedented Surge in 2025 Imagine this: a flood of new investment products hitting the market, making it easier than ever for mainstream investors to gain exposure to a diverse range of digital currencies beyond the top two. That’s precisely the scenario unfolding as we head further into 2025. According to recent data from Cointelegraph Research, there has been an impressive surge in applications submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Specifically, reports indicate that at least 31 separate applications for various Altcoin ETF products have been filed so far this year. This number is substantial and signals a clear intent from financial firms to bring these investment vehicles to market. This isn’t just a trickle; it’s a significant flow of formal proposals landing on the SEC’s desk. What’s Driving This Wave of SEC Filings? So, why the sudden rush now? The primary catalyst appears to be a renewed sense of optimism regarding the regulatory landscape in the United States. The sentiment around cryptocurrency regulation, particularly concerning investment products, seems to be shifting. A key factor cited is the environment under current U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins. There’s a growing perception that the regulatory body might be adopting a more pragmatic or at least clearer approach to digital assets compared to previous periods. This perceived shift is empowering financial institutions to confidently pursue these new product offerings. Filing an ETF application is a costly and time-consuming process, so firms wouldn’t undertake this unless they saw a realistic path towards approval. The volume of these SEC Filings suggests that confidence is indeed high. Major Players Entering the Crypto ETF Space It’s not just the quantity of filings that’s noteworthy; it’s also the quality and reputation of the firms involved. Established financial giants are stepping into the ring, targeting specific altcoins. Companies like VanEck and Franklin Templeton, names familiar to traditional investors, are among those who have reportedly filed applications. These firms aren’t just filing generic applications; they are targeting specific, prominent altcoins. Assets mentioned in these filings reportedly include major players like BNB, XRP, and Solana. The fact that large, reputable asset managers are seeking to create dedicated Crypto ETF products for these specific assets highlights their growing legitimacy and perceived investment potential within the broader financial world. This move could significantly broaden the investor base for these particular cryptocurrencies. Could This Spark an ‘Altcoin Summer’? The big question on everyone’s mind in the crypto community is: What does this mean for market prices? The surge in filings, combined with the optimistic regulatory outlook, is fueling significant hope for what many are calling an ‘ Altcoin Summer ‘. Historically, an ‘Altcoin Summer’ refers to a period where altcoins, in general, experience significant price rallies, often outperforming Bitcoin. This can be driven by various factors, including market sentiment, technological developments, or increased liquidity and adoption. Analysts are bullish on the potential for approvals. Estimates suggest that out of the numerous filings, over 10 approvals are considered likely in the near future. If even a handful of these dedicated altcoin ETFs get the green light, it could unlock significant capital from traditional investment channels, pushing demand and potentially prices higher across a wide range of altcoins. The anticipation alone is contributing to positive sentiment in the market, laying the groundwork for that potential ‘ Altcoin Summer ‘ rally. Understanding the Implications for Cryptocurrency Investment For both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers, the prospect of Altcoin ETFs has several key implications for their Cryptocurrency Investment strategies. Here’s a quick look at some potential benefits and challenges: Potential Benefits: Increased Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making it much easier for retail and institutional investors to gain exposure without dealing directly with crypto exchanges, wallets, or private keys. Greater Legitimacy: ETF approvals from a major regulator like the SEC lend significant credibility to the underlying assets and the crypto market as a whole, potentially attracting more conservative investors. Enhanced Liquidity: Increased institutional participation via ETFs could bring substantial liquidity into the altcoin market. Diversification Options: Depending on the ETF structure (single-asset, basket), investors could easily diversify their exposure across different altcoins. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: While optimism is high, regulatory hurdles could still cause delays or rejections for some applications. Market Volatility: ETFs provide exposure but do not eliminate the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies. Tracking Error: ETFs aim to track the price of the underlying asset, but fees and operational factors can lead to slight differences (tracking error). Concentration Risk: Single-asset ETFs mean your investment is tied solely to the performance of that one altcoin. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on SEC announcements regarding these filings. Research Specific Assets: If you’re interested in exposure via potential ETFs, research the specific altcoins being targeted (BNB, XRP, Solana, etc.) and understand their fundamentals and risks. Evaluate ETF Structures: Once approved, understand how each specific ETF is structured (e.g., spot price tracking vs. futures, single asset vs. basket). Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Even through an ETF wrapper, altcoins are high-risk investments. Looking Ahead: The Road to an Altcoin Summer The sheer volume of Altcoin ETF filings in 2025 is a clear indicator of where the financial industry sees future growth in the digital asset space. Driven by a more favorable regulatory climate and increasing institutional confidence, the path is being paved for potentially groundbreaking new investment products. While approvals are not guaranteed, the high number of applications and analyst predictions paint a promising picture for the accessibility and potential performance of altcoins. Whether it fully blossoms into a widespread ‘ Altcoin Summer ‘ remains to be seen, but the foundational steps are certainly being taken, making this a fascinating time for anyone involved in Cryptocurrency Investment .

This case highlights ongoing efforts to police market manipulation within the cryptocurrency sector and underscores the growing reach of crypto regulation . What Exactly is Crypto Wash Trading? Before diving into the specifics of the Gotbit case, it’s crucial to understand what crypto wash trading entails. At its core, wash trading is a form of market manipulation where an investor simultaneously buys and sells the same asset to create a misleading impression of market activity. It’s like a person selling an item to themselves repeatedly to make it look popular. How it Works: A trader places both a buy and a sell order for the same asset at roughly the same price. These orders execute against each other. The Goal: The primary objective is not to profit from price movements, but to inflate trading volume artificially. Why Do It? Inflated volume can make an asset appear more liquid and popular than it is, potentially attracting legitimate traders or meeting exchange listing requirements. Legality: Wash trading is illegal in traditional financial markets and is increasingly being targeted by authorities in the crypto space as a form of market manipulation that undermines fair markets. What Happened to the Gotbit Founder and the Firm? The focus of this recent enforcement action is Aleksei Andriunin, the Gotbit founder . According to reports from The Block, Andriunin received an eight-month prison sentence. This sentence stems from his involvement in conducting multi-million-dollar crypto wash trades . The market-making firm itself, Gotbit, also faced severe consequences. The company was reportedly given five years of probation. More significantly, as part of the judgment, Gotbit is required to cease its operations. This effectively shuts down the firm’s activities in the market. Market makers like Gotbit typically play a vital role in providing liquidity to trading pairs. However, when these services are used for illicit activities like inflating trading volumes through wash trading, it distorts market signals and harms genuine participants. How Does Market Manipulation Harm the Crypto Ecosystem? Cases involving practices like crypto wash trading are detrimental to the overall health and reputation of the digital asset space. Market manipulation creates an unfair trading environment. Here’s how: Distorted Prices: Artificial volume can give a false sense of demand, potentially leading to unstable or manipulated prices. Misleading Investors: Traders relying on volume indicators might be tricked into thinking an asset is more actively traded or desirable than it truly is. Reduced Trust: Incidents of manipulation erode confidence among both retail and institutional investors, making them hesitant to participate in the market. Unfair Advantage: Those engaging in wash trading gain an unfair advantage over legitimate traders who are playing by the rules. Ensuring crypto market integrity is paramount for the long-term growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Enforcement actions like the one against the Gotbit founder send a clear message that such behavior will not be tolerated. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Integrity? The sentencing of the Gotbit founder and the shutdown of the firm are strong indicators of a push towards greater accountability and transparency in the digital asset markets. Protecting crypto market integrity is a stated goal of regulators worldwide. This case serves as a practical example of authorities taking action against firms and individuals who engage in deceptive practices. For the market to mature and attract broader participation, participants need confidence that they are trading on a level playing field, free from artificial manipulation. Steps taken to curb crypto wash trading and other forms of deceit are crucial for building this trust. Is Increased Crypto Regulation Inevitable? This case fits into a broader global trend of increasing scrutiny and the development of formal crypto regulation frameworks. As the digital asset market grows, regulators are becoming more active in applying existing laws or creating new ones to address unique aspects of crypto. Enforcement actions often precede or coincide with new regulatory guidance. The focus areas typically include investor protection, market stability, and preventing illicit finance activities, including various forms of market manipulation . While the pace and nature of crypto regulation vary by jurisdiction, the direction appears clear: a move towards more oversight and established rules for market participants, including exchanges, platforms, and market makers. Lessons Learned and Actionable Insights The Gotbit case offers important lessons for everyone involved in the crypto space: Due Diligence: Investors should look beyond just reported volume when evaluating assets. Consider the reputation of the exchange and the market makers involved. Regulatory Risk: Firms operating in the crypto space must understand and comply with evolving crypto regulation to avoid legal repercussions. Market Integrity Matters: Supporting platforms and practices that promote genuine trading activity is vital for the ecosystem’s health. This incident serves as a reminder that while the crypto market is innovative, it is not immune to old forms of financial crime like market manipulation , and regulators are watching. Conclusion The sentencing of the Gotbit founder for multi-million-dollar crypto wash trading and the subsequent forced cessation of Gotbit’s operations mark a significant moment in the ongoing effort to enforce crypto regulation and protect crypto market integrity . It underscores the risks associated with market manipulation in the digital asset space and signals a continued push by authorities to ensure fair and transparent markets. As the regulatory landscape evolves, participants must remain vigilant and committed to ethical practices to foster a healthy and trustworthy ecosystem.

For those following the cryptocurrency space, understanding shifts in foundational tech like semiconductors and AI is crucial, as they underpin many advancements and market dynamics. Recently, Nvidia , a giant in the chip industry, made a significant announcement impacting its financial outlook regarding the China market. Why is Nvidia Excluding China? Nvidia has decided it will no longer include the Chinese market in its official revenue forecast and profit projections. This isn’t a sudden decision but a direct consequence of ongoing geopolitical tensions and, more specifically, U.S. chip export restrictions aimed at limiting China’s access to advanced semiconductor technology. CEO Jensen Huang stated that the company doesn’t anticipate these restrictions being lifted or significantly altered in the near future, even under a potential change in U.S. administration. Understanding the Impact of Chip Export Restrictions The U.S. government has implemented licensing requirements that severely limit the type and performance of chips that American companies, including Nvidia, can sell to China. These restrictions are primarily targeted at preventing China from acquiring cutting-edge AI chips that could be used for military modernization or other strategic purposes. For Nvidia, this means even its specially designed H20 chip, intended to comply with previous regulations for the Chinese market, now faces licensing hurdles. The implications are substantial: Reduced Market Access: China is a massive market for technology components, especially advanced chips needed for AI development. Financial Hit: Nvidia has already acknowledged a significant financial impact. In its first-quarter results, the company estimated that these restrictions would lead to an approximate $8 billion reduction in its second-quarter revenue. Strategic Shift: By excluding China from forecasts, Nvidia signals that it views this market segment as highly uncertain and outside its predictable revenue streams for the foreseeable future. Focus on AI Chips and Global Markets While the restrictions specifically target advanced AI chips , they affect Nvidia’s overall strategy and global sales mix. The company is a leading provider of GPUs essential for AI training and inference, making it particularly vulnerable to regulations aimed at controlling AI technology proliferation. The decision to exclude China from the revenue forecast underscores the strategic challenges major tech companies face when navigating complex international trade policies and national security concerns. What Does This Mean for Nvidia’s Revenue Forecast? Removing a major market like China from forecasts introduces both challenges and a degree of clarity. It presents a challenge in finding alternative markets or revenue streams to compensate for the loss. However, it also provides clearer guidance to investors about the expected performance based on markets where sales are less subject to sudden regulatory changes. Jensen Huang reportedly referred to any potential reversal of restrictions as a ‘bonus,’ highlighting the company’s current stance of not relying on sales to China for core projections. Conclusion: Navigating Geopolitical Headwinds Nvidia’s move to exclude China from its revenue forecast is a clear indicator of the deep impact U.S. chip export restrictions are having on the global semiconductor industry. It highlights the strategic importance of AI chips and the challenges companies like Nvidia face in a fractured geopolitical landscape. This decision provides a more realistic, albeit potentially lower, baseline for the company’s financial expectations, reflecting the current reality of limited access to a key market.

News regarding a potential US Iran meeting has recently surfaced, carrying significant implications for global stability and potentially, for investor sentiment in volatile markets like crypto. Trump Iran Meeting: A Cloud of Uncertainty According to a report shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, former U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that a meeting between the U.S. and Iran was still on the schedule for an upcoming Sunday. However, the crucial detail that grabbed attention was his expressed uncertainty about whether this meeting would actually take place. This simple statement injects a notable degree of doubt into a potentially high-stakes diplomatic engagement. Why is a meeting between the U.S. and Iran significant? The relationship between the two nations has been fraught with tension for decades, marked by periods of intense hostility, sanctions, and proxy conflicts in the Middle East. Any direct talks, especially at a high level, could signal a potential shift in dynamics, for better or worse. The uncertainty surrounding the meeting’s occurrence adds another layer of complexity to an already delicate geopolitical landscape. Understanding Geopolitical Uncertainty Geopolitical uncertainty refers to the unpredictability of political events and their potential impact on international relations and global stability. This uncertainty can stem from various sources, including: Changes in leadership or government policy International disputes and conflicts Economic instability in key regions Unexpected diplomatic developments (like the potential cancellation of a planned meeting) When significant geopolitical events or potential events are uncertain, it creates a climate of risk aversion among investors. They become hesitant to commit capital, and existing investments can become more volatile as market participants react to news and speculation. How Geopolitical Events Fuel Market Volatility Market volatility is a measure of how much the price of an asset fluctuates over time. Geopolitical events are well-known catalysts for increased volatility across various asset classes. Here’s how it often plays out: When news like the uncertainty surrounding the Trump Iran meeting breaks, traders and investors attempt to assess the potential outcomes and their consequences. Will the meeting happen? If so, what will be discussed? Will it lead to de-escalation or increased tension? The lack of clear answers leads to speculation, which can cause rapid price swings. For instance: Safe Havens: Assets traditionally considered safe havens, like gold or certain government bonds, might see increased demand, driving up their prices. Risk Assets: Assets perceived as riskier, such as stocks or commodities tied to the affected regions (like oil), might experience sell-offs, leading to price declines. Currency Markets: Exchange rates can fluctuate significantly as capital flows react to perceived risks in different economies. The uncertainty itself, regardless of the eventual outcome, is often enough to trigger a knee-jerk reaction in the markets as participants price in potential worst-case scenarios. Exploring the Crypto Market Impact The Crypto market impact from geopolitical uncertainty is a topic of ongoing debate. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes touted as digital gold or a hedge against traditional financial system instability and geopolitical risks. The argument is that they are decentralized and not tied to any single nation-state’s policies or stability. However, the crypto market has also shown a strong correlation with traditional risk assets, particularly technology stocks. During periods of broad market fear or sell-offs, cryptocurrencies often decline alongside stocks, behaving more like a risk asset than a safe haven. So, how might the uncertainty around the US Iran meeting affect the crypto market? Several scenarios are possible: Increased Volatility: The most likely immediate impact is increased price swings in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as traders react to global sentiment. Safe Haven Narrative Test: If traditional markets react negatively, it could test the safe haven narrative for Bitcoin. Will investors flock to it, or will they sell off crypto alongside other risk assets? Regional Impact: Uncertainty in the Middle East can affect energy prices, which in turn can have broader economic impacts that ripple into all markets, including crypto. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased global instability could potentially lead to renewed calls for stricter regulation of cryptocurrencies, which some see as a potential tool for circumventing sanctions or capital controls. Investors in the crypto space need to be particularly aware of these macro-geopolitical factors, as they can significantly influence market sentiment and price action, sometimes overshadowing crypto-specific news. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Navigating markets during times of geopolitical uncertainty requires careful consideration. Here are a few actionable insights for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep track of major global news events, especially those involving key players like the U.S. and Iran. Understand the potential implications beyond just the headline. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Periods of high volatility can be stressful. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for risk. Consider Diversification: While crypto can be part of a diversified portfolio, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes can help mitigate risk during uncertain times. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, short-term geopolitical volatility might present buying opportunities, but this requires conviction and the ability to stomach potential further price drops. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Market reactions to geopolitical news can be swift and emotional. Try to stick to a pre-defined strategy rather than making impulsive trades based on fear or hype. The uncertainty surrounding the US Iran meeting serves as a reminder that the crypto market does not exist in a vacuum. It is increasingly intertwined with global economic and political forces. Summary: Navigating the Ripples of Uncertainty President Trump’s statement regarding the potential US Iran meeting has introduced a new element of geopolitical uncertainty into the global landscape. This uncertainty is a known driver of increased market volatility across traditional financial markets and has a tangible potential for significant Crypto market impact . While some view crypto as a hedge against such instability, its behavior often mirrors that of other risk assets during sell-offs. Investors should remain vigilant, stay informed about global events, and approach the market with a clear strategy to navigate the potential turbulence that geopolitical developments can create.

Officials within the Indian government have confirmed that the tax department has launched investigations into cases of cryptocurrency-related tax evasion. This development underscores the increasing scrutiny on digital assets and highlights the importance of understanding and complying with India crypto tax regulations. What Triggered the Investigation into Crypto Tax Evasion India ? The move by the Indian tax authorities isn’t entirely unexpected. With the significant growth in cryptocurrency adoption and trading activity across the country over the past few years, the volume of transactions involving digital assets has skyrocketed. While many participants in the crypto market are compliant taxpayers, the potential for large, untracked gains has naturally drawn the attention of tax authorities looking to ensure everyone pays their fair share. Several factors likely contributed to the timing of this investigation: Increased Adoption: A larger user base means a wider pool of potential taxpayers and transactions. Regulatory Clarity (Partial): While a comprehensive regulatory framework is still evolving, the Finance Act 2022 brought significant clarity on how cryptocurrency income is taxed, making it easier for authorities to identify non-compliance. Data Availability: Exchanges operating in India and globally are increasingly subject to reporting requirements, providing tax departments with data points to cross-reference with filed tax returns. Global Trend: Tax authorities worldwide are ramping up efforts to tackle crypto tax evasion, and India is aligning with this global push. This investigation signals a serious intent from the government to enforce the existing tax laws pertaining to digital assets. Understanding Cryptocurrency Tax India : The Current Landscape Before diving deeper into the investigation, it’s crucial to understand the existing tax rules for cryptocurrencies in India. The framework, introduced in 2022, treats income from the transfer of Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs), which includes cryptocurrencies, in a specific manner. Here are the key aspects: Flat 30% Tax on Gains: Any income from the transfer (sale, exchange, etc.) of VDAs is taxed at a flat rate of 30%. This is applicable regardless of your income tax slab. No Set-off of Losses: A significant point is that losses from the transfer of one VDA cannot be set off against income from the transfer of another VDA. For example, a loss on Bitcoin cannot be adjusted against a gain on Ethereum. Furthermore, losses from VDA transfers cannot be set off against income from any other source (like salary, business, etc.). No Deduction for Acquisition Cost (with exceptions): The only deduction allowed when calculating the gain is the cost of acquisition. No other expenses related to the transfer (like mining costs, exchange fees, etc.) are deductible. 1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source): A 1% TDS is applicable on the transfer of VDAs above a certain threshold (Rs 10,000 in a financial year, or Rs 50,000 for specified persons like individuals/HUFs with significant income). This TDS is not the final tax but acts as a mechanism for the government to track transactions and collect tax upfront. The final tax liability is calculated during tax filing. Tax on Gifts: If you receive cryptocurrency as a gift, it is taxable in the hands of the recipient if the aggregate value of VDA gifts received during the financial year exceeds Rs 50,000. This is taxed under the head ‘Income from Other Sources’ at the recipient’s applicable income tax slab rate. This structure makes it relatively straightforward, yet potentially high-tax, for those profiting from crypto trading or investments. Who Might the Indian Tax Department Crypto Investigation Target? While the tax department hasn’t released specific criteria for their investigations, it’s reasonable to assume they would focus on individuals and entities exhibiting certain patterns: High-Volume Traders: Individuals or entities involved in frequent, large-value transactions on domestic or international exchanges. Data from exchanges, both within India (due to TDS) and potentially from international cooperation agreements, could highlight such activity. Non-Filers or Under-Reporters: Taxpayers who have engaged in significant crypto activity but have either not filed tax returns or have filed returns without reporting their crypto income. Users of Unregulated Platforms: While harder to track, individuals using peer-to-peer platforms or foreign exchanges with less stringent KYC/AML procedures might also be on the radar if linked to other identifiable financial activities. Those Flagged by TDS Data: The 1% TDS mechanism provides the tax department with a wealth of data on who is transacting in crypto and the value of those transactions. Discrepancies between TDS data and filed returns would be a major red flag. Entities Accepting Crypto Payments: Businesses that have accepted cryptocurrency as payment for goods or services but have not accounted for this income correctly in their books. The investigation is likely data-driven, using information from exchanges, the TDS system, and potentially other financial intelligence sources to identify potential cases of non-compliance with India crypto tax laws. What Are the Potential Consequences of Crypto Tax Evasion India ? Evading taxes, including those on cryptocurrency income, carries significant penalties under Indian tax law. The consequences can range from financial penalties to legal prosecution. Potential repercussions include: Penalty for Underreporting Income: If income is underreported or misreported, a penalty of 50% to 200% of the tax payable on the underreported income can be levied, in addition to the tax due. Interest on Unpaid Tax: Interest is charged on the amount of tax not paid by the due date. Prosecution: In serious cases of willful evasion, prosecution can be initiated, which may lead to imprisonment. Reputational Damage: Being found guilty of tax evasion can severely damage an individual’s or business’s reputation. The tax department has powers to scrutinize accounts, demand information, and assess tax liability. Non-cooperation can also lead to penalties. Actionable Insights: How to Ensure Compliance with Cryptocurrency Tax India Given the ongoing investigation, the most crucial step for anyone involved with cryptocurrencies in India is to ensure full compliance with tax laws. Here are some actionable insights: Gather All Transaction Data: Collect comprehensive transaction history from all exchanges and wallets you have used, both domestic and international. This is the foundation for calculating your tax liability. Calculate Your Gains and Losses Correctly: Determine the cost of acquisition and sale value for every VDA transfer. Calculate the gains subject to the 30% tax. Remember the restrictions on setting off losses. Account for TDS: Ensure that the 1% TDS deducted on your transactions is correctly accounted for in your tax calculations. You can claim credit for this TDS when filing your return. Report All Crypto Income: Clearly declare your income from the transfer of VDAs under the appropriate head (Income from Virtual Digital Assets). Also, report any VDA gifts received above the threshold. File Your Income Tax Return Accurately and On Time: Use the correct ITR form and report all sources of income, including cryptocurrency. File your return by the due date to avoid interest and penalties. Maintain Proper Records: Keep detailed records of all your cryptocurrency transactions, including dates, amounts, costs, sale values, and exchange details. These records are essential if your return is selected for scrutiny. Consult a Tax Professional: Cryptocurrency taxation can be complex. If you have significant transactions or are unsure about any aspect, consult a chartered accountant or tax advisor experienced in crypto taxation. Consider Voluntary Disclosure: If you have previously failed to report crypto income, consider filing an updated return (ITR-U) to disclose the income and pay the tax with applicable interest and penalties. This is generally a better option than waiting for the tax department to initiate action. Being proactive and ensuring compliance is the best way to avoid potential issues with the Indian tax department crypto investigation. Challenges in Enforcing Crypto Regulations India from a Tax Perspective While the tax department is increasing its enforcement efforts, there are inherent challenges in taxing and regulating cryptocurrencies: Decentralization: The very nature of some cryptocurrencies makes tracking transactions difficult, especially those occurring off exchanges or on decentralized platforms. Global Nature: Transactions often cross international borders, involving foreign exchanges and wallets, complicating data collection and enforcement. Anonymity/Pseudonymity: While not truly anonymous, identifying the real-world identity behind certain wallet addresses can be challenging without cooperation from exchanges or service providers. Complexity of Transactions: Various types of crypto activities exist (trading, mining, staking, DeFi, NFTs), each potentially having different tax implications, requiring detailed understanding and tracking. Taxpayer Awareness: Many individuals may not be fully aware of their tax obligations regarding cryptocurrencies, leading to unintentional non-compliance. Despite these challenges, the tax department is leveraging available data points, technological tools, and potentially international information sharing agreements to build cases against non-compliant taxpayers. The Broader Picture: Crypto Regulations India Beyond Tax The tax investigation is part of a larger picture concerning crypto regulations India . While taxation has been clarified, the broader regulatory framework covering aspects like trading platforms, investor protection, and the legal status of cryptocurrencies is still under development.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just announced some key personnel changes that could potentially reshape the landscape for digital assets in the United States. These appointments are particularly noteworthy because they include individuals with direct experience in the crypto sector, sparking hope for a more informed and perhaps even a more accommodating regulatory approach. Understanding the Significance of SEC Crypto Appointments Why are SEC crypto appointments such a big deal? Well, the SEC plays a critical role in overseeing financial markets, including how cryptocurrencies and related products are classified, traded, and offered to the public. Their decisions have a massive impact on everything from whether a spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved to how crypto platforms operate. For years, the industry has called for clearer rules, and changes in leadership can often signal a shift in regulatory priorities and perspectives. The recent announcement highlights the appointment of four senior officials, and what caught the eye of many industry observers is that two of these individuals bring experience specifically relevant to the burgeoning world of digital assets . Jamie Selway: Stepping in as the new director of the Division of Trading and Markets, effective June 17th. This division oversees trading venues like exchanges and brokers – areas directly relevant to how cryptocurrencies are bought and sold. Brian Daly: Taking the helm as the new director of the Division of Investment Management, starting July 8th. This division is crucial for investment products, including funds and ETFs, which are major vehicles for institutional and retail investment in crypto. Their backgrounds in the digital asset space suggest that the SEC is bringing in expertise that understands the nuances and complexities of this technology and market. This move has been interpreted by publications like The Block as a potential indicator that SEC leadership, possibly under Chairman Paul Atkins, might be leaning towards a more pragmatic or even ‘crypto-friendly’ stance compared to previous approaches. What These SEC Digital Assets Appointments Could Mean The addition of officials with digital asset experience could lead to several potential outcomes for the market and participants. While it’s too early to make definitive predictions, here are some possibilities: Increased Understanding: Officials with direct experience might better grasp the technology, market structures, and potential benefits of digital assets, leading to more informed rulemaking. Potential for Clearer Guidance: Their insights could contribute to developing clearer regulatory frameworks, reducing uncertainty that has long plagued the industry. Review of Existing Stances: It’s possible that previous regulatory positions on certain tokens or activities could be revisited with a fresh perspective. Smoother Process for New Products: A deeper understanding within the SEC could potentially streamline the review process for new crypto-related financial products, such as various types of ETFs or investment funds. However, it’s important to temper expectations. The SEC is a large institution, and regulatory processes are complex and often slow. These appointments are significant, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. The overall direction will depend on many factors, including the views of the Commissioners and the broader political and economic environment. The Future of Crypto Regulation US The landscape for crypto regulation US has been a major point of discussion and often frustration for the industry. The lack of a comprehensive, clear framework has been cited as a barrier to innovation and institutional adoption. Different agencies, like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), have sometimes appeared to have overlapping or conflicting views on which assets fall under their jurisdiction. These new SEC officials could play a vital role in shaping the future of this regulation. Their experience could inform discussions around: How to classify different types of tokens (security vs. commodity vs. other). Appropriate consumer protection measures for crypto investors. Regulation of crypto exchanges and trading platforms. Oversight of stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi). The hope is that their appointments will contribute to a more collaborative and effective approach to developing rules that protect investors while allowing the digital asset space to innovate responsibly. Navigating Digital Asset Regulation: What Stakeholders Should Consider For businesses and investors in the crypto space, these appointments are a signal to pay close attention to upcoming SEC actions and statements. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow announcements and speeches from the SEC, particularly from the divisions led by the new officials. Engage Constructively: Industry participants should continue to engage with regulators, providing input and education on digital asset technologies and markets. Prepare for Potential Changes: While hoping for clearer rules, businesses should remain prepared for evolving regulatory requirements. Understand Divisional Roles: Recognize that the Division of Trading and Markets and the Division of Investment Management handle different aspects of the market, and changes in their leadership are relevant to specific types of crypto activities and products. These appointments represent a step towards potentially integrating more specialized knowledge into the regulatory body overseeing digital asset regulation . While the path forward still holds uncertainties, the inclusion of officials with relevant experience is a positive development for those seeking clarity and progress in the US crypto market. Concluding Thoughts: A New Era for SEC and Crypto? The appointment of two senior SEC officials with experience in the digital assets sector is a significant development that shouldn’t be overlooked. It suggests a potential evolution in how the regulatory body approaches the complex and rapidly changing world of cryptocurrency. While challenges remain in establishing a comprehensive crypto regulation US framework, bringing in expertise from the industry itself could pave the way for more informed, effective, and perhaps even favorable policies for digital assets moving forward. The coming months under the leadership of Jamie Selway and Brian Daly in their respective divisions will be closely watched by everyone invested in the future of finance.

Some coins are getting more attention due to strong community support, price growth, or important updates. Among these, one stands out not just for its tech but also for its fast-growing reach, BlockDAG. Along with BlockDAG, ONDO, TIA, and APT are each offering unique value across the DeFi sector. From linking digital assets to real-world use, to building scalable blockchain tools and pushing smart contract progress, these four are grabbing attention. Here’s a closer look at the top crypto projects in 2025 and why they’re becoming more relevant. 1. BlockDAG: Strong Utility, Global Reach, and US-Based Sponsorship BlockDAG is doing what many early-stage platforms have struggled to achieve, blending strong tech features with rising user numbers and wide exposure. Sources suggest BlockDAG is in talks for a US-based sponsorship, which could lead to major branding exposure. With ties to names like Inter Milan and Alex Pereira already in place, this new development could further raise its visibility among mainstream audiences. At the heart of its momentum is a presale that has raised $299 million, selling over 22.4 billion coins. BlockDAG is currently in Batch 29 of its presale, with coins priced at $0.0276 and targeting a launch price of $0.05. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. The project is fully audited by CertiK, EVM-ready, and runs through the X1 app, which has 1.5 million miners onboard. With community engagement tools like Buyer Battles giving rewards to active users, BlockDAG (BDAG) lead among the top crypto projects in 2025, combining tech depth and mainstream appeal. 2. ONDO: Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto Tools ONDO is building momentum by offering tokenized US Treasuries, giving it a real use case in this cycle. The project recently enabled transactions on its testnet through the Ondo Chain using OUSG, its Treasury-based asset, while also working with major firms like J.P. Morgan and Chainlink. It’s also introduced USDY for Latin America and enabled Solana support, helping improve liquidity across different networks. Currently priced around $0.90, ONDO holds a market cap of $2.8 billion and sees daily trading between $130–162 million. Despite earlier price drops from its $2.14 high, it is regaining attention thanks to strong product development and growing institutional support. With over $1.37 billion in value locked and more backing from regulated custodians, ONDO continues to stay relevant as one of the top crypto projects in 2025, offering real-world integration. 3. TIA: Building Scalable and Modular Infrastructure Celestia’s token, TIA, focuses on modular design, allowing developers to create separate execution spaces using Celestia for data. This structure helps improve scalability and avoid network slowdowns. It’s already working with systems like Arbitrum Orbit and Polygon CDK, helping other chains without overloading its own. The price of TIA stands near $2.21, a steep drop from its earlier high above $20. However, steady volume around $122 million and a market cap under $1.5 billion hint at a possible rebound. Future projections go from $2.62 up to $11 by 2026, depending on how quickly rollup usage spreads. With support for Ethereum tools, use of WebAssembly, and strong decentralization, TIA ranks as one of the top crypto projects in 2025 for those watching future blockchain scaling. 4. APT: Growth Path Amid Short-Term Challenges APT, the token for Aptos, has recently crossed above $5 resistance, now trading at $5.13. This follows activity like Bitwise’s ETF filing and rising development based on RapidLane, its improved execution engine. RapidLane lifts throughput, helping Aptos rival other fast blockchains. Even though $53 million in tokens will be unlocked this month and $60 million more next month, which may cause brief price dips, the project’s long-term goals are clear. With Aptos built on the Move language, its ecosystem is growing with grant programs and platforms like xBTC. Some expect APT to temporarily fall to $3.80, but longer-term estimates go as high as $31 in 2025. With better tools and expanding features, APT remains one of the top crypto projects in 2025 worth monitoring. Summing Up! These four cryptos give a strong overview of DeFi’s direction, with each bringing a different strength. ONDO connects digital finance with traditional assets. TIA builds the core tools for future blockchains. APT moves ahead with upgraded smart contract tech. But BlockDAG leads the list with the most balanced mix of reach, growth, and tech. With a $299 million presale, 1.5 million users, and a presale price of $0.0276, it has already shown a 2,660% increase since its first batch. Its US-based sponsorship adds further visibility. Among all, BlockDAG stands out as one of the top crypto projects in 2025 with both user momentum and solid delivery.

In a move that underscores the dynamic nature of large-scale crypto movements, a substantial amount of BTC has shifted addresses, sparking widespread discussion about potential market implications. What Did the Whale Alert Reveal About This Bitcoin Transfer? According to data provided by Whale Alert, a service that monitors large transactions on various blockchains, a colossal amount of 7,999 BTC was recently transferred. This particular transaction originated from Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, and was directed towards a wallet address currently classified as ‘unknown’. The sheer scale of this Bitcoin transfer is noteworthy, valued at approximately $847 million at the time of the transaction. Whale Alert’s notifications are crucial for traders and analysts trying to gauge the activities of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’. Such large movements can sometimes signal potential shifts in market sentiment or liquidity. Key Details of the Bitcoin Transfer Metric Detail Amount Transferred 7,999 BTC Originating Exchange Coinbase Destination Wallet Unknown New Wallet Approximate USD Value $847 Million Reported By Whale Alert Why Does a Large Coinbase Outflow Matter? A significant Coinbase outflow , like the one observed with this 7,999 BTC transfer, is often interpreted as a potentially bullish signal by market participants. Exchanges are typically used for trading activities. When a large amount of Bitcoin leaves an exchange and moves to an unknown wallet, it can suggest that the owner intends to hold onto the assets for the long term rather than selling them in the immediate future. This is because moving assets off an exchange, especially in such large volumes, often involves setting up cold storage solutions, which are less accessible for quick trading. Conversely, large inflows to exchanges can sometimes precede selling pressure, as traders move assets onto platforms to potentially execute trades or take profits. Therefore, tracking Coinbase outflow and inflow data is a key metric for analysts assessing market sentiment and potential supply dynamics. Who is This BTC Whale and What Are They Doing? The term BTC whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin. These players can significantly influence market dynamics due to the sheer size of their holdings and transactions. The identity of the wallet receiving the 7,999 BTC remains unknown, which adds an element of mystery and fuels speculation. Several possibilities exist regarding the nature of this BTC whale and the purpose of the transfer: Institutional Investment: It could represent a large institution moving recently acquired Bitcoin into cold storage for safekeeping. This would align with the narrative of increasing institutional adoption. Private Investor/Fund: A wealthy individual or a private investment fund could be consolidating assets or securing a large position off-exchange. Exchange Internal Transfer: Less likely for a move to a completely ‘unknown new wallet’, but sometimes exchanges perform internal rebalancing, though these are usually identifiable. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The BTC might have been purchased via an OTC desk, and this transfer represents the delivery of the assets to the buyer’s secure wallet. Without concrete information on the wallet’s owner, these remain educated guesses based on typical large-scale crypto movements. However, the fact that it left a major exchange like Coinbase and went to a new, unknown address is a strong indicator of a potential long-term holding strategy by the recipient. How Does This Fit Into the Broader Crypto News Landscape? This significant transfer is just one piece of the larger puzzle in the dynamic world of crypto news . Large transactions are constantly occurring across various blockchains, and monitoring them helps provide insights into market activity, investor behavior, and potential trends. In a market often driven by sentiment and large capital flows, keeping an eye on whale movements is considered a crucial aspect of analysis. Recent crypto news has highlighted increasing interest from institutional players and corporations in Bitcoin. Transfers like this one can sometimes be indicative of such trends, especially if followed by similar patterns from other exchanges or into identifiable institutional wallets. However, it’s important not to overstate the impact of a single transaction. While significant, the market’s direction is influenced by a multitude of factors including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. What Can We Learn From Tracking Whale Activity? Tracking large transactions, as reported by services like Whale Alert, offers several potential benefits for market participants: Gauging Sentiment: Large outflows from exchanges can suggest accumulation and a bullish bias among whales, while large inflows might indicate potential selling. Identifying Trends: Observing patterns in whale behavior over time can help identify broader trends in institutional or large investor interest. Understanding Liquidity: Movements of large volumes can impact the available supply on exchanges, potentially affecting price volatility. Spotting Potential Opportunities: While risky, some traders attempt to anticipate market moves based on observed whale activity, although this requires sophisticated tools and analysis. It’s essential to remember that whale tracking is not an exact science and should be used as one of many tools for market analysis. Large transfers can have various legitimate reasons that do not directly predict immediate price movements. Actionable Insights for the Reader Given this large Bitcoin transfer and the ongoing interest in whale activity, what steps can interested individuals take? Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and data providers like Whale Alert to stay updated on significant on-chain movements. Analyze Context: Don’t view a single transaction in isolation. Consider it within the broader market context, including price action, news headlines, and other on-chain metrics. Use Whale Data as an Indicator, Not a Guarantee: Understand that large transfers are just one piece of the puzzle. They can signal potential intent but do not guarantee specific market outcomes. Focus on Long-Term Trends: For most investors, focusing on the long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader market is often more productive than trying to trade based on individual whale movements. Summary: A Closer Look at the $847 Million Bitcoin Transfer The recent movement of 7,999 BTC, valued at approximately $847 million, from Coinbase to an unknown wallet, as highlighted by Whale Alert , is a significant event in the world of cryptocurrency. This large Coinbase outflow suggests that a major holder, a likely BTC whale , is potentially moving assets off-exchange for long-term storage, which is often interpreted positively by the market. While the identity and exact intentions of the recipient remain a mystery, such transactions are vital pieces of crypto news that analysts use to gauge market sentiment and potential supply dynamics. Tracking these large transfers provides valuable insights but should always be done in conjunction with other forms of market analysis.

This isn’t just a simple donation; it’s a powerful statement from one of the most influential organizations in the Ethereum ecosystem, underscoring the high stakes involved in the ongoing legal battles facing developers in the crypto space, particularly those working on tools designed to enhance crypto privacy . Why is the Ethereum Foundation Stepping Up for Roman Storm ? The Ethereum Foundation confirmed it is contributing $500,000 towards the legal costs for Roman Storm. This substantial sum highlights the perceived importance of his case, not just for Storm himself, but for the broader principles the Foundation believes are at stake. In their statement, the Foundation emphasized that “privacy is normal” and, crucially, that “writing code is not a crime.” This position aligns with a long-held view within the crypto and open-source communities that code is a form of speech and that developers should not be held criminally liable for how others choose to use the tools they create. The Foundation’s financial support signals a commitment to defending developers whose work touches upon sensitive areas like privacy, especially when facing legal challenges from powerful entities like the U.S. Department of Justice. What is Tornado Cash and Why the Controversy? To understand the context of the DOJ indictment and the Ethereum Foundation’s support, it’s essential to know what Tornado Cash is. Tornado Cash is a decentralized protocol designed to improve transaction privacy on the Ethereum network. It works by pooling together cryptocurrency from various users, mixing it, and then allowing users to withdraw the same amount (minus fees) to a new address. This process makes it significantly harder to trace the origin of funds. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it generally works: Deposit: User A deposits ETH or another token into the Tornado Cash pool. Wait: User A waits for a period while other users also deposit and withdraw funds. Withdraw: User A withdraws the same amount of ETH to a completely new wallet address using a cryptographic proof (a ‘note’) from their original deposit. The controversy arises because while Tornado Cash can be used for legitimate privacy reasons (e.g., protecting financial history from public view, preventing tracking by advertisers or unwanted parties), it has also allegedly been used by malicious actors, including cybercriminals and entities sanctioned by the U.S. government, to launder illicit funds. This dual-use nature has placed it squarely in the crosshairs of regulators. Unpacking the DOJ Indictment : What Are the Charges Against Roman Storm ? Roman Storm was arrested and subsequently indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice in August 2023. The charges against him are serious and carry significant potential penalties. The indictment alleges three main counts: Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering: This charge alleges that Storm conspired with others to conduct financial transactions involving the proceeds of specified unlawful activities, knowing that the transactions were designed to conceal the nature, source, or ownership of the funds. Conspiracy to Operate an Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business: The DOJ alleges that Tornado Cash operated as a money transmitting business without obtaining the necessary licenses, and Storm was involved in this operation. Conspiracy to Violate Sanctions Laws: This charge is particularly sensitive, alleging that Storm conspired to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by facilitating transactions for sanctioned entities, notably the North Korean cybercrime group Lazarus Group, which the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash for allegedly enabling. The DOJ’s case appears to focus not just on the existence of the tool, but on Storm’s alleged involvement in its operation, maintenance, and alleged knowledge or willful blindness regarding its use by illicit actors. This distinguishes it from merely writing and publishing code, a point the defense and its supporters, including the Ethereum Foundation, are likely to contest vigorously. The Bigger Picture: Crypto Privacy Under Fire? The case against Roman Storm and the subsequent support from the Ethereum Foundation highlight a fundamental tension at the heart of the crypto space: the desire for privacy and anonymity versus the demands of financial regulation aimed at preventing money laundering and sanctions evasion. Blockchain technology is inherently transparent, making transaction histories publicly viewable. Privacy tools like Tornado Cash were developed precisely to counter this transparency for users who value financial confidentiality. Proponents of privacy tools argue that privacy is a fundamental right and necessary for various legitimate activities, such as protecting sensitive business transactions, preventing stalking or harassment based on public financial data, or simply maintaining personal financial confidentiality in a world where data is increasingly exploited. Regulators, on the other hand, view tools that obfuscate transaction origins as significant risks that can be exploited by criminals, terrorists, and sanctioned regimes to move illicit funds undetected. They argue that the need to combat serious financial crime outweighs the general desire for privacy in this context. The legal battle facing Storm could set important precedents regarding the legal liability of developers who create decentralized, open-source software. If developers can be held responsible for the illicit actions of users of their tools, even if they have no direct control over the usage, it could have a chilling effect on innovation and the development of privacy-enhancing technologies in the crypto space and beyond. What Does This Mean for Developers and Users? The DOJ indictment and the subsequent legal proceedings against Roman Storm serve as a stark reminder of the legal risks associated with developing and using certain types of crypto software, particularly those focused on privacy or facilitating peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. For developers, this case underscores the importance of understanding the regulatory landscape and potential legal liabilities associated with their projects. While the “code is speech” argument is a strong defense within the community, its acceptance in traditional legal systems is still being tested. Building in compliance features where possible or clearly disclaiming responsibility for user actions might become even more crucial, though the decentralized nature of many projects makes this complex. For users, the case highlights the risks associated with using privacy tools that are under regulatory scrutiny. While using such tools might be legal in some jurisdictions or for certain purposes, their association with illicit activities and the regulatory crackdown can lead to assets being frozen or other legal consequences. Ultimately, the outcome of the case against Roman Storm, supported by the Ethereum Foundation ‘s significant contribution, will be closely watched by the entire crypto community. It represents a critical juncture in the ongoing debate about the balance between financial privacy, regulatory control, and the freedom to develop open-source technology.

Analyst Sees Path To $137,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-following-abcd-pattern-analyst-sees-path-to-137000/,"Brewing tensions between Israel and Iran have triggered global de-risking across risk-on assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). The top cryptocurrency by market cap is down 1.7% over the past 24 hours. That said, technical indicators still point toward a potential new all-time high (ATH) for BTC in the coming months. Bitcoin Tracing The ABCD Pattern According to a recent post on X by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, BTC appears to be following the ABCD pattern. The analyst noted that Bitcoin is currently trading within a wedge formation and could target as high as $137,000 if it breaks out. For the uninitiated, the ABCD pattern is a classic chart setup with four points and three legs – AB, BC, and CD – where AB and CD are typically equal in length, and BC serves as the retracement. It helps identify potential reversal zones and signals when a price move may be losing momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance – A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Several other technical indicators also point to a potential new ATH for BTC. For instance, crypto analyst Crypto Caesar shared the following 4-hour Bitcoin chart highlighting a bullish double bottom pattern that suggests BTC is primed for recovery. Fellow crypto commentator Jelle identified a cup and handle pattern on the daily BTC chart. Jelle shared the following chart showing that BTC has already formed the “cup” and is now beginning to shape the “handle,” which typically precedes a sharp upward move. Meanwhile, crypto trader Merlijn the Trader pointed to the Hash Ribbons – an on-chain indicator historically associated with major rallies. Merlijn shared the following BTC daily chart, noting that the last four appearances of this signal preceded strong Bitcoin uptrends. To explain, Hash Ribbons is an on-chain indicator that uses Bitcoin’s 30-day and 60-day hash rate moving averages (MA) to spot miner capitulation and recovery. A bullish signal appears when the short-term average crosses above the long-term one. Are BTC Bears Regaining Ground? Although BTC remains above the psychologically important $100,000 mark, some concerning signs are beginning to emerge. The cryptocurrency was recently rejected from the $110,000 resistance level again, giving bears temporary control.

Such dynamics are typically observed during the late phase of a bull cycle. In parallel, short-term holders are showing signs of declining confidence in BTC, as reflected in recent on-chain activity. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $105,568, down 1.7% over the past 24 hours.

While the immediate focus is on the humanitarian and security implications, for participants in the financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, such events are closely watched for their potential to trigger significant shifts. Understanding the Geopolitical Tension Behind the Israel Missile Event The report confirms an Israel missile alert triggered by a launch originating from Yemen. This incident is not isolated but occurs within a broader context of escalating regional tensions. Yemen has been a flashpoint for conflict, and actions originating from there impacting Israel represent a significant development. This particular event underscores the complex and volatile geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Several factors contribute to the heightened geopolitical tension in the region: Ongoing conflicts and proxy wars involving regional and international powers. Disputes over territory, political influence, and religious differences. The involvement of non-state actors capable of launching cross-border attacks. The intricate web of alliances and rivalries that can quickly escalate localized incidents into broader confrontations. An confirmed Yemen launch targeting Israel is a direct manifestation of these underlying tensions, raising concerns about potential retaliation and further escalation across the region. How Does Geopolitical Tension Influence Market Volatility? Financial markets, including traditional assets like stocks, bonds, oil, and gold, are highly sensitive to geopolitical events. Increased geopolitical tension typically introduces uncertainty and fear, leading investors to reassess risk exposure. This often results in: Flight to Safety: Capital tends to flow into assets perceived as safe havens, such as gold, certain government bonds (like US Treasuries), and sometimes the US dollar. Increased Volatility: Prices of riskier assets (like stocks and many commodities) can experience sharp swings as traders react to news, rumors, and speculation about the potential impact of the conflict. Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts in key regions can disrupt global supply chains, affecting commodity prices (especially oil and gas) and potentially impacting inflation. Changes in Investor Sentiment: Overall market confidence can be shaken, leading to broader sell-offs or a reluctance to invest until the situation stabilizes. The news of an Israel missile alert following a Yemen launch fits squarely into the category of events that can fuel this kind of market volatility . Exploring the Potential Crypto Impact Given that cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7 and are increasingly integrated into the global financial landscape, they are not immune to the effects of major geopolitical events. The potential crypto impact from events like the recent Israel missile incident can be multifaceted: Historically, the reaction of the crypto market to geopolitical tension has been debated. Some argue that Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ could act as a safe haven asset, independent of traditional financial systems and government control. Under this narrative, increased global instability might lead investors to seek refuge in Bitcoin, driving its price up. However, the reality is often more complex. Crypto markets are still relatively young and can be highly correlated with traditional risk assets, particularly technology stocks. In times of broad market panic or deleveraging, investors may sell off all risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, to raise cash or cover margin calls. Therefore, increased market volatility stemming from geopolitical events could also lead to downward pressure on crypto prices. What Factors Determine the Crypto Market’s Reaction? The specific crypto impact of the Yemen launch and resulting Israel missile alerts will depend on several factors: Scale of Escalation: A contained incident might have minimal lasting impact, while a significant escalation into a broader regional conflict could trigger a more severe market reaction. Global Economic Context: The state of the global economy (inflation, interest rates, recession fears) at the time of the event can amplify or dampen its effects on markets. Market Sentiment: The prevailing sentiment in the crypto market (bullish, bearish, or neutral) before the event can influence how it reacts. A market already under pressure might be more susceptible to negative news. Correlation with Traditional Markets: The degree to which crypto is currently correlated with stocks and other risk assets will play a significant role. Narrative Strength: The strength of the ‘digital gold’ or safe haven narrative for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies during the specific event. Potential Scenarios for Crypto Impact: Based on past reactions and current market dynamics, here are a few potential scenarios for the crypto impact following the news of the Yemen launch and Israel missile alerts: Scenario Description Potential Crypto Reaction Reasoning Limited Impact / Quick Recovery Incident remains isolated, no major escalation. Minor dip followed by quick recovery or sideways movement. Market assesses the event as not significantly changing the broader economic/geopolitical outlook. Increased Volatility / Short-Term Dip News creates initial panic; broader market sell-off. Prices dip alongside stocks; increased trading volume and price swings. Crypto acts as a risk asset, sold off during general market fear and deleveraging. Flight to Safety Narrative Emerges Significant escalation; traditional systems perceived as vulnerable. Bitcoin (and potentially other select crypto) sees inflows; outperforms traditional risk assets. Investors seek non-sovereign, decentralized assets as a hedge against geopolitical instability. (Less common scenario currently) Sustained Downtrend (if part of larger crisis) Incident is part of a prolonged, escalating regional or global crisis impacting the global economy. Crypto market experiences a sustained downturn, possibly steeper than traditional markets due to higher beta. Broader economic fallout, loss of confidence, and continued risk-off sentiment dominate. As of the immediate aftermath of the report, the market reaction is being closely monitored. Initial news often leads to knee-jerk reactions, and it takes time to assess the true potential for escalation and its lasting effect on global stability and financial markets. Navigating Market Volatility: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Events like the Yemen launch causing Israel missile alerts serve as a stark reminder of how quickly the global landscape can change and impact financial markets. For those holding or trading cryptocurrencies, navigating this potential market volatility requires a thoughtful approach. Stay Informed, But Be Critical Keep track of reliable news sources regarding the geopolitical situation. However, be wary of sensationalism and rumors that can exacerbate panic. Focus on verified information from reputable outlets and official statements. Assess Your Risk Tolerance and Portfolio Geopolitical shocks are part of the investing landscape. Review your portfolio allocation. Are you comfortable with the potential downside if markets react negatively? Consider whether your current holdings align with your long-term investment goals and risk tolerance in light of increased uncertainty. Avoid Emotional Decisions Sudden news and market drops can trigger fear and panic selling. Conversely, a quick rebound might lead to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Try to stick to your pre-defined investment strategy. Emotional trading during periods of high market volatility often leads to poor outcomes. Consider Diversification While diversification within crypto (holding various coins) is important, also consider your overall asset allocation across different asset classes. However, during systemic shocks driven by geopolitical events, correlations between asset classes can sometimes increase. Think Long-Term For long-term crypto investors, short-term geopolitical shocks might be viewed as temporary noise. Historically, markets tend to recover from such events over time, provided they don’t trigger a sustained global crisis. Consider whether short-term price movements should alter your long-term conviction in the underlying technology and adoption trends. Manage Your Leverage If you are trading with leverage, periods of high market volatility significantly increase the risk of liquidation. Geopolitical events can cause rapid and large price swings, making leveraged positions particularly vulnerable. Conclusion: Monitoring the Crypto Impact Amidst Rising Tensions The news of missile sirens across Israel following a launch from Yemen is a serious geopolitical development with potential ramifications far beyond the immediate vicinity. For global financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space, it introduces a new layer of uncertainty and the potential for increased market volatility . While the immediate crypto impact remains to be fully seen and will depend on how the situation evolves, investors should be prepared for potential price swings. The incident highlights the interconnectedness of global events and financial markets. Staying informed, managing risk prudently, and avoiding impulsive decisions are crucial strategies for navigating these turbulent times. The situation remains fluid, and market participants will be closely watching for further developments from both the region and the subsequent reactions in traditional and crypto markets.

A recent announcement from Iran serves as a stark reminder that Geopolitical Risk remains a significant factor on the world stage. This development, while centered on diplomatic negotiations, highlights the interconnectedness of global events and their potential, albeit indirect, influence on various sectors, including the broader financial landscape that encompasses the Crypto Market Impact . Understanding the Latest Development: Why Did Iran Skip the Talks? According to reports from Iranian state television, Iran will not be participating in nuclear talks with the United States that were scheduled for Sunday. This decision introduces a fresh layer of Global Uncertainty into already complex diplomatic efforts aimed at reviving the Iran Nuclear Deal , formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The planned talks were seen by some as a potential pathway to de-escalation and a step towards bringing both the U.S. and Iran back into full compliance with the 2015 agreement. The deal, which curbed Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, has been in jeopardy since the U.S. withdrew in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, prompting Iran to gradually reduce its own commitments. The exact reasons cited by Iran for skipping this specific round of talks were not immediately detailed in initial reports, but such decisions often stem from a complex interplay of factors: Leverage: Iran may be seeking to gain leverage in future negotiations by signaling dissatisfaction or demanding concessions before returning to the table. Internal Politics: Domestic political considerations within Iran can heavily influence its negotiating stance and willingness to engage. Response to External Events: The decision could be a reaction to recent actions or statements from the U.S., other parties to the deal (like the UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China), or regional adversaries. Procedural Disagreements: There might be disagreements over the format, agenda, or participants of the planned talks. Regardless of the specific immediate cause, the outcome is clear: a delay, and potentially a setback, in diplomatic efforts, increasing Geopolitical Risk . How Does Geopolitical Risk Connect to the Crypto Market Impact? At first glance, nuclear negotiations in the Middle East might seem worlds away from the decentralized ledgers and digital currencies of the crypto market. However, global markets are highly sensitive to shifts in Geopolitical Risk and Global Uncertainty . When major geopolitical events occur, they can trigger broader market reactions: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty often leads to increased volatility across asset classes as investors react to potential instability. Flight to Safety: In times of heightened risk, some investors may move capital out of perceived riskier assets (like stocks, or sometimes, cryptocurrencies) into traditional safe havens (like gold or certain government bonds). Impact on Traditional Finance: Geopolitical events can affect oil prices, currency exchange rates, and stock markets. These shifts in traditional finance can indirectly influence sentiment and liquidity in the crypto market. Regulatory Concerns: Geopolitical tensions can sometimes lead to increased scrutiny or calls for stricter regulation of cryptocurrencies, particularly regarding their potential use in circumventing sanctions. While the Bitcoin Price and the broader crypto market are driven by their own unique fundamentals (adoption rates, technological developments, halving cycles, etc.), they do not exist in a vacuum. They are increasingly integrated into the global financial ecosystem and can react to macro-economic and geopolitical headwinds. Exploring the Iran Nuclear Deal: What’s at Stake? The potential revival of the Iran Nuclear Deal is significant for several reasons, all of which contribute to the level of Global Uncertainty : Table: Key Aspects of the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA) Aspect Description Significance Nuclear Restrictions Limits on uranium enrichment levels and stockpiles, restrictions on advanced centrifuges, intrusive inspections by the IAEA. Aims to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Breakdown increases proliferation risk. Sanctions Relief Lifting of international sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program (U.S. sanctions largely reimposed after 2018 withdrawal). Intended to provide economic benefits to Iran. Reimposition severely impacts Iran’s economy. Monitoring & Verification Robust inspection regime by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Ensures transparency and verification of Iran’s compliance. Reduced cooperation increases opacity. Parties Involved Iran, P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, UK, U.S.) and the European Union. Requires consensus and cooperation among multiple global powers, adding complexity. A failure to revive the deal could lead to Iran further expanding its nuclear activities, potentially bringing it closer to weapons-grade material. This scenario would dramatically heighten Geopolitical Risk in the Middle East and globally, potentially leading to regional conflict or further international isolation of Iran. Such outcomes are precisely the kind of events that can send jitters through financial markets, contributing to Global Uncertainty and potentially influencing the Crypto Market Impact . Historical Perspective: Geopolitical Events and Market Reactions History provides numerous examples of how geopolitical events have impacted markets. While the crypto market is relatively new compared to traditional finance, it has shown sensitivity to major global shocks: The COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 caused a significant, albeit temporary, crash across global markets, including cryptocurrencies, as initial Global Uncertainty peaked. Regional conflicts or significant political crises in the past have often correlated with increased volatility in oil prices and stock markets, effects that can spill over into other asset classes. Even events like major elections or policy shifts in key global economies can introduce uncertainty that affects investor sentiment worldwide, influencing decisions related to assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. The current situation with the Iran Nuclear Deal , while not an immediate crisis, is a persistent source of Geopolitical Risk that market participants monitor. A sudden negative turn could trigger risk-off sentiment, potentially affecting the Bitcoin Price and the broader market. What Are the Challenges and Risks Ahead? Reviving the Iran Nuclear Deal faces significant challenges: Trust Deficit: Deep mistrust exists between Iran and the U.S., making direct negotiation difficult. Sanctions vs. Nuclear Steps: Disagreements persist on the sequencing and extent of U.S. sanctions relief and Iran’s return to nuclear compliance. External Pressure: Regional adversaries of Iran lobby against the deal’s revival. Escalation Risk: Continued failure to find a diplomatic path increases the risk of escalation, either through further Iranian nuclear advancements or regional tensions. These challenges perpetuate Global Uncertainty and underscore the ongoing nature of Geopolitical Risk associated with this issue. For market participants, this means this is not a ‘one-off’ event but a situation that requires ongoing monitoring due to its potential for sudden shifts that could have a Crypto Market Impact . Actionable Insights for Navigating Uncertainty While it’s impossible to predict market movements based solely on geopolitical news, understanding the potential impact of events like the stalled Iran Nuclear Deal is crucial for informed decision-making. For those interested in the crypto market, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of major geopolitical developments, even those seemingly unrelated to crypto. Understand how events causing Global Uncertainty have historically affected markets. Recognize Interconnectedness: Appreciate that the Crypto Market Impact can be influenced by macro factors, including Geopolitical Risk , not just internal crypto news. Monitor Sentiment: Observe how traditional markets (stocks, oil, gold) react to such news, as this can sometimes provide clues about broader risk appetite that may affect the Bitcoin Price and altcoins. Risk Management: Ensure your investment strategy accounts for potential volatility driven by external factors. This might involve diversification or setting clear entry/exit points. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility can be triggered by news events, the long-term trajectory of the crypto market is driven by fundamental adoption and technological progress. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on single news items. Understanding the landscape of Geopolitical Risk helps investors contextualize market movements and make more resilient decisions in the face of Global Uncertainty . The situation with the Iran Nuclear Deal is a prime example of an external factor that contributes to this complex global backdrop. Conclusion: Monitoring the Horizon Iran’s decision to skip scheduled nuclear talks with the U.S. is a significant diplomatic setback that elevates Geopolitical Risk . While the direct, immediate Crypto Market Impact might not be apparent, this development contributes to the overarching climate of Global Uncertainty that influences all financial markets. The future of the Iran Nuclear Deal remains precarious, and potential escalations or resolutions will continue to be watched closely by global observers and market participants alike. For those navigating the crypto space, recognizing that events far beyond the blockchain can create ripples is key to developing a robust and informed approach to investment in assets like Bitcoin Price and beyond. Staying informed about such critical global developments is an essential part of understanding the broader forces that can shape the market landscape.

By mixing blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, Lightchain AI introduces the best solutions that set it apart in the competitive crypto industry. Currently, its presale has seen the project secure funding of about $18.4 million, with its token priced at $0.007, showing that investors trust the project. With its special technology and forward-thinking move, Lightchain AI is set to outperform other meme coins by 2025. Drawbacks of Meme Coins Such as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have been seeing a lot of attention in the crypto market. Nevertheless, there are few of the well-known tokens in the market. One of the major disadvantages of these tokens is their sharp movements in price. For example, these coins see quick movements in prices, with a sharp decline translating to losses for investors. This unstable movement is caused by social media and trends. Sometimes, it is also caused by celebrity endorsements. Moreover, most of the meme coins are not supported by the best fundamentals, with community hype and speculation causing their value to rise or drop. This unknown behavior has led to investors complaining about their long-term growth. The meme coin market can also be easily manipulated e.g. pump and dump schemes where projects cause their tokens to rise using artificial mens later to sell them for profit and leave investors hanging. Secondly, regulations for meme coins are still unclear and as a result, investors are taking on big risks by being in the sector. This means that investors need to be careful when dealing in this sector, carrying out the needed research before choosing to invest in any token in the meme coin sector. What Sets Lightchain AI Apart from Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) Lightchain AI sets itself apart from Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) with the best technologies, better tokenomics, and security measures. While SHIB and DOGE rely on community hype, Lightchain AI has an ecosystem that offers real-world utility. The project’s tokenomics is clearly defined, with its token supply fixed at 10 billion LCAI tokens. 405 of these are allocated to the presale, while 28.5% are allocated to staking rewards. 15% is allocated to liquidity, while the rest is shared across marketing, treasury, and members of the team. This encourages adoption and ensures growth inside the ecosystem. Lightchain AI also stands out due to its low latency performance, and parallel execution that allows real-time response. These features are important for AI-powered decentralized applications. It also uses the Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) framework for its security and decentralized storage to ensure data privacy and protection. These features make Lightchain AI the best project for investors looking for new platforms with functionality. Why Play It Safe When You Can Aim for Greatness? While meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are good because of their short profits, that is not enough for investors looking at the long term. Lightchain AI ensures the best opportunity with real long-term potential. With the best technology and solid tokenomics, Lightchain AI reduces risks by ensuring its platform is stable and sustainable. This is not just another crypto project, it is a bold step into the decentralized world. It also wants to change the future of decentralized finance by blending blockchain with artificial intelligence. So, why settle for short-term profits when you can invest in something better?

Right now, Worldcoin (WLD) is heading toward resistance, and Sui (SUI) recently showed a breakout pattern, suggesting wider momentum in the sector. With that movement, another project is gaining serious attention, BlockDAG. This guide explores the fastest growing cryptos in 2025, covering BlockDAG , TAO, ALGO, and TIA, and why each deserves a closer look in this current cycle. 1. BlockDAG: US-Based Sponsorship Hype Builds BlockDAG continues to show strong presale growth. The project has now raised $299.6 million and sold 22.4 billion coins across 29 batches. The current price in batch 29 is $0.0276. Since batch 1, early holders have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds. With expectations of a $0.05 launch price, there’s strong attention building around the project. Unlike most presales, BlockDAG brings more than hype, it’s backed by working features and strong tech.

A recent alert from a reputable source like VanEck carries significant weight, especially when it concerns announcements that could mislead investors. VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets, Matthew Sigel, has issued a pointed VanEck crypto warning regarding certain corporate pronouncements in the digital asset space, specifically targeting small-cap firms making grand claims about XRP treasury plans and Solana treasury plans. Understanding the VanEck Crypto Warning VanEck is a well-established investment management firm with a growing focus on digital assets. When a figure like Matthew Sigel, who leads their digital asset strategy, speaks, the market listens. His recent comments highlight a critical concern: the potential for low-market-capitalization companies to exploit the hype around cryptocurrencies like XRP and Solana for less-than-legitimate purposes. The core of the VanEck crypto warning is skepticism towards announcements from companies, particularly those listed on exchanges like Nasdaq but possessing market caps under $100 million. These firms are reportedly announcing intentions to raise substantial amounts – potentially hundreds of millions of dollars – specifically for purchasing digital assets like XRP and SOL to hold in their corporate treasuries. Sigel’s concern, as reported by The Block, stems from the sheer scale of the proposed crypto acquisitions relative to the size and financial capacity of these micro cap crypto companies. Raising hundreds of millions typically requires significant institutional backing, proven track records, or substantial existing assets. Without these elements, such ambitious funding goals for speculative asset purchases appear questionable. What Makes These Micro Cap Crypto Announcements Suspicious? Let’s break down why these specific announcements raise red flags, according to the VanEck crypto warning: Disproportionate Scale: A company with a market capitalization of, say, $50 million, claiming it will raise $500 million to buy crypto is a massive mismatch. This implies raising capital ten times their current valuation solely for a volatile asset class. Lack of Credible Backing: Large capital raises usually involve investment banks, venture capital firms, or strategic investors who conduct thorough due diligence. The absence of announced major backers for these micro-cap plans is suspicious. Asset Choice: While XRP and Solana are prominent cryptocurrencies, announcing massive XRP treasury plans or Solana treasury plans without a clear, compelling business rationale tied to the company’s core operations can seem opportunistic. Unlike a tech company needing Bitcoin for payments or reserves, a tutoring company (like Classover) or a digital services firm (like Trident Digital) announcing huge crypto buys lacks obvious synergy. Timing: Such announcements often coincide with periods of increased crypto market volatility or interest, potentially aimed at capturing market attention rather than reflecting a sound corporate strategy. The Mechanism: Potential Crypto Pump and Dump Matthew Sigel explicitly labels these types of announcements as potentially being crypto pump and dump schemes. But how would that work in this context? A classic crypto pump and dump involves inflating the price of an asset through misleading positive statements or hype, then selling off holdings once the price rises, leaving others with devalued assets. In this corporate version: A micro cap crypto company announces massive XRP treasury plans or Solana treasury plans. This news creates excitement, suggesting significant institutional demand for XRP or SOL is coming. Crypto investors, and potentially even stock investors in the micro-cap company, buy the assets or the stock based on this perceived future demand or strategic shift. This ‘pumps’ the price. The company or associated insiders, who may have acquired the crypto or stock cheaply beforehand, sell their holdings into the inflated market. This is the ‘dump’. The announced capital raise or crypto purchase may never fully materialize, or if it does, it might be on a much smaller scale, leaving investors who bought on the hype holding the bag as prices inevitably fall back down. This scheme leverages corporate announcements to manipulate market perception, distinct from a typical project-based crypto pump and dump but with a similar harmful outcome for unsuspecting investors. Case Studies: Trident Digital and Classover Holdings Sigel specifically mentioned companies like Trident Digital and Classover Holdings as examples exhibiting these concerning patterns. While specific details of their announcements would need independent verification, the pattern described fits: Both are described as having market caps under $100 million. Both reportedly announced plans to raise hundreds of millions for crypto purchases. The scale of the proposed raise relative to their size is the primary red flag. These examples serve as cautionary tales, illustrating the types of announcements that prompted the VanEck crypto warning. Investors should look beyond the headline and scrutinize the details, especially the financial viability of the announced plans for companies of this size. Risks for Investors: Navigating Micro Cap Crypto Announcements For both stock market investors considering these micro-cap companies and crypto investors trading XRP or SOL, these announcements present significant risks: Stock Valuation Risk: The company’s stock price might artificially inflate based on the crypto hype. If the plan fails or is revealed as disingenuous, the stock price could collapse. Furthermore, pursuing highly speculative XRP treasury plans or Solana treasury plans with shareholder funds might indicate poor corporate governance or a lack of focus on the core business. Crypto Market Volatility: While a large buyer *could* theoretically impact XRP or SOL prices, the impact of a potentially fake or exaggerated announcement is different. It creates artificial demand that evaporates, leading to potential price corrections that harm those who bought during the ‘pump’. Liquidity Issues: Micro cap crypto stocks can be illiquid, making it hard for investors to sell shares quickly if news turns negative. Fraud Risk: At worst, these could be outright fraudulent schemes designed to enrich insiders at the expense of public investors. The VanEck crypto warning serves as a timely reminder that not all corporate crypto adoption announcements are created equal. Actionable Insights: How to Spot Dubious Treasury Plans Given the potential for crypto pump and dump schemes dressed up as corporate strategy, how can investors protect themselves? Here are some actionable insights: Check the Company’s Market Cap: Compare the announced capital raise amount to the company’s current market capitalization. If the raise is many times larger than the company itself, be extremely skeptical. Identify Funding Sources: Does the announcement name specific, reputable investors or investment banks providing the hundreds of millions? Generic statements about ‘raising capital’ without specifics are a red flag. Evaluate the Business Rationale: Why does this specific company need XRP treasury plans or Solana treasury plans? Is there a clear strategic link to their existing business model, or does it seem like a speculative pivot? Research Management and Track Record: Look into the history of the company’s leadership. Do they have experience managing large sums or operating in the digital asset space legitimately? Be Wary of Hype: Announcements focused more on generating buzz than explaining the financial and strategic details warrant caution. Diversify and Don’t Bet on Single Announcements: Avoid making significant investment decisions based solely on a single company’s announcement, especially from a micro-cap firm. Treat announcements from micro cap crypto firms claiming massive treasury plans with extreme caution. Due diligence is paramount. Conclusion: Heeding the VanEck Crypto Warning Matthew Sigel’s VanEck crypto warning about potentially fraudulent XRP treasury plans and Solana treasury plans from micro cap crypto companies is a crucial alert for the market. While corporate adoption of crypto is a significant trend, not all announcements are genuine or well-founded. The pattern of small companies claiming they will raise vast sums for crypto purchases, without credible backing, strongly suggests the possibility of a crypto pump and dump scheme designed to manipulate stock or crypto prices. Investors must remain vigilant, look beyond sensational headlines, and conduct thorough research into the companies and the feasibility of their announced plans. The promise of large institutional buys can create powerful hype, but as VanEck suggests, sometimes that hype is just a cover for something far less legitimate. Stay informed, question ambitious claims from small players, and prioritize sound investment principles over speculative excitement.

A significant proposal has emerged that could fundamentally change how the network operates, aiming for unprecedented levels of efficiency and scalability. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a potential architectural shift that could redefine the future capabilities of the platform. Why is Vitalik Buterin Proposing a Major Change? During the recent Protocol Berg event, part of Berlin Blockchain Week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin dropped a compelling idea: potentially replacing the network’s core execution engine, the EVM ( Ethereum Virtual Machine), with a new architecture called RISC-V . This proposal stems from the ongoing need to improve the network’s ability to handle more transactions and complex operations without increasing costs or compromising decentralization. While Ethereum has made significant strides with upgrades like The Merge and ongoing work on sharding, execution layer efficiency remains a key area for improvement. The EVM has served the network well since its inception, acting as the decentralized computer that executes smart contracts. However, as the demand on Ethereum grows, its limitations in processing speed and cost become more apparent. This is where the vision for a more powerful, flexible, and potentially faster execution environment comes into play. What Exactly is RISC-V and How Could it Benefit Ethereum ? RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA). Unlike proprietary ISAs that require licensing fees and have closed specifications, RISC-V is free to use and modify. This open nature aligns well with the decentralized and open-source ethos of the Ethereum community. Buterin highlighted several potential benefits of transitioning to RISC-V : Massive Execution Capacity Increase: The most striking claim is the potential for a 100x increase in execution capacity. This means the network could theoretically process significantly more complex smart contracts and transactions simultaneously, dramatically boosting throughput. Lower Transaction Costs: Higher efficiency and capacity typically translate to lower computational costs per operation. For users, this could mean substantially reduced gas fees, making the network more accessible and affordable for a wider range of applications and activities. Broader Developer Adoption: RISC-V is a well-established architecture in the general computing world. Shifting to it could potentially lower the barrier to entry for developers who are already familiar with RISC-V tools and environments but are new to blockchain-specific virtual machines like the EVM . This could attract a larger and more diverse pool of talent to build on Ethereum . Improved Flexibility and Innovation: As an open standard, RISC-V allows for greater flexibility in implementation and optimization compared to the more fixed design of the current EVM . This could pave the way for future innovations in how smart contracts are executed. Think of it like upgrading from an older, custom-built engine to a modern, standardized, and highly optimized one that’s used across various high-performance systems. While the custom engine worked, the standardized one offers significant performance gains and is easier for more mechanics (developers) to work with. Understanding the Difference: EVM vs. RISC-V To appreciate the significance of this proposal, it helps to understand the core difference between the current EVM and the proposed RISC-V . Both are virtual machines designed to execute code in a sandboxed environment, but they differ fundamentally in their instruction sets and design philosophies. Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) RISC-V Architecture Type Stack-based Register-based (RISC – Reduced Instruction Set Computing) Instruction Set Custom, designed specifically for Ethereum Standardized, open-source, widely used in general computing Complexity Relatively simple, optimized for blockchain state transitions More complex but highly optimized for general computation Performance Potential Limited by design; scaling improvements often involve layer 2 or sharding High; designed for performance in various computing environments Developer Familiarity Requires specific EVM knowledge Familiar to developers with general computing background The move from a stack-based EVM to a register-based RISC-V is a technical leap that leverages decades of optimization work done in the broader computing industry. This is a key reason why such significant performance gains are even considered possible. What Does This Mean for Blockchain Scaling ? Blockchain scaling is one of the most critical challenges facing decentralized networks like Ethereum . The current limitations on transactions per second and high gas fees during peak demand hinder mass adoption and the development of complex decentralized applications (dApps). While Layer 2 solutions like rollups are currently the primary strategy for scaling, improving the base layer’s execution capacity could significantly enhance the overall scalability picture. A 100x increase in execution capacity at the base layer, as proposed by Vitalik Buterin with the RISC-V shift, wouldn’t necessarily mean 100x more transactions directly on Layer 1 overnight. However, it could: Enable more complex and gas-intensive operations to run more efficiently on Layer 1. Potentially reduce the computational cost of Layer 2 operations that settle on Layer 1. Provide a stronger foundation for future scaling technologies. Make Layer 1 more viable for certain types of applications that are currently priced out. This proposal is a long-term vision for achieving sustainable, high-throughput blockchain scaling directly on the main network, complementing the ongoing work on Layer 2 solutions. Is This Upgrade Happening Soon? While the proposal is exciting, it’s crucial to note that this is still in the early discussion stages. Vitalik Buterin himself indicated that preparing for such a significant architectural shift could take around 18 months. This involves extensive research, development, testing, and community consensus. Replacing the core execution engine of a multi-billion dollar, globally distributed network is no small feat. It would require careful planning to ensure compatibility, security, and a smooth transition for existing applications and users. The potential challenges include: Complexity of Transition: Migrating existing smart contracts and infrastructure from the EVM to a RISC-V based environment would be a massive undertaking. Security Audits: A new execution environment introduces new potential vulnerabilities that would require rigorous auditing. Tooling and Ecosystem Development: A new ecosystem of development tools, debuggers, and libraries would need to be built or adapted for the RISC-V execution layer. Community Consensus: Like all major Ethereum upgrades, this would require broad support from the core developers, researchers, validators, and the wider community. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits outlined by Vitalik Buterin make this proposal a significant topic of discussion within the Ethereum community. It represents a bold vision for addressing the network’s long-term scalability and efficiency needs. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Ethereum ‘s High-Performance Future Vitalik Buterin ‘s proposal to explore replacing the EVM with RISC-V is a testament to Ethereum ‘s commitment to continuous improvement and innovation. While still a long-term prospect requiring significant development and community alignment, the potential benefits – including a dramatic increase in execution capacity, reduced costs, and broader developer appeal – could solidify Ethereum ‘s position as a leading platform for decentralized applications and drive significant advancements in blockchain scaling . This ambitious vision underscores the dynamic nature of blockchain technology and the ongoing efforts to build a more efficient, accessible, and scalable decentralized future.

Dogecoin has spearheaded a meme coin revolution, and Chainlink now boasts a reputation for being one of the most popular smart contract networks. Polkadot has also come a long way as an open-source blockchain platform. However, a new wave of emerging tokens, such as Remittix’s (RTX) , is taking center stage. RTX’s ongoing presale has grabbed the attention of investors who have raised over $15.6 million in a brief spell. Can RTX surpass DOGE, LINK and DOT this season? Dogecoin dips 14% as bullish sentiment wanes Dogecoin’s price has shed nearly 15% of its previous gains in the last 30 days, signaling a pullback after Dogecoin’s surge to highs of $0.24. This rebound is backed by a descending support triangle that is now forming, albeit with a rising macro trendline. At its current price of $0.19, DOGE is showing signs of strength for a long-term uptick despite the recent pullback. With DOGE’s price approaching a zone that could trigger serious buy-side interest, onlookers anticipate an uptick if the bulls hold support. Image Source: Coinmarketcap Chainlink confirms breakout despite an 11% pullback Just like Dogecoin, Chainlink has seen its price dip of around 21% in the last month despite clear signals of a breakout forming at the $15.36 barrier. Chainlink saw its price surge from lows of $12.93 to highs above $15, but only a consolidative pattern ensued as LINK failed to hold support above $15. Image Source: Coinmarketcap Currently priced at around $13.54, LINK’s bullish sentiment is buoyed by recent enhancements that could see Chainlink become the main chain for the Hong Kong-Australia pilot CBDC project . Chainlink has also partnered with banks around the world to integrate a decentralized oracle for financial compliance. Could these advancements re-ignite a bullish uprising for LINK? Polkadot’s price plummets after SEC delays ETF approval The bearish wave sweeping across legacy altcoins has not spared DOT, whose price has dipped 16.3% in the last month, adding to an annual downturn of over 35%. Previously, DOT was on the rise, with its price surging to highs of $10 at the tail end of 2024. As 2025 began, DOT’s pullback saw its price rebound around the $3.2 mark. Anticipation for a favorable SEC decision concerning DOT ETFs brought about a wave of excitement, although short-lived. The SEC’s decision to delay DOT’s ETF approval could spell more doom, leading to a prolonged downturn. Remittix’s RTX presale set to surpass DOT , LINK and DOGE While legacy altcoins struggle to regain previous popularity, emerging tokens such as Remittix’s RTX are taking center stage. Remittix is reinventing cross-border payments with a service that enables crypto holders to send funds directly from their crypto wallet to a recipient’s bank account. The entire process obscures the complexities of crypto wallet making it easy for recipients anywhere in the world to receive funds across 30+ fiat currencies. Remittix is on track to lead a potential $250 trillion remittance market thanks to its PayFi platform’s speedy and affordable transactions. While the likes of XRP and XLM focus on institutions, Remittix facilitates near-instant crypto-to-fiat transactions for both individual users and small businesses, leading expert analysts to predict a 3,00% uptick for RTX at launch.

Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, is reportedly taking a significant step into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Sources indicate that Coinbase is planning a major Coinbase DEX integration directly into its popular mobile application. This move aims to bring the power of decentralized trading closer to millions of users, potentially reshaping how people interact with DeFi on their smartphones. What is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX)? Before diving into the specifics of the DEX on Coinbase , let’s quickly touch upon what a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is. Unlike centralized exchanges (CEX) like Coinbase itself, DEXs operate directly on a blockchain. This means: No Intermediary: Trades happen peer-to-peer using smart contracts. User Control: Users retain custody of their private keys and assets throughout the trading process. Transparency: All transactions are recorded on the public ledger of the blockchain. Wide Asset Range: Often lists a broader range of tokens, especially newer or smaller cap ones, compared to CEXs. Think of it this way: a CEX is like a traditional bank or stockbroker holding your assets, while a DEX is more like a direct peer-to-peer marketplace where you trade directly from your own wallet. Why is Coinbase Integrating a DEX? This reported Coinbase DEX integration is a fascinating development. Coinbase has historically been a gateway for retail users into crypto through its centralized platform. By adding a DEX, they are essentially bridging the gap between the centralized and decentralized worlds. Here are a few potential reasons and benefits: Meeting User Demand: Many crypto users are increasingly exploring DeFi for staking, yield farming, and accessing a wider variety of tokens. Integrating a DEX makes these activities more accessible within a familiar interface. Leveraging the Base Ecosystem: The initial integration is planned to support trading on Coinbase’s own Base blockchain . This move will significantly boost activity and liquidity on Base, attracting more developers and users to their layer-2 network. Expanding Revenue Streams: While DEXs typically have lower fees than CEXs, facilitating trading activity within their app could generate revenue through various means, such as integrating with specific DEX protocols or potentially offering enhanced features. Staying Competitive: As the crypto landscape evolves, centralized platforms need to adapt. Offering access to DeFi capabilities helps Coinbase remain a comprehensive platform for all types of crypto users. Onboarding DeFi Users: Millions of Coinbase users who might find navigating separate DEX interfaces complex could easily try decentralized trading within the app they already use. Initial Focus: The Base Blockchain The report specifies that the initial DEX support will be for trading on the Base blockchain . Base is a Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution built by Coinbase, designed to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications. Focusing on Base first makes strategic sense: It allows Coinbase to dogfood its own network, drive adoption, and ensure a smooth user experience within a controlled environment before potentially expanding to other chains. Trading on Base is generally faster and cheaper than on the Ethereum mainnet, offering a better entry point for users new to DEX trading. While the initial focus is on Base, the plan is to support other blockchains in the future. This indicates a long-term vision of making Coinbase a hub for accessing decentralized liquidity across multiple networks, further solidifying its position as a leading Crypto Mobile App . What Does This Mean for Users? For the average Coinbase user, this integration could be a game-changer. Accessing a Decentralized Exchange often requires setting up external wallets, bridging assets, and navigating unfamiliar interfaces. Bringing this functionality directly into the Coinbase app simplifies the process significantly. Imagine being able to trade tokens available on Uniswap or other DEXs operating on Base directly from your Coinbase account, without leaving the app. However, it’s important to remember that using a DEX still comes with responsibilities and risks inherent to DeFi: Benefits for Users: Simplified Access: Trade directly from your Coinbase wallet interface. Wider Token Selection: Access tokens typically found only on DEXs. Potential for Lower Fees: Trading on L2s like Base is generally cheaper than Ethereum mainnet. Non-Custodial Trading: Maintain control of your assets during the trade (assuming the integration uses a non-custodial method within the app). Potential Challenges and Considerations: User Experience Complexity: While simplified, DEX interfaces and concepts (like slippage, gas fees on L2s) can still be more complex than CEX spot trading. Security Risks: Smart contract risks and potential vulnerabilities on the DEX protocol itself remain. Liquidity: While Base is growing, liquidity for certain pairs might be lower than on major CEXs initially. Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for DEXs is still evolving, which could impact how these features are offered globally. Learning Curve: Users new to DeFi will still need to understand concepts like transaction signing and network fees. Coinbase will likely need to provide clear educational resources within the app to guide users safely through their first DEX trades. Coinbase’s Strategy: Bridging CeFi and DeFi This move is part of a broader trend where centralized crypto companies are embracing decentralized technologies. By integrating a Decentralized Exchange , Coinbase isn’t just adding a feature; it’s acknowledging the growing importance of DeFi and positioning itself as a bridge between the two worlds. This strategy could attract DeFi natives who also use CEXs and introduce CEX users to the possibilities of decentralization. Examples of this trend include other platforms adding DeFi features or building their own blockchain networks. Coinbase’s approach, focusing initially on their Base blockchain , allows them to control the core experience while tapping into the decentralized ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Users and Developers For Users: Keep an eye out for official announcements from Coinbase regarding the DEX feature rollout. Educate yourself on how DEXs work, including concepts like liquidity pools, slippage, and network fees (gas). Start exploring the Base ecosystem if you’re interested in getting ahead. Understand the difference between custodial (CEX) and non-custodial (DEX) trading within the app’s implementation. For Developers on Base: This integration could bring significant new user traffic to protocols built on Base. Ensure your DApps are robust, secure, and provide a good user experience, anticipating potential influx from Coinbase users. Explore ways to integrate or be discoverable within the new Coinbase DEX interface (if applicable). The Future of the Crypto Mobile App The integration of a Decentralized Exchange into a major Crypto Mobile App like Coinbase signals a maturing market. It suggests that the future of crypto access might involve seamless transitions between centralized services for ease of use and decentralized protocols for control and innovation, all within a single application interface. As Coinbase plans to support other blockchains, its mobile app could become a universal portal to various DeFi ecosystems. This move could accelerate mainstream adoption of DeFi by lowering the technical barrier to entry for millions of users. It highlights the increasing demand for decentralized services and the willingness of major players to adapt their models. In Conclusion The reported Coinbase DEX integration is a monumental development. By bringing a Decentralized Exchange onto its platform, starting with the Base blockchain , Coinbase is poised to introduce a vast user base to the world of decentralized trading. While challenges related to user education and interface complexity remain, the potential benefits in terms of access to a wider range of assets and participation in the growing Base ecosystem are significant. This step reinforces Coinbase’s position as a leading Crypto Mobile App and represents a key moment in the convergence of centralized and decentralized finance. It’s a revolutionary step that could redefine mobile crypto trading for years to come.

These issues erode trust, inflate costs and hinder innovation. DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), powered by blockchain technology, offer a transformative approach to addressing these problems by fostering transparency, patient empowerment and community-driven governance. This article explores how DAOs could reshape healthcare, diving into their mechanics, applications, real-world examples, challenges and future potential. What are DAOs DAOs are entities governed by smart contracts – self-executing code on a blockchain – rather than traditional hierarchical management. DAOs operate without centralized control, relying instead on token-based voting systems where stakeholders (token holders) collectively make decisions. These tokens represent voting power or ownership in the DAO, ensuring democratic governance. Key features of DAOs include the following. Transparency – All transactions and decisions are recorded on an immutable blockchain, publicly verifiable by all members. Decentralization – No single entity controls the organization, reducing risks of corruption or mismanagement. Automation – Smart contracts enforce rules and execute decisions, minimizing human error and bureaucracy. Community governance – Stakeholders vote on proposals, from funding allocation to operational changes, aligning incentives. In healthcare, these characteristics make DAOs uniquely suited to tackle systemic issues by empowering patients, providers and researchers to collaborate in a trustless, transparent ecosystem. Addressing healthcare’s core challenges with DAOs Transparent medical research funding Medical research, particularly pharmaceutical development and clinical trials, often suffers from opaque funding processes and conflicts of interest. Funding decisions may prioritize profit over patient needs, and lack of transparency can erode public trust. DAOs offer a solution by decentralizing and democratizing research funding. Crowdsourced funding – DAOs allow stakeholders – patients, researchers, healthcare providers or even the public – to pool resources and vote on which research projects to fund. This ensures funding aligns with community priorities, such as rare disease research or underserved populations. Immutable accountability – All funding decisions and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making it impossible to manipulate or hide allocations. This transparency builds trust and ensures funds are used as intended. Accelerated innovation – By involving diverse stakeholders, DAOs can prioritize innovative projects that might be overlooked by traditional funding bodies, potentially speeding up breakthroughs in treatments or diagnostics. For example, a DAO could enable patients with a specific condition to fund research directly, ensuring their needs are addressed while giving researchers access to a transparent funding pool. Patient data ownership and privacy Fragmented patient data is a major barrier to efficient healthcare. EHRs (electronic health records) are often siloed across providers, making it difficult for patients to control or share their data. This fragmentation hampers care coordination and limits the data available for research. DAOs can empower patients through decentralized data management. Patient-centric data control – Using blockchain, DAOs can create secure, decentralized platforms where patients own their medical data. Patients can grant or revoke access to specific providers, researchers or institutions via smart contracts, ensuring explicit consent. Enhanced privacy and security – Blockchain’s cryptographic protocols protect sensitive health data, reducing risks of breaches common in centralized systems. Patients can share anonymized data for research without compromising privacy. Data monetization and research – DAOs can facilitate data marketplaces where patients voluntarily contribute anonymized data to research initiatives in exchange for tokens or other incentives. This fuels data-driven discoveries while rewarding patients for their contributions. For instance, a patient could use a DAO to share their genetic data with a research institute studying cancer, receiving tokens in return while maintaining control over who accesses their information. Decentralized health insurance models Traditional health insurance systems are plagued by high administrative costs, opaque claims processes and slow payouts. DAO-based insurance models can streamline operations and enhance fairness. Community-driven pools – DAOs can create peer-to-peer insurance pools where members contribute premiums (in tokens or cryptocurrency) and vote on claims. Smart contracts automate payouts based on predefined criteria, reducing overhead and delays. Transparency in claims – All claims and payouts are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring members can verify fairness and track fund usage. Lower costs – By eliminating intermediaries like insurance companies, DAOs reduce administrative fees, making coverage more affordable and accessible, particularly for underserved communities. A DAO-based insurance model could, for example, provide affordable coverage for chronic disease management, with members collectively deciding coverage terms and claims criteria. Community-driven health initiatives Healthcare needs vary widely across communities, yet centralized systems often fail to address localized priorities. DAOs enable grassroots health initiatives by empowering communities to pool resources and make decisions. Localized funding – Communities can create DAOs to fund local health projects, such as building clinics, supporting mental health programs, or providing vaccinations in underserved areas. Incentive alignment – DAOs align incentives by giving community members a stake in outcomes. For example, a DAO could reward participants for preventive health measures, like regular checkups, with tokens redeemable for services. Global collaboration – DAOs can connect communities worldwide, enabling knowledge-sharing and resource pooling for global health challenges, such as pandemics or climate-related health crises. A rural community, for instance, could establish a DAO to fund a mobile clinic, with residents voting on its services and operations to ensure it meets local needs. Real-world examples of healthcare DAOs Several projects are already exploring DAO applications in healthcare, demonstrating their potential, including the following. Healthereum – This platform uses blockchain and DAO principles to enhance patient engagement. Patients receive tokens for adhering to treatment plans or attending appointments, incentivizing proactive health management. Providers benefit from streamlined workflows and transparent patient interactions. Robomed network – This DAO integrates blockchain to automate healthcare processes, such as patient-provider agreements and care delivery. It aims to improve efficiency and reduce costs through decentralized governance and smart contracts. Molecule – A DAO focused on decentralized biotech research, Molecule enables communities to fund and govern drug development projects. It connects researchers, patients and investors to accelerate innovation transparently. These projects illustrate how DAOs can bridge gaps between stakeholders, creating more equitable and efficient healthcare systems. Challenges and barriers to adoption Despite their potential, healthcare DAOs face significant hurdles. Regulatory compliance – Healthcare is heavily regulated, with strict laws like HIPAA (in the US) governing data privacy and medical practices. DAOs must navigate these regulations to ensure compliance, which may limit decentralization or require hybrid models. Technological complexity – Blockchain and DAOs require technical expertise, which can be a barrier for patients, providers or communities unfamiliar with the technology. User-friendly interfaces and education will be essential for adoption. Scalability and adoption – Blockchain networks can face scalability issues, such as slow transaction speeds or high costs, which could hinder large-scale healthcare applications. Widespread adoption also requires buy-in from stakeholders accustomed to traditional systems. Equity concerns – Token-based governance risks excluding those who cannot afford tokens or lack access to blockchain infrastructure, potentially creating new disparities. Addressing these challenges will require collaboration between technologists, healthcare professionals, regulators and communities to balance innovation with practicality. The road forward The potential of DAOs to revolutionize healthcare lies in their ability to create a transparent, patient-centric and collaborative ecosystem. As blockchain technology matures and adoption grows, DAOs could do the following. Empower patients – By giving individuals control over their data and healthcare decisions, DAOs shift power from institutions to patients. Foster innovation – Transparent funding and data-sharing accelerate research and development, addressing unmet medical needs. Reduce costs – Decentralized models eliminate intermediaries, making healthcare more affordable and accessible. Build trust – Immutable records and community governance restore confidence in healthcare systems. To realize this vision, stakeholders must invest in user-friendly platforms, regulatory frameworks and education to bridge the gap between blockchain’s potential and real-world implementation. Pilot projects, like those mentioned, will serve as critical testing grounds for refining DAO models. Conclusion DAOs represent a paradigm shift for healthcare, offering solutions to inefficiencies, opacity and disempowerment. By leveraging blockchain’s transparency and decentralization, DAOs can create a future where patients control their data, communities drive health initiatives and research aligns with public needs. While challenges remain, the growing interest in blockchain and decentralized governance signals a promising path forward. As DAOs evolve, they could redefine healthcare as a collaborative, equitable and innovative ecosystem, putting power back into the hands of patients and communities.

This latest movement signals a potential shift in short-term market momentum, with traders increasingly opting to exit positions. While the broader cryptocurrency market has experienced similar pullbacks, Bitcoin’s trajectory is attracting closer scrutiny due to its influence on overall sentiment and market structure. Analysts are looking into how external factors, particularly geopolitical developments, are impacting trading behavior. One such development is the reported military engagement between Israel and Iran on June 13, which triggered sell pressure across high-risk assets, including digital currencies. Amid these events, key metrics on Binance, particularly Net Taker Volume, are showing increased sell-side dominance, suggesting short-term volatility may continue. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as Whale Behavior Suggests Further Upside Binance Net Taker Volume Hits Multi-Week Low Amid Bitcoin Panic Selling According to on-chain analyst Amr Taha on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, Bitcoin’s Net Taker Volume on Binance fell to -$197 million, the most negative reading since June 6. This metric, which compares aggressive selling to aggressive buying, indicates heightened urgency among traders to sell at market prices, bypassing limit orders. The seven-hour moving average (7HMA) has remained in negative territory since June 12, reinforcing the current downward pressure. Historically, such extremes in net taker volume have been linked to local price bottoms, as they often signal panic-induced capitulation by retail and overleveraged traders. Taha highlighted that a similar event occurred on June 6, followed by a 4% rebound in Bitcoin’s price within 24 hours. The implication is that, while aggressive selling may signal weakness, it also presents conditions that have previously preceded price reversals. Geopolitical Shock Triggers Liquidation Cascade, May Signal Local Bottom Taha also pointed to the geopolitical backdrop, specifically the sudden escalation between Israel and Iran, as a major catalyst for recent market behavior. News of the strike led to a surge in liquidation activity, especially among long-leveraged positions. The correlation between the timing of the conflict and the spike in Binance sell volume suggests that traders are reacting to broader market uncertainty, contributing to downward momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rate Flips Again And History Says A Rally Is Around The Corner Despite this, Taha still views these conditions as potentially bullish in the medium term. Heavy selling often flushes out weaker hands, creating opportunities for long-term holders or institutional participants to accumulate positions at lower prices. Taha suggests that while the short-term outlook remains volatile, the current setup resembles previous recovery phases, marked by contrarian buying and reduced selling pressure.

MiCA, which came into force earlier this year, allows EU member states to issue licenses that grant crypto companies access to all 27 member countries. However, sources familiar with the matter say the licensing process has sparked internal disputes among regulators, with concerns raised over the pace and standards of approvals in some jurisdictions. Two individuals briefed on the discussions, who requested anonymity, noted growing unease in private talks about inconsistent regulatory approaches. Malta’s quick approval process sparks debate in the regulatory landscape The supervision of the multi-trillion-dollar crypto industry is at risk. Regulators have repeatedly warned that this industry could lead to fraud, market instability, and illegal financial activities without proper oversight. As a result, MiCA is seeking to bring crypto under the same regulatory roof as traditional finance. However, some people worry that uneven enforcement might weaken its objectives. Meanwhile, Gemini, an American cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is set to obtain a license to trade from Malta, the smallest country in Europe, two people familiar with the matter said. Malta previously granted licenses to OKX and Crypto.com just weeks after unveiling its new regime. OKX said it went through a rigorous application and that compliance is extremely important to the company. The speed at which Malta is granting these approvals has caught the attention of other national regulators who gather under the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). France’s AMF has expressed concern that ESMA’s lack of direct power might result in a “regulatory race to the bottom.” Moreover, a senior regulatory official, who asked to remain anonymous, mentioned worries about accepting licenses from countries with fewer regulatory staff, using Malta as an example. According to one source, ESMA is currently examining Malta’s licensing process, and a report on this will be shared soon. Malta Financial Services Authority officials said that they have four crypto licenses . According to the representative, they can act quickly because of their experiences and the expedited processing they learned over the years. The authority emphasized that its local money laundering regulations are stringent. ESMA chose not to comment on the matter. Coinbase nears Luxembourg license as EU expansion plans accelerate Talks of regulation have gained momentum now that Coinbase is on the verge of getting licenses, allowing it to do business in the European Union. One of the people said that the regulatory debate has intensified with expectations that Luxembourg will soon grant a license to Coinbase, the first US crypto-focused company to join the S&P 500 . While Coinbase had been working on its application for several months, another source said that the size of Coinbase’s intended operations in Luxembourg is relatively minor. Still, Coinbase already has a notable presence in Luxembourg, where it incorporated Coinbase Luxembourg SA in late 2024 with a share capital of €30,000. According to business registry filings, the subsidiary is overseen by four directors, including Caroline Tarnok, Coinbase’s US Head of Financial and Operational Risk, and David Farmer, VP of Products. All directors are currently based in Luxembourg. The company plans to expand its European workforce by at least 20 roles this year on top of its 200 employees across the continent.

The innovative way Cardano works and its rapid expansion present intriguing potential in the cryptocurrency market. Will ADA surge above $5 as expected? Or could you gain more by investing in a different altcoin? Read on to find out how these changes could change the future of Cardano and the crypto sector. Cardano integrates Bitcoin DeFi Cardano has made news by integrating Bitcoin into its DeFi ecosystem. With the Cardinal Protocol, those who own Bitcoin (BTC) can now use Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem directly. This means that Bitcoin’s safety and ability to be traded are the same as Cardano’s ability to be programmed and its smart contract features. Source: CoinBureau on X The integration uses MuSig2 technology, which lets Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) be wrapped and used in Cardano’s ecosystem without the need for middlemen. This method keeps Bitcoin safe and in the hands of its owner and it also lets people utilize it in Cardano’s powerful DeFi apps. The new feature has made Bitcoin more like Cardano’s decentralized apps, which are a key part of DeFi. Experts say that this will get more people to utilise Cardano because it mixes Bitcoin and Cardano in a way that hasn’t been done before. This connection lets those who own Bitcoin join Cardano’s developing ecosystem without giving up their Bitcoin. Experts tip ADA price to eclipse $5 in 2025 Many experts believe that ADA, Cardano’s native token, might achieve new highs in 2025 now that Bitcoin is part of Cardano’s DeFi. Some predictions suggest that the price could increase significantly, potentially reaching $5 by the end of 2025. ADA is more appealing to investors since it links Bitcoin’s liquidity to Cardano’s ecosystem. ADA is a popular choice for people who want long-term growth because of its unique consensus method and its platform that can grow and use less energy. ADA’s price could surge due to the momentum from Bitcoin’s integration into Cardano. Source: Coinglass via CoinCentral Analysts are sure that Cardano will have a great year in 2025. ADA’s value could increase significantly with the Bitcoin DeFi integration, potentially surpassing $5, which has never been achieved before. Experts believe Remittix has a higher growth rate than ADA While Cardano’s future looks promising with Bitcoin DeFi, some experts believe that Remittix, a new altcoin, could experience higher growth rates than ADA in the coming years. Remittix aims to revolutionize cross-border payments by offering a platform where users can send crypto directly to bank accounts in fiat currency. Remittix has already raised over $15.6 million in its presale, showing strong investor interest. Many view Remittix as a solution to the pain points that traditional financial systems and even Bitcoin face in everyday transactions. As Remittix continues to develop, it could offer more immediate utility than ADA. While ADA focuses on long-term development with its smart contract system, Remittix has already begun making waves in the real-world market. This practical utility could drive demand for the token, making it a strong contender for growth. Experts are particularly excited about Remittix’s potential to disrupt the payments market. Suppose the project can execute its goals and capture the attention of businesses and consumers. Conclusion Cardano’s integration of Bitcoin into its DeFi ecosystem is an exciting new step that could potentially push the price of ADA above $5 by 2025. The Cardinal Protocol’s technology has made Bitcoin and Cardano more important in decentralised finance. Cardano is now a major participant in this field. However, Remittix has considerable room to expand, and it may become a more effective version of ADA by providing investors and customers with real-world use cases that they can relate to. While ADA and Remittix have good chances of growth as the cryptocurrency world evolves, experts expect Remittix to guarantee a higher ROI than ADA.

In a joint move, Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have asked a New York court to release $125 million in escrow funds, marking the end of a long fight. Meanwhile, XRP is no longer seen as a security in the secondary market, giving a boost to XRP price , which is now trading around $2.15. Joint Filing By Ripple & SEC What started in December 2020 as a case in which the U.S. SEC first sued Ripple, accusing the firm of raising $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP sales. Now, after several key rulings and appeals, both Ripple and the SEC have come to a final agreement. According to their joint filing , $50 million from the escrow account will go to the SEC as a civil penalty, while Ripple will receive the remaining $75 million, pending court approval. In their letter to the court, the parties said this move avoids further appeals and officially brings the lengthy lawsuit to a close. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Ripple About to Dominate Stablecoins with USDC on XRPL? , XRP’s Legal Status Now Clear This motion follows Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 ruling , which clarified that XRP is not a security when traded on secondary markets. That judgment gave Ripple and the broader crypto industry a huge boost in credibility. However, the court had also found that early XRP sales to institutional investors did qualify as securities. Even Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed the SEC’s decision to drop its appeal, calling it a “milestone moment” for the entire industry. XRP Price Holds Steady Following the news, XRP has shown signs of recovery despite the recent market dip. The token is currently trading at around $2.16, reflecting a jump of 2.45% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, experts see a key resistance at $2.35, with potential upside toward $2.44–$2.60 if momentum builds. On the downside, support lies near $2.05. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is surging in its presale phase 5, priced at $0.03. The project has over $10,600,000 raised and 550 million tokens sold to 12,000 holders. Both tokens are capturing attention in the crypto market as top picks for investors seeking high-potential assets. XRP’s established infrastructure and Mutuum Finance’s innovative lending model position them as standout choices. Ripple’s cross-border edge Ripple (XRP) is changing payment in the world with the XRP Ledger. It is meant to simplify international transactions and is much quicker and less expensive than the existing systems, such as SWIFT. Banks that have adopted Ripple Payments take advantage of XRP to act as a bridge currency, which enhances efficiency. This usefulness is what contributes to demand, and analysts believe that XRP may reach $5.70 in 2028, which is a 148 percent increase. In addition, XRP ETFs are on the verge of being accepted, which could trigger a massive price rally, just like Bitcoin enhanced by 136% after its ETF was accepted. The future of XRP is further brightened by increased interest by investors due to the trading of its futures in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Besides that, its use in tokenizing assets such as digital commercial paper indicates an increasing usage. Mutuum Finance presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in phase 5 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.03, a 200% increase from the opening phase’s $0.01. Over $10,600,000 has been raised, with 550 million tokens sold to 12,000 holders. Phase 5 is currently underway, but phase 6 will raise the price by 16.7% to $0.035. At launch, MUTM will list at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% ROI for current buyers. Furthermore, analysts forecast a post-launch price of $2.50, a 8,233% surge from today’s price. The project’s recent Certik audit, scoring 80.00 with no vulnerabilities, underscores its robust security. Consequently, investor confidence is soaring. Mutuum’s innovative lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining decentralized finance with its dual lending system. The Peer-to-Contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools, earning passive income through automated interest adjustments. This ensures low borrowing costs and high lender returns. In contrast, the Peer-to-Peer model permits lending direct without intermediaries, which promotes transparency and control by the user. Also, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) originates a stablecoin on Ethereum, linked to the USD, and has a robust design to preserve stability. The team’s dashboard, showcasing the top 50 holders eligible for bonus tokens, adds incentive. Moreover, a $100,000 giveaway splits $10,000 among 10 winners, requiring a $50 presale investment to enter. Scaling with layer-2 efficiency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is integrating Layer-2 technology to enhance transaction speed and reduce fees. This scalability ensures seamless user experiences, even during high network demand. Unlike platforms struggling with congestion, Mutuum Finance prioritizes efficiency, making it attractive for cost-conscious investors. The beta platform will launch alongside the token, allowing immediate access to lending and earning features. Furthermore, the stablecoin’s interest revenue will fund the treasury, supporting long-term growth and token buybacks to boost demand. Active monitoring and strong social media engagement further solidify Mutuum Finance’s reliability. Consequently, its infrastructure positions it as a leader in the crypto investment space. Why these tokens shine Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging as the best cryptos to buy now. XRP’s established role in cross-border payments and potential ETF-driven growth make it a solid choice. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers early investors a low entry point at $0.03, with a guaranteed 100% ROI at launch and a projected $2.50 post-launch value. Its innovative lending, robust security, and Layer-2 integration fuel its appeal. Investors seeking high returns should explore these tokens in the crypto market.

45980124,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746451,1749877244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45980124.jpeg,Ripple mints 12M RLUSD tokens ahead of GENIUS Act vote,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-mints-12m-rlusd-tokens/,"Ripple reactivated its RLUSD minting mechanism, introducing 12 million new tokens into circulation. This follows a strategic hiatus since April, undertaken to stabilize supply and calibrate with market demand . The mint came shortly before the US Senate votes on the GENIUS Act, a bill introducing a federal regulatory regime for stablecoins, on June 17. The timing indicates a strategic play by Ripple to build more liquidity for RLUSD before impending regulation. The blockchain digital payment company stopped issuing its stablecoin in April in hopes that the token would maintain its market standing and they could regulate the circulating asset count. The firm last issued its RLUSD stablecoin on April 25, releasing two tranches of about 23 million tokens. So far, around 425.74 million RLUSD tokens are presently in circulation, per CoinMarket cap analysis. Ripple burned some of its RLUSD tokens in May Ripple’s decision to mint more tokens just before the GENIUS Act vote on June 17 hints at the company’s confidence in the bill’s approval and a bullish stablecoin market . In the last few months, the firm has consistently put effort into checking its stablecoin supply. The platform burned roughly 4 million RLUSD tokens in May, taking them out of the circulating supply. Plus, it stopped minting, striking a balance between supply and demand in the market. The company has also been working on infusing its stablecoins on several platforms. RLUSD has already been listed on several exchanges and financial platforms, including Bitget, Gemini, and Revolut, to enhance its accessibility and utility. The GENIUS Act’s supporters believe it would encourage stablecoin issuance If the GENIUS Act is approved, it would set regulatory frameworks for stablecoins and help provide clarity to companies like Ripple in the stablecoin market. If the bill wins the key vote on June 17, the bill will move to the US House of Representatives, and eventually, the bill may just be passed into law. Nic Puckrin, a crypto analyst, investor, and founder of The Coin Bureau, believes the bill would make stablecoins more mainstream and encourage more companies to venture into stablecoins. So far, Puckrin sees the stablecoin market as a duopoly, mainly controlled by Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT. Puckrin commented, “Since the bill will create a clear pathway for banks and other entities to begin issuing stablecoins. We’ll likely see a flood of them rush into the market at the start.” He added that banks are preparing to create their own tokens, and although not all will succeed, they will expand consumer choice in finding a stablecoin and issuer that fits their preferences. Senator Bill Hagerty, who introduced the bill to the Senate, is urging his fellow lawmakers to vote on it, claiming that without regulation, stablecoin innovation will only continue internationally, excluding America, and they would fall behind in global competitiveness. Puckrin also suggested that Congress is beginning to realize the positive effect stablecoins can have on the nation’s position in the world, as USD backs the majority of stablecoins. He thinks the GENIUS Act may be the answer the USD needs to hold on to global power. Other bill champions have recognized that the legislation may not be perfect but believe that passing it is better than having no stablecoin regulation at all. Bezalel Eithan Raviv, CEO of the blockchain security firm Lionsgate, shares a similar view, saying that having the bill is better than what’s currently being done. Those opposing the bill have argued that it threatens the decentralized nature of crypto and could open the door to corruption, including regulators showing favoritism toward certain stablecoins.

It reveals that Trump earned over $57 million from World Liberty Financial , a crypto firm linked to his family, and holds a huge amount of WLFI tokens. The report also lists several other sources of income, showing just how much Trump is profiting across various ventures. Here’s a breakdown of the key earnings. Trump’s Stronghold In Crypto The disclosure , made public by the Office of Government Ethics, revealed that Trump earned $57.35 million from selling tokens linked to his family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. He also holds 15.75 billion governance tokens, making this one of his biggest income sources so far. Apart from this, last week Forbes reported that Donald Trump’s net worth has climbed to $5.6 billion. Interestingly, nearly half of his liquid assets are now tied to crypto. In less than a year, Trump has made over $1.2 billion from crypto-related ventures alone. Donald Trump is cashing in on crypto. Over the last nine months, beginning slightly before the election, he has stirred up new ventures, new coins, new noise. All of it makes the president money, but how much? (Photo: Jamel Toppin for Forbes) https://t.co/eJWOWiwM8M pic.twitter.com/XsBFINCpa0 — Forbes (@Forbes) June 6, 2025 Interestingly, Trump’s involvement here shows a change in attitude. He was once critical of digital currencies, but now seems to be embracing them, especially when the profits are this high. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Media Gets SEC Nod for Bitcoin Treasury Filing: What Next? , Big Profits Beyond Crypto Apart from crypto, Trump continues to make millions from his well-known real estate empire. His Florida properties—including Mar-a-Lago, Doral, and Jupiter—brought in over $217 million. He also cashed in on his brand name. The disclosure shows: $3 million from a coffee table book. $2.8 million from Trump watches. $2.5 million from Trump-branded sneakers and fragrances. $1.15 million from NFT licensing and royalties. $1 million from collectible guitars. Add to that another $700,000+ from speaking gigs—and it’s clear Trump’s income streams remain diverse and many more. Debts and Legal Troubles Still Loom The filing also lists over $100 million in unpaid real estate loans. Trump is still battling several legal cases, including the $454 million civil fraud judgment and $88 million defamation payout, though both are currently paused due to appeals. Despite these liabilities, Trump’s crypto earnings stand out. They show that even traditional political figures are now diving into digital assets, and walking away with millions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Currently priced at just $0.0781, this lesser-known altcoin is rapidly gaining traction and attracting attention for its speed, user-friendliness and ability to tackle real issues that XRP has yet to address. With both racing toward the $15 mark, the question on everyone’s mind is simple: can the underdog pull off the upset or will Ripple stay on top? Remittix Could Be Your Gateway To A World of Huge Crypto Gains Remittix is quietly gaining recognition as a payment-focused protocol that doesn’t rely on hype to drive interest. Analysts monitoring wallet flows have noticed consistent accumulation by addresses typically associated with long-term holding strategies. These addresses are moving RTX into cold storage, reducing circulating supply and signaling confidence in the asset’s utility. Ultimately, Remittix’s goal is to shake up the $190 trillion cross-border payments market. The project makes it easy to send crypto like Bitcoin or Ethereum and have it show up as real money in someone’s bank account. This transaction happens very fast and without any sketchy exchanges, high fees and long waiting period. Remittix also plays fair with its holders. There are zero buy or sell taxes on the token, so what you earn is yours to keep. The project’s security framework is also robust; Remittix has successfully undergone a full audit by BlockSAFU, alleviating some concerns for investors. The team is committed to long-term success, not a quick exit. If adoption continues at this pace, some analysts argue the current supply structure gives RTX enough scarcity to challenge the $15 mark in 2025. Market depth, of course, will play a huge role, but the infrastructure and positioning suggest the forecast isn’t without merit. Is XRP Set To Touch The $15 Mark Soon? Ripple is back in the spotlight as traders keep a close eye on its price. Nasdaq is preparing to offer bigger exposure through its upcoming Crypto Index. According to a filing dated June 2, 2025 , the American Stock Exchange has submitted a rule change request to the SEC under rule 19b-4. The proposed change would allow the Hasdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ) to adjust its benchmark. This means adding major altcoins like XRP, SOL, ADA and XLM to its portfolio. At the moment, XRP is holding steady above the key support level of $2.14. This price point is drawing interest from XRP buyers, especially as the growing excitement around the potential approval of the Nasdaq crypto index is also boosting momentum for the altcoin. Current resistance levels for XRP sit at $2.50 and $2.94. If bullish trends continue, the price could push toward $3 within the month. Many believe increased adoption and the chance for Nasdaq exposure could drive Ripple to new heights. In fact, some crypto enthusiasts like CW on X , believe that XRP could hit prices as high as $4.5. With such predictions, there is a strong possibility that XRP’s long-awaited target of $10 and even $15 is achievable. Source: Coinmarketcap Conclusion XRP still has significant upside potential, with major catalysts that could drive its price much higher. However, reaching targets like $15 won’t be easy, as it continuously faces market challenges and regulatory pressures. For investors seeking an alternative with greater explosive potential, Remittix may be the answer. Currently in presale, each RTX token is priced at just $0.0781 – Don’t miss out!

But some regulators are worried that things are moving too fast. According to Reuters , Gemini, the crypto platform founded by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is about to receive a license in Malta, the EU’s smallest country. This would give them the green light to operate across all 27 member states. This comes shortly after Malta approved licenses for OKX and Crypto.com, just weeks after MiCA came into effect. Malta’s Fast-Track Approvals Face Scrutiny Malta’s fast approvals are raising eyebrows among EU regulators, especially under the watch of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). France’s AMF has warned that weak oversight could lead to a “race to the bottom.” One official even raised concerns over whether countries with smaller regulatory teams, like Malta, can provide adequate oversight. ESMA is now reviewing Malta’s process and is expected to release a report soon. In response, Malta’s regulator said that it has issued four licenses so far, and credited its speed to its past experience and the “in-depth understanding acquired over the years.” Malta’s regulator said it follows strict anti-money laundering rules. OKX also called the process rigorous and said that compliance is a top priority. Coinbase Eyes Luxembourg License Elsewhere, Luxembourg is soon expected to approve a license for Coinbase, the first U.S. crypto firm in the S&P 500. While its team there may be small, Coinbase has 200 staff in Europe, and it plans to hire 20 more in Luxembourg by the end of the year. Luxembourg pushed back on claims that it is being too lenient on crypto. It suggested that other countries might just be trying to win over crypto firms. Notably, Coinbase’s move is seen as a setback for Ireland, whose central bank once compared crypto to a Ponzi scheme. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Czech Opposition Pushes No-Confidence Vote Over $45M Bitcoin Deal Scandal , EU Split on MiCA Enforcement At the centre of the issue is keeping the multi-trillion-dollar crypto market in check. MiCA is designed to bring crypto under the same regulatory standards as traditional finance, but if countries apply the rules differently, it could weaken MiCA’s overall impact. Countries are still divided in the EU over how to enforce crypto rules. There are ongoing talks about giving more power to ESMA. ESMA’s chief Verena Ross wants stronger oversight, but some countries are hesitant to increase their authority. How these early licenses are handled will likely set the tone for how the EU balances crypto growth and investor protection going forward. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It is currently trading at $42.18, up 6.5% in the last 24 hours. It is up 23% this week, 68% over the past month, and an impressive 1200% in the last six months. Its technical indicators show a neutral sentiment with a slightly bullish tilt. Momentum indicators like MACD and Momentum show upward strength, while most moving averages are strongly bullish. Overall, the trend looks positive but cautious. HYPE’s Explosive Growth Hyperliquid has pulled in $64.8 million in revenue over the past 30 days, outpacing major players like Ethereum and Tron. What truly sets it apart is that 97% of its revenue goes into buying back HYPE tokens, directly rewarding holders. But despite its strong fundamentals, there could be a possible short-term pullback around $36 or even $30. After HYPE’s recent move to $44, the unstaking on Hyperliquid remained low. MetamateDaz noted that the holders stayed calm and confident, which is rare during a price jump. Analysts note that HYPE is showing signs of a short-term pullback, and the dip could be a healthy reset after the recent run. With strong fundamentals, even if HYPE cools off, a quick recovery is likely. despite the recent move to $44 on $HYPE The unstaking queue on Hyperliqud remains relatively quiet low convictions holders are running out of tokens pic.twitter.com/BFXLRi9Fi3 — daz.hl (@MetamateDaz) June 12, 2025 Experts predict HYPE could break past its previous high of $43.86 and hit $90.72 by year-end. This is due to the rising platform usage, smart mobile app upgrades, and Hyperliquid’s dominant 70% share in the global DEX derivatives market. Hyperliquid Is Becoming a Major Player Hyperliquid recorded $11B daily volume in late May and recently hit $10.1B open interest. It is now the 5th biggest in derivatives trading and could soon rival top exchanges. Binance recently mentioned Hyperliquid’s performance, which fueled listing rumors. This boosted HYPE’s trading volume by 20%. With growing interest and a fast, low-cost ecosystem, HYPE is quickly gaining traction. Long-Term Price Predictions HYPE may dip to around $32 this month, but the upside remains strong. CoinCodex predicts a rise up to $103 by 2026, with big gains likely by March. CoinDCX is even more bullish, expecting $43–$45 this week and a rise to $85 in 2025, possibly hitting $125 by 2026.

Ethereum Spot ETFs Have Seen 154,000 ETH In Inflows This Week In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the netflow related to the US-based Ethereum spot ETFs. The “spot ETFs” refer to investment vehicles that allow an alternate means of exposure to a given asset. This means that with a spot ETF, a trader can ‘invest’ into an asset without having to directly own it. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this is especially relevant, as the ETFs trade on traditional platforms. Some investors may not want to fiddle with digital asset exchanges and wallets, so the ETFs offer them a familiar path into cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Tron Has Plenty Of Room For A 2025 Bull Run, Risk Metric Signals The option of the spot ETFs is a relatively recent one in the sector, with Bitcoin’s version gaining approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the start of 2024 and Ethereum’s in mid-2024. Below is a chart that shows how the netflows related to the latter’s spot ETFs have looked during the past month. From the graph, it’s visible that the Ethereum US spot ETFs have been witnessing net inflows for the last few weeks, a sign that there has been demand for the coin from the traditional investors. “This week alone, they’ve seen 154K ETH in inflows – 5x higher than their recent weekly average,” notes Glassnode. “For context: the biggest single-day ETH inflow this month was 77K ETH on June 11th.” While the trend has been that of growth for Ethereum, it has looked a bit more mixed when it comes to the number one digital asset, Bitcoin. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin US spot ETFs have also seen positive netflows this week. The scale of the inflows, however, hasn’t been anything impressive, as only around 7,800 BTC has entered into the ETFs. This is above average, but far lower than the highs witnessed in May, when at one point the daily inflow had reached a peak of 7,900 BTC, more than the inflows for the entire current week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet—But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos Last week, the Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed an outright negative netflow, so it seems the momentum has recently just been slower for the asset. In contrast, things have looked much more green for Ethereum indeed. ETH Price While Ethereum has been seeing consistent ETF inflows, its price has still underperformed against Bitcoin over the past day as it has dropped to $2,540, a decline of 7% compared to BTC’s 2% loss.

This bold action suggests a possible fresh chance with even more returns. Could XYZVerse really be the next major breakthrough? What observations he has about it? XYZVerse ($XYZ) price prediction shows a 30x jump possible XYZVerse joined the meme coin market at a period when community-driven tokens still rule speculative trading. The emergence of meme coins such as PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk shows how powerfully community involvement, viral marketing, and strong branding can propel enormous increases. XYZVerse’s potential is much influenced by the general state of the market as well. Lower-cap meme coins are attracting more interest as the altcoin season gets underway. XYZVerse might profit from this wave if it gets strategic exchange listings and keeps community buzz post-launch, since it is still in presale. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable.

According to an SEC filing dated June 13, the agency “declared effective” TMTG’s Form S-3 registration statement, which the company filed on June 6. This form allows U.S. corporations to register a variety of securities, including stocks, options and different debt instruments. On the same day, TMTG also filed its final prospectus with the SEC. As outlined in the filing, TMTG registered the resale of roughly 56 million shares, along with another 29 million shares tied to convertible notes. These debt and equity agreements involved about 50 investors and generated the full $2.3 billion that the company plans to hold in Bitcoin. The registration statement also establishes a universal shelf, giving TMTG added flexibility to raise funds or issue securities in the future. Despite this, the firm has stated it has “no immediate plans” to sell any securities under the shelf. Chief Executive and President Devin Nunes commented on the filing, saying, “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities.” He further added, “By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our fintech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy.” TMTG’s stock dipped on the same trading day On the same trading day, TMTG’s shares dipped 2.06 percent, closing at $19.52, according to Google Finance data . Stock price of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. Source: Google Finance This move follows TMTG’s May 27 announcement that it had raised $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin, a deal the company had initially denied in earlier reports. Nunes described Bitcoin a financial freedom instrument at that time, adding that Trump Media would keep the cryptocurrency as a key asset. He said, “Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets.” Beyond its treasury holdings, TMTG is also pursuing a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Blockchain analytics firm Arkham noted in a May 28 post on X that “Donald Trump’s company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?” Later on June 5, TMTG filed the launch of a Bitcoin ETF with the SEC, stating, “The assets of the Trust consist primarily of Bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust. The Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of Bitcoin.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/wealth-manager-pretty-soon-there-wont-be-any-xrp-left-to-dca-with-heres-why/,"Matthew Snider, Chief Investment Officer at Digital Wealth Partners, has issued a cautionary statement to XRP retail investors following a significant development involving Trident Digital. The financial firm recently disclosed its plan to build a $500 million XRP reserve, a move that could impact the availability of XRP in the broader market. Trident Digital’s XRP Reserve Strategy Trident Digital, a Nasdaq-listed company, announced its intention to raise $500 million through a combination of stock offerings and financial instruments. The funds will be used to establish a substantial XRP treasury, with implementation scheduled to begin in the latter half of this year, pending regulatory clearance. At present, the firm is engaging with institutional investors and other stakeholders to determine the optimal approach for acquiring XRP and managing the reserve infrastructure. With this move, Trident joins the ranks of other publicly traded companies that have announced similar plans to hold XRP in their corporate treasuries. These companies include Webus International, Wellgistics Health, and VivoPower, among others. Implications for Retail Access to XRP In light of the growing institutional interest, Snider warned that the supply of XRP available for individual investors could face increasing constraints. He highlighted that sustained corporate accumulation could restrict the effectiveness of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) , a method in which investors buy an asset at regular intervals to reduce price volatility over time. Snider’s concern is rooted in the possibility that large-scale purchases by corporations might remove significant quantities of XRP from the circulating supply. If institutional reserves continue to grow, the availability of XRP on public exchanges may decline, limiting opportunities for everyday investors to accumulate the token steadily. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While such a supply restriction could positively influence XRP’s price trajectory, Snider noted that retail participants may be priced out or unable to maintain consistent accumulation. His statement implies that investors considering XRP should act sooner rather than later, before institutional interest accelerates further. XRP Holding Benchmarks Remain Debated As the conversation around XRP adoption intensifies, discussions have also emerged regarding the ideal quantity of XRP to hold for long-term financial benefit. The XRP community remains divided on what constitutes a meaningful amount for personal investment. Edo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, suggests that holding at least 1,000 XRP could be a reasonable benchmark for retail investors aiming to benefit from future growth. In contrast, other voices in the community, such as King Vale, argue that a minimum of 50,000 XRP is necessary to achieve financial success. At current prices, that would require an investment of over $100,000, a threshold many consider unrealistic. This has led to criticism from some community members, including commentator Xena, who argues that such figures are arbitrary and often serve to inflate investor egos rather than offer practical guidance. According to critics, individual investment goals and risk tolerance should dictate how much XRP one holds, not broad community speculation. The announcement from Trident Digital marks another step in the growing trend of institutional involvement in XRP. As more corporations express interest in integrating the asset into their financial frameworks, retail investors may face new challenges in accessing XRP through traditional accumulation strategies. Snider’s warning underscores the urgency for those considering investment to reassess their plans before broader market dynamics shift further out of reach.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Little Pepe is emerging as 2025’s leading meme contender; fast, tax-free, and Layer 2 powered. Table of Contents Shiba Inu’s momentum is slowing: Here’s why that matters Enter Little Pepe: The next meme king is in the womb The verdict: Buy before the meme becomes a movement Nothing captures attention in the crypto world like a memecoin turning rags into riches. Shiba Inu (SHIB) did precisely that, riding a tidal wave of hype, community fervor, and speculative energy to generate jaw-dropping returns. But as 2025 draws near, one pressing question dominates investor circles: What’s the next SHIB? The answer, increasingly clear to those in the know, is Little Pepe , a high-speed, tax-free, Layer 2 meme juggernaut that blends meme culture with next-gen blockchain performance. For those who missed the early days of SHIB, LILPEPE could be a golden ticket to generational wealth. Let’s dive into why this under-the-radar gem is the most promising SHIB replacement for 2025. You might also like: Shiba Inu price outlook: double bottom pattern signals a rebound Shiba Inu’s momentum is slowing: Here’s why that matters SHIB’s recent price action shows a market in limbo. Despite recovering from May’s lows, SHIB has struggled to break above key moving averages decisively. It currently trades just above the $0.000012 support level, but technical indicators, such as the RSI and low trading volume, hint at waning investor conviction. Even worse, SHIB remains trapped below its EMAs, all of which are trending downward. For many seasoned traders, that’s a red flag indicating a potential momentum loss. The window for exponential SHIB gains may have closed. Its community remains loyal, but its utility and excitement are diminishing. This is precisely the environment in which the next breakout coin thrives, and that coin is LILPEPE. Enter Little Pepe: The next meme king is in the womb While most memecoins rely solely on hype, Little Pepe is backed by a comprehensive Layer 2 blockchain ecosystem. The whitepaper positions LILPEPE not as a derivative of the original Pepe meme but as a rightful heir to the throne, a new-age, frog-powered warrior of crypto innovation. Here’s what makes LILPEPE a serious SHIB contender: Ultra-fast layer 2 tech Built as a Layer 2 Ethereum solution, Little Pepe offers lightning-fast speeds and ultra-low fees, all while maintaining Ethereum compatibility. Unlike SHIB, which remains a standard ERC-20 token with limited technical differentiation, LILPEPE is its own Layer 2 chain, capable of handling smart contracts, dApps, and meme magic — at warp speed. 0% tax policy One of LILPEPE’s standout features is its zero-tax trading model. This is a breath of fresh air in a DeFi space filled with stealth taxes and liquidity traps. Every cent you invest works for you: no fees, no games, just pure upside potential. Tokenomics that reward early believers Unlike many memecoins that flood the market with supply, Little Pepe’s distribution is carefully structured. With only 26.5% allocated to presale participants, early backers are protected from oversaturation. Add to that 13.5% reserved for staking and rewards, and what stands tall is a system designed for long-term diamond hands, not pump-and-dump speculators. Massive marketing + community engine LILPEPE doesn’t leave community growth to chance. With 10% of the total supply dedicated to marketing, expect a blitz of influencer partnerships, viral campaigns, and meme warfare. This isn’t a hobby project, it’s a meme empire in the making. Presale advantage: Where 21,830% gains begin With the presale currently in Stage 1 at just $0.001 per token, LILPEPE is at the perfect entry point. Investors who jumped into SHIB early turned $600 into six figures. Now, history is poised to repeat itself, only this time with stronger fundamentals, better technology, and a more precise roadmap. If LILPEPE reaches a $1 billion market cap — a goal openly stated in the project’s roadmap — early presale investors could see up to 21,830% ROI. That turns $600 into over $130,000. Ambitious? Maybe. Impossible? Not even close. Let’s not forget: Dogecoin once seemed like a joke. SHIB was dismissed as a copycat. And PEPE? Born out of chaos, it skyrocketed 100x in under 60 days. Little Pepe has the ingredients of all three, plus actual blockchain innovation. Roadmap that makes sense Most memecoins fumble when it comes to execution. Not LILPEPE. Its three-phase roadmap is both fun and focused: Pregnancy: Strategic presale, key partnerships, and community formation. Birth: Exchange listings (Uniswap, major CEXs), full-scale marketing blitz. Growth: Layer 2 rollout, utility-driven ecosystem expansion, CMC Top 100 target. It’s rare to see a memecoin with a defined path to actual use-case delivery and that’s where Little Pepe rises far above SHIB’s shadow. The verdict: Buy before the meme becomes a movement In crypto, timing is everything. SHIB was a generational wealth opportunity for those who got in before it gained mainstream popularity. Today, Little Pepe is at that same precipice: Early-stage presale, explosive upside, and a viral meme ready to take over the internet. What could be the best Shiba Inu replacement in 2025? The answer is clear: Little Pepe is not just next. It’s better. Before the masses discover it, before CEX listings ignite the charts, and before the memes flood feed, there’s still time. But not much. Claim a share of LILPEPE at the official website before it becomes the next $SHIB. For more information about Little Pepe , visit Telegram and X .

What’s grabbing everyone’s attention is the timing, as the U.S. Senate gets ready to vote on the GENIUS Act , a key bill that could shape the future of stablecoins, on June 17. Does it mean ripple planning for something big? Why Ripple Minted 12M Tokens Now According to the Ripple Stablecoin Tracker Ripple minted 12 million new RLUSD tokens in the last 24 hours. This sudden minting comes after Ripple had paused new RLUSD creation for about a month. 12,000,000 #RLUSD minted at RLUSD Treasury. https://t.co/uVwOFwgZYQ — Ripple Stablecoin Tracker (@RL_Tracker) June 13, 2025 In April and May, they issued large amounts, 38 million in a day at one point, before taking a break to keep the supply in check. It was seen as a move to stabilize the market, giving RLUSD time to settle into its role as a reliable digital dollar. So, why start minting again now? The answer may lie in an upcoming U.S. Senate vote on the GENIUS Act, happening on June 17. This bill is expected to set clear rules for stablecoins like RLUSD. Ripple’s move could be seen as a show of confidence, suggesting they believe the bill will pass, and the stablecoin market will finally get the legal clarity it’s been waiting for. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP and Solana Treasury Plans Are Likely Scams, Warns VanEck , What is RLUSD? For those unfamiliar, RLUSD is Ripple’s own stablecoin, designed to always hold the same value as the U.S. dollar. It’s meant to help people send money faster, trade more easily, and use crypto without worrying about price swings. Most RLUSD tokens live on the Ethereum blockchain, but some are also on Ripple’s XRP Ledger. RLUSD Volume Up by 30% The return of RLUSD minting has already pushed trading volume up by 30%, reaching $179 million in a single day. As of now, RLUSD has a total supply of about 405 million tokens . Around 70% of these exist on Ethereum, while the rest are on Ripple’s chain. If the GENIUS Act becomes law, it could mark a turning point for U.S. crypto regulation , and Ripple is preparing for that moment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This shakeup came after Meta announced it would acquire a 49% stake in the startup. Google planned to spend about $200 million on Scale this year for human-labeled training data, which is needed to train its Gemini AI model. Reuters ‘ sources familiar with the matter said Google has already begun talks with other companies this week, aiming to move much of its workload away from Scale AI. The change comes just as Meta’s investment lifts Scale’s value from roughly $14 billion to $29 billion. Despite the upheaval, Scale AI plans to carry on. Its CEO, Alexandr Wang, and a few employees will move to Meta, while everyone else stays. But losing Google, one of its biggest clients, could seriously cut its revenue. A spokesperson for Scale AI said that its relationships with large corporations and government agencies are solid and that it remains dedicated to safeguarding client information. They declined to address Google’s decision directly. In 2024, Scale AI brought in $870 million in revenue. Sources say Google accounted for about $150 million of that last year. Other leading tech firms are also cutting back One source said Microsoft is rethinking its work with Scale, and Elon Musk’s xAI plans to leave. OpenAI reduced its use of Scale several months ago, though its finance chief recently said the company still uses Scale as one of multiple data vendors. Rival AI developers worry that sending their data to Scale could reveal strategic plans. When companies contract Scale, they often hand over prototype tools and private datasets for labeling. With Meta now owning nearly half the business, competitors fear their research road maps and technical details could be exposed to a chief rival. Most of Scale AI’s revenue comes from services for generative AI firms. It connects these companies with experts such as PhD-level scientists, who work with datasets to “post‐train” models. As AI systems have grown more capable, the need for such detailed human input has soared. Scale also labels data for self-driving car makers and U.S. government agencies, clients expected to stay. Yet its largest income still comes from teaming up with generative AI developers. Rivals gain demand as AI Firms push for neutrality after Meta deal Sources say Google has been diversifying for over a year. Meta’s recent investment has prompted Google to switch all key agreements away from Scale. Thanks to built-in clauses in many contracts, the shift could occur rapidly. This transition opens doors for Scale’s rivals. “The Meta-Scale deal marks a turning point,” said Jonathan Siddharth, CEO of Turing. “Leading AI labs are realizing neutrality is no longer optional, it’s essential.” Meanwhile, some AI labs are choosing to hire in-house data-labelers to keep their information secure. “Many AI labs now want to hire in-house data-labelers, which allows their data to remain secure,” said Brendan Foody, CEO of Mercor, a startup that also offers automated tools to recruit and vet labeling experts quickly.

The revelation comes from his official 2025 public financial disclosure filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on June 13. Holding Billions of Governance Tokens According to the filing, Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in WLFI, which also grant him voting rights within the crypto enterprise. The nature of these tokens and whether they were monetized or simply valued at a high internal rate is not detailed in the document. It simply lists the income as “$57,437,927” without specifying whether the figure stems from token sales, staking rewards, or another method of realization. Massive Fundraising Effort Launched in September 2024, World Liberty Financial has rapidly scaled its capital base. The company raised $200 million in its initial public token sale and an additional $250 million in its second sale. Combined, these rounds brought in approximately $550 million. The firm’s mission is focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions and dollar-pegged stablecoins, aiming to challenge existing financial infrastructure. High-Profile Backers The crypto venture has drawn support from major investors in the digital asset space. Tron founder Justin Sun invested $30 million in November 2024, receiving 2 billion WLFI tokens at the discounted early price of $0.015. Web3Port followed with a $10 million contribution in January 2025. Oddiyana Ventures also participated, though the amount was not disclosed. Trump’s Larger Digital Asset Involvement Trump’s involvement in digital assets extends beyond WLFI. Previous filings revealed his earnings from NFT-based products like the Trump Digital Trading Cards collection. However, the latest disclosure does not show any new income from NFTs. Additionally, Trump maintains affiliations with other crypto-related companies, including CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC. These entities were also included in the latest filing, although they appeared inactive or generated minimal income during the reported period. Official Ethics Statement As per U.S. law, the President’s disclosure must be certified as “true, complete, and correct” and is subject to review by the Office of Government Ethics. This filing adds further clarity on the extent of Trump’s crypto dealings and the financial impact they’ve had in recent months. Conclusion Trump’s substantial earnings from World Liberty Financial highlight his deepening involvement in the cryptocurrency space. With over $57 million reported and a large shareholding in the platform, his crypto footprint could become a significant aspect of his post-presidency financial legacy.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-14 06:51:48

The asset’s price experienced some notable volatility as of late, not just because of the ongoing geopolitical tension but also due to Hoskinson’s latest proposal. Whales Sell CryptoPotato reported at the start of the business week that large ADA holders, those with investments of somewhere between 100 million and a billion tokens, have continued to accumulate. In the span of just 48 hours, they expanded their holdings by 120 million ADA. However, they seem to have changed their attitude once again since then. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez informed that these large entities have disposed of more than 270 million ADA in just a week. In terms of USD value, this stash is worth over $170 million. Whales have sold over 270 million #Cardano $ADA in the past week! pic.twitter.com/SKd94mj99J — Ali (@ali_charts) June 13, 2025 Such big sell-offs increase the selling pressure of the underlying asset and are typically followed by smaller investors doing the same. ADA’s price felt the consequences in the past few days as it plunged from $0.71 to under $0.62 before it recovered some ground to the current $0.636. Some analysts warned that ADA could drop further to around $0.5 if it doesn’t invalidate a head and shoulders pattern that it’s currently breaking down. While the most evident reason behind this price crash could be related to the escalating geopolitical tension between Iran, Israel, and the US, there’s another possibility that involves more internal changes. ADA for BTC? Charles Hoskinson, the brain behind the Cardano ecosystem, proposed earlier this week that the treasury should exchange $100 million worth of ADA for BTC and stablecoins to enhance the network’s DeFi capabilities. The responses were mixed, with some praising the move, while others warned that it could increase the selling pressure on ADA even more. However, Hoskinson was quick to refute these rumors, indicating that there’s enough OTC demand from institutions for ADA to cover any potential pressure. “The belief that Cardano DeFi is improving will offset the sale volume of ADA from a modest divestment (and yes, this is modest.)” This is the madness of trying to do anything with the treasury. People who have never traded large amounts of Ada presume that any trade will result in catastrophic harm to the price, using ChatGPT as the source for their claims.

Related Reading: ONDO To Repeat 2024’s ‘Parabolic’ Run? Analyst Anticipates 130% Rally Soon Bitcoin to Continue Choppy Performance On Thursday afternoon, Bitcoin dropped 5.5% to the $102,000 support fueled by the news of the Iran-Israel conflict. Amid the market pullback, the flagship crypto failed to hold its $108,000-$110,000 three-day range, falling to the mid-zone of its post-November breakout range. Notably, BTC had just recovered from last week’s retest of the $100,000 level, reclaiming the key $106,800 area as support earlier this week. Daan Crypto Trades noted that the cryptocurrency “saw a clear trigger on that retest of the range high,” driven by the headlines of the Middle East turmoil, as it is “still quite a volatile and headline-driven market currently.” Bitcoin took the liquidity above and below its local price range, the analyst explained, adding that it is “already starting to trade more like the choppy (pre) summer environment” he had forecasted. Despite the drop, the analyst highlighted that the range high remains the key level for a larger move up: I think the range high is a key area for the Bulls to hold on to. If not, I think there’s a case to be made for a local high to be put in and for the market to move back further within this range. At this point, I’m fairly certain that if price breaks either the current monthly high or low, it will keep trending that direction for the rest of June (and possibly beyond). However, he suggested investors be cautious until BTC price breaks back above the range high convincingly and holds it as support on the higher timeframes. “Don’t chop yourself up in the next few weeks/months,” he warned. Volatility Could Send BTC To Range Lows Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show highlighted a potential double top pattern forming on BTC’s 4H chart, noting that if the price didn’t bounce from the previous descending resistance, reclaimed a week ago, it could further drop into the mid-zone of its range. According to the analysis, if it loses the mid-range, BTC could risk a retest of the range lows, around the $90,000-$92,000 area. Similarly, market watcher Merlijn The Trader suggested that Bitcoin could fill the lower CME gaps if the war narrative intensifies. BTC opened two CME gaps between the end of April and the start of May, situated at the $92,500 and $97,300 levels, respectively. Nonetheless, the trader considers that this could serve as a discount entry for investors, as BTC “already left higher CME gaps open,” signaling that a rebound to the levels is likely. Moreover, he noted that Bitcoin is displaying the same structure as last year, which could hint at a massive rally brewing. In 2024, the cryptocurrency faced rejection from a multi-month descending resistance following its all-time high (ATH) rally, which set the Range high level. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For Massive Run After $2,800 Reclaim – ‘Up Only’ Ahead? According to the post, after the liquidity grab, BTC broke out of the key downtrend line, was rejected from the range high, and retested the descending resistance as support before a new rally. In 2025, Bitcoin appears to be following this path, currently retesting the descending resistance after the breakout. “If you know the pattern, you know what comes next,” he concluded.

She warned of a potential volatility driven by rising funding rates without a significant price rally. The analysis, shared on June 11, highlights the growing risk conditions emerging within XRP’s ongoing consolidation phase. According to the post, XRP is nearing the apex of its macro consolidation zone, with price trading just above key support levels. Despite this support holding for now, funding rates are gradually rising without confirmation of any meaningful breakout. At the time of the analysis, the XRP perpetual futures funding rate had reached 0.01% per eight hours, a subtle but important metric suggesting increasing leverage on the long side. CasiTrades cautions that if funding continues to rise toward 0.02% or higher while price remains stagnant, a downside liquidity event becomes increasingly likely. XRP Funding Rising, While Prices Stall We’re just days away from the apex of #XRP ’s macro consolidation and price is hovering above support, while funding quietly climbs. That’s a dangerous combo. As of this morning, funding rates are ticking up to 0.01%/8h without any… pic.twitter.com/bjKCYk3PiZ — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 11, 2025 Support Levels at Risk as Liquidity Threatens Longs The core of the concern lies in the disparity between increasing open interest and flat price action. Algorithms and market makers closely monitor these conditions, and when long positions become overcrowded and under-protected, it often leads to a rapid downside move designed to flush leveraged positions. In such a scenario, XRP could test lower support levels. The chart attached by the analyst outlines $2.25 as a critical support zone. A failure to maintain that level would expose XRP to deeper pullbacks, with targets at $2.01, $1.90, and potentially $1.55. These levels align with key Fibonacci retracement zones and past liquidity pools, as shown on the 4-hour chart. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Wave 3 Outlook Remains Intact Despite Short-Term Threats CasiTrades does not present this potential drop as bearish in the broader context. Instead, the analysis suggests that such a liquidity sweep could generate the necessary momentum for a significant breakout in what appears to be an emerging Wave 3 of a larger Elliott Wave structure. The chart illustrates a projected wave path extending from current consolidation toward higher Fibonacci extensions, notably the 1.618 level at approximately $3.77, and ultimately targeting a wave (4) peak above $4.00. Technical Indicators Signal Caution Ahead While the market remains in a holding pattern, the analyst emphasizes that volatility is “nearly inevitable.” Whether this comes in the form of a final downward flush or a direct breakout from current levels, the implication is that XRP’s next major move could define the trajectory for the remainder of the summer. A potential bearish divergence was also noted in the RSI indicator on the lower panel of the chart, further supporting the case for caution in the near term. This divergence, coupled with rising funding and stagnant price movement, forms the technical basis for the warning issued. CasiTrades’ analysis reinforces the importance of closely monitoring funding rates, support levels, and market positioning in the days ahead.

Buffett, who plans on ending his legendary 60 year tenure at the end of 2025, has placed more than 70% of the firm’s assets into just seven stocks. The stocks reflect Buffett’s time-tested method of handpicking assets for their resilience and consumer appeal – while Berkshire continues to hoard a staggering $347.7 billion in cash. Here’s a look at where the Oracle of Omaha is placing his bets before the curtains on his legendary career close. • Apple ($58.9 billion allocated): Apple remains Berkshire’s top holding, although Buffett has sold more than half of the firm’s stake in the tech giant since 2023. • American Express ($43.6 billion allocated): A bet on the financial giant’s premium customer base and payment network. • Coca-Cola ($28.4 billion allocated): A longtime Buffett favorite with global brand recognition and consistent dividends. • Bank of America ($27.8 billion allocated): A top holding despite Buffett significantly trimming his stake and reducing bank investments overall. • Chevron ($17.3 billion allocated): An energy giant offering strong dividends, aligning with Buffett’s love for reliable cash flows. • Occidental Petroleum ($12.3 billion allocated): Buffett’s longstanding bet on energy continues with this oil and gas leader. • Kraft Heinz ($8.4 billion allocated): Another consumer goods giant and longtime Buffett favorite. Buffett has selected Greg Abel to be his successor next year, entrusting him to continue Berkshire’s legacy of prudent investing and long-term value creation.

A significant update from UBS, a major player in investment banking, has caught the attention of market watchers. UBS recently shared its view on the GBP/USD exchange rate , predicting a notable move towards the 1.38 level. This forecast offers valuable insights into potential shifts in the Forex forecast landscape, impacting not just traditional traders but also providing context for those navigating the interconnected financial ecosystem. What is the UBS Forecast for GBP/USD? UBS analysts have indicated their expectation that the GBP/USD pair will strengthen, targeting a move towards 1.38. This is not just a random guess but is based on their analysis of various economic indicators, central bank policies, and market sentiment surrounding both the British Pound (GBP) and the US Dollar (USD). A move from current levels towards 1.38 represents a significant appreciation for the Pound against the Dollar. Such forecasts from major institutions like UBS are closely watched because they can influence market expectations and trading strategies across the board. Why Does UBS See GBP/USD Moving Higher? Several factors likely underpin the UBS forecast for the GBP/USD pair. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone involved in currency trading or simply monitoring global economic health. Economic Outlook Differences: Analysts often compare the economic health and growth prospects of the UK and the US. Differences in GDP growth, employment figures, and consumer spending can influence currency strength. If UBS sees relative strength or improving prospects in the UK economy compared to the US, it could support a stronger Pound. Monetary Policy Divergence: The actions and forward guidance of the Bank of England (BoE) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) are paramount. Interest rate differentials and expectations about future rate hikes or cuts significantly impact currency valuations. If UBS anticipates the BoE maintaining a tighter policy stance or the Fed potentially easing sooner than expected, this could favor GBP over USD. Inflation Trends: Inflation levels and how central banks are responding to them play a critical role. Persistent inflation in the UK, requiring the BoE to keep rates higher for longer, while US inflation moderates more rapidly, could provide support for the Pound. Political Stability and Risk Appetite: Geopolitical events and political stability within the UK and the US also influence investor confidence and capital flows. A period of perceived stability or increased risk appetite globally can sometimes benefit currencies like the Pound. What Are the Implications of This Exchange Rate Forecast? For traders and investors, a forecast like the one from UBS has several implications: Trading Opportunities: Traders specializing in Forex might look for opportunities to buy GBP/USD, expecting the price to rise towards the 1.38 target. Hedging Strategies: Businesses or individuals with exposure to both currencies might adjust their hedging strategies based on the expected movement in the exchange rate . Portfolio Allocation: Investors with global portfolios might consider how this forecast impacts assets denominated in GBP or USD. Broader Market Sentiment: Currency movements can reflect underlying economic sentiment. A strengthening Pound against the Dollar might signal positive views on the UK economy or shifting expectations about US economic performance. Are There Challenges or Risks to the UBS Forecast? No forecast is guaranteed, and the path to 1.38 for GBP/USD faces potential hurdles. Market conditions are constantly evolving. Risks include: Unexpected shifts in central bank policy from either the BoE or the Fed. Release of economic data that contradicts the underlying assumptions of the forecast (e.g., weaker UK growth, stronger US inflation). Major geopolitical events that increase demand for safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar. Significant changes in global risk sentiment. Monitoring these factors is essential for anyone relying on the Forex forecast . Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Given the UBS forecast , what steps can market participants consider? Stay Informed: Keep track of key economic releases from both the UK and the US (inflation data, GDP reports, employment figures). Watch Central Bank Commentary: Pay close attention to speeches and statements from BoE and Fed officials. Their words often provide clues about future policy direction, which is critical for the exchange rate . Monitor Technical Levels: While fundamental analysis drives the forecast, technical analysis can help identify potential entry and exit points for trades. Look at charts for support and resistance levels around the 1.38 target. Manage Risk: If trading based on this forecast, use appropriate risk management tools like stop-loss orders. Consider the Broader Context: Understand how this specific currency forecast fits into the larger global macroeconomic picture and how it might indirectly affect other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Engaging in currency trading requires careful analysis and risk management. Conclusion: Navigating the Path to 1.38 The UBS forecast for GBP/USD targeting 1.38 highlights a potentially significant shift in this major currency pair. Driven by expectations around economic performance and central bank policies in the UK and US, this outlook provides a roadmap for traders and investors. While challenges exist, staying informed about economic data, central bank actions, and market sentiment will be key to navigating the potential move in the exchange rate . This specific Forex forecast from a reputable institution like UBS offers a valuable perspective in the complex world of global finance and currency trading .

For those in the cryptocurrency space, while focus often remains on digital assets, recognizing broader macro trends, particularly in the currency market , is crucial. These trends can indirectly influence investor sentiment and capital flows across various asset classes. A recent highlight gaining attention is the reiterated UBS forecast for the EUR/USD forecast pair, suggesting continued upward momentum. What is Driving the UBS EUR/USD Forecast? Major financial institutions like UBS employ extensive research teams to analyze a multitude of factors influencing currency valuations. Their positive outlook on the Euro US Dollar pair isn’t pulled from thin air; it’s based on a rigorous assessment of economic indicators, central bank policies, and geopolitical developments. Understanding these drivers is fundamental for anyone involved in Forex trading . Several core elements typically underpin a bullish view on EUR/USD: Monetary Policy Divergence: Central banks, specifically the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed), play a pivotal role. If UBS anticipates the ECB maintaining a relatively tighter stance or the Fed signaling potential easing sooner or more aggressively, this can strengthen the Euro against the Dollar. Interest rate differentials are a primary driver of short-to-medium term currency flows. Higher relative interest rates in the Eurozone would attract capital, boosting the Euro’s value. Conversely, expectations of Fed rate cuts tend to weaken the Dollar. Analyzing the nuances of their forward guidance and reaction functions to inflation and growth data is critical. Economic Performance: The relative health and growth trajectories of the Eurozone and US economies are key. If the Eurozone economy shows signs of resilience or improvement compared to the US, or vice versa, it impacts currency strength. Stronger economic data points, such as GDP growth, employment figures, and manufacturing indices, can bolster confidence in a currency. UBS’s analysis likely weighs these relative performances and their potential future paths. Inflation Dynamics: How inflation evolves in both regions is closely watched by central banks. If inflation proves stickier in the Eurozone than the US, or if disinflation proceeds faster in the US, it can influence policy expectations and thus currency valuations. Central banks are mandated to maintain price stability, and their actions to combat or manage inflation directly impact interest rate policy. Capital Flows and Investor Sentiment: Global risk sentiment and capital flows into or out of the Eurozone and US assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) can significantly impact the currency market . If global investors perceive greater opportunities or stability in the Eurozone, increased investment can drive up demand for the Euro. Geopolitical stability, trade relations, and overall market confidence all play a part in directing these flows. Fiscal Policies: Government spending, taxation, and debt levels in both the Eurozone member states and the US can also have an impact. Sustainable fiscal policies and manageable debt levels can enhance a country’s economic stability and currency appeal. Navigating the Currency Market: What Does This Mean for Traders? A positive EUR/USD forecast from a major institution like UBS provides a potential directional bias for traders. However, it’s not a guarantee. For those engaged in Forex trading , this outlook suggests considering strategies that benefit from a rising EUR/USD pair. This primarily involves taking long positions (buying Euro, selling Dollar). Here are some implications and considerations: Opportunity Identification: Traders might look for entry points to buy EUR/USD, perhaps on dips or pullbacks, anticipating the pair will trend higher towards targets potentially outlined by UBS. Risk Management: No forecast is infallible. Implementing robust risk management techniques, such as setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the market moves against the forecast, is paramount. Position sizing should also be carefully considered based on capital and risk tolerance. Confirmation with Other Analysis: Relying solely on one forecast is risky. Traders often combine institutional forecasts with their own technical and fundamental analysis. Looking for chart patterns, key support/resistance levels, and confirming economic data releases can strengthen a trading plan. Understanding Volatility: The Euro US Dollar pair is the most traded currency pair globally, known for its liquidity but also subject to significant volatility around major economic news releases and central bank announcements. Traders must be prepared for potential sharp movements. Understanding the potential benefits of a rising EUR/USD involves recognizing the profit potential from long positions. The challenge lies in timing entries and exits effectively and managing the inherent market volatility and the risk that the forecast may not materialize. Can the UBS Forecast Be Wrong? Exploring Challenges Absolutely. Even the most sophisticated models and experienced analysts can be incorrect. The future is inherently uncertain, and unforeseen events can rapidly alter market dynamics. Several factors could challenge or invalidate a bullish EUR/USD forecast : Unexpected Economic Data: A sudden downturn in Eurozone economic indicators or a surprisingly strong resurgence in US data could shift the narrative and central bank expectations. For example, persistently high US inflation could force the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, supporting the Dollar. Conversely, a sharp recession in the Eurozone would likely weaken the Euro. Central Bank Policy Shifts: Central banks might pivot faster or slower than anticipated based on evolving data. A hawkish surprise from the Fed or a dovish turn from the ECB would directly contradict the conditions favoring a stronger Euro. Geopolitical Shocks: Major global events, such as conflicts, political instability in key regions, or unexpected policy decisions by major economies, can trigger risk-off sentiment, often benefiting safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar, regardless of fundamental forecasts for pairs like the Euro US Dollar . Market Sentiment Swings: Broad shifts in investor confidence or risk appetite can override fundamental drivers in the short term. Therefore, while the UBS forecast provides a valuable perspective, it’s crucial for those involved in Forex trading to remain adaptable and monitor incoming information constantly. Actionable Insights for the Euro US Dollar Trader For those looking to potentially act on the UBS forecast for EUR/USD forecast , here are some actionable steps: Educate Yourself: Deepen your understanding of the economic factors driving the currency market , particularly those specific to the Eurozone and the US. Follow economic calendars and central bank communications closely. Develop a Trading Plan: Based on your own analysis, decide on potential entry and exit points, stop-loss levels, and profit targets. This plan should incorporate the potential upside suggested by UBS but also account for downside risks. Start Small (If New): If you are new to Forex trading , consider starting with a demo account or trading small position sizes to get comfortable with execution and market volatility before committing significant capital. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor news related to Eurozone and US economics, politics, and central bank statements. Be prepared to adjust your view or trading plan if the fundamental picture changes. Diversify: Do not put all your capital into one trade or currency pair. Diversification across different assets or trading strategies can help mitigate risk. Examples of how traders might use this information include setting limit orders to buy EUR/USD at a specific price level, or using technical indicators like moving averages or Fibonacci retracements to identify potential support areas where the price might bounce before moving higher, aligning with the UBS forecast . In Summary: Weighing the EUR/USD Outlook UBS’s continued positive stance on the EUR/USD forecast signals their conviction that underlying economic and policy factors favor further appreciation of the Euro against the US Dollar. This outlook is likely predicated on anticipated monetary policy paths, relative economic performance, and capital flow dynamics between the Eurozone and the US. For participants in the currency market , especially those engaged in Forex trading , this provides a potential directional cue. However, a forecast, even from a reputable institution, is not a certainty. The path of the Euro US Dollar pair will ultimately be determined by the complex interplay of real-time economic data, central bank actions, and global events. Traders should view such forecasts as one input among many, combining them with their own thorough analysis, rigorous risk management, and a flexible approach to navigate the inherent uncertainties of the financial markets. Whether you are directly trading Forex or simply monitoring macro trends from the crypto world, understanding the rationale behind forecasts like the UBS forecast for EUR/USD forecast offers valuable insight into the broader economic landscape.

This enhanced selling pressure transpired during the darkest hours of the global trade war started by US President Donald Trump. Although that political tension has improved a lot since then, with the US striking deals with many countries, including its main rival, China , there’s more uncertainty that has blown off in the past few days. This time, it’s a lot more harmful and has already taken many lives. Operation Rising Lion, launched by Israel on June 13, targeted more than 100 strategic military and nuclear sites in Iran, including facilities in Natanz and Fordow. The most recent reports suggest that the number of killed is nearing 100, which includes senior commanders and scientists, while the injured list is well above 300. Iran responded with Operation Vow of Truth 3, firing countless waves of missiles last night at central Israel, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and some targets north. The reported casualties are at least three, while dozens have been injured. While Israel and US President Trump categorized the initial strike as “ preemptive ,” aiming to disrupt Iran’s nuclear progress as the country refuses to sign such a deal, Tehran described its retaliation as defending its sovereignty against direct aggression. Impact on Bitcoin As it happened during the trade war, BTC’s price reacted immediately yesterday to Israel’s attack. In a matter of hours, it plunged from a daily peak of $108,500 to under $103,000. It has recovered some ground and now trades around $105,000, and it hasn’t been significantly influenced by Iran’s response. However, uncertainty persists, and the situation could escalate, potentially leading to further trouble. As such, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez warned that bitcoin needs to stay within a six-digit price territory; otherwise, it risks plummeting back to under $80,000. #Bitcoin $BTC needs to hold above $100,000 to stay on track for a breakout from this channel.

As reported earlier this week, some of the long-term BTC investors had started to dispose of small portions of their holdings, but that was even before the attacks occurred. Martinez noted after the first strike that some of the largest BTC whales—those with more than 1,000 bitcoins—have begun “trimming” their positions. If these sell-offs continue or intensify, they will not only increase the selling pressure on BTC but can also be mimicked by smaller investors.

Following last week’s market recovery from a correctional phase, which was majorly triggered by Bitcoin’s bounce, several altcoins with Aero regained strength and posted notable gains after 7 days of buying. Unfortunately, the buying cooled off due to a new sell order days back. That caused a serious reduction in the past days, and the market is now bleeding out again, following a negative sentiment. The bleeding came as a result of Bitcoin’s drops, and as we can see, it has shown no signs of stopping yet. However, altcoin like Aero defies the odds and is now posting gains on the day. It currently appears strong and shows signs of bullishness on the daily chart with a higher high and higher low pattern in the past months. The latest bullish signal is supported by the $0.47 level. If it continues to play out, we can expect a major increase in the coming days. Surpassing the previous high should validate a big price movement in the future. Inversely, if Aero fails to advance higher, a dip below last week’s low could trigger a fresh breakdown to the yearly low before deciding where to head next. For now, the market is still in favour of the bulls. AERO’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The immediate resistance level for buying right now is $0.8. If Aero breaks above it, the next line of resistance would be $1, along with the $1.5 resistance level. There’s room for a pullback at $0.56. If the price drops below the $0.47 support level, the next support to keep in mind would be $0.375.

While it enjoys widespread recognition, observers have noted that Dogecoin lacks substantial utility, relying instead on community support and social media hype. Enter Ruvi AI , a blockchain and AI-powered project that analysts believe could rival Dogecoin—not with memes, but with innovation and real-world use cases. With its AI-driven utility, structured growth model, and an impressive ongoing presale, Ruvi AI presents a compelling alternative for investors looking for significant returns without relying solely on hype. Why Analysts Are Comparing Ruvi AI to Dogecoin The comparison between Ruvi AI and Dogecoin is rooted in their potential to disrupt markets.

Ruvi AI, on the other hand, combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to deliver real-world applications that resonate across industries, making it more than just a speculative purchase. Ruvi AI offers an entry price of just $0.015 per token during its Phase 2 presale , providing early adopters a chance to secure tokens at a fraction of Dogecoin’s current price. What sets Ruvi AI apart is its practical utility, transparency, and built-in growth model. These features appeal to investors who are searching for sustainable and scalable projects rather than fleeting hype. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success and Future Valuation Ruvi AI’s presale numbers underscore its strong market appeal. The project has already raised over $1.7 million and sold 145 million tokens , demonstrating confidence in its strategy. After the presale, Ruvi AI will transition to a price of $0.07 per token , as outlined in its roadmap, and analysts project that this valuation could climb to $1 post-listing . This 66x ROI potential has caught the attention of savvy investors seeking explosive growth opportunities. Maximize Returns With Ruvi AI’s VIP Tiers Ruvi AI encourages early adoption through its VIP tier system , which substantially rewards participants with extra tokens. Here’s a summary of the investment tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These unparalleled bonuses help investors maximize their returns while Ruvi AI’s presale price remains accessible. Transparency and Security Through Strategic Actions Ruvi AI has taken significant steps to promote transparency and security , two areas where cryptocurrency projects often face skepticism. The platform is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a well-regarded blockchain security firm, to enhance investor confidence. This audit will verify Ruvi AI’s infrastructure, ensuring it adheres to industry standards and best practices. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange ensures global liquidity and seamless token trading for investors. This accessibility solidifies Ruvi AI’s reputation as a legitimate and scalable project in the crypto market. Real-World Applications Set Ruvi AI Apart Unlike Dogecoin, which has limited functionality outside of tipping and payments, Ruvi AI integrates AI technology to address challenges in multiple sectors, driving real impact.

Two of these appointments are experienced in digital assets, a move seen as a strong signal that the SEC is taking a friendlier approach to cryptocurrencies. As of June 17, Jamie Selway will assume the role of Director of the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets. On July 8, Brian T. Daly will begin as Director of the Division of Investment Management. Selway most recently worked as a partner at Sophron Advisors, where he advised on capital markets. He has previously advised a number of financial technology companies and served as global head of institutional markets at the Blockchain firm from 2018 to 2019. “Chairman Atkins is ushering in a ‘new day’ at the SEC. I thank him for entrusting me with the leadership of the Trading and Markets division during this exciting and critical time. We will support the SEC’s mission and drive innovation for the benefit of our investors,” Selway said in a statement.

His resume also includes experience in areas such as hedge funds and credit funds. Daly previously spoke to the Financial Times about the withdrawal of SAB 121 guidance implemented by the Biden administration, which required digital assets to be shown as liabilities on banks’ balance sheets. Daly said that this practice “makes it impossible for responsible banks, brokerages and financial intermediaries to provide crypto custody services,” adding that custody services are essential for financial institutions to provide crypto services. *This is not investment advice.

45985754,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746474,1749886200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45985754.jpeg,3 Altcoins Ready to Pop Before July – Summer’s Sleeper Picks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/3-altcoins-ready-to-pop-before-july-summers-sleeper-picks/,"Amid the heightened volatility in the crypto market, many cryptocurrencies have been experiencing wild swings in price. However, the storms present the perfect opportunity to find promising altcoins that could experience turbo-charged growth in the summer of 2025. The altcoins have the potential to deliver massive wins for holders. The most interesting of them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which analysts forecast could rise 2,765% after it goes live. Let us take a close look at the most promising altcoins of June 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) is a dog-themed meme coin that can be a fun diversion from the serious stakes in the crypto sector. However, it is still up by huge numbers in the past five years. Despite this, past success is not proof of future success with meme coins. Like all meme coins, it is always a toss-up whether DOGE will rise or fall. For more reliable and sustainable gains, you should opt for presale projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that have real prospects for growth. Sui (SUI) SUI is the native token of the Sui ecosystem, which was designed for fast speeds and low costs. It has made some technical achievements that aim to set it apart from leading blockchains. One of the main downsides to Sui is that it is prone to centralization due to its consensus mechanism. Another glaring problem is that Ethereum (ETH) already exists. Consequently, SUI will have a hard time trying to replace Ethereum when it comes to blockchain use cases. Nevertheless, holders can expect some potential gains when they add SUI to their portfolio. However, SUI is already trading at the top of its valuation. Consequently, a better alternative would be a project like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is still on the ground floor. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Real Gainer Of This Summer Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project powered by powerful technical prowess that aims to transform the Defi industry into the powerhouse it was meant to be. The project has at its core a powerful lending protocol and the native MUTM token. On Mutuum Finance (MUTM), users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. When they participate as lenders, they deposit their funds into an audited smart contract and start to earn interest. The interest rate they get on their assets is based on the pool utilization rate. To determine the utilization rate, the protocol measures the assets that are being actively borrowed in the pools against the total assets deposited in the pool. When the utilization rate rises, the interest rate rises, which encourages borrowers to pay back their loans. It also encourages lenders to deposit more funds in a pool, which raises the liquidity of the pool and lowers the interest rate. The Mutuum Finance lending protocol is thus designed to achieve perfect balance on its own, leading to optimal capital efficiency. Borrowers in the protocol can choose between stable and variable lending rates. When they pick the stable interest rates, they have the benefit of predictable repayments. How Liquidity Is Managed On Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Proper liquidity management is critical to the long-term success of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project. To start with, the protocol always vets assets that are added to the pools. That means that the team will first check the volatility, trading volume, liquidity, centralization, and the fidelity of its price data oracles. Depending on the outcome of the betting process, a token may be barred from the protocol to protect the liquidity of the platform, or it could be added in a restricted mode. For instance, some tokens may have a high level of centralization and poor blockchain design that could expose the protocol to infinite minting. That could quickly be used to siphon all liquidity from the pools. If the protocol detects any problems with a token’s price data, all activity for the token is stopped until the code can be carefully examined. This proactive approach will ensure that the protocol does not suffer any reputational damage that has been the death knell of so many protocols in the past. The team will also launch a bug bounty program as a protection measure. These programs will be open to all security experts and blockchain developers, giving them an opportunity to identify and report any vulnerabilities in the system. As such, it will ensure that at any moment, there are thousands of experts analyzing the code independently and nipping issues in the bud before they balloon into a problem. The MUTM Token Presale: Progress Update So far, over $10.6 million has been raised in the ongoing presale, from around 12,000 unique buyers. The token presale is in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. In the previous phase of the presale, the tokens were going for $0.025 and have since increased in price by 20%. The token presale has experienced an acceleration in the current phase, with over 35% of the tokens already sold barely two weeks after it began. One of the main catalysts for this fast pace is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway , where the team plans to give ten lucky winners $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. To participate in the giveaway, you only need to purchase at least $50 in the ongoing presale. A massive giveaway, coupled with the positive analysts’ forecasts for returns of over 2,700%, this is one presale you do not want to miss. MUTM tokens could be your biggest win of the current bull run.

It has been a year marked by new highs and extreme market volatility. Additionally, it has seen an increased rate of institutional adoption of crypto, with a major bank now planning to offer loans backed by crypto. With June promising to be yet another exciting year for crypto, here are the top three crypto picks you should choose. Amongst this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers some of the biggest returns of 2025. According to analysts, it could explode in price by 2,455%. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is a proof-of-stake blockchain built for fast speeds and low transaction costs. Unlike most other blockchain platforms, Cardano uses a peer-reviewed approach to development. One of the downsides of Cardano is that its peer-reviewed approach to development has sidelined most of the crypto industry. It has been slow to release upgrades, and it is too sophisticated for most people to understand. As such, Cardano (ADA) is forecast to grow solely compared to the rest of the crypto market. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM) is a project launched back in 2014 as a means of fast cross-border payments. It is used to facilitate transactions in different currencies quickly. Stellar (XLM) is intended to be a bridge currency between fiat and crypto. One of the main downsides of XLM is that there is no use case outside of cross-border payments. Its use case is also constrained in that it has not been able to compete with the legacy financial system. As such, it has remained a fringe service. For massive growth powered by utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be your best option. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a revolutionary DeFi ecosystem that aims to redefine the financial sector. The protocol is decentralized and non-custodial, and users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders can deposit their assets in the protocol to receive passive income as annual percentage yields, while borrowers can deposit overcollateralized collateral to get a loan. The percentage yield that lenders can earn from a pool is based on the pool utilization rate. Protocol Safeguards For Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has numerous protocol safeguards that are meant to protect all users, ensuring they can continue to make a profit. One of the safeguards is the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, which is a cap on how much users can borrow relative to the value of the collateral. For instance, if ADA has an LTV of 75%, it means that when a user pledges 1 ADA of collateral, they can borrow up to 0.75 ADA worth of a given asset. The effective LTV ratio is always fluctuating in line with the asset price. The other protocol safeguard is the liquidation trigger, which establishes a threshold at which a debt position is considered undercollateralized. If the borrowed amount surpasses the threshold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) considers it unsafe, and it is liquidated. A liquidation is carried out by liquidators, who acquire the collateral for a loan position at a discount. Their actions help to keep bad debt off the protocol and maintain overall ecosystem health. Once a position is liquidated, the borrower is charged a liquidation penalty, a portion of which goes to the treasury, while the rest goes to the liquidators. To determine how much liquidators and the treasury get, an allocation factor is used. It aims to balance between ensuring fast liquidations and protecting the long-term solvency of the ecosystem. Finally, there is a reserve factor, which collects a fraction of the borrower’s interest via the reserve factor. These funds go into an aggregate pool and offset potential defaults due to extreme market events. Tokens with a higher stability are often assigned a smaller reserve factor of around 10%, while those assets that are considered more unstable get a bigger reserve factor of up to 35%. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is currently in phase 5 of the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, over $10.55 million has been raised in the ongoing presale from around 12,000 unique buyers. The current phase of the presale is around two weeks old, and over 35% of the tokens reserved for the phase have already been sold. That signals a high level of participation, much faster than phase 1 when the tokens were going for $0.01. One of the biggest catalysts for this current phase of the presale is the ongoing giveaway. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $100,000 giveaway in which it plans to give away $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens to ten lucky winners each. To participate in this giveaway, all you need to do is participate in the presale with a minimum of $50. With the MUTM tokens expected to explode in price, coupled with this massive giveaway, there is no reason you should miss this opportunity. It could be one of your biggest in the crypto world in 2025, and beyond.

According to reports, the 73-year-old man was first contacted over the phone, with the scammers luring him into making investments in digital assets, presenting an enticing opportunity. However, things did not go as planned, as the elderly man fell into the hands of scammers, losing £14,500 to them. After a while, the man received a call from someone, claiming they could help him get his money back. According to authorities , the caller pretended to be from a genuine financial services company and told the man that they had already traced the funds he lost, noting that there was still a crypto account in his name. Elderly man loses £65k to crypto scammers According to the man, he was at an all-time low around when the representative from the financial services firm called him, highlighting that the caller, calling himself Gabriel, was ringing him nonstop, encouraging him to use their fraud recovery services. “He persistently chased me and chased me,” said the grandfather-of-three. “He even contacted me when I was on holiday in Gran Canaria.” The elderly man said after the calls became disturbing, he had to block the caller, but then, he was still able to contact him using another phone number. “I should have just hung up, but I didn’t. He sounded so professional, almost to the point of being totally arrogant. I ended up believing him,” the victim said. Eventually, the scammer was able to convince the man, pushing him to agree to use his company’s services to withdraw his lost funds, which he said were sitting in a crypto account untouched. However, things were not meant to be, because instead of helping the elderly man recover his lost funds, the crypto scammers carried out another elaborate scam that saw him send over £66,500 from his business account to them between December 2024 and January 2025. According to the victim, he was asked to make payments between £7,500 and £18,500 over three weeks before he could withdraw his funds from the crypto account. Gabriel mentioned that the payments were tied to anti-money laundering regulations and a failed verification process, among other lies he was fed. The elderly man said he received fake emails from a bank and crypto exchange, noting how far the scammers went to make their con appear legitimate. “He said I needed to do this and do that, and I said ‘I can’t keep sending money if you’re not giving me any back’,” the victim said. In January, he was asked to make a final payment of £7,500 and all of his funds will be released, making the first half in a day, and another half the next day. National Fraud Helpline solicitors recovered the funds According to the elderly man, he didn’t get the money on Friday, as promised by the criminals. He even waited to see if he would get it over the weekend, but nothing came. On Monday, the victim said he made a WhatsApp call to Gabriel, and that was when he realized he had been scammed. “So I sent them a message via WhatsApp , very short and sweet, and told him what I thought of him. Then I never heard anything else,” he said. The victim added that he had invested so much in the hopes that he would get his funds back, but didn’t. “I still get so upset about this. It was an extremely worrying time. Mentally, I was in a bit of a mess, but I couldn’t tell anybody from sheer embarrassment,” he added. He said he took out four loans to pay the scammer’s fees, noting that he promised an unsustainable monthly repayment plan totaling £1,250. He added that during his ordeal, his bank never queried any of the payments he made to the firm to check if it was a legitimate financial firm or not. However, luck smiled on him after he contacted the National Fraud Helpline solicitors to help recover his money from Co-Op Bank. NFH was able to recover all his funds, which have now been refunded. He said he was amazed when he got the call telling him about the good news. “I thought I’d lost the lot, I’d rearrange my finances and do what I could,” he said. “Then I saw about National Fraud Helpline solicitors and thought ‘I’ve got nothing to lose’.

He proposed using $100 million worth of ADA to strengthen stablecoin liquidity and bring Bitcoin into the Cardano DeFi ecosystem. Low Stablecoin Liquidity Holds Cardano Back He started off by pointing out that Cardano does not have enough stablecoin liquidity. There is only about $33 million in stablecoins supporting over $330 million in total value locked (TVL). In comparison, Ethereum and Solana have way more stablecoin support, and Cardano is falling behind. “We have a treasury with about $1.5 billion of ADA, and yet there’s only about $30 million of stablecoins in the entire Cardano ecosystem,” he said. “That’s a problem.” Cardano Decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund https://t.co/8RIELNl872 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 13, 2025 Hoskinson Proposes Bold Move- To fix this, Hoskinson is proposing a bold move: take 5–10% of the $1.2 billion Cardano treasury and convert it into a mix of native stablecoins like USDA, USDM, iUSD, and even some Bitcoin to help start Bitcoin-based DeFi on Cardano. The goal here is to generate yield from these assets like a sovereign wealth fund (like Norway or Abu Dhabi) and reinvest the profits back into ADA. This move could boost yields, improve liquidity, and speed up stablecoin adoption on Cardano. It may also help native stablecoins get listed on more exchanges and position Cardano as a strong player in the DeFi space. Will This Hurt ADA? Hoskinson believes that the $100 million move will not hurt ADA’s price. “Hundreds of millions of dollars of ADA change hands daily without visibly affecting the cryptocurrency’s price,” he said. He says that the market is strong and liquid enough to handle it, especially if done gradually using time-weighted average price algorithms and OTC trades. Governance in Progress Cardano is still figuring out how to handle governance. Charles wants the treasury fund plan ready for discussion at the Rare Evo Conference in August. He has already written a 40-page document outlining the idea and shared it with internal teams. Further, the team will gather feedback from Cardano’s DeFi projects and prepare a full proposal, possibly by the conference. Cardano Aims for Cross-Chain Growth and $1B Treasury Hoskinson says Cardano’s treasury will eventually become multi-asset. As more chains connect to Cardano, their fees could also flow into the treasury, building a large, diverse portfolio to support cross-chain growth. If the strategy works out, it could be a game-changer for Cardano. Stablecoin liquidity could rise to 33–40% of TVL, making the ecosystem much healthier. The treasury could grow to over $1 billion in stablecoins and Bitcoin. Cardano’s DeFi could become much more competitive on the global stage.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-14 07:38:57

The South African government does not consider crypto as a legal tender, but it is actively regulating the industry and recognizing it as a financial product. So far in 2025, its primary approach has been integrating crypto assets into existing financial frameworks rather than creating new legislation for digital assets. The government’s current priorities are: Evolution in the crypto landscape Enhancing the anti-money laundering compliance framework Integrating international standards in the country’s national system Fostering a secure environment for crypto regulations Crypto Tax in South Africa Is crypto taxable? Yes, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) treats cryptocurrencies as “assets of intangible nature,” which are subject to capital tax gains and income tax. Reporting and Penalties: All crypto losses and gains are required to be annually reported; non-compliance can lead to a penalty imposed by SARS. Transaction type Tax type/ Rate Details Long-term investment (capital) CGT up to 18% (on 40% of gain) Annual exclusion of 40,000 ZAR Frequent trading/ business income Income tax 18%-45% Taxed at the marginal rate Company gains Corporate tax 27% (on 80% of gains) Gains exceeding 40,000 ZAR credit Mining, staking, airdrops, DeFi Income tax 18%-45% Guidelines are evolving Buying/ holding/transferring crypto Exempted Not taxable Crypto License in South Africa Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) operating in South Africa are required to obtain a Financial Services Provider (FSP) license from the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA). Crypto assets were considered as financial products by the FSCA in 2019, and since then, the licensing has become mandatory. CASPs must register as “accountable institutions” with the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) under the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA). The licensing involves demonstrating compliance with regulations related to anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT). It requires strict adherence to Travel Ryle. Crypto Adoption Rate in South Africa Users rate: Approximately 10.49% of the internet users are using cryptocurrency, and it is expected to rise to 10.77% by 2026. South African crypto user estimates are expected to reach 7.05 million by 2026. Crypto Revenue: The current South African cryptocurrency market revenue is approximately US$615.5 million, with the average revenue per user expected to be US$90.7 in 2025. The revenue is growing annually at the rate of 3.63%, resulting in a total of US$637.9 million by 2026. Governments’ Crypto Holdings: No public disclosure yet; no evidence that the government owns crypto assets in official reserves. It rather focuses on private ownership and crypto market growth. Endnote In 2025, the South African government showed its support for blockchain and cryptocurrency through a complex regulatory framework. While the country does not consider crypto as a legal tender, it has legalized the trading of crypto as a legal financial product. The crypto regulatory agencies, such as SARB and FSCA, are moving towards a robust regulatory framework to create an enhanced crypto landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yes, crypto trading is legal in South Africa. The government actively regulates it as a financial product, and a recent court ruling clarified it’s not subject to strict exchange controls. Is South Africa crypto-friendly? South Africa is considered crypto-friendly due to its progressive regulatory framework that recognizes crypto as a financial product and aims to foster a secure environment for its growth. How is Crypto Taxed in South Africa? SARS treats crypto as “assets of intangible nature,” subjecting it to capital gains tax (up to 18% on 40% of gains, with an R40,000 annual exclusion) or income tax (18%-45%) depending on the transaction. Which government body handles crypto operations in South Africa?

That is a mind-boggling 337% increase from the $400 million it had at the start of the year, and it puts Hyperliquid firmly among the top DeFi protocols in terms of TVL. What this growth reflects, what it is sourcing itself from, is certainly the desire in the market for innovative DeFi infrastructure that commands the attention of developers and users alike. Hyperliquid’s total value locked now makes it a top DeFi protocol by that metric. 1/ Hyperliquid EVM has reached $1.7B in TVL, representing a 337% YTD increase from $400M. Breaking down the Hyperliquid ecosystem protocols leveraging programmable finance primitives: builder codes, auctions, and Hypercore/EVM composability, only possible on @Hyperliquidx : pic.twitter.com/JZZvcWzeyy — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) June 12, 2025 Hyperliquid is an ever-growing ecosystem that attracts a variety of projects. These projects develop new financial products and services, taking full advantage of Hyperliquid’s programmable architecture. There is a new surge in adoption that is resulting from this. More sophisticated DeFi building blocks are being demanded that go beyond what conventional smart contracts can deliver. Hyperliquid is a prime testing ground for what decentralized protocols can achieve. Innovative Protocols Powering the Ecosystem Hyperliquid’s success is built on a code architecture that allows protocols to do the kinds of things Hyperliquid needs them to do to succeed, like routing trades through Hypercore orderbooks, for instance. And this is quite modular; you could even say it’s a set of Lego bricks. So if you’re a protocol developer, or an orderbook developer, or mind-melding to do both, you can use it at varying levels of depth, like with good ol’ Lego. Pvptrade uses this same architecture, but through a Telegram bot interface, provides an accessible and innovative trading experience. Redacted similarly, Axiom Exchange has built a trading terminal that captures value by using Hyperliquid’s flexible infrastructure and providing users with an experience that is quite unlike that which is found at most other centralized exchanges. Another vital stroke of genius is the auction mechanism of HIP3, which currently resides in testnet, enabling builders to create bespoke markets with configurable fees not exceeding 50%. This framework has already pulled in dedicated projects like Hyperunit, testing leveraged equity products, and Ethena Labs, doing their work with USDe trading pairs. Allowing these sorts of structures and configurations is simply a giant leap in the path toward even more innovative DeFi applications catering to an ever-diverse set of trader needs. Cross-Layer Composability Unlocks New Financial Architectures One of the most groundbreaking features of Hyperliquid is the profound composability of the Hypercore and Hyperliquid EVM, which partake in the shared state of the protocol. This architecture allows reading and writing of data at the layer between the Hypercore and the Hyperliquid EVM with the same fluidity and coherence with which data is handled at the layer between two Hyperliquid EVMs. Why is that important? Because it permits seamless transactions that can span not merely multiple smart contracts but also multiple blocks. This composability’s power is demonstrated in several protocols already. Hyperlendx offers liquid perpetual positions by allowing users to borrow and lend against leveraged Hypercore positions. Felix Protocol extends capital efficiency by facilitating stablecoin borrowing against Hypercore positions. Liminal Money spotlights the cross-layer synergies available in the DeFi ecosystem. Liminal Money is an automated delta-neutral farming strategy. It operates from the EVM layer, accepting deposits in USDC. It interacts with Hypercore to do spot purchasing. And it uses the equivalent short positions to maintain market neutrality. You could say that Liminal Money is a dynamically layer-crossing strategy. But to be honest, it is also good practice to avoid buying the top and selling the bottom. The capabilities of builder codes, HIP3 auctions, and the composability of Hypercore/HyperEVM are enabling protocol architectures that, until now, were impossible within classical DeFi frameworks. Lending, options, liquid staking tokens (LSTs), and dApps are going to be integrated into an ecosystem where these primitives interact with Hypercore’s deep liquidity pools. The financial ecosystem that results from this integration will be both fully integrated and highly efficient. A borrowing and lending ecosystem doesn’t work if you can only borrow from one set of liquidity pools; it only works if you can borrow from many pools and many different kinds of lenders. Liquidity is the Cooper Union of financial investigations. Conclusion: Toward a Unified DeFi Financial System Decentralized finance has reached a new significant milestone with the rapid ascension of Hyperliquid EVM and its ecosystem. The rise of Hyperliquid EVM marks yet another step in the march of decentralized protocols toward providing programmable, permissionless, and composable financial services to all. What is happening around Hyperliquid EVM is no longer just an experiment; it is clearly a viable, real-world chapter in the DeFi universe. As adoption accelerates and fresh protocols appear, Hyperliquid is making itself into a base element of the pending next wave of DeFi innovation. The vision of a fully integrated financial system—where lending, trading, and asset management share liquidity layers and thus if not converge, then alternate seamlessly—is an emerging reality, one that with each passing day seems to promise to unlock new possibilities for traders, developers, and investors.

In the past few months, the asset has been stuck in a consolidation phase within a tight range between $2.1 and $2.4, with a few brief and unsuccessful breakout attempts in both directions. However, more recent data from Glassnode indicates that XRP is once again in the driver’s seat in terms of capital rotation, at least when compared to SOL, which could trigger a substantial shift in the narrative around the asset and potentially impact its price movements. Realized Cap Changes $XRP is pulling ahead again. Its 30D % change in Realized Cap just hit +4.2%, outpacing $SOL modest +1%. Capital is rotating faster into #XRP , hinting at stronger short-term conviction: https://t.co/cOSVts1PMm pic.twitter.com/W0eub7oGTe — glassnode (@glassnode) June 13, 2025 The analytics platform’s graph shows that XRP dominated SOL in terms of 30D Realized Cap changes until the end of March. At the beginning of that month, Ripple’s token flew past $3 briefly, and even though it corrected slightly in the following weeks, it still stood above $2.6-7 for the most part. However, then came the trade war escalation, and XRP’s price tumbled, alongside Glassnode’s metric. The situation changed briefly in early May as XRP was recovering from a plunge to $1.6 and returned above $2. SOL performed a lot better in the following month, but XRP has regained its lead in the past few days. Consequently, Glassnode determined that this growing capital rotation into XRP hints at “stronger short-term conviction.” Why So? The primary narrative supporting XRP’s improving position is the renewed hope for spot Ripple ETF approvals. Most recently, the SEC greenlighted a Nasdaq crypto US settlement price index, which included Ripple’s token. Many analysts believe this opened the door even more for an XRP ETF in the States. Polymarket’s current data shows a 89% chance for such a product to be approved in the US this year. Although SOL’s percentage is quite high as well, other experts noted that Ripple continues to expand its DeFi ecosystem, including the recent introduction of USDC on XRPL, which could further enhance its position. Additionally, some noted that XRP is holding better because capital “chases regulatory clarity and event-driven hype, while SOL’s bounce potential is hampered by recent drawdowns and meme rotation fatigue.” The post Ripple Is Pulling Ahead Again as Capital Is Rotating Fast Into XRP: What Does This Mean? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-14 07:51:47
45986710,https://nulltx.com/?p=150413,1749887553,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ethereum ETFs See Surging Demand as Inflows Hit Five Times the Weekly Average,https://nulltx.com/ethereum-etfs-see-surging-demand-as-inflows-hit-five-times-the-weekly-average/,"Demand for Ethereum-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is on the rise, and this may be a watershed moment for the largest altcoin to gain institutional adoption. Ethereum ETFs saw inflows of 154,000 ETH over the past week, which is five times their previous weekly average. If investors—including institutions—were not paying attention to Ethereum before now, they certainly are now. $ETH spot ETFs are heating up. This week alone, they’ve seen 154K #ETH in inflows – 5x higher than their recent weekly average. For context: the biggest single-day $ETH inflow this month was 77K #ETH on June 11th. pic.twitter.com/8Xlerbc6GX — glassnode (@glassnode) June 13, 2025 The standout moment was June 11, the day on which ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of ETH for the month, with 77,000 ETH poured in. Not only was the scale of the figure quite notable, but it also suggested something interesting: A rebalancing in the ETF world between Bitcoin and Ethereum. For the longest time, Bitcoin has been the ETF darling, with inflows flowing to the tune of tens of thousands of BTC. But suddenly, it looks like Ethereum has caught up quite nicely. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have not seen nearly the same level of reception. This week’s total of 7,800 BTC inflows—while somewhat above average—pales in comparison to the peak we saw in May, when daily inflows reached as high as 7,900 BTC on May 23. Though Bitcoin reigns as the dominant asset in the world of crypto investments, Ethereum’s recent performance hints at rising interest in its broader ecosystem and long-term utility. Ethereum Futures Open Interest Tops $20 Billion In a further show of strength for Ethereum, cash-margined ETH futures open interest hit a record high this week, sailing past 20 billion dollars. This development indicates an upsurge in not-so-subtle trading activity, and an uptick in trading that Ethereum is a Thriving market for futures and options trading that the platform Ethereum is a park for possibilities that is often seen as a precursor to the implementation of the shift to Ethereum 2.0. Open interest is rising, and that signals the traders are gearing up for future moves. More and more, those moves don’t seem to involve direct ownership of ether, and in fact, traders appear to be perfectly content gaining exposure via stablecoins and other collateralized forms of banking. This aligns with another trend: the rise of derivatives in crypto trading. These are becoming a key short-term market driver. The increase in leverage does not seem to be an isolated or speculative occurrence. The concurrent upsurge in ETF inflows indicates that both institutional investors in the Ethereum spot market and traders in the futures market who are using leverage have a high level of confidence in Ethereum’s performance in the near term. Bitcoin Maintains Stability But Loses the Spotlight Despite Ethereum’s explosion of activity, Bitcoin ETFs continue to perform, if not steadily, then without much drama. This week, the ETFs reported inflows of 7,800 BTC, which is just an eyebrow-raising number without the context of what it means. The context is that these inflows are pretty much the same as what we saw last week and the week before that, at least in terms of not having any kind of noticeable increases or decreases. $ETH futures open interest (cash-margined) just hit a new all-time high – topping $20B. Despite a slight pullback from the $2.8K levels, leverage continues to build as traders load up using stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/XP3KmhkdJ1 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 12, 2025 Certainly, Ethereum ETF potential chatter is way more exciting than anything directly linked to Bitcoin, but that doesn’t mean Bitcoin ETFs aren’t doing their own exciting things, at least in a sense that it’s almost as if they’re functioning like a stablecoin at this point. Bitcoin still commands the lion’s share of attention among traditional financial players, not surprisingly because it is the original and, by far, the most recognized cryptocurrency. That said, Ethereum’s wider and more dynamic range of use cases—something that spans decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and infrastructure for layer-2 solutions—seems to be grabbing the notice of institutions that are looking for an even broader base of exposure to blockchain applications. Inflow data may also show a difference between ETH and BTC because of the larger market cycles and portfolio strategies—part of the natural evolution of an investable asset. Bitcoin, having already undergone a significant rotation of capital earlier this year post-ETF approval, was already benefitting from a more apparent positioning by institutional investors. Meanwhile, Ethereum is apparently only starting to see this same effect and benefit. Conclusion: A New Phase for Ethereum on Wall Street The sharp increase in inflows into ETH ETFs, together with inflows into futures that are setting all-time records, indicates that Ethereum is generating interest among a diverse array of investors. Whether these investors want longer-term exposure via a spot ETF or to express a directional view using high-leverage futures contracts, Ethereum is emerging as a go-to asset for many. Although Bitcoin is still the foundation for getting exposure to the world of cryptocurrencies, it is becoming increasingly clear that Ethereum is the true value proposition. Institutional investors now understand that Ethereum is not simply a representative alternative to Bitcoin. This is partly because the regulatory situation for cryptocurrencies has improved, and products like Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have matured. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In just the last three months, the supply of stablecoins issued by American companies—such as USD Coin (USDC) and PayPal USD (PYUSD)—has more than doubled, up 104 percent, to reach a total market value of $67.5 billion. Offshore stablecoins still dominate, but U.S. growth is accelerating Over the past year, U.S.-based stablecoins like $USDC and $PYUSD have more than doubled in supply, growing +104% to $67.5B. Meanwhile, non-U.S. stablecoins, led by $USDT , $USDe , $DAI , and $USDS , showed more… pic.twitter.com/GGLHim43CA — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 12, 2025 This growth is in contrast with the moderate expansion seen among offshore jurisdiction stablecoins, which include the long-standing leaders Tether (USDT), Ethena’s USDe, MakerDAO’s DAI, and Stably’s USDS. These offshore stablecoins grew by 41 percent over the same period—still remarkable, but clearly not on par with the pace of growth seen among U.S. stablecoins. The numbers show a change in market dynamics. For most of the past decade, the stablecoin sector was dominated by non-U.S. issuers, who operated under very little regulatory oversight. But the past year has seen a recalibration of sorts, as U.S. issuers have found their footing and confidence in the rapidly evolving legal and compliance landscape. Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Confidence Drive U.S. Growth The recent surge in stablecoins based in the U.S. is closely linked to the growing clarity of the regulatory approach to digital assets. What is becoming clearer is that U.S. financial regulators expect firms to register with them and follow the rules. Lawmakers have also signaled that new legislation could be on the way to provide more guidance and cover for firms that seek to operate in the digital asset space. USDC from Circle has become a go-to option for organizations, fintechs, and DeFi apps that want a digital dollar that’s overseen and operates in a clear, trustworthy manner. Meanwhile, it’s important to note that PayPal’s own stablecoin—PYUSD—has managed to crank the dial up even further in terms of mainstream visibility and accessibility. A retail user can now also satisfy their on-chain dollar desire via PayPal. This trend is significant because it is happening at a time when stablecoins are assuming a greater role in the global payments landscape. From crypto exchanges to decentralized applications, having access to reliable, compliant, dollar-pegged assets is actually kind of crucial. And within this context, the digital asset space is exhibiting a pronounced preference for U.S.-based stablecoin issuers. These are deemed more secure and more regulated (even if the jury is still out on the overall regulatory framework). These stablecoins have seen a substantial increase in the pace of their supply growth. This not only shows us that more and more people are converting fiat into tokenized dollars, but also that these dollars are being actively used in DeFi applications. A large portion of this is likely being used in cross-border payments, which we know is one of the major use cases for stablecoins. Trading platforms are also a big part of this, as evidenced by the recent conversations around stablecoin market making. Offshore Stablecoins Still Lead, But the Gap Is Narrowing Even with the recent increase in stablecoins from the U.S., the global market is still largely in the hands of stablecoins from outside the U.S. Tether (USDT), which is mostly an outside-the-U.S. operation, still is the largest stablecoin by market cap and also by daily trading volume. It’s available on just about every exchange you can think of and is a go-to choice for a lot of users because of that and also because of its cross-border applications. Especially in emerging markets, USDT is a default choice. DAI and algorithmic models like USDe represent decentralized alternatives that give users opportunities to prioritize decentralization or sidestep regulatory scrutiny. Stablecoins issued from offshore jurisdictions, when taken in aggregate, represent the lion’s share of the total global supply of stablecoins. The gap is closing, though. Stablecoins based in the U.S. are growing at more than double the rate of their offshore counterparts. Market share is likely to shift further in the coming years. And if this trend continues, stablecoins issued in the U.S. could, in some sense, be as big as Tether. Slipping in market share as we go forward, Tether could become, in some context, a non-factor. How digital assets are regulated is an evolving story in the United States. This includes legislation around stablecoin reserves, that they should be backed by a currency, a commodity, or some combination thereof. The regulators want to know if the reserves are there when we say they are, and if the tokens are being issued in a way that is safe and sound. If we get to a place that is described in a way such that we think it is secure, then we think more capital could flow into U.S.-issued stablecoins. Although the U.S. may lag in the issuance of stablecoins, the U.S. stablecoin market is rapidly growing, and American stablecoins could play a significant role in the next phase of the digital currency ecosystem. Clearer regulation, stronger institutional demand, and surging adoption are propelling U.S. stablecoins to potential leadership in the next phase of the digital currency evolution. Non-U.S. stablecoins are in the lead today, but U.S. stablecoins are potentially next. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The pullback comes during a broader market correction that seems to be affecting speculative, tech-driven areas of the market, including blockchain-based AI projects. The sharp decline highlights how vulnerable the budding AI agent economy is to overall macro conditions and investor mood. The AI agent category—stocked with autonomous and semi-autonomous digital agents, living in decentralized environments—has enjoyed rapid growth over the past year, but it’s too early to say if that will continue. Of course, with any new technology segment, we can expect some volatility, but this feels like a big drop. $VIRTUAL Token Falls Nearly 11% But Holds Market Leadership The recent market turbulence has not spared the Virtuals ecosystem. The native $VIRTUAL token fell by 10.95%, bringing its current trading price to 1.8461 dollars. Despite this price correction, though, Virtuals still occupies a solid stronghold in the AI agent space, commanding a market cap of 1.21 billion dollars and 46.18% mindshare. Those figures are strong enough to maintain its position as the leading project in this sector. Virtuals Daily Update | June 13th, 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/2Z4rL70ERw — Graeme (@gkisokay) June 13, 2025 The Virtuals ecosystem now has a total valuation of $2.31 billion, which unfortunately reflects a decline of 7.79% over the past 24 hours. The figures are clearly down across the board. However, something positive emerged from this latest debacle: Our mindshare—percentage of sector-related activity and attention we command—actually ticked up 1.02%. That puts us at an all-time high in that metric. Even with the price falling, it looks like traders, developers, and users keep seeing Virtuals as a foundational platform in the AI agent economy. This growth in mindshare suggests that we are taking the current downturn in stride, seeing it as a temporary dip rather than a total rethink of the foundational prospects of the Virtuals ecosystem. Mindshare Milestone Reflects Strong Community and Ecosystem Growth A clear development—and a notable one at that—is the continued growth in mindshare for Virtuals. Mindshare might offer a clearer picture of the project’s resilience than price metrics alone. In tech markets, especially those as multifaceted as AI and blockchain, mindshare tends to precede market share and price recovery. It is significant that Virtuals managed to expand its influence in the discussion surrounding AI agents—even while its token slipped almost 11%—because it shows how tough their platform is. It shows how strong their community is and how much people believe in the perceived usefulness of the technology. Moreover, the toolkit of the Virtuals ecosystem is all but ensuring its hold as a top choice among developers and users. Decentralized AI agents, customizable virtual assistants, and identity layers native to Web3 are just a few of the tools that programmers can employ to create projects that can compete in an increasingly cluttered space. And as these projects vie for our attention, the mental space they occupy becomes a powerful indicator of which are the most likely to endure. Project users and backers are still urged to take part and broaden the ecosystem, and many are directly bringing in new users via the platform’s referral system, which you can access from app.virtuals.io/referral. Looking Ahead: A Short-Term Dip or a Long-Term Opportunity? Even though the statistics from June 13th may appear alarming at first, they are not viewed as such by astute analysts of the crypto and Web3 worlds, who see them for what they really are—corrections that happen all the time. For Virtuals, the token price slump is clearly not the whole story. The platform seems primed for a rebound; after all, with its decentralizing aura, all’s well in the Virtuals ecosystem. As the AI agent economy keeps growing and maturing, Virtuals remains a key entity to monitor. It offers infrastructure, community, and tools that go well beyond mere token speculation. Whether this current dip is just a temporary setback or the start of a longer consolidation phase is still unclear. But Virtuals seems to be holding steady and might even be expanding its influence as it moves through this storm. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

45986949,https://nulltx.com/?p=150410,1749887893,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Coinbase Adds Sonic (S) to Listing Roadmap, Signaling Major Leap for Emerging Blockchain Network",https://nulltx.com/coinbase-adds-sonic-s-to-listing-roadmap-signaling-major-leap-for-emerging-blockchain-network/,"In a development that could represent a major breakthrough for the nascent Sonic blockchain, Coinbase announced that it has placed Sonic’s native token, $S, on its roadmap for future token listings. But this isn’t just another potentially profitable coin that’s been added to the list of all the coins that Coinbase handles; this is a much bigger deal. Integrating $S into Coinbase’s infrastructure means integrating an entirely new blockchain network. In contrast to Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens or Solana’s SPL tokens, which Coinbase natively supports, integrating $S involves much more. When will we see $S in the Coinbase wallet? Currently, it isn’t in the roadmap for 2023. Adding it would require a full-stack integration of the entire Sonic network, which is much more than token support. This opens the possibility for including not just $S but also other Sonic-native assets, like $USDC, within the Coinbase platform. Expect that sometime after 2023. Why is getting $S listed on Coinbase such a big deal? Unlike ERC20 tokens from Ethereum or SPL tokens from Solana, getting $S on Sonic listed involves support of a totally new network. This network integration isn't a simple token listing, its a full stack integration that… — assistant.sonic (@SonicAssistant) June 13, 2025 This move shows that Coinbase is becoming more open to not just onboarding new tokens, but also new blockchains that could have a lot of potential. And it isn’t doing it for just any blockchain; it’s choosing ones that meet very strict criteria in terms of scalability, developer activity, and compliance—things that the Sonic network and its backers are surely hoping to be validated for. Key Advantages of the Coinbase Listing For the Sonic ecosystem, getting $S onto the Coinbase roadmap opens up a broad range of strategic opportunities, and it all has to do with how you access markets and how you build credibility in them. First off, Coinbase has awesome access: it’s a top place to trade for a massive audience, both in the U.S. and around the world, and that audience is a good mix of both retail and institutional investors. Maybe the more significant point about being on Coinbase is that and it makes available access to something called Coinbase Custody, which is a platform for institutional-grade custody of assets. It is something that 9 of the 12 Bitcoin ETF issuers use as their custody solution. If S continues to meet the compliance and regulatory requirements that these institutional players require, then it seems to me like there’s a pretty good shot at something approaching real institutional involvement. To be a constituent on Coinbase also bears an important signal that carries a certain level of compliance, security, and, most importantly, reputability. The tokens that are not only vetted but also make it onto the Coinbase exchange tend to be viewed as safer and more stable by not just retail investors but also institutional ones. And that is an important line for $S to have skated across. It carries with it the signals of safety and respectability that make it so much more likely that large, even public entities, could end up involved with that token. Furthermore, $S will gain from direct fiat onramps—users can purchase it with USD, EUR, and other key currencies. This substantially lessens the usual resistance to entry associated with newer ecosystems and allows for greater accessibility to Sonic by the average retail user who may have little knowledge of DeFi protocols or cross-chain swaps. Institutional and Retail Doors Swing Open for Sonic Sonic is also likely to become a much more attractive network for wallet providers, custodians, and institutional service firms, many of whom wait for signals from big platforms like Coinbase before extending support to new tokens, to do business with. And why is that? Because Coinbase lists that token. Compared with some other crypto exchanges, Coinbase’s involvement signals that a new network is a safe choice. The rapidly growing web3 wallet and DeFi-friendly product suite of Coinbase will soon provide native support for $S and Sonic’s related tokens, which will allow users to interact with Sonic’s decentralized infrastructure in a seamless manner. Sonic’s recent partnership with Coinbase marks a significant step for the scalable network toward mainstream relevance. For Sonic, this is more than just a tech integration. The network, which has been gaining traction among developers for its scalable architecture and user-friendly tools, is now about to find itself on a mega stage. With the credibility and exposure that Coinbase brings, $S and the broader Sonic ecosystem are positioned to attract many new participants, from institutional investors to retail traders. In the fast-changing crypto world, where being visible and trustworthy usually makes the difference between adoption and non-adoption, seeing Sonic included in the Coinbase listing roadmap could just be what Sonic needs to be taken seriously as a next-generation blockchain platform that plans to stick around for a while.

After about three years of construction and several months of operation, the team behind Solsniper said they can no longer sustainably run the platform and will be eliminating access to their NFT marketplace as of Friday. The announcement sent ripples through the Solana NFT community, largely because few people saw it coming. Solsniper set out 3.5 years ago to become a data and analytics tool for active NFT traders on Solana. The platform, however, has expanded quite a bit since then and now also offers a mobile application, serves as an NFT aggregator, and has a launchpad for new projects. And, Solsniper has an actual NFT marketplace, which it calls “full-fledged.” That said, the team and I are really excited for the next chapter of their story as Solsniper has increasingly found it difficult to sustain the marketplace operationally. “We were unable to run the NFT marketplace in a sustainable way,” the Solsniper team said in a statement. “We’re closing this chapter, but we are still on our journey.” Marketplace Shutdown, NFT Delisting, and User Refunds Solsniper is doing several things as part of the shutdown process to make sure the transition for its users goes smoothly. Effective immediately, any NFTs listed on the Sniper Marketplace will be delisted, and any active bids will be canceled. Thank you everyone for the last 3.5 years. We started Solsniper as an analytics tool for NFT traders and over the years we've built a mobile app, an NFT aggregator, as well as an NFT marketplace and launchpad. Unfortunately over the last year we have not been able to… — Solsniper (@solsniperxyz) June 12, 2025 Order and bid balances will be refunded directly to users’ wallets. Based on the platform’s announcement, there is no need for users to do anything. Solsniper provided the community with a continued assurance that all assets will be returned by June 13, 2025, at 12 PM PST, and that any issues arising afterward should be dealt with via support ticket in their Discord server. Many in the community regard this proactive approach to shutting down as a responsible, user-focused exit. In an industry where sudden closures often lead to lost assets or incomplete processes, Solsniper’s effort to ensure full refunds for users and a clear, transparent timeline has earned them praise—even in the midst of disappointment. The group further noted that they have kept the data of users who took part in their rewards leaderboard, and this may be used in any future reward programs the company decides to create. A Thank You to the NFT Community and Hints at Future Projects The end of the Solsniper marketplace marks the closing of a chapter, but the Solsniper team is not leaving the Web3 space altogether. In their farewell message, they extolled gratitude toward the NFT community for building and supporting their platform, saying, “Without NFTs, we wouldn’t be here today.” The team expressed gratitude to their users, “We’re grateful for your trust and support over the years. We don’t plan to stop building anytime soon and hope that you’ll continue to support us in future endeavors.” While not specifying what might come next, the message indicates that the Solsniper team plans to keep working in the still-broad blockchain or decentralized application space. If their next project is in that realm, they’ll be able to apply the lessons (or whatever they dream up to call them) from this chapter of their collaboration. Solsniper shutting down again reminds us how manageable yet volatile the NFT and Web3 space is. Even with innovation and growth apparent in the NFT space on Solana, operational sustainability is clearly a hurdle that a not-yet-overcome assembly of Solana NFT teams faces. Solsniper had community ties and was an apparently technically advanced platform; why was it unable to achieve the same kind of sustainable operational success that Magic Eden and Hey, NFT !? have? Solsniper’s cautionary tale will likely be remembered in the maturing Solana ecosystem for two reasons: It shows the not very distant downside of the financial strains of Web3 startups, and it can be seen as a testament to what responsible project management looks like in the often unpredictable world of Web3.

By 2028, SPX may achieve a peak price of $4.55 and an average trading price of $4.27. In 2031, the target price for SPX is between $6.83 and $7.40, with an average price of $7.12. SPX6900 (SPX) functions primarily on the Ethereum network. The token was created as a meme to entertain wider audiences. It has no real connection with stocks, equities, or securities. SPX6900 generates interest through spot trading, market speculation, or perpetual and leveraged trading, the latter are not recommended for non-professionals because of their high risk. Early users confess to its credibility and remarkable price performance; however, the meme token still holds the interest of many investors. Starting as a non-serious venture, the SPX6900 coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024. It was initiated as a useless token but ultimately ended up earning profits in the millions. For example, over a month, SPX earned up to 9000% of return following its ascent through September 2024. What’s next for the meme token SPX6900 in 2025 and beyond? Let’s get into the SPX6900 price prediction and technical analysis.

Investing in SPX necessitates an evaluation of the SPX6900 market and its emphasis on adaptability. Despite the earlier price spikes and enormous price gains, investors are advised to exercise caution on account of the market volatility of meme coins. Earnings from SPX require long-term investment decisions, whether holding or trading, but in this dynamic market, risk management is primarily achieved through diversification and keeping abreast of developments.

If buyers defend the immediate support levels and push the price above the Fib channels, a recovery can be initiated. Will SPX6900 reach $2? SPX6900 may reach $2 in 2026. With the current price action, this seems quite possible, as the token is trending near $1. Will SPX6900 reach $3? Per SPX6900 price prediction, SPX has a chance of reaching $3 by 2027 if positive sentiment prevails. Will SPX6900 reach $5? To reach $5, SPX’s value will have to increase sixfold. Though not impossible, there are chances of reaching this level by 2029. Does SPX6900 have a good long-term future? Long-term forecasts suggest a gradual increase in the value of SPX6900 over the next two years. Following this period, projections anticipate sustained upward price movement with a potential resurgence in 2029. By 2031, SPX6900 is expected to trade above $7, solidifying its position as a valuable long-term asset. Recent news/opinions on SPX6900 On May 29, 2025, SPX6900 broke through $1 billion in market cap, flipping WIF and FLOKI. On June 1, it stands at the 77th position, just below PayPal USD and GRT, with a market cap of $886.67 million. https://twitter.com/SPX6900aeons/status/1928043529940463711 Some of the crypto influencers are bullish on SPX6900, like MustStopMurad, ApeToshi Aeon, and Maddox, a bestselling author and blogger known for “The Best Page in Universe” and tech stuff. On 28th May, Murad shared a post highlighting the community behind SPX6900’s success, and recently Maddox shared a video along the same lines.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $$104,232.70 and $106,203.76 today. Table of Contents Story Highlights Bitcoin Price Today CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 Bitcoin Crypto Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 BTC Price Forecast 2026 BTC Price Prediction 2027 Bitcoin Predictions 2028 BTC Price 2029 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2030 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Bitcoin Prediction: Analysts and Influencer’s BTC Price Target FAQs Bitcoin Price Today Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $ 104,952.20364289 -0.22% Market cap $ 2,086,239,904,013.42 Circulating Supply 19,878,000.00 Trading Volume $ 49,405,884,751.4169 All-time high $109,114.88 on 20th January 2025 All-time low $0.04865 on 15th July 2010 CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Firstly, at CoinPedia, we feel optimistic about Bitcoin’s price increase. Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2, especially in April and May 2025. Bitcoin saw a strong and steady rally, driven by easing trade war tensions, pushing the price to a new all-time high of $ 112 K. Now, the question remains, Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June?. In early June, BTC is trying to hold support near the previous swing low of May after pulling back from its peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks sparked a short-term bounce from the 50-day EMA’s dynamic support. But on June 10th, momentum was halted, linked directly to rising geopolitical tensions, especially between Israel and Iran . However, Bitcoin is still facing resistance from a multi-month supply block, and is once again inching towards support near the previous swing low of May. if bearish pressure increases, the swing support zone becomes critical. A breakdown below this level could drag the price down to the $100K–$95K range in the near term. On the flip side, if it reverses from the swing support zone and manages to break June’s swing high, then the odds of clearing $112K are possible, and above this level, a certain strong momentum could take BTC price to a new high towards $120K by the end of June. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC.

According to an official statement from the firm, it acquired 10,387 HYPE tokens, which priced out at an average of $42.24 each, for a nearly $438,828 total investment. The transaction was executed via WonderFi Technologies, a digital asset platform regulated in Canada, that marks a compliant and carefully structured entry point into the decentralized trading world. For Tony G Co-Investment Holdings, this was not just a compliant entry point; it was an expression of support for next-generation blockchain infrastructure. I would say that our sorry trio represents Canada quite well. LATEST: Tony G Co-Investment Holdings purchases 10,387 $HYPE tokens worth around $438,829 as part of its long-term digital asset strategy. pic.twitter.com/IhzdZ9deO1 — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) June 13, 2025 The HyperLiquid platform, which is the basis for HYPE, is constructing a truly impressive blockchain. HyperLiquid is a high-performance infrastructure that is specifically designed to scale decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. And with DeFi still early in its evolution, HyperLiquid’s engineers are betting that the DeFi space is going to need lots of liquidity (and trading). If they are right, and if these engineers deliver on their vision, an impressive virtual ocean of liquidity is going to materialize in the blockchain space. 加拿大上市公司Tony G Co-Investment Holdings购入约44万美元的HYPE代币 据官方消息，加拿大上市投资公司Tony G Co-Investment Holdings宣布以均价42.24美元购入10,387枚HyperLiquid平台原生代币HYPE，总价值438,828美元。 此次收购通过加拿大合规数字资产平台WonderFi… pic.twitter.com/XLNjpE7McF — PANews (@PANewsCN) June 13, 2025 Tony G’s Growing Interest in Digital Asset Innovation This first marks the HyperLiquid ecosystem’s public interaction with the HyperLiquid ecosystem. If anything, it further solidifies HyperLiquid’s deep liquidity as a DeFi platform. It makes sense then that Tony G Co-Invest Investment Holdings makes direct and focused bets with decentralized finance. Known for their broad and innovative investment strategies, they are actualizing moves within the blockchain space—all good signs for the HyperLiquid community. The HYPE token purchase is part of a broader strategic initiative, said company leadership, to allocate capital to the kinds of basic infrastructure projects that create a solid foundation for the crypto industry. As for why the company even went public with the HyperLiquid investment, its CEO said something related to the investment’s significance for their company and the kind of DeFi space they wish to embrace. That institutional investors are seeking to blend innovation with the compliance of existing financial standards is underscored by the fact that they facilitated the trade through WonderFi, a regulated platform. This path that the trade took may—along with the use of well-known counterparties—be a signal from institutional investors to their peers that the move into decentralized finance (DeFi) can be undertaken with due regard for safety and soundness. HyperLiquid: A Rising Star in DeFi Infrastructure Established to accelerate the decentralized trading movement, HyperLiquid is gaining notice as a blockchain infrastructure project whose technical innovations and developer-friendly architecture make it a fast, cheap, and—increasingly vital—as DeFi scales, a performant place for makers and takers to do business. Within the HyperLiquid ecosystem, the HYPE token serves as the native asset. It is used for governance, staking, and funding network operations. The project has seen substantial capital inflows from institutional investors like Tony G Co-Investment Holdings. This impressive backing is likely to lure even more retail and institutional market participants to further engage with HyperLiquid. Furthermore, this investment might herald even larger moves ahead. Analysts point out that Tony G’s capital deployment, when considered in relative terms, is pretty modest. But it might well be the first of many strategic moves he makes into DeFi projects. “We’re seeing more and more institutional investors dip their toes into the space in a compliant, controlled manner,” a Toronto-based blockchain analyst tells me. “This isn’t just about buying tokens—it’s about understanding and shaping the infrastructure of the next financial era.” The decentralized finance sector is maturing, and as it does, we are increasingly getting a sense of what it will look like when everything sorts out and the crypto world finds its regulatory footing. Moves like this one from Tony G may become the norm rather than the exception. For now, this investment—$440,000—in HYPE represents a meaningful and very traditional-seeming vote of confidence in HyperLiquid and in the potential of DeFi to remodel the financial world.

The announcement, which came just hours after the company’s stock crashed 66% during pre-market trading, has sent ripples through the financial and crypto communities. SharpLink stands now as one of the most significant corporate holders of ETH. Comparisons have been immediately drawn between SharpLink and MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin in 2020 and 2021. Even though the earlier collapse of SharpLink’s share price was eyebrow-raising, their ETH acquisition should be taken seriously. For one thing, it adds an intriguing twist to SharpLink’s long-term strategy to transform itself into a player in the digital assets space. Observers have noted that the timing of the acquisition—in the same week that SharpLink’s stock was getting docked for perceived shortcomings—might just be an instance of management trying to shore up an under-heralded story. Or it might just be an instance, as we often see in crypto, of centralization (hi, holding 38 million ETH!) breeding a not very good idea (hi, trying to be a player in a decentralized space). A Billion-Dollar War Chest and More ETH Likely on the Way SharpLink’s move is growing even more significant when viewed in the broader context of what the company is doing. SharpLink is currently in the process of raising a $1 billion funding round. It has already deployed into Ethereum nearly half of that total. Still, with over $500 million to play with, it could shift even more capital into expanding its Ethereum holdings. The Microstrategy moment for Ethereum has finally happened. Just now, SharpLink Gaming has announced an acquisition of 176,271 ETH worth $463 million. Interestingly, SharpLink Gaming crashed today 66% in pre-market and now they have come up with an announcement. Don't forget… pic.twitter.com/DR6Hlv2EdT — Cipher X (@Cipher2X) June 13, 2025 Speculation has now begun among analysts as to whether this is just the first step in a multi-phase acquisition strategy. If Ethereum’s price rises to the $2,800-$3,000 range over the next few weeks, as many bullish traders anticipate, it could well validate SharpLink’s gamble and maybe even kick off a broader trend among mid-cap tech companies to look for alternative reserve assets. SharpLink’s somewhat less publicized ETH play still has the potential to set off a second wave of institutional crypto accumulation. SharpLink might be too small a player in the Ethereum space for its investment to truly impact the trajectory of institutions accumulating ETH, but if it were to somehow wind up with either an obscene amount of ETH or some Ethereum-based technology, it could potentially affect the accumulation curve. This development also raises questions about SharpLink’s long-term intentions. Is the company pivoting toward a become Ethereum-centric financial entity, or is this simply a high-risk, high-reward treasury strategy to recover from market realities? As of now, the firm hasn’t put any bigger plans on the table, but its ETH buying spree suggests a strong conviction in Ethereum’s viability as a future fine tech. A Turning Point for Corporate Crypto Strategy? SharpLink’s shift might signal a fresh new look at an overarching crypto strategy among corporates—one that stretches beyond Bitcoin. Up until now, Bitcoin has largely dominated institutional treasuries, thanks to its perceived “digital gold” status and its first-mover advantage. But now, Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance, smart contracts, and emerging “Web3” technologies have more and more institutions looking its way. Following SharpLink’s buy-in, if Ethereum’s price were to appreciate considerably, other companies might start seeing ETH as more than just an asset for speculation, but rather as a serious component of a well-diversified corporate treasury. This could have some pretty earth-shattering effects on Ethereum—more corporate procurement, for one thing, makes ETH less available and more desirable, and that can take price appreciation not just to new highs but also into the next bull cycle. The speculation has already started in the market over which companies might follow the lead of SharpLink. Prospective candidates range from tech startups with loaded balance sheets to gaming firms, to fintechs. The door has now been opened for Ethereum to play a much larger and more impactful role in corporate finance strategies. Similarly to MicroStrategy’s experience with Bitcoin, SharpLink’s Ethereum investment will ultimately play out based on three factors: execution, timing, and market conditions. But one thing is certain: the game has changed, and Ethereum just had its “MicroStrategy moment.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Many altcoins have started to recover from the Friday crash, including HYPE, which has risen back above $42. BTC Calm Despite Attacks The business week started on the right foot for BTC as the asset broke out of last weekend’s consolidation range and shot above $110,000 on Monday. Although it was stopped there, it managed to remain close to that level for the next couple of days. More positive news emerged on Wednesday, including a trade deal between the US and China as well as better-than-expected CPI data, but BTC failed to maintain its run. Just the opposite, it lost some ground and went back down to under $107,000. The bulls took it north to $108,500 on Thursday, but the geopolitical tension in the Middle East skyrocketed that night as Israel fired countless missiles against Iran, killing over 70 people in the process. Bitcoin’s prices reacted immediately with a price plunge that drove it south by over five grand since Thursday’s peak to under $103,000. Nevertheless, it recovered some ground on Friday and even challenged $106,000 at one point. It couldn’t breach that level but still trades above $105,000 now, which is somewhat surprising as Iran retaliated against Israel last night. Still, there are some warning signs about its future price trajectory if it fails to remain above $100,000. For now, though, its market cap has jumped to almost $2.1 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is at 61.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Rebound Most altcoins suffered yesterday but are with minor gains on a daily scale. Ethereum has returned above $2,500 after a small increase, while Ripple’s cross-border token has defended the $2.15 support. SOL, DOGE, ADA, and AVAX are also slightly in the green, while BCH and SHIB have posted more impressive gains. However, HYPE has stolen the show once again from the larger-cap alts, having surged by almost 8%. As a result, the asset now trades close to its all-time high of roughly $43. Other notable gainers from the past day include WBT, Fartcoin, PI, and ICP. The total crypto market cap has recovered over $60 billion and is back to $3.4 trillion on CG.

In a tweet that included an excerpt from a published academic or policy-oriented text, SMQKE highlighted a quote stating: “XRP is not just an asset, but a switch that modulates the XRP Ledger.” The excerpt provided by SMQKE delves into the integral role XRP plays in the XRP Ledger’s operational structure and the complex dynamics that surround it. XRP as a Required Component for Ledger Interaction The text, likely from an industry analysis, positions XRP at the center of a multi-faceted system. It points out that to activate an account on the XRP Ledger and participate in the distributed currency exchange, users must hold XRP in reserve, open a trust line, and issue offers. This requirement effectively makes XRP a necessary component for activity on the ledger, functioning as more than a store of value or speculative asset. In this sense, the description of XRP as a “switch” speaks to its technical necessity in initializing and maintaining functions within the ledger’s ecosystem. XRP IS NOT JUST AN ASSET—ITS A SWITCH THAT MODULATES THE XRP LEDGER This is documented. https://t.co/xP9VOrWISP pic.twitter.com/OnHIxjuaeg — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 11, 2025 Competing Interests in the XRP Ecosystem The passage goes on to highlight the competing interests among various user groups within the system. LETS (Local Exchange Trading Systems) supporters, according to the text, prefer XRP to be inexpensive to minimize the cost of opening trust lines and conducting transactions. Traders, in contrast, benefit from price volatility, which creates arbitrage opportunities. Meanwhile, payment providers seek price stability to reduce exchange rate risk when using XRP as a bridge asset for cross-currency transfers. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Escrow Strategy and Shifting User Base The excerpt also notes Ripple’s strategic response to these tensions. In 2017, Ripple locked 55 billion XRP into a cryptographically secured escrow account , with a mechanism to release only 1 billion XRP per month . This measure was designed to assure market participants that XRP’s supply would remain predictable and controlled, thus attempting to address concerns from various stakeholders who relied on the token in different capacities. SMQKE’s tweet underscores that this operational role of XRP is not speculative but supported by documentation. The phrase “switch that modulates the XRP Ledger” carries specific technical implications, suggesting that XRP functions not just as a token but operates as a prerequisite mechanism within the ledger’s infrastructure. This statement offers a different perspective than viewing XRP purely through the lens of its market price or liquidity profile.

As the market gears up for the next big wave, AGNT stands out with potential. This coin is setting the stage to move ahead of favorites like PEPE, SHIB, and BONK by 2025. The craze continues to grow as investors search for the next major break. In the buzzing crypto sphere, a fresh face emerges with high hopes. Codename:Pepe tackles the clutter of fake AI promises, aiming to guide users through meme coin chaos. It draws inspiration from legends like PEPE, offering a chance for involvement through a secretive community-driven approach. The race is on; this might be a game-changer. Codename:Pepe Unleashes True Intelligence for Maximum Profits The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents—shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Codename:Pepe has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is actually doing something useful: helping you make money in the chaotic meme coin jungle. Codename:Pepe is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: The True Identity of Codename:Pepe Keep this under wraps: Codename:Pepe is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Codename:Pepe Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Codename:Pepe is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Codename:Pepe Mission Explained Codename:Pepe plans to use the power of artificial intelligence to hunt down the juiciest meme coins, predict market trends, and deliver exclusive AI-powered trading signals before the FOMO kicks in. Beyond smart analysis, this genius agent will also trade for you with its fully automated AI-trader, turning those signals into sweet gains. Every great agent needs an elite organization backing them. That’s where $AGNT comes in. Holding $AGNT unlocks membership in a top-secret DAO, where operatives (investors) gain access to classified strategies, insider analytics, and the ability to vote on high-stakes missions. Holding $AGNT will unlock: Membership in a top-secret DAO Access to classified strategies Insider analytics Ability to vote on high-stakes missions Profits from the mutual DAO fund will be allocated to those who stake their $AGNT, ensuring the spoils of the trade go to the most loyal agents. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Codename:Pepe isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Early for a Bigger Discount Pepe (PEPE) Shows Signs of Potential Recovery Amid Market Fluctuations Pepe (PEPE) is trading between $0.00001038 and $0.00001296. After a period of volatility, the coin is stabilizing within this range. The recent price movements suggest that PEPE is finding its footing in the market. In the past week, PEPE's price has risen by 4.61%. This uptick indicates a possible short-term uptrend. However, over the last month, the coin's value has decreased by 9.11%. Looking at the six-month data, PEPE has dropped by 50.01%, highlighting a significant long-term decline. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.56. This level suggests that PEPE is neither overbought nor oversold. The nearest resistance is at $0.00001424. Breaking above this point could lead to further gains. The nearest support is at $0.00000909. Falling below this level might result in additional losses. Based on the current data, PEPE may be poised for a gradual recovery. If the price moves past the resistance level, it could see an increase of over 10%. Conversely, if it dips below the support level, the price might decrease by around 15%. Traders are watching these levels closely to anticipate PEPE's next move. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Tests Critical Price Levels Shiba Inu's price is currently between $0.00001178 and $0.00001333. This range shows a period of consolidation as traders watch for the next move. The coin is approaching a key resistance level at $0.00001416. Breaking this level could determine its short-term direction. If SHIB rises above the $0.00001416 resistance, it might start a bullish trend. This could lead to a price increase of about 6% to 8% from its current position. Such a move might attract more investors and increase market momentum. On the other hand, if the price can't overcome the resistance, it may fall toward the nearest support at $0.00001107. This drop would be around 15% to 17%. Traders should keep an eye on these levels. Overall, SHIB's recent performance suggests it's at a crossroads. The upcoming moves toward resistance or support will be crucial. A clear direction could set the tone for the coming weeks. BONK Shows 4.65% Recovery Bonk (BONK) is currently trading between $0.00001390 and $0.00001788. Recent movements have caught the eye of many in the crypto community. In the past week, BONK's price has risen by 4.65%, showing a slight uptick. However, over the last month, it has dropped by 27.74%. Looking back six months, the price has decreased by 57.66%. This long-term decline indicates significant downward pressure. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00001998. If BONK breaks above this point, it could signal a potential move upward. The closest support level is at $0.00001202. Falling below this may lead to further declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 35.85. An RSI below 30 often suggests that an asset is oversold. Since BONK's RSI is approaching this mark, it might indicate that the coin is nearing a point where buyers could become more interested. Conclusion In conclusion, while PEPE, SHIB, and BONK have gained attention in the meme coin market, their short-term potential appears limited compared to AGNT. AGNT, known as Codename:Pepe crypto, brings genuine artificial intelligence to the table, aiming to maximize profits in the chaotic meme coin arena.

Hold Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) and Get Ahead of the Market with Early Signals From Meme to Mainstream: The Rise of Shiba Inu Shiba Inu started in 2020 as a meme coin aiming to ride the wave of Dogecoin's popularity. It quickly gained traction, catching the attention of high-profile figures like Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk. Built on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-20 standard, SHIB was initially a simple token for payment and investment purposes. As its popularity soared, the creators expanded SHIB's ecosystem. They launched a decentralized exchange and introduced an NFT project, attracting even more users. These developments helped Shiba Inu stand out from other meme coins by offering real utility beyond being a digital joke. The token experienced a meteoric rise in its early days but later settled into a more stable price range. Despite volatility, the community remained active, and the project continued to grow. New initiatives like a metaverse, games, and merchandise were introduced, laying the groundwork for future expansion. Shiba Inu's market position strengthened over time, reflecting its dedicated community and evolving ecosystem. The infrastructure built around SHIB suggests potential for growth, especially if external factors like a crypto bull market come into play. New users entering the crypto space might find SHIB's products appealing, possibly driving increased adoption. While predicting exact price movements is challenging, some analysts believe that technical indicators point toward a positive outlook for Shiba Inu. The token's ability to differentiate itself and evolve may play a crucial role in its long-term prospects. As the crypto landscape changes, SHIB's continued innovation could make it an attractive option for investors and enthusiasts alike. PEPE Coin's Leap: Is the Meme Coin Set for a Big Future? Matt Furie's cartoon frog, Pepe, became an internet hit in the early 2000s. This meme inspired PEPE Coin, a deflationary token on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. Embracing its playful origins, PEPE focuses on simplicity and community. PEPE Coin's goals are clear: Phase 1 is the meme, Phase 2 is vibe and HODL, and Phase 3 is meme takeover. It avoids complicated promises, staying true to its fun roots. The strong community and transparency set it apart. In December 2024, PEPE hit an all-time high of $0.00002825 before dropping about 68%. This was likely due to investors taking profits. Such swings are common in crypto, especially with meme coins. PEPE's future depends on market sentiment. Some experts are bullish. Valdrin Tahiri predicts a ""meme coin season"" could lift PEPE. Others, like Steven Walgenbach, warn that selling pressure may continue. Long-term predictions vary. By 2025, PEPE could reach between $0.000014 and $0.000055. Estimates for 2030 range from $0.00003015 to $0.000159. These predictions show the potential many see in PEPE. Conclusion In conclusion, coins like SHIB and PEPE have seen significant growth but may offer less immediate potential in the current market surge. Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a compelling alternative, aiming to deliver maximum profits through genuine intelligence powered by advanced AI. By utilizing AI to identify promising meme coins and predict market trends, Codename:Pepe crypto sets itself apart. Its community-driven approach, capped token supply, and exclusive features like a top-secret DAO membership position it as a noteworthy contender in the ongoing bull run.

Recently, a significant development caught the attention of market watchers: Meta’s substantial investment in the AI data-labeling space. This move, alongside intriguing shifts in the public offering landscape, offers key insights for anyone tracking the pulse of innovation and investment. The Bitcoin World Equity podcast recently delved into these topics, providing a deep dive into what these developments signal for the future. Meta AI Investment: A Bold Move in the AI Race? Meta Platforms has reportedly made a significant Meta AI Investment , committing a substantial $14.3 billion to Scale AI, a leader in data labeling. However, this isn’t a straightforward acquisition. Meta is taking a 49% stake in the company and bringing Scale AI’s co-founder, Alexandr Wang, onto their team. This strategic partial ownership and talent acquisition highlight Meta’s urgency to accelerate its position in the competitive artificial intelligence landscape. The move signals Meta’s determination to keep pace with AI heavyweights like OpenAI and Google, although the exact strategy for leveraging this investment remains a subject of discussion. The Equity podcast hosts explored whether this Scale AI Deal represents a genuine game-changer for Meta’s AI capabilities or if it’s primarily aimed at adding a well-connected figure like Wang to their ranks at a time when Meta’s internal AI progress faces scrutiny. Navigating the Fintech IPO Market Beyond the realm of artificial intelligence, the financial technology sector continues to see activity in the public markets. The discussion turned to the Fintech IPO Market , specifically examining recent performance. A notable example is Chime’s initial public offering, which reportedly priced above initial expectations at $27 per share and saw a positive jump in early trading. This performance offers potential signals for the broader tech IPO landscape. Anthony Ha, one of the Equity podcast hosts, shared his perspective, offering some “not-so-hot takes” on what Chime’s IPO signals for overall Tech IPO Trends . The conversation explored whether this indicates renewed investor appetite or if specific sector strength is driving these outcomes. Understanding these nuances is crucial for evaluating the health and direction of technology companies seeking public funding. The Rise of Agentic AI Startups The podcast also touched upon emerging trends within the AI sector itself, particularly focusing on the types of companies gaining traction. Y Combinator’s recent Demo Day reportedly showcased a significant number of “agentic” AI Startups . These companies are focused on building autonomous software agents capable of performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention.

Claiming that current market conditions support Bitcoin’s upward surge, Kang argued that a deep correction is unlikely before the largest cryptocurrency reaches at least $140,000 to $160,000.

The fact that cryptocurrencies are seen as volatile and risky assets in times of uncertainty has triggered investors to turn to safer havens. The escalation of tensions between the two countries has also raised concerns that Iran could close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation. According to the US Energy Information Administration, 20% of global oil transportation takes place through this strait. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to retaliate against Israel in a message published on X, writing that the country “must be ready for a harsh punishment.” *This is not investment advice.

Why This Analyst Claims BlockDAG Is Faking Its Raise,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/blockdag-a-scam-why-this-analyst-claims-blockdag-is-faking-its-raise,"BlockDAG claims to be the next big Layer-1 blockchain, boasting nearly $300 million raised and major brand partnerships. But growing doubts suggest the project may be more hype than substance—anonymous team, recycled whitepaper, and no on-chain proof. Meanwhile, XYZVerse quietly offers what BlockDAG lacks: audits, KYC, real utility, and transparent fundraising. Here’s why investors are starting to question the noise—and look elsewhere. Is BlockDAG Faking Its $300M Presale? BlockDAG has captured crypto headlines with a presale claiming nearly $300 million in funds—yet many in the space now question whether that number is real or simply inflated marketing. Positioned as a hybrid Proof‑of‑Work/DAG Layer 1 with EVM compatibility, audits from Halborn and CertiK, and partnerships from Inter Milan to NBA hints, its hype is growing. But skeptics argue that behind the noise lies little transparent substance. The red flags are troubling: A seeming mismatch between big advertising budgets and minimal GitHub activity. Repositories are near-empty, and real infrastructure progress is hard to track. Elements of the whitepaper appear nearly identical to Kaspa’s, hinting at recycled documentation rather than true innovation. Surge of impersonator and scam presale sites, which security experts say can drain wallets upon connection. Reddit users have also sounded the horn. One wrote: “No legit company forces you to pay a ‘fee’ or ‘taxes’ to withdraw money. That's just a scam to suck more money out of you.” Source: https://www.reddit.com Another observed that: Source: https://www.reddit.com These comments suggest that much of the presale’s claimed funding may be hype-fueled rather than backed by real investor capital. By contrast, XYZVerse (XYZ)—a sports-themed presale—has amassed around $14 million, completed smart contract audits, passed KYC, and tied itself to a working dApp ecosystem like bookmaker.XYZ, along with clear tokenomics and burn schedules. That presale feels far more grounded and transparent than BlockDAG’s, despite commanding a much smaller scale. Still, BlockDAG has some checkboxes ticked: audit reports, a testnet, and hardware prototypes. Supporters highlight these as signs of a serious project. But without public on-chain fundraising proof, live token listings, or reusable code, investors remain rightly cautious. BlockDAG isn’t proven to be a scam, but its massive presale raise is unverified and the project appears to lean heavily on marketing. Until we see active code, token launches, and on-chain funding, it's a speculative gamble at best. For a more credible presale example on a much smaller scale, look to XYZVerse—with its completed audit, real ecosystem integration, and orderly tokenomics, it reads far more transparently. Why XYZVerse Feels Safer and More Transparent Than BlockDAG In the crowded and often chaotic world of crypto presales, XYZVerse stands out as a rare example of a project that actually delivers transparency, security, and real utility—something that BlockDAG, despite its massive marketing push, consistently fails to prove. Let’s start with verifiable trust. XYZVerse has completed full KYC verification and smart contract audits through respected firms like SolidProof and Pessimistic. These aren't just badges for show—both firms confirmed the absence of critical vulnerabilities and validated the legitimacy of the team behind the project. BlockDAG, in contrast, remains faceless. No team disclosures, no audit transparency, no GitHub development that shows active or meaningful progress. Another critical difference is utility. XYZVerse is already integrated with a functioning on-chain sportsbook—bookmaker.XYZ—that’s handled over $100 million in betting volume and currently serves more than 20,000 users. BlockDAG has no live dApps, no user base, and no proof that anything outside its testnet and promotional pages actually works. Then there’s tokenomics. XYZVerse has released a detailed, structured breakdown: Total supply: 100 billion tokens Presale allocation: 17.9% Burn reserve: 17.1% Liquidity and CEX allocation: 15% Team and development: 10% Staking and ecosystem growth: 10% These numbers are public, documented, and tied to wallet addresses. BlockDAG, on the other hand, offers no visible supply breakdown, no vesting schedules, and no transparency on how presale funds are being used. Fundraising is another key point. XYZVerse has raised over $14 million in a multi-stage, trackable presale, with each price increase documented and reflected in the live dashboard. BlockDAG claims to have raised nearly $300 million—but provides no blockchain receipts, no wallet proofs, and no third-party confirmation. The scale of that number, unsupported by visible market traction, raises more questions than confidence. Finally, there’s the roadmap. XYZVerse has committed to a Token Generation Event (TGE) in the second half of 2025, followed by listings on centralized and decentralized exchanges at a projected $0.10 launch price. These steps are documented, with stage-based progress leading up to launch. BlockDAG continues to delay major roadmap milestones, including token release and listing plans, without offering firm deadlines or accountability. Bottom Line BlockDAG may talk big—with flashy partnerships and a $300 million headline—but its lack of transparency, anonymous team, and unverifiable funding raise serious doubts. The absence of working products, clear tokenomics, and public code only adds to investor skepticism. In contrast, XYZVerse is quietly building trust the right way: with completed audits, a fully KYC’d team, live utility through bookmaker.XYZ, and a structured, public presale. It doesn’t promise the moon—it delivers verifiable progress. Until BlockDAG proves its claims with on-chain proof and product delivery, it remains a marketing-driven gamble. For investors looking for credibility, accountability, and real-world application, XYZVerse is the safer, smarter choice. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Google, a major player in information access, is constantly innovating how we consume information. For those following the intersection of technology and finance, understanding these shifts is crucial. Google Search is now experimenting with a feature designed to change how you interact with search results: Audio Overviews. What are Audio Overviews in Google Search? Google announced it is testing Audio Overviews for specific Search queries. This feature offers users a new way to quickly grasp the main points of a search result without needing to read text. It leverages Google’s advanced artificial intelligence to generate a concise audio summary. The concept of Audio Overviews isn’t entirely new within Google’s ecosystem. It was initially introduced in NotebookLM, Google’s AI-powered research tool, allowing users to create audio summaries from their documents. Google also brought this capability to its Gemini AI interface in March, expanding its reach. Powered by Advanced Gemini Models Google states that these new Audio Overviews for Google Search are powered by its latest Gemini models. This highlights the increasing integration of sophisticated AI into core Google products. Using Gemini models allows the system to understand complex queries and synthesize information into a coherent, easy-to-listen audio format. The goal is to provide an alternative method for users to absorb and understand information, catering to different learning preferences and situations. Benefits and How to Access Audio Overviews Google explained the primary benefit: “An audio overview can help you get a lay of the land, offering a convenient, hands-free way to absorb information whether you’re multitasking or simply prefer an audio experience.” This makes information more accessible, especially when you’re on the go, exercising, or simply prefer listening over reading. The feature is currently available in Google Labs, the company’s platform for testing experimental features. Here’s how it generally works: When you perform a Google Search query, if Google’s system determines an Audio Overview would be useful, it will offer the option to generate one. Clicking the option generates a short audio summary. An audio player appears with standard controls: play/pause, volume adjustment, and playback speed options. Importantly, Google displays links within the audio player, showing the sources of the information. Users can click these source links to dive deeper into the topic after listening to the overview. Users participating in the Labs experiment can provide feedback (thumbs up or down) on individual Audio Overviews and the experiment as a whole. Audio Overviews vs. AI Overviews Audio Overviews build upon the concept of AI Overviews, the text-based AI-generated summaries that Google has been providing for certain Search queries. While AI Overviews offer a quick written summary at the top of the search results page, Audio Overviews provide the same concept in an auditory format. This expansion into audio reflects Google’s effort to make information retrieval more flexible and accessible, particularly targeting auditory learners or those seeking hands-free information access. Implications and the Future of Search Queries This development comes at a time when the impact of AI-powered search features on content publishers is a subject of discussion. Recent reports have noted that AI Overviews and similar tools can potentially reduce traffic to news websites by providing summaries directly in the search results. Audio Overviews continue this trend of providing synthesized information directly within Google Search. While beneficial for user convenience, the long-term effects on the broader web ecosystem and content creators remain a key consideration as Google AI features become more integrated into everyday search experiences. The introduction of Audio Overviews powered by Gemini models is a significant step in how Google is rethinking the presentation of Search queries. It underscores the growing role of AI in making information more accessible and adaptable to different user needs and situations, pushing the boundaries of traditional text-based search.

However, the absence of crucial evidence such as a visible team, a verified whitepaper, and on-chain validation raises significant skepticism about these claims. In contrast, XYZVerse presents a starkly different narrative. With its adherence to audits, a clear KYC process, and a tangible utility in the blockchain space, it stands out as a beacon of transparency and investor confidence. Analyzing BlockDAG's Claimed Innovations and Market Presence BlockDAG’s marketing campaigns boast an extensive $300 million presale influx and strategic partnerships, purportedly setting it apart in the competitive blockchain landscape. However, several indicators suggest these claims might not hold water: Minimal activity on development platforms like GitHub contrasts sharply with their claimed technological advancements. Duplicated content in their whitepaper, similar to that of Kaspa’s, raises questions about the authenticity of their documentation. The emergence of related scam sites, as highlighted in online forums, further tarnishes its credibility. Source: Reddit Discussion on BlockDAG Scams These concerns are echoed by the community on platforms like Reddit, where users express doubt over the legitimacy of BlockDAG's fundraising and operational practices. Comparative Analysis: Why XYZVerse Outshines BlockDAG Unlike BlockDAG, XYZVerse has carved a niche in the blockchain market through genuine and verifiable strides: XYZVerse underpins its market claims with concrete evidence, including $14 million raised from a fully audited presale and a functional dApp ecosystem that confirms its utility and investor appeal. Source: Reddit Analysis of XYZVerse The clear, documented tokenomics and operational transparency of XYZVerse present a reliable and structured investment opportunity, starkly different from the speculative and unverified propositions of BlockDAG. Conclusion: Evaluating the Trustworthiness of Blockchain Innovations While BlockDAG continues to make headlines with its high-profile claims and partnerships, the lack of foundational transparency and verifiable data casts a shadow over its legitimacy. On the other hand, XYZVerse’s approach of maintaining open audits, clear financial handling, and live product deployments positions it as a more reliable and trustworthy venture in the blockchain space.

In a new interview on CNBC, Novogratz says Bitcoin has become an “institutionalized macro asset” just like gold or silver. According to Novogratz, the rising number of institutional investors putting money into Bitcoin will further draw more investors into an asset with a fixed supply. “More and more people are realizing this is a story that they want to care about. And so once Larry Fink said BlackRock’s getting behind this, all that pushing the snowball uphill, it started rolling downhill. And now we’ve got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we’ve got sovereign wealth [funds] buying Bitcoin, we’ve got retail investors buying Bitcoin, there are easier ways to get it. And so the adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset, as an asset to save money in, I think that’s now a ball rolling downhill.” The Galaxy Digital CEO says Bitcoin could go up by over 9x from the current level as it increasingly becomes accepted as a store of value by younger generations. “The bull case becomes that over time, young people care about it more than old people. And so gold slowly gets replaced by Bitcoin. If you look at gold’s market cap and Bitcoin’s market cap, Bitcoin has a long way to go – 10x. And so that’s a $1 million Bitcoin just to be where gold is. And I think gold should go from $3,000 to $10,000.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,662 at time of writing.

The “initiation” ceremony took place Friday, one day before the Army’s 250th birthday. The four tech leaders, Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth, OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil, Palantir Chief Technology Officer Shyam Sankar, and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab and former Chief Research Officer at OpenAI, have enlisted in the Executive Innovation Corps under the Army Reserve. Their mission is to make technological advancements like artificial intelligence “more familiar” to the military while working part-time and as civilians. Officials did not disclose the planned size of the detachment. According to an Army statement , Detachment 201 is designed to “bridge the commercial-military tech gap” by adding the input of private-sector leaders directly into military projects. Each executive will serve as a senior advisor for approximately 120 hours annually. Tech executives training military to be ‘combat-ready’ According to the Wall Street Journal, the executives will be responsible for advising the Army on AI-powered systems, drones, and battlefield robotics. “Det. 201 is an effort to recruit senior tech executives to serve part-time in the Army Reserve as senior advisors,” the Army stated in a press release. “In this role they will work on targeted projects to help guide rapid and scalable tech solutions to complex problems.” Andrew Bosworth, 43, who leads Meta’s hardware and XR initiatives, said he had a personal desire in joining the program as it could honor his family’s military legacy. “ It’s possible I watched too much ‘Top Gun ,’” he joked. At over six feet tall, Bosworth once aspired to fly fighter jets but was told he was too tall for the cockpit. Now, he sees this opportunity as a meaningful way to serve. The company he works for is behind the Maven Smart System and the AI-powered TITAN vehicle currently in development for the Army. The announcement comes against the backdrop of the Army Transformation Initiative, launched and led by Secretary Daniel Driscoll and Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George. The initiative is meant to get rid of obsolete systems and take up “dual-use” commercial technology. Driscoll has asked the US Department of Defense to increase the procurement of commercial off-the-shelf solutions and make reforms to acquisitions. Solutions to the military-tech divide The Army says Detachment 201 will contribute to projects like the Army Transformation Initiative, that could make the force more technologically advanced . “ We need to go faster, and that’s exactly what we are doing here ,” said Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George. He joked about making the tech leaders nervous about physical training, saying he had “been giving them a hard time” about the difficulty of the tests. Brynt Parmeter, the Pentagon’s chief talent management officer, has led the formation of the new program since 2023. He hopes Detachment 201 will open doors for other branches of the military to create similar initiatives. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The ongoing debate around TikTok’s legal status in the United States isn’t just about national security—it’s about control. With millions of creators relying on TikTok for visibility and income, the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the platform’s future highlights the significant impact centralized platforms can have on creators’ livelihoods. In these environments, key aspects of a creator’s presence—from monetization to content accessibility—are shaped by decisions that may not always align with their interests. You might also like: Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion TikTok’s situation highlights a broader issue. In recent years, creators on web2 platforms have faced abrupt policy shifts that have significantly impacted their earnings and reach. The YouTube ‘Adpocalypse’ of 2016-2017, for example, saw a wave of videos demonetized due to revised advertising policies. Likewise, Patreon’s fee structure changes in 2017 raised concerns among smaller creators. In 2018, platform-wide content policy updates on Tumblr disrupted longstanding communities. Even changes to Instagram’s algorithm have altered how and whether creators’ content reaches their audiences, often without transparency or recourse. These examples reflect a recurring pattern: creators on centralized platforms often have limited control over the environments in which they operate. In such systems, policies, algorithms, and monetization options are subject to frequent change, and creators rarely have a say in the process. While decentralized platforms have yet to become mainstream alternatives, they offer a promising path forward. Historically, challenges such as cost, performance limitations, and clunky interfaces have hindered adoption. But many of these issues are being actively addressed, especially in how data is stored and accessed. Decentralized platforms can offer creators greater control over their content and its management. Permanent storage is ideal for preserving essential content such as posts and profiles, while temporary storage enables fast, flexible delivery of dynamic or short-lived data. By combining both models, creators can optimize their digital presence for speed, accessibility, and resilience. The next generation of platforms must prioritize user experience, offering seamless integration with familiar tools, intuitive interfaces, and the reliability that users have come to expect. Web3 won’t displace web2 overnight, but it can offer creators an empowering alternative built on transparency, autonomy, and sustainability. Decentralized storage solutions, such as Arweave, enable creators to maintain long-term access to their content while reducing their dependence on centralized gatekeepers. This model not only increases resilience against censorship or algorithmic suppression but also opens up new opportunities for monetization that are not tied to the priorities of large tech corporations. To succeed, web3 solutions must go beyond ideology. They need to deliver concrete improvements, such as more efficient uploads, scalable storage, and interfaces that fit into creators’ existing workflows without forcing them to start from scratch. As someone working directly in the digital media industry, I’ve seen how vital it is for creators to have true ownership over their work. Decentralization and free speech are not just ideals—they are practical foundations for building more sustainable and creator-centric ecosystems. What sets decentralized platforms apart is their transparency and openness. Features like open-source software, decentralized provider networks, user-driven storage options, and transparent pricing models reduce the risk of sudden, opaque policy shifts. These design choices offer a degree of protection and predictability that centralized systems often lack. The ongoing legal uncertainty around TikTok is just the latest chapter in an ongoing story: centralized platforms can be unstable ground for creators. It’s time for a shift. The promise of decentralization—when paired with well-designed systems for both permanent and temporary storage—offers creators a real opportunity to regain control over their content, distribution, and earnings. The time to build that future is now. At Odysee, we’re committed to giving creators genuine ownership over their work and a platform that respects their autonomy. With the integration of permanent storage networks like Arweave, we are taking decisive steps toward a more open, resilient, and creator-first digital economy.

In fact, for investors who can spot well-structured projects with clear roadmaps and credible development teams, presales remain one of the few entry points where significant upside is still possible. With many established tokens already priced at multi-billion-dollar valuations, presales offer a rare chance to get in early—before listings, before hype peaks, and before retail waves arrive. The five projects in this list represent some of the more compelling cases for why this route still matters in 2025. In a crowded presale market where many projects focus on infrastructure, AI, or asset tokenization, XYZVerse introduces a different kind of narrative. Rexas Finance is bringing real estate on-chain, Unilabs is leveraging AI for DeFi portfolio tools, Solaxy is refining Solana’s scalability with a Layer‑2 approach, and BlockDAG is exploring mobile mining through a DAG-based framework. XYZVerse (XYZ): The Sports Meme Coin Aiming to Redefine Fan-Based Crypto XYZVerse is positioning itself as the first-ever sports-themed memecoin, aiming to bridge fandom—from football to esports—with meme culture. The presale price has soared from $0.0001 at launch to ~$0.003333 in later stages, and over $14 million has already been raised. Organizers anticipate the final presale price to reach $0.02, with a target listing around $0.10, hinting at potential multiple-fold returns. Tokenomics include deflationary mechanics: a notable portion of tokens are burned during the presale, portions are reserved for liquidity, and community airdrops are planned—designed to reward early supporters. The project has secured smart contract audits and incorporated community-driven initiatives like ambassador programs and decentralized betting features. Analysts have compared its growth and investor appeal to other meme tokens, with some suggesting XYZVerse may outperform established players in the under‑$1 meme-token space. Rexas Finance (RXS): Tokenizing Real Estate and Hard Assets for On-Chain Ownership Rexas Finance focuses on tokenizing real-world assets—like real estate—targeting institutional and retail investors. The presale has advanced to Stage 12, with each RXS priced at $0.20; the planned listing price is around $0.25. From an initial round at $0.03, the project has achieved a roughly 6x increase and raised approximately $49–51 million. Scheduled to close June 19, 2025, Rexas offers governance token utility for platform decisions. It supports payment via ETH and USDT, though critics have raised concerns about regulatory uncertainty, competition from more established platforms, and the risk that early presale holders may sell after launch. Unilabs Finance (UNIL): AI-Powered DeFi Portfolio Management for the Next Cycle Unilabs combines AI-driven portfolio management with DeFi. With over $30 million in assets managed, the token began at $0.004 and is now selling for approximately $0.0051 in its current stage, with a projected listing around $0.05—potentially offering a 10× return. The presale has raised between $2–3 million, and analysts highlight its advanced AI tools for asset selection and fee redistribution to token holders. Some forecasts predict continued mid-term growth into 2026. However, the competitive landscape and dependence on timely platform delivery are key risks to monitor. Solaxy (SOLX): A High-Speed Solana Layer‑2 With Testnet and Cross-Chain Potential Solaxy presents a Layer‑2 solution built on Solana, focusing on speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. The testnet is underway, and the presale has collected roughly $43–48 million. Token pricing started around $0.001626 and has risen to approximately $0.00179. The presale is concluding on June 16, 2025, with expectations of strong exchange interest. It includes staking options offering attractive APRs (86–112%) and a bridge to Ethereum utilizing Hyperlane, underscoring a focus on interoperability. Institutional interest appears significant, although the broader Layer‑2 sector is crowded and execution will be critical. BlockDAG Network (BDAG): Mobile-Mining Layer 1 With Massive Fundraising Momentum BlockDAG is a hybrid blockchain/DAG protocol targeting mobile mining and rapid scalability. Its presale has raised over $291 million, with more than 22 billion tokens sold. Current presale pricing is around $0.018–0.026, with an intended listing near $0.05—suggesting a potential 2,500–2,700% return. The project allows users to mine via mobile app, with staking and security features embedded, and ambitious plans to launch a mainnet within six months. While fundraising has been record-breaking, the long-term value depends heavily on executing on fast delivery timelines . Summary & Considerations XYZVerse stands out for its sports‑focused memecoin model, presale performance, deflationary approach, and clear roadmap toward listing and on-chain utility. Rexas Finance offers real-world asset access and governance participation, with strong financial momentum but also regulatory and competition challenges. Unilabs Finance delivers AI‑DeFi innovation and revenue-sharing structures, though it must navigate a crowded space and ensure platform delivery. Solaxy provides a technically solid Layer‑2 solution with a testnet and staking features, but faces stiff competition. BlockDAG has raised massive capital and combines mobile mining with scalability, though its prospects rely on speed of execution. Final Note Presales may not grab headlines like major token listings or billion-dollar market cap rallies, but they continue to offer one of the few remaining frontiers for outsized returns—especially for early, informed participants. The five projects explored here—ranging from cultural plays like XYZVerse to infrastructure-focused platforms like BlockDAG and Solaxy—demonstrate that innovation is still happening at the ground floor. As always, due diligence is critical. Roadmaps can shift, teams must deliver, and market conditions can turn quickly. But for those willing to do the work, the presale market in 2025 remains very much alive—and, for the right picks, still full of possibility.

Despite the crowded landscape, projects like XYZVerse, Rexas, and BlockDAG stand out, providing promising prospects before they even hit mainstream exchanges. Among the myriad of projects focusing on diverse areas such as AI integration, infrastructure enhancement, and asset tokenization, certain initiatives like XYZVerse have carved distinct niches. These projects are not only redefining the standard presale model but are also setting new benchmarks for success and investor engagement. The Dynamic Appeal of XYZVerse With an innovative approach to integrating sports and meme culture, XYZVerse has captivated a broad audience, elevating the concept of fan-based cryptocurrencies. This project began its journey at a mere $0.0001 per token and witnessed a remarkable surge to about $0.003333, raising over $14 million in the process. Featuring a deflationary token model, the platform has introduced mechanisms such as token burns and community airdrops to sustain growth and reward early adopters. The projected final presale price aims at $0.02 per token, with aspirations to reach $0.10 post-listing, suggesting a lucrative potential return for initial investors. Rexas Finance and the Future of Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance has significantly influenced the real estate and hard asset sectors by introducing tokenization to a wider audience. Starting from a humble $0.03, it has escalated to $0.20 in its latest presale stage, amassing between $49 and $51 million in investor funds. Despite facing regulatory challenges and stiff competition, Rexas maintains its allure through its innovative governance model, allowing token holders to steer platform decisions, an appealing feature that enhances its investment case as the project nears its presale conclusion on June 19, 2025. Emerging Trends: AI-Driven DeFi and Advanced Blockchain Solutions The presale landscape is also enriched by projects like Unilabs and Solaxy. Unilabs is pioneering AI-driven portfolio management within the DeFi sector, managing assets worth over $30 million, with its presale phase drawing keen interest from tech-savvy investors. Similarly, Solaxy leverages Solana’s infrastructure to enhance blockchain scalability and speed, attracting a substantial $43 to $48 million in investments during its presale. The Revolutionary Potential of BlockDAG Network In the landscape of mobile mining and scalability, the BlockDAG Network emerges as a formidable contender. Its presale phase has been a record-breaking success, amassing over $291 million, with plans to launch a mainnet within the next six months. Summary The highlighted projects showcase the diversity and innovation still prevalent in the cryptocurrency presale arena. Each offers unique features, from XYZVerse's fan-centric approach to BlockDAG's mobile mining capabilities, painting a promising picture for early investors in 2025.",More News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MINING|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-06-14 09:19:05

Key Takeaways: The SEC approved Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin-linked registration, covering 85 million shares. TMTG says it has no immediate plans to issue new securities despite gaining shelf flexibility. CEO Devin Nunes says the firm aims to grow its media, fintech, and Bitcoin holdings in parallel. The decision, revealed in a June 13 filing , marks a major regulatory step for the company behind Truth Social, the platform founded by President Donald Trump and partially owned by him. According to the filing, the SEC declared effective TMTG’s S-3 registration statement, initially submitted on June 6. Trump Media Registers 85M Shares Linked to $2.3B Bitcoin Deal: SEC The document outlines the registration of roughly 56 million shares and an additional 29 million shares tied to convertible notes, forming part of the firm’s broader equity and debt agreements with approximately 50 investors. The total proceeds from these arrangements amount to $2.3 billion. Although the registration includes a universal shelf to allow TMTG greater capital-raising flexibility, the company said it has “no immediate plans” to issue new securities under the provision. The move appears more strategic than urgent, aligning with TMTG’s stated ambition to evolve beyond its media roots. TMTG President and CEO Devin Nunes said the company is now pushing forward on multiple fronts. “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities,” Nunes said. “By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our fintech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy.” SEC APPROVES TRUMP MEDIA’S BITCOIN TREASURY DEAL pic.twitter.com/bybvEZ5TjS — Kyle Chassé / DD (@kyle_chasse) June 13, 2025 Despite the regulatory win, TMTG shares dropped 2.06% on the day of the announcement, closing at $19.52. TMTG Confirms $2.5B Capital Raise to Buy Bitcoin The SEC’s green light comes just weeks after TMTG confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to accumulate Bitcoin, following earlier denials. In that May 27 announcement, Nunes characterized Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” asserting that it would become a core part of the company’s asset base. On May 28, Arkham Intelligence posted on X, “Donald Trump’s company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?” — referencing MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and his aggressive Bitcoin strategy. TMTG isn’t stopping there. On June 5, the company filed for approval to launch its own Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), signaling even deeper ambitions in digital assets. According to the filing, the ETF would hold Bitcoin in custody and aim to mirror its market performance. Trump has publicly supported the expansion of crypto access and has pledged to make the United States a leading center for digital assets. Earlier this month, he hosted a private dinner for investors in his personal meme coin project at his golf club.

Ondo Finance: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Innovation Ondo Finance is pioneering a new path by combining the stability of traditional finance with the innovation of blockchain technology. By tokenizing stable, income-generating assets like US Treasuries, Ondo makes high-grade financial products more accessible to a broader audience. Its structure includes an asset management arm that creates these tokenized products and a technology arm that develops decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to enhance their functionality. Collaborations with respected firms like BlackRock and the use of Coinbase for crypto asset custody highlight Ondo’s commitment to quality, security, and regulatory compliance. In today’s market, where volatility is common, Ondo’s focus on real-world, income-generating assets offers a different approach. Their product USDY combines the accessibility of a stablecoin with the added benefit of yield, secured by US Treasuries and bank deposits. This blend might appeal to non-US investors looking for regulated and transparent financial options within the crypto space. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, Ondo’s unique position at the intersection of traditional finance and DeFi could make it stand out among other digital assets, especially for those interested in stability and tangible backing over high-risk speculation. VeChain’s VET: Revolutionizing Supply Chains with Blockchain Power VeChain is transforming how we track products globally.

This development is particularly relevant to the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, which often intersects with cutting-edge technology and its regulatory landscape. The recently passed bill, known as the RAISE Act, aims to establish guardrails around powerful frontier AI models developed by major players like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. What is the New York AI Bill All About? The core purpose of the New York AI bill is to prevent future disaster scenarios potentially fueled by advanced AI systems. The bill specifically defines a disaster as an event causing death or injury to more than 100 people, or resulting in over $1 billion in damages. This focus on tangible, high-impact harm distinguishes the bill’s scope. The passage of the RAISE Act is seen as a notable victory for the AI safety movement. This group, which includes prominent figures like Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton and AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio, advocates for prioritizing caution and safety measures as AI technology rapidly advances. Their support highlights the bill’s alignment with calls from leading researchers for responsible AI development. Boosting Transparency Among Leading AI Labs A key component of the RAISE Act is its requirement for enhanced transparency from major AI labs . Should the bill be signed into law by Governor Kathy Hochul, it would mandate that the world’s largest AI companies publish detailed safety and security reports on their frontier models. This would be America’s first set of legally required transparency standards for such advanced AI. The bill also includes provisions requiring these companies to report safety incidents. This could involve disclosing concerning behaviors exhibited by an AI model or reporting instances of bad actors attempting to steal or misuse an AI system. Failure to meet these standards could result in significant civil penalties, potentially up to $30 million, enforceable by the New York Attorney General. Comparing New York’s Approach to Previous AI Regulation Efforts The RAISE Act shares many goals and provisions with California’s earlier attempt at AI regulation , SB 1047, which ultimately faced a veto. However, sponsors of the New York bill, like state Senator Andrew Gounardes, emphasize that they deliberately designed the RAISE Act to avoid stifling innovation, particularly among startups and academic researchers. This was a common criticism leveled against the California bill. Senator Gounardes noted the urgency of implementing safeguards, stating, “The window to put in place guardrails is rapidly shrinking given how fast this technology is evolving.” He added that even experts familiar with AI express alarm about the likelihood of these risks, underscoring the motivation behind the bill. Addressing Industry Concerns and the Scope of the Bill The RAISE Act is specifically designed to regulate the world’s largest companies whose AI models were trained using more than $100 million in computing resources and are available to New York residents. This includes tech giants based both domestically and internationally, such as OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, and Alibaba. Despite this focused approach, the bill has faced pushback from Silicon Valley. New York state Assemblymember Alex Bores, a co-sponsor, acknowledged this resistance but maintained that the bill would not hinder innovation. Even Anthropic, an AI safety focused company, expressed some reservations, with co-founder Jack Clark noting concerns that the bill might be too broad and potentially impact smaller companies, a criticism Senator Gounardes disputed, reiterating the bill’s narrow focus on large entities. Another common concern raised, similar to debates around European tech regulations, is that AI model developers might simply choose not to offer their most advanced models in New York. Assemblymember Bores countered this, suggesting the regulatory burden is light enough that withdrawing from the state wouldn’t be economically justified, especially given New York’s significant GDP. He expressed confidence that while there might be “political pettiness,” there are no strong economic reasons for companies to withhold their services from New York residents. The Path Forward for the RAISE Act With passage in the state legislature, the RAISE Act now awaits review by New York Governor Kathy Hochul. She has several options: signing it into law, sending it back for potential amendments, or vetoing it. The tech and safety communities will be closely watching her decision, as signing it would make New York the first state in America with legally mandated transparency standards specifically for advanced AI labs . Summary: A Step Towards Accountable AI The passage of the RAISE Act in New York marks a significant legislative effort to proactively address the potential catastrophic risks associated with powerful frontier AI models. By focusing on transparency, incident reporting, and civil penalties for the largest AI labs , the bill aims to establish a framework for accountability. While facing industry pushback and comparisons to previous regulatory attempts, sponsors argue the bill is narrowly tailored to promote AI safety without stifling innovation, particularly for smaller entities. The fate of this potentially landmark AI regulation now rests with the Governor. To learn more about the latest AI regulation trends, explore our article on key developments shaping AI policy .

Amid this new cycle, investors are looking for the gem that gives them massive returns in the ongoing altcoin boom. In every cycle, there is always one hidden token that surprises everyone after going live. Such a token always starts small, raising a bit of excitement amongst smart investors who take time to study the market, before it explodes onto the scene. In the current bull cycle, that coin is shaping up to be Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Investors are scrambling to secure a massive haul before the latecomers find out about it on CoinMarketCap, when the price goes parabolic. A Deep Dive Into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the latest entrant into the crypto space that is causing excitement all over. It is built as a decentralized, non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. Lenders provide liquidity in the pools for a chance to earn passive income through an annualized percentage yield. The interest that they earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate. As more borrowers join a pool, the interest rate rises, which encourages them to repay their loans. Meanwhile, more lenders join the pool to benefit from the higher yields. The positive feedback loop ensures that a pool attains optimal capital utilization. As borrowers, the goal is to get loans using overcollateralized collateral. The loan can be used to take advantage of market opportunities without having to spend your collateral. As the value of the collateral rises, you can repay the loans and get back your full amount. Borrowers can choose between stable and variable interest rates. A stable interest rate allows borrowers to make predictable repayments. To maintain the health of the protocol, the stable rate is only available to assets that have high levels of liquidity and low volatility. How High Could MUTM Tokens Rise? According to analysts, the price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens could rise as high as $2 when they go live. The Mutuum Finance project is currently in the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 in the current phase 5 of the presale. So far, over $10.6 million has been raised in the ongoing presale, with over 35% of the tokens allocated for the current phase sold, barely two weeks after launch. The presale has seen massive participation numbers, which currently stand at around 12,000 unique buyers. In the upcoming phase of the presale, the token price will rise by 16.67% to $0.035. This will also see the guaranteed ROI, based on the $0.06 listing price, fall from 100% to 71.43%. Based on the analysts’ forecast of a price of $2 when the tokens go live, that is a 6566.67% increase for those who buy their tokens in the presale at the current price of $0.03. For a clearer view of this increase, let us take the example of a buyer who purchases $1,345 worth of MUTM presale tokens. At the projected increase to $2 when the tokens go live, the buyer would see their investment grow to just over $89,666. That is a massive return that should not be ignored. While that might seem like a lot, it is quite common in the crypto sector. For instance, since DOGE launched, its price has grown by 33686.14%. While the MUTM token may not offer the same returns as DOGE a few days after launch, the gains will be more sustainable. A major downside to meme coins like DOGE is that they are prone to wild market swings, which makes it difficult to accurately plot an exit. Maintaining Positive Price Pressure One of the most notable aspects of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the buy and distribute program. In this program, protocol profits are used to purchase MUTM tokens off the open market and distributed to mtToken holders. That encourages more people to join the protocol, while also boosting the price of MUTM tokens on the open market. Since the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is listed on CoinMarketCap, these price increases will be visible to the masses, which will boost interest in the tokens. CoinMarketCap has over 350 million monthly visitors, and this could prove to be one of the biggest sources of growth for the token price. This program will ensure long-term sustainable returns for early investors. Coupled with various protocol safeguards that include careful vetting of new tokens, this could make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the most valuable tokens of the new age of crypto. Massive Giveaway To reward early investors in the protocol, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized a $100,000 giveaway . This ongoing giveaway will reward ten lucky winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The giveaway is open to everyone who participates in the presale with a minimum $50 purchase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a new era for the crypto sector, built on sustainable returns and long-term value increase. You have a chance to be part of this exciting new future at the low price of $0.03 per token in the ongoing presale.

While the crypto market often grabs headlines, traditional Forex markets continue to influence global economics and investment strategies. Recently, Bank of America (BofA) released its latest Swedish Krona forecast , offering a compelling view on its potential performance, particularly when stacked against its Scandinavian neighbor, the Norwegian Krone. Why the Swedish Krona Forecast Looks Positive to Bank of America Bank of America analysts have pointed towards several key factors underpinning their optimistic outlook for the Swedish Krona. Their analysis suggests that fundamental economic shifts and central bank policy trajectories are creating a favorable environment for SEK relative to NOK. Key reasons cited by BofA include: Economic Resilience: Despite global headwinds, the Swedish economy is showing signs of resilience in specific sectors. BofA believes this underlying strength provides a better foundation for the Krona compared to Norway’s economy, which is heavily influenced by oil price volatility. Central Bank Divergence: The Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) and Norges Bank (Norway’s central bank) are on potentially different paths regarding monetary policy. BofA’s BofA currency view takes into account anticipated interest rate decisions and quantitative easing/tightening measures that could widen the yield differential in favor of the Krona. Relative Valuation: The Krona may be undervalued relative to the Krone based on long-term economic fundamentals. BofA’s models suggest a potential correction in this valuation gap. Inflation Dynamics: Differences in inflation trends and how central banks are tackling them play a crucial role. BofA assesses that Sweden’s approach and inflation trajectory could be more supportive of currency strength moving forward. This confluence of factors forms the basis of BofA’s prediction that the Swedish Krona is likely to outperform the Norwegian Krone in the near to medium term. Understanding the SEK NOK Forecast Dynamics The relationship between the Swedish Krona (SEK) and the Norwegian Krone (NOK) is often closely watched due to their geographical proximity and intertwined economies. However, despite similarities, key differences drive their respective currency values. The SEK NOK forecast from institutions like BofA highlights these divergences. Norway’s economy, and consequently the Krone, is significantly impacted by global energy prices, particularly oil and gas. As a major energy exporter, higher oil prices generally support the Norwegian Krone, while lower prices can weaken it. Sweden, on the other hand, has a more diversified industrial and service-based economy, making its currency less directly tied to commodity fluctuations. Here’s a simplified comparison of factors influencing each currency: Factor Swedish Krona (SEK) Norwegian Krone (NOK) Economic Base Diversified industry, services, exports Heavily reliant on oil & gas exports Commodity Sensitivity Lower Higher (especially oil prices) Central Bank (Monetary Policy) Riksbank Norges Bank Key Risks Global demand for exports, housing market Oil price volatility, global energy demand BofA’s analysis suggests that current conditions, including potential shifts in energy markets and differing central bank responses to inflation and growth, favor the structural position of the Swedish Krona over the Norwegian Krone. What Does This Norwegian Krone Forecast Imply for the Market? A bearish outlook on the Norwegian Krone relative to the Swedish Krona has direct implications for Forex traders and investors with exposure to these currencies. The Norwegian Krone forecast from BofA suggests that positioning for SEK strength against NOK could be a profitable strategy. Actionable insights derived from such a forecast might include: Trading the Pair: Traders might consider going ‘long’ SEK and ‘short’ NOK, effectively betting on the SEK/NOK exchange rate to rise. Portfolio Hedging: Businesses or investors with significant exposure to Norway (e.g., receiving payments in NOK) might consider hedging this risk by buying SEK or other stronger currencies. Investment Decisions: For those looking to invest in Scandinavian assets, a stronger SEK could make Swedish assets relatively more attractive or Norwegian assets less so, depending on the investment goal and currency exposure. It is crucial, however, to remember that currency markets are volatile, and forecasts are not guarantees. Geopolitical events, unexpected economic data, or sudden shifts in commodity prices can quickly alter currency trajectories. Broader Implications for the Forex Market Forecast While the SEK vs NOK prediction is specific, it fits into the broader picture of the current Forex market forecast . Currency analysts globally are grappling with the effects of persistent inflation, varying paces of post-pandemic economic recovery, and the tightening (or potential easing) of monetary policies by major central banks. The BofA view on SEK vs NOK highlights a theme seen in other currency pairs: the divergence in economic fundamentals and central bank reactions is becoming a primary driver of exchange rates. Instead of broad market movements, we are seeing more pair-specific dynamics based on relative strengths and weaknesses. This means that for those involved in Forex, whether trading directly or managing international finances, a granular understanding of individual country economics and central bank intentions is more critical than ever. The SEK/NOK example serves as a micro-level illustration of these macro-level forces at play in the global currency markets. Challenges and Risks to the Forecast No financial forecast is without its risks. The BofA Swedish Krona forecast is subject to potential disruptions. Key challenges or events that could invalidate or alter the prediction include: Unexpected Riksbank/Norges Bank Policy Shifts: A sudden change in interest rate plans or quantitative measures by either central bank could quickly reverse currency movements. Commodity Price Swings: A significant and sustained rally in oil prices could provide unexpected support for the Norwegian Krone, challenging the forecast. Global Economic Shocks: A severe global recession or a major geopolitical event could impact both economies and currencies in unforeseen ways, potentially affecting their relative performance differently than anticipated. Swedish Housing Market Issues: Concerns about Sweden’s housing market have been a long-standing vulnerability for the Krona. A crisis in this sector could outweigh positive factors. Therefore, while BofA’s analysis provides a strong case, market participants should remain vigilant and monitor incoming data and events. Conclusion: Navigating the SEK and NOK Outlook Bank of America’s analysis presents a clear case for the Swedish Krona likely outperforming the Norwegian Krone, grounded in differing economic structures and central bank outlooks. Their BofA currency view provides valuable insight for anyone tracking Scandinavian currencies or looking for relative value opportunities in the Forex market. The prediction hinges on Sweden’s economic resilience and the Riksbank’s potential policy path offering more support for the Krona compared to Norway’s oil-dependent economy and the Norges Bank’s stance. However, like all financial forecasts, this outlook is subject to global economic shifts, commodity price volatility, and unexpected policy decisions. For traders and investors, this suggests paying close attention to the SEK/NOK pair and the underlying economic data from both countries. While the path may not be linear, BofA’s forecast provides a compelling narrative for potential SEK strength ahead.

It runs on a technology called blockchain, allowing people to send money directly to each other without a bank. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin is a network of computers keeping records of transactions. Miners verify these transactions by solving complex puzzles and are rewarded with bitcoins. This makes the system secure and resistant to fraud. About every four years, the reward miners get is cut in half in an event called ""halving."" There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, making it scarce like gold. In the current market, Bitcoin remains strong compared to other cryptocurrencies. Its limited supply and growing acceptance make it attractive. While other coins come and go, Bitcoin has stood the test of time. With more people and companies using it, Bitcoin could be a good choice for those interested in the future of digital money.

The exchange-traded fund will also include staking options for users. Fidelity isn’t the only firm eyeing a SOL ETF, with a flurry of companies issuing SOL ETF S-1 amendments on Friday, including VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, Grayscale, Canary Capital, and Franklin Templeton. VanEck was the first U.S. company to file for a spot Solana ETF in June 2024 and was also the last to submit its amended S-1 filing for the day. Fidelity advances toward a spot SOL ETF Fidelity submitted its S-1 statement Friday to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The firm acknowledged that the proposed Fidelity Solana Fund would operate as a Delaware statutory trust. The ETF’s goal is to mirror SOL’s performance based on the Fidelity Solana Reference Rate Index, which calculates price data using a volume-weighted median price after 15 seconds. The index aggregates prices from eligible spot markets and reflects the real-time value of SOL in U.S. dollars. The ETF issuer revealed that the fund aims to keep SOL in custody and earn extra yield by staking some of its holdings through vetted providers. The resulting staking rewards will be treated as income and distributed accordingly. Fidelity has named a custodian who will store all SOL in segregated accounts on behalf of the trust. According to the company, most assets will be held in cold storage with limited SOL in hot wallets for transactions. The firm also plans to list shares on the Cboe BZX Exchange, though the ticker symbol remains undisclosed. According to Fidelity, shares will be created and redeemed in large blocks called Baskets, mainly by authorized participants using either SOL or cash. The asset management firm added that daily net asset value (NAV) will be calculated using the same index method applied to SOL pricing. The filing also revealed an annual sponsor fee tied to the fund’s SOL assets, though the percentage remains undisclosed. Fidelity said the fee will cover most standard operating expenses, except for unusual costs and a separate staking-related fee paid to the custodian from staking rewards. Fidelity’s affiliate, FD Funds Management LLC, will sponsor the product. The firm said the Trust will not use leverage, derivatives, or complex instruments, keeping the structure simple for traditional investors. According to the asset management company, the custodian will control all private keys, and the sponsor will oversee staking activities and manage security. The Trust’s assets, including staked SOL, are not protected by the FDIC or SIPC insurance. To initiate the momentum, a sponsor affiliate purchased a single Seed Share to set up the fund. Fidelity also clarified that the trust isn’t registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which means investors won’t receive the same regulatory protections given to traditional mutual funds or ETFs that fall under that law. The trust needs registration approval from the SEC before sales can commence. Fidelity has labeled the trust as an emerging growth company, allowing it to follow scaled-back reporting rules initially. SEC urges ETF issuers to update their S-1 filings by June The latest filing follows the U.S. SEC’s directive last week for spot Solana ETF issuers to update their S-1 filings by June. Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said at the time that the agency’s request indicates it’s more likely than before to approve some of the products, giving a timeline of two to four months for spot SOL ETFs to go live. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart doubts the Solana ETF approval will come as soon as next week. “I think there needs to be a back and forth with the SEC and issuers to iron out details, so I doubt it. If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were a lot of filings over the preceding couple months before launch.” – James Seyffart , ETF Analyst at Bloomberg The regulator also reportedly asked issuers to update language surrounding in-kind redemptions and how issuers would approach staking. Firms have been advocating for the agency to approve Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs, which would earn holders staking yield. The SEC has approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as well as several blended crypto-equity funds. ETF issuers, including VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, recently urged the agency to practice a first-to-file approach, where the SEC prioritizes greenlighting financial products based on the order of arrival Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Big news dropped recently concerning one of the most prominent players in the digital asset space: Coinbase. If you’ve been keeping an eye on Coinbase stock (COIN), you’ll want to pay close attention to this development. A major financial services firm , Cantor Fitzgerald, has just updated its outlook on Coinbase, and it’s looking decidedly bullish. This isn’t just a minor tweak; they’ve significantly increased their Coinbase price target , signaling strong confidence in the company’s future trajectory. Why is Cantor Fitzgerald Bullish on the Coinbase Price Target? Let’s dive into the specifics of what the analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald are seeing. According to reports, they’ve upped their 12-month price forecast for Coinbase shares from a solid $253 to an impressive $292. That’s a notable jump and reflects a positive sentiment towards the company’s operational performance and strategic direction. Their reasoning centers on a couple of key areas: Strong Trading Operations: The analysts believe Coinbase is making significant headway in its core trading business. Continued progress here is seen as a primary driver for increasing its market share within the competitive crypto exchange landscape. As market conditions improve or volatility rises, Coinbase’s robust trading platform is well-positioned to capture more volume. Growth Beyond Trading: Perhaps more interestingly, Cantor Fitzgerald is also factoring in Coinbase’s initiatives outside of its traditional trading services. While these new ventures might not be massive revenue generators right now, they are expected to gradually reshape how investors perceive the business, moving beyond just a simple trading platform. This two-pronged view suggests that while current performance is strong, the long-term potential lies in Coinbase’s ability to diversify and innovate. Exploring Coinbase’s Non-Trading Growth Drivers What exactly are these ‘initiatives beyond trading’ that Cantor Fitzgerald is highlighting? Coinbase has been actively expanding its offerings to become a more comprehensive crypto financial institution. These include: Staking Services: Allowing users to earn rewards by holding certain cryptocurrencies. Custody Solutions: Providing secure storage for institutional and high-net-worth investors. Web3 & dApp Integration: Making it easier for users to interact with decentralized applications and the broader Web3 ecosystem. International Expansion: Entering new markets to capture a global user base. Layer 2 Solutions: Investing in or supporting scaling technologies to reduce transaction costs and increase speed. These efforts are crucial for Coinbase’s long-term strategy. They aim to create multiple revenue streams, reduce reliance solely on trading fees (which can be volatile), and build a sticky ecosystem that keeps users engaged even when trading volume is low. While the analysts don’t expect these new products to yield significant returns this year, their potential is clearly a factor in the revised Coinbase price target for the future. When Can Investors Expect a Shift in Sentiment? Timing is everything, and the Cantor Fitzgerald report offers a specific timeline for when these non-trading initiatives might start meaningfully impacting investor perception and, subsequently, the Coinbase stock price. They anticipate a significant shift in sentiment beginning in the second half of 2026 and continuing into 2027. Why the later timeline? Developing and scaling new financial products, especially in a nascent and regulated space like crypto, takes time. Building user adoption, proving profitability, and gaining regulatory clarity are processes that unfold over years, not months. The analysts’ forecast suggests they believe these efforts will reach a critical mass and start demonstrating tangible value to the market around that period. What Does a $292 Coinbase Price Target Mean for You? A raised Coinbase price target from a respected financial services firm like Cantor Fitzgerald is certainly positive news for existing shareholders and potential investors. However, it’s essential to view this within the broader context of market analysis and investment strategy. Benefits Highlighted: Validation of Coinbase’s strategic direction, particularly its diversification efforts. Potential for significant upside from the current trading price if the target is met. Indication of growing institutional confidence in the long-term viability of major crypto players. Potential Challenges & Considerations: Price targets are forecasts, not guarantees, and are subject to market volatility, regulatory changes, and execution risks by the company. Competition in the crypto exchange space remains fierce, with both centralized and decentralized platforms vying for market share. The broader crypto market’s health significantly impacts Coinbase’s performance. A downturn could negate positive company-specific developments. The timeline for sentiment shift (H2 2026/2027) is still several years away, requiring patience from investors. Actionable Insights: For investors, this report can serve as one data point among many. It reinforces the narrative that Coinbase is not standing still but is actively building for the future. However, any investment decision should be based on thorough personal research, understanding your own risk tolerance, and considering your overall portfolio strategy. Don’t rely solely on one analyst’s target, no matter how positive it seems. Comparing Analyst Views It’s also helpful to see how Cantor Fitzgerald’s target compares to others. While a comprehensive list is beyond the scope here, analyst ratings for Coinbase stock vary, reflecting different models, assumptions, and views on the crypto market’s future. Some analysts may have higher targets, others lower, and ratings range from ‘Buy’ to ‘Hold’ to ‘Sell’. The $292 target places Cantor Fitzgerald among the more optimistic outlooks currently reported. Understanding the range of analyst opinions provides a more balanced perspective on the potential paths forward for COIN. The Road Ahead for Coinbase and COIN Stock Coinbase operates at the intersection of traditional finance and the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. Its success is tied not only to its own execution but also to the broader adoption and regulation of cryptocurrencies globally. The endorsement from a financial services firm like Cantor Fitzgerald , with its increased Coinbase price target , underscores the growing mainstream attention and potential seen in this sector. The journey to $292 (or beyond, or below) will likely involve navigating complex regulatory landscapes, fending off competitors, and successfully launching and scaling those non-trading initiatives. The analysts’ belief in a sentiment shift by late 2026/2027 suggests they see these foundational efforts paying off and the market beginning to value Coinbase more like a diversified financial technology company than purely a transaction-based exchange. In Conclusion: A Bullish Signal Amidst Evolving Markets Cantor Fitzgerald’s decision to raise its Coinbase price target to $292 is a significant vote of confidence in the company’s operational strength and future growth potential, particularly its efforts to expand beyond core trading. While the anticipated major impact from new initiatives is still a few years out, the revised target provides a compelling outlook for the Coinbase stock . This move by a major financial services firm highlights the increasing maturity and complexity of the crypto market and the businesses operating within it. For investors, it’s a reminder that while volatility is inherent in the crypto space, many believe there is substantial long-term value to be unlocked by key players like Coinbase as the ecosystem continues to evolve.

The figure was revealed in Trump’s 2025 public financial disclosure, filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on June 13. The filing notes that Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in World Liberty Financial, which grants him voting rights within the organization. However, the document does not provide the market value of these tokens or whether the income was generated from token sales, staking rewards, or other mechanisms. The income is listed as “$57,437,927” with no further breakdown. A Bold Entry into the Crypto World World Liberty Financial, which launched in September 2024, is marketed as a decentralized finance (DeFi) initiative focused on dollar-pegged stablecoins and challenging traditional financial structures. Since its debut, WLFI has raised a total of $550 million —$200 million from its first public token sale and $250 million in the second, as disclosed in March 2025. The project has attracted attention from prominent crypto investors. Tron founder Justin Sun invested $30 million in November 2024, receiving 2 billion WLFI tokens at $0.015 each. In January, Web3Port invested $10 million, while Oddiyana Ventures joined as a strategic partner, though the amount of their investment remains undisclosed. Although the governance structure and utility of WLFI tokens remain vaguely defined in the filing, the reported income implies that Trump may have monetized part of his holdings or valued them based on high internal metrics. Trump and Digital Assets This is not the president’s first foray into digital assets. Previous disclosures revealed income from NFT-based ventures , including the Trump Digital Trading Cards collection. However, the latest filing shows no new earnings from NFTs. The president also retains titles in companies such as CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC, which are linked to digital ventures. While he still maintains positions in these entities, the filing indicates little or no income from them in the past year. The ethics disclosure concludes with Trump certifying that the information is “true, complete, and correct,” and it will now undergo review by the Office of Government Ethics.

The journalist laid out a valuation scenario originating from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s remarks about XRP capturing 14% of SWIFT’s global volume. At the 2025 APEX developer summit, the CEO predicted that XRP would capture 14% of SWIFT’s transaction volume in the next five years. Fruition Productions noted that capturing this portion of SWIFT’s $150 trillion in annual settlements would represent $21 trillion in value flowing through the XRP Ledger (XRPL). In that scenario, the asset could reach a price of $357 from a cross-border payment utility. If BRAD GARLINGHOUSE is right about $XRP taking 14% of the SWIFT network (150 trillion a year) then you would get 21 trillion in value on the XRPL network. That’s a $357 XRP price based on cross boarder payment utility. — Fruition Productions (@Fruition_Films) June 12, 2025 Increasing Utility and Adoption The calculation assumes XRP’s adoption in institutional financial networks and envisions a direct correlation between settlement volume and price. Fruition Productions clarified that this projection reflects utility-based pricing and is not dependent on speculation. This distinction separates the estimate from typical market-driven price targets. A follow-up post by the same account made an important point about Garlinghouse’s communication style, noting that CEOs tend to be conservative when speaking publicly. This suggests that XRP could play a more significant role in the global financial ecosystem, potentially capturing a larger portion of SWIFT’s transaction volume and reaching higher targets. Other Ripple executives have emphasized that the company is focused on driving real-world utility and long-term adoption rather than short-term price fluctuations. Gaining a dominant position in the cross-border payments market is a critical milestone in enhancing XRP’s functional value and broadening its global adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Institutional Strategy and Market Impact Brad Garlinghouse has long emphasized Ripple’s ambition to serve as a global payments infrastructure provider. His cautious approach in public statements is consistent with corporate leadership, but Fruition Productions’ posts suggest there’s room for optimism beyond what is publicly stated. With the XRPL offering fast, low-cost, and scalable settlement options, and given Ripple’s growing involvement in central bank digital currency (CBDC) development and enterprise integrations, the possibility of XRP exceeding a $357 valuation may not be entirely speculative. Ripple has been building partnerships with financial institutions across several regions, and XRP has already been integrated into payment corridors in Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East. Should XRP’s share of SWIFT-like traffic increase beyond 14%, the price ceiling could rise substantially, particularly if transactional demand drives daily usage volumes.

The outlook comes as Bitcoin stabilizes, following a pullback triggered by uncertainty tied to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. As of press time, BTC was trading at $105,124, down about 0.3% in the past 24 hours and more than 2% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, Bitcoin is trading above the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $103,326 and the 200-day SMA of $87,532, a sign of strength in both the short and long term. On the other hand, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 54.22, indicating neutral momentum, with room for further upside without immediate correction pressure. ChatGPT predicts Bitcoin price Regarding the price outlook, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s ChatGPT to gauge where Bitcoin might head over the next two weeks. According to the model, BTC could trade around $114,000 by July 1, likely between $111,000 and $117,000. The forecast is based on solid technical momentum, favorable historical trends, and steady institutional inflows. ChatGPT noted that 2025, a post-halving year, often brings Bitcoin gains. With continued ETF demand and institutional inflows, upward pressure will be seen throughout Q2. It also flagged $102,000 as key support. A drop below could lead to $98,000, while strong momentum could drive BTC to $120,000. Bitcoin AI price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts Bitcoin price Meanwhile, Grok, the AI model developed by xAI , offered a slightly more conservative view. Based on the current consolidation between $102,000 and $108,000, Grok projects Bitcoin will reach around $111,500 by July 1. The model noted Bitcoin’s tendency to post short-term gains after periods of sideways movement, especially in a supportive macro environment with continued ETF inflows. Assuming no major disruptions, Grok sees a reasonable 6% climb from current levels. However, Grok also outlined alternative scenarios: If resistance at $108,000 holds, a pullback to $103,000 could occur. Conversely, a breakout could push the price up to $116,000. In summary, both AI models remain bullish heading into July. The key focus is whether Bitcoin can hold the $105,000 level, a critical point for sustaining its upward momentum.

Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview CoinPedia’s Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction BCH Price Prediction 2025 Bitcoin Cash Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Bitcoin Cash Price Forecast 202 6 BCH Price Prediction 2027 Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2028 BCH Price Analysis 2029 Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Cash Token BCH Price $ 432.26845238 4.14% Market cap $ 8,594,978,703.6407 Circulating Supply 19,883,428.1250 Trading Volume $ 432,015,786.0378 All-time high $4,355.62 on 20th December 2017 All-time low $75.08 on 15th December 2018 CoinPedia’s Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction Coinpedia’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin Cash could potentially emerge as a more affordable version of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin Cash gains some hype in the coming months, then the BCH price can reach $701 in 2025. On the flip side, the BCH price can drop to $507 during that year. We expect the BCH price to create a new 2025 high of $701 during the upcoming altcoin season. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $507 $605 $701 BCH Price Prediction 2025 BCH’s price action has shown that, over the long term, it follows a multi-year trendline. Historically, during every bull run, the price has reversed after touching this long-term resistance line. In 2025, this pattern remains evident on the chart. The price lacked the strength to break above the multi-year trendline and reversed the strong gains seen on May 8th, even before reaching the dynamic trendline. After a failed breakout attempt on May 8th, BCH price consolidated and made another attempt in the third week. However, the momentum once again fell short, with the price getting rejected near the $433 resistance zone. In May’s final week, the crypto market shattered, and the BCH crypto market dipped significantly by June 1st week. The short-term crash lasted for 13 days before taking support from the dynamic 200-day EMA band. In the second week of June, the BCH price has jumped nearly 15% and trades near an important resistance zone. If Bullish momentum continues, then multi-year trendline resistance could be flipped by June end with $522 in sight, only if bullish momentum supports. Therefore, as seen in the past, if BCH fails to break out again, the $300 support level could step in to defend the decline, just as it has consistently done before. Furthermore, if BCH successfully breaks above the multi-year resistance trendline, then in the long term it would be a breakout from multi-year descending triangle formation, and the breakout could come big. As for this year, it could aim for a target of $710 by the end of 2025. On the other hand, if the breakout fails, the $300 support is expected to absorb the downside once again.

Understanding the prevailing sentiment is crucial for investors and traders alike. One of the most popular tools for gauging this collective mood is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Recently, this index has shown a significant shift, rising to 63 and firmly positioning itself within the ‘Greed’ zone. What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a unique tool designed by Alternative.me to visualize the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It aggregates various data points to produce a single number between 0 (Extreme Fear) and 100 (Extreme Greed). The core idea is that extreme fear can indicate a potential buying opportunity for those brave enough to enter a falling market, while extreme greed can signal that the market is due for a correction. Why does this matter? Because human psychology plays a massive role in financial markets. Fear can lead to panic selling, driving prices down further than fundamentals might suggest. Greed can lead to irrational exuberance, FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), and speculative buying, pushing prices into bubble territory. The index provides a snapshot of this emotional temperature, helping participants potentially make more rational decisions by understanding the crowd’s current mindset. Breaking Down the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Score The index categorizes sentiment across a spectrum: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed A reading of 63, as recently reported, falls comfortably within the ‘Greed’ category. This indicates that market participants are feeling optimistic, perhaps even euphoric, about current and future price movements. While not yet in the ‘Extreme Greed’ territory, it suggests a strong positive bias is currently dominating the Crypto Market Sentiment . Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have often coincided with market bottoms, presenting opportunities for long-term investors. Conversely, periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ have sometimes preceded market tops or significant pullbacks, as speculative excess becomes unsustainable. How is the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index Calculated? While often referred to in the context of the broader crypto market, the index is heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance, given its market dominance. The calculation incorporates six key factors, each weighted differently: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to average values. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): Compares current market volume and momentum to historical averages. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greedy or optimistic behavior. Social Media (15%): Analyzes tweets and posts for specific terms related to crypto, tracking sentiment and engagement speed. High interaction and positive sentiment can indicate growing greed. Surveys (15%): Polls users about their market sentiment. (Note: As mentioned in the source, surveys are currently paused, which might slightly affect this component’s input, although the weighting is applied to the remaining active factors). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Rising dominance can indicate fear (as investors move to the perceived ‘safer’ asset, BTC) or simply strong performance in Bitcoin itself. Falling dominance can signal increasing greed as altcoins rally more aggressively. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest, especially for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin bubble’, can signal fear, while terms related to buying or specific projects might suggest greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a more holistic view of the underlying Crypto Market Sentiment than simply looking at price charts alone. What Does Being in the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’ Mean for You? A reading of 63 in the ‘Greed’ zone carries several implications for those involved in the market: Potential Implications: Increased Optimism: Participants are generally feeling positive about the market’s direction. Higher Risk Appetite: Investors may be more willing to take on risk, potentially moving into more speculative altcoins. FOMO Setting In: The fear of missing out on potential gains can drive impulsive buying. Potential for Overheating: Markets driven purely by emotion and speculation can become detached from underlying value, increasing the risk of a sharp correction. While ‘Greed’ isn’t ‘Extreme Greed’, it serves as a yellow flag. It suggests caution is warranted. Prices may continue to rise, but the probability of a significant downturn increases as sentiment moves higher into the greed spectrum. Using the Crypto Fear and Greed Index in Your Crypto Investing Strategy The index is best used as one tool among many, not as a standalone signal. Here’s how it can fit into a broader Crypto Investing Strategy : Benefits: Sentiment Check: Provides a quick, aggregated view of market mood. Contrarian Indicator: Can help identify potential opportunities during ‘Extreme Fear’ (buy when others are fearful) or warn of potential tops during ‘Extreme Greed’ (be cautious when others are greedy). Historical Context: Comparing current readings to historical levels can offer perspective on where the market might be in its cycle. Challenges & Limitations: Not a Crystal Ball: The index cannot predict future price movements with certainty. A high greed score doesn’t guarantee an immediate crash, nor does a high fear score guarantee a bottom. Lagging Indicator: It reflects *current* sentiment, which is often a reaction to recent price action, not necessarily a predictor of future action. Component Reliance: Changes in the calculation method or data sources (like paused surveys) can affect its reliability. Bitcoin-Centric: While indicative of the overall market, it’s heavily weighted towards Bitcoin. Altcoin sentiment might differ. Actionable Insights: Combine with Analysis: Use the index alongside technical analysis (charts, patterns), fundamental analysis (project utility, adoption), and macroeconomic factors. Manage Risk: High greed scores are a good time to review your portfolio, potentially take some profits, set stop-losses, or reduce leverage. Avoid FOMO: When the index is high in the greed zone, resist the urge to chase rapidly rising prices. Stick to your predefined investment plan. Look for Opportunities in Fear: Conversely, low fear scores can signal potential buying opportunities if fundamentals remain strong. Think of the index as a temperature gauge for the market’s emotional state. It tells you if people are hot (greedy) or cold (fearful), but it doesn’t tell you *why* or *how long* that temperature will last. Historical Examples and the Greed Zone Looking back, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index has often provided interesting insights. For instance, during the peak of the 2017 bull run and the late 2020/early 2021 rally, the index consistently registered in the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone (often above 90). These periods were followed by significant market corrections. Conversely, during major crashes, like March 2020 or the bear market lows of 2022, the index plummeted into ‘Extreme Fear’ (sometimes below 10), which in hindsight, represented strong accumulation zones for long-term holders. Being in the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’ at 63 isn’t as extreme as those historical peaks, but it places the market firmly in a state where caution should start outweighing excessive optimism. It’s a reminder that trees don’t grow to the sky and corrections are a natural part of market cycles. What Could Shift the Crypto Market Sentiment? The index is constantly reacting to market forces. Several factors could cause the Crypto Market Sentiment to shift from its current greedy state: Significant Price Drop: A sharp decline in Bitcoin or other major cryptocurrencies would quickly inject fear into the market. Negative News: Regulatory crackdowns, exchange hacks, or major project failures can trigger widespread panic. Macroeconomic Changes: Shifts in global interest rates, inflation data, or recession fears can impact risk-on assets like crypto. Positive Developments: Conversely, positive news like institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, or technological breakthroughs could push the index further into Extreme Greed. Monitoring these external factors alongside the index provides a more robust understanding of potential future movements. Conclusion: Navigating Greed with Caution The rise of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 63 signifies that optimism and confidence are currently the dominant forces in the market, placing it firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone. While this reflects positive price action and momentum, it also serves as an important reminder to temper enthusiasm with prudence.

Bitcoin Solaris (BTC‑S), now in Phase 7 of its presale at $7, replicates that momentum with updated fundamentals and broader accessibility. Forecasts set token value at $20 at listing — an almost certain 186% return — while deeper growth potential lies ahead. The mechanics that drove TRON’s early success are now fueling BTC‑S. Tokenomics Designed for Value Retention BTC‑S operates on a hard cap of 21 million tokens, with only 4.2 million made available during presale. Every token allocation and phase detail is public and verifiable — no hidden vaults, no stealth minting. This transparency ensures that each BTC‑S token purchased today keeps its value intact as supply remains fixed. Early buyers who secured tokens at $5 or $7 locked in positions under material scarcity. The fewer tokens available, the stronger each remaining one becomes. Mining Participation Without Barriers TRON’s rise leaned heavily on network activity. BTC‑S goes further by enabling participation through ordinary smartphones. Through the Nova App beta, users verified that idle device resources — storage and CPU — generate BTC‑S smoothly and sustainably. That means network contributors aren’t limited to technical insiders; anyone with a compatible phone can earn rewards and help secure the system. This widespread participation model mirrors TRON’s early engagement — except it’s built on everyday hardware. Trusted Transparency Through Audits Trust in presale tokens hinges on early verification. BTC‑S has met this requirement. A smart contract review by Cyberscope confirmed token logic aligns with stated rules. Mobile mining infrastructure received additional vetting from Freshcoins , confirming functionality and reliability. Developer identities passed a full KYC verification , eliminating the anonymity common in early-stage tokens. These layers of verification elevate BTC‑S from speculation to substance. Crypto strategist Ben Crypto recently analyzed BTC‑S, drawing lines from TRON’s early model to Bitcoin Solaris’s structural setup. His insights highlight the capped token supply, mobile-first mining, and audit-backed confidence as reliable signals for future gains. He projects BTC‑S could reach $100 within a year of listing — suggesting gains beyond the initial 186% jump. Real Participation Builds Real Value At $7, BTC‑S offers access comparable to TRON’s early phases, but with improved infrastructure. Pricing is set before the public market opens, establishing a baseline for early return. If listing occurs at $20, investors see an automatic 186% gain. If utility and adoption follow, the climb to $100 becomes realistically attainable. That’s more than speculation — it’s calculated outcome based on adoption and demand. In both TRON and BTC‑S cases, the key driver is user-led action. TRON grew through developer backing and community engagement. BTC‑S adds a layer of passive user contribution via mobile mining. Every device added, every token mined reduces circulating supply and raises demand. The result is value generated from activity, not just hype or media buzz. As more people download and use the Nova App, the demand curve grows organically. That’s a self-reinforcing loop rarely found in token models. Accelerated Wealth: A Rare Opportunity Bitcoin Solaris has drawn over 11,000 investors and raised more than $3.8 million to date. Social channels are active. Mobile mining is live. Audits and KYC are in place. In a single stage, the project blends structural opportunity with execution. TRON’s early backers benefited from low entry points in a rising ecosystem. BTC‑S now delivers a comparable setup — with added certainty and accessibility. With Phase 7 nearing conclusion, final presale tokens remain limited. After that, tokens shift into public trading, which introduces volatility, broader buy-in, and reduced rewards for contributors. Early participants enjoy both pricing advantage and mining participation ahead of public launch. History shows that this timing matters — TRON’s early investors saw outsized returns because they acted before market tides shifted. BTC‑S offers the same timing advantage, modernized with structural clarity.

Price action remained relatively tight, with BTC moving within a $2,090 range from $104,220 to $106,135. The largest moves occurred overnight in Asia trading, where Bitcoin briefly dipped below $104,200 before rebounding on high volume. Much of the recent volatility has been driven by developments in the Middle East. The Israel-Iran war, which some analysts fear could spread to other parts of the Middle East, combined with trade tensions between the U.S. and some of its key trading partners, has unsettled risk markets. More than $1.1 billion in crypto liquidations were recorded during the initial wave of conflict headlines, though bitcoin has shown resilience in the aftermath. Traders appear to be leaning bullish in the medium term, as BTC continues to hold a pattern of higher lows despite intraday wobbles. Profit-taking near $106,000 capped upside momentum, but support near $105,000 continues to draw buyers on dips. Market participants are watching this range closely, particularly as safe-haven demand and risk sentiment remain intertwined. While short-term headlines continue to drive volatility, the broader structure suggests BTC is consolidating rather than reversing. If support around $104,950 holds, Bitcoin may attempt another push above $106,200. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC traded in a $2,090 range from $104,182 to $106,272 over the past 24 hours. A key bounce occurred at $104,182 with 15,342 BTC traded during the recovery. Resistance formed near $106,200 amid consistent profit-taking. A rising trendline of higher lows remains intact. Psychological support at $105,000 is holding for now. Recent price range: $104,875 to $105,202 in the last hour. A sharp dip below $105K at 07:19 reversed quickly, with $105,200 acting as near-term resistance. Final 15-minute candles showed minor exhaustion, but volume patterns suggest accumulation on dips.

This latest news about Clay, a sales automation firm, securing a substantial funding round is a prime example of where significant capital is flowing in the current tech environment. Significant Venture Capital Fuels Clay’s Growth Clay, a company focused on sales automation, has reportedly finalized a Series C startup funding round. According to sources familiar with the transaction, the round values the company at approximately $3 billion. The investment was led by Capital G, Alphabet’s independent growth fund. Neither Clay nor Capital G have publicly commented on the deal when asked. This new development follows closely on the heels of another significant event for the New York-based startup. Just a month prior, Clay announced a tender offer, allowing many employees to sell a portion of their shares at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sequoia spearheaded this secondary transaction, committing to purchase up to $20 million in employee stock. While employees who participated in the tender offer sold shares at half the reported new valuation, Clay’s co-founder and CEO, Kareem Amin, indicated in a previous interview that the company intends to conduct tender offers annually. This suggests future opportunities for employees to liquidate equity at potentially higher valuations. The Power of AI in Sales Automation Founded in 2017, Clay’s trajectory saw a significant acceleration a few years ago after a strategic pivot. CEO Kareem Amin decided to refocus the company on leveraging artificial intelligence to empower sales and marketing professionals. This shift aimed at helping teams efficiently discover key data points and automate their go-to-market strategies. Clay’s platform is designed to streamline core sales tasks. It assists salespeople in finding and updating lists of prospective customers and automating the process of writing personalized outreach emails. This focus on applying AI in sales processes has been a key driver of their recent growth and investor interest. Market Position and Competition in Sales Automation Today, Clay’s tools are utilized by thousands of customers. This includes large, well-known technology companies such as OpenAI, HubSpot, and Canva. Additionally, over 100 smaller consulting agencies use Clay to assist their own clients with go-to-market efforts. The sales automation market is competitive. Clay operates alongside established platforms and newer entrants, including companies like ZoomInfo, Lusha, Apollo.io, Unify, and Common Room. The substantial venture capital investment suggests that investors see Clay as having a strong position and significant potential within this crowded space, likely due to its specific AI-driven approach. Key Investors in the Series C Round and Beyond The latest Series C round was led by Capital G. This investment builds upon support from existing investors who have participated in previous funding rounds. Notable existing investors in Clay include: Sequoia Meritech Capital Boldstart Ventures Maple VC First Round Capital Box Group The participation of these prominent firms across multiple rounds underscores continued investor confidence in Clay’s business model and growth prospects in the competitive sales automation sector, particularly as it leverages AI in sales . Summary: A Significant Milestone Clay’s reported $3 billion valuation in its latest startup funding round, led by Capital G, marks a significant milestone for the sales automation company. This rapid increase in valuation, coming shortly after a tender offer at a lower price, highlights the intense investor interest in companies effectively applying AI to solve real-world business problems like sales and marketing efficiency. The substantial capital infusion positions Clay to further develop its platform and expand its reach in the dynamic sales automation market, fueled by continued venture capital support and the successful execution of its AI in sales strategy.

45993052,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746602,1749895221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45993052.jpeg,Hackers use Discord invite links to deliver malware,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/discord-invite-link-malware-crypto-wallets/,"A new campaign of malware targeting crypto users via Discord invite links has been uncovered. According to information, the new malware exploits a weakness in Discord’s invitation system to deliver an information stealer known as Skuld and the AsyncRAT remote access trojan. In a report by Check Point, the platform mentioned that the attackers hijack the links through vanity link registration, which allows them to easily redirect users from trusted sources to malicious servers. “The attackers combined the ClickFix phishing technique, multi-stage loaders, and time-based evasions to stealthily deliver AsyncRAT, and a customized Skuld Stealer targeting crypto wallets,” Check Point said. According to the platform, one of the uses of Discord’s invite mechanism is that it allows attackers to hijack expired or deleted invite links and secretly redirect unsuspecting users to different malicious servers under their control. This means that a Discord invite link, which was previously shared for a legitimate purpose on social media and other forums could be used to lead users to their malicious servers and platforms. Discord invite link hijacked for malicious purposes This development comes a little over a month after the cybersecurity firm revealed another sophisticated phishing campaign that hijacked expired vanity links to entice users into joining a Discord server, instructing them to visit a phishing site to verify ownership. The malicious actors eventually used the platform to gain illegal access to the users’ digital wallets and drain their wallets after connecting them. While users are allowed to create temporary, permanent, or custom invite links on Discord, the platform does not allow other legitimate servers to reclaim a previously expired or deleted invite link. However, if a user creates a custom link, they can reuse the expired invite codes and even some deleted permanent invite codes in some cases. This ability to reuse expired or deleted codes when creating custom vanity invite links allows criminals to abuse it, with most of them claiming them for their malicious servers. “This creates a serious risk: Users who follow previously trusted invite links (e.g., on websites, blogs, or forums) can unknowingly be redirected to fake Discord servers created by threat actors,” Check Point said. According to the report, Discord invite link hijacking involves using a legitimate invite link shared by communities to redirect users to a malicious server. Victims of this scheme are asked to complete a verification stamp, which involves entering several details to gain full access to the server. This is done by authorizing a bot, which leads them to a fake website where they are mandated to verify the information provided. After this, the scammers use a social engineering tactic to trick users into infecting their systems. Malicious actors steal wallet seed phrases with malware According to the report, the Skuld malware is capable of harvesting crypto wallet seed phrases from the Exodus and Atomic crypto wallets. It carries out this activity using an approach called wallet injection, replacing the original version of the application files with versions loaded with trojans downloaded from GitHub. Another payload is a Goland information stealer that can be downloaded from Bitbucket. It is used to steal sensitive data from Discord, various browsers, crypto wallets , and gaming platforms. Check Point added that it also identified another malicious campaign being carried out by the same threat actor where it distributed the loader as a modified version of a hack tool for unlocking pirated hams. The program, according to the report, has been downloaded 350 times on Bitbucket. Victims of these campaigns are primarily located in the United States, France, Slovakia, the Netherlands, Austria, Vietnam, and the United Kingdom. The findings show the latest example of how cybercriminals have been targeting the platform. “This campaign illustrates how a subtle feature of Discord’s invite system, the ability to reuse expired or deleted invite codes in vanity invite links, can be exploited as a powerful attack vector,” the researchers said. “By hijacking legitimate invite links, threat actors silently redirect unsuspecting users to malicious Discord servers.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

A Chicago trading firm put up $100 million to buy 4 million shares in Trump Media & Technology Group. That move comes just nine weeks after US regulators closed a probe into the same firm. Based on reports, the deal is tied to TMTG’s plan to buy over $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin.

Grumbach (@JakeMGrumbach) June 14, 2025 Institutional Backers Rally Jane Street leads the pack with a $375 million stake in the Trump Group. That makes it the largest backer so far. Other investors are also lining up. Based on reports, TMTG’s goal is to raise $2.5 billion and use much of that cash to buy Bitcoin. If all goes to plan, the firm could hold over 140,000 BTC at current prices. Regulatory Milestone Achieved On Friday, June 13, the SEC declared TMTG’s registration statement for its Bitcoin Treasury offering effective. That covers 56 million new shares of equity and 29 million in convertible notes. Clearing this step means the company can sell shares and raise the cash it needs. It also subjects TMTG to ongoing SEC reporting and oversight. Voice Of The Crypto Industry Meanwhile, a DRW spokesperson called for a fresh look at the SEC and CFTC. The firm argued that the current regulators don’t match the pace of global market changes. Over the years, DRW’s crypto arm, Cumberland, bought 70,000 BTC in a US government auction of Silk Road assets. That stash is worth about $7.7 billion today. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million?

The fusion of digital coins and gaming has transformed virtual passion into real-world earnings, creating a booming digital economy. Currently, the gaming sector commands a market capitalization of $17.75 billion, marking a 5.03% increase — a clear sign of rising adoption and investor interest. Gaming tokens are no longer just in-game assets; they’ve become strategic investment engines. Leading the charge are tokens like FLOKI (3.94%), VIRTUAL (1.93%), SAND (1.72%), MANA (1.67%), and RENDER (1.07%), each contributing to the sector’s growing dominance and market share. As adoption accelerates, these tokens are poised for potential value appreciation. To help navigate this high-growth niche, CoinPedia’s expert panel has compiled a well-researched guide covering the top 10 gaming tokens with massive potential for gains in 2025. ImmutableX (IMX) Claimed as the first Layer-2 scaling solution for the NFTs built on the Ethereum ecosystem, ImmutableX focuses on increasing efficiency, user experience, liquidity, and scalability. Through it, users can create large quantities of ERC-20 & ERC-721 tokens and distribute them. Despite recording a drop of ~74% YTD, IMX is one of the most-valued gaming projects in the crypto-verse. With a market capitalization of $871.23 million, this altcoin has secured the 75th position in the global cryptocurrency list. Render (RNDR) Render is a decentralized GPU rendering network that allows users to contribute unused GPU power to help render digital content such as 3D models, animations, and virtual effects. With a primary focus on visual effects, motion graphics, and 3D rendering, Render has contributed immensely to the blockchain gaming sector. Ranked 48th in the global crypto market, RNDR boasts a market capitalization of $1.79 billion and holds a 1.07% share of the gaming sector. Decentraland (MANA) Another successful project built on the Ethereum ecosystem, Decentraland boasts a decentralized metaverse that is built, owned, and governed by its users. Similar to other gaming platforms, Decentraland offers plots called “LAND” that participants can buy and access. Notably, “ MANA ” is the native token of Decentraland and is used as an in-game transaction medium. The growing adoption of Decentraland could push the token toward a new high during this altcoin market. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Virtuals Protocol ranked 63rd in the global crypto market, with a market cap of $1.21 billion. Positioned as a foundational layer for AI-driven, co-owned gaming agents, this network bridges the gap between AI and immersive virtual environments.

As the Metaverse evolves, Virtuals Protocol stands out for enabling next-gen virtual interactions and concreting its role as a key infrastructure player in blockchain-powered gaming. Floki (FLOKI) Created on the Ethereum chain, the Floki memecoin is inspired by Elon Musk’s dog. This Shiba Inu-themed meme is also a part of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community. Moreover, this was one of the first people’s crypto tokens to be introduced in the cryptocurrency market . Primarily used as a native token in the NFT gaming metaverse called “Valhalla.” Floki has successfully partnered with giant crypto projects such as Chainlink, Trader Joe, and ApeSwap for its “FlokiFi Locker” digital asset locker protocol. With a market cap of $764.4 million, this gaming token has secured the 85th position. Axie Infinity (AXS) Axie Infinity is a pioneer in blockchain-based play-to-earn games, which allows players to collect, breed, battle, and trade in-game creatures called Axies. AXS, the native token of the network, empowers its users through governance voting, staking for passive rewards, and in-game functionalities like breeding and event participation. Once a lagship GameFi project during the 2021 boom, AXS now holds a market capitalization of $379.63 million and ranks 135th in the global crypto market. We can expect this token to perform well once the bullish momentum kicks off. The Sandox (SAND) The Sandbox project with a unique approach of allowing its users to create their own games with the application of their visual scripting tools. Notably, these games require no prior coding and development knowledge. Moreover, players can also make games and store assets on LAND (digital real estate). “SAND” tokens act as the mode of payment for the Sandbox ecosystem. With newer partnerships and increased adoption, this altcoin has recorded impressive growth in 2024. With a maintained bullish sentiment, this project may head toward a new high in 2025. MultiversX (EGLD) MultiversX is a unique blockchain protocol that offers a variety of services to its users. Reportedly, with its true horizontal scalability and sharding, it offers an efficient and secure network and transaction chain. By including decentralized finance, real-world assets, and the Metaverse, this project is a marvel of the gaming industry. Moreover, its users pay transaction fees in “EGLD”, and validators participate in the consensus process. The EGLD allows developers to deploy smart contracts, protocols, and dApps on the platform. Further, it empowers participants to perform uninterrupted and open network action. Through its staking, validation rewards, and transaction fees, the EGLD token has borne all the load of the MultiversX network. Beam (BEAM) Built by the Merit Circle DAO, the Beam project is a gaming application. The ecosystem’s native token, “BEAM”, also acts as a mode of payment. The Beam SDK, its core component, is a “flexible software development kit” that helps game developers access various tools to structure their in-game blockchain elements. With a potential Altcoin season around the corner, the gaming sector is prepared to mirror the 2021 rally and potentially achieve a new high during 2025. This makes this budding gaming project a potential pick for an investor’s gaming portfolio. Gala Games (GALA) Built by a Layer-1 blockchain, GalaChain , the Gala project is a unique Web3 model. Primarily built to power the Gala entertainment, this ecosystem initially included the Gala Games, Gala Music, and Gala Film. Notably, it is now accessible to external developers across industries. With the idea of empowering visionaries and creators across global industries, this project aims to become the world’s first billion-user blockchain. By allowing assets built on its chain to be bridged to other blockchains, across the crypto-verse, this altcoin has gained the attention of top investors and institutes. With a market cap of $689.1 million, this project continues to play a key role in the gaming segment.

Small recoveries, rising price patterns, and renewed interest in major names are back. Pi Network has gained 15% recently. Uniswap (UNI) has also jumped 28%, showing strong momentum for well-known projects. Each one is getting attention for different reasons. Pi is in the spotlight for its long-awaited changes, while Uniswap is making headlines by reaching new highs. But beyond all these names, one project stands out more than any other: BlockDAG (BDAD) . With over $303 million collected in its presale and a current batch price $0.0276, BlockDAG is turning heads. More than 22.4 billion coins have already been sold. Its progress and energy in this early phase make it the most talked-about project. While others are still warming up, BlockDAG is already proving its strong position in the crypto market. Pi Network Shows Signs of a Comeback Pi Network is showing fresh signs of life. The price went up by 15% in early June. This came after a strong RSI signal, suggesting that the long, quiet phase could now be turning into an upward trend. However, most Pi trading is still limited to wrapped coins or placeholder versions. Full exchange listings have not yet happened. Even so, Pi’s global base of tens of millions of users stays active. Many traders are watching to see if a breakout above resistance levels will come next. But until a full mainnet and exchange use arrive, full value remains delayed. Uniswap Surges 28%, Nears All-Time High Uniswap (UNI) has recently gone up by 28%. This growth came after a wider 40% price increase. It brings the coin close to its all-time high. A report from buyX suggests this growth is tied to new interest in decentralised finance. Uniswap remains a top project in that space. The project benefits from strong protocol revenue and ongoing coin burns. Expected governance changes could also increase yields. Uniswap has also gained from better regulation in some key areas. But because of its large market size, future gains might be smaller than smaller, growing names. BlockDAG Presale Accelerates with $303M Raised and Growing Demand BlockDAG is moving fast and showing strong performance during its presale. It has now raised over $303 million and is currently in Batch 29. Each BDAG coin is now priced at $0.0276. From Batch 1 to Batch 29, the return on price has grown by 2660%. This strong growth is drawing attention. Over 22.4 billion coins have been sold so far. Buyers are continuing to join in every day. Along with coins, BlockDAG’s mining equipment is also in demand. The total amount made from miner sales is now over $7.2 million. More than 17,950 miners have been sold. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles is one of the main attractions. This feature gives the highest daily buyer the leftover coins from that day’s batch. These extra coins range between 25 million and 150 million BDAG. So far, over $1.26 million worth of bonus coins has been distributed through this system. This adds daily excitement and keeps users active. Unlike other projects that only make promises, BlockDAG has already built and launched tools. Its X1 mining app has over 1.5 million users. The app is mobile-friendly and allows mining without heavy hardware. This builds trust and encourages early use of the system. The presale has a total of 45 price rounds. With over 22.3 billion coins already sold, the window for early access is closing quickly. Final Verdict This year has been full of price rebounds and renewed hype, but BlockDAG is offering more than just talk. Pi Network is still relying on what could happen in the future. Uniswap is a well-known name, but it may not deliver big future jumps. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is showing real numbers and real usage. With more than $303 million raised, 22.4 billion coins sold, and daily buying rewards, it brings fresh energy to the crypto space. Its mobile app already has over 1.5 million users. Sales of mining machines have passed $7.2 million, and over 17,950 units have been sold. 28 out of 45 batches sold out, it’s a clear front-runner in crypto growth.

45992932,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70928,1749895258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"$1,000 in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Now Could Be $20,000 Later — Here’s the Case",https://timestabloid.com/1000-in-mutuum-finance-mutm-now-could-be-20000-later/,"In the ongoing dynamics of decentralized finance, opportunities to invest early in projects with massive upside are rare. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as one of those rare gems. With a current price around $0.03, a total supply of 4 billion tokens, and over $10.55 million raised during Phase 5 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building strong momentum. For anyone who invests $1,000 today, the road ahead promises a journey that will turn that modest hold into $20,000 or more as the platform scales and utility expands. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Demands Attention Now Unlike many projects that begin with sky-high prices and leave little room for growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trading below $0.03 despite generating significant capital—over $10.55 million—through its presale phases. Early investors who bought during Phase 1 paid even less, presenting a clear path for strong returns. The price gap between Phase 1 and the current price shows how users have already profited handsomely, yet a large portion of the token supply remains locked, promising greater demand as more tokens hit exchanges. With over 11,900 holders already participating, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a vibrant community, which adds social proof to its growing traction. The upcoming beta platform launch will be a crucial ignition point, driving adoption and unlocking the full potential of MUTM’s utilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed on Layer-2 blockchain technology, delivering fast and low-cost transactions. This technical edge resolves common DeFi problems such as network congestion and high fees, offering a smoother, more efficient user experience. This will attract a wider audience, from casual crypto holders to institutional players looking for reliable and scalable DeFi solutions. One of the most exciting features in development is Mutuum’s decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike traditional stablecoins that depend on centralized reserves, this stablecoin will be minted algorithmically using assets locked on the Mutuum platform. This design ensures full transparency and automatic supply adjustment, creating a stable borrowing asset that strengthens the entire ecosystem. This stablecoin will also recycle interest payments back into the platform, reinforcing Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s treasury and enabling new utility pathways for users, including staking rewards. How Users Benefit Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s native token, MUTM, plays a key role in the protocol’s ecosystem. Passive dividends will be distributed using a portion of protocol revenue, which is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market. These purchased tokens are then sent to participants who stake mtTokens in the protocol’s safety module. This compounding income model is designed to reward long-term holders and active participants, creating a steady growth cycle for capital invested in the ecosystem. The token also ties directly into Mutuum’s dual lending engine. In pool-based lending (P2C), users deposit popular assets like ETH or DAI into liquidity pools and earn annual interest rates that vary based on the pool’s utilization rate—these can range from moderate to attractive double-digit yields. For example, depositing $1,600 worth of ETH into the protocol at current rates could generate steady passive income on top of any price appreciation of MUTM tokens. In peer-to-peer lending (P2P), users will be able to lend and borrow less common tokens not usually available on pool platforms, such as memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB). This opens unique opportunities for higher returns and diversification, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a more versatile ecosystem than many competitors. Why $20,000 From $1,000 Is a Realistic Forecast The current MUTM token price sits at approximately $0.03. A rise to $0.60 per token—20X the current price—would make a $1,000 investment worth $20,000. This valuation is well within reach given Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s strong fundamentals, growing user base, and upcoming beta release that will begin unlocking the platform’s full functionality. Beyond $0.60, a price of $1.50 is not out of the question as the protocol expands its user base, rolls out Layer-2 speed advantages, and introduces its decentralized stablecoin. Such growth will multiply early investors’ gains by 50X, turning $1,000 into $50,000, underscoring the huge upside potential. The project’s CertiK audit, completed in May 2025, confirms strong contract security with a Token Scan Score of 80.00, reassuring investors that the platform is robust and ready for mainstream adoption. The price advantage that early investors in Phase 1 enjoyed is gradually narrowing, which means that waiting for later phases to join will likely offer less upside. The protocol’s roadmap reveals that major development milestones, including the beta launch, marketing campaigns, and ongoing $100,000 giveaway , are set to accelerate user acquisition and liquidity growth. As more tokens circulate, the demand effect and platform utility will push the price higher. The Bigger Picture: A $2.5 Billion Market Cap Within Reach DeFi projects with real use cases and scalable platforms can reach market capitalizations in the billions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s supply of 4 billion tokens and robust dual lending system, combined with the upcoming decentralized stablecoin, set the stage for a market cap exceeding $2.5 billion. This target is grounded in real utility, not speculation. As the platform gains traction through Layer-2 efficiencies and diverse lending options, MUTM’s token demand will rise accordingly. This makes the $20,000 return from a $1,000 investment a conservative estimate of what’s structurally possible. Delaying entry means missing the early phases’ price advantage and the compounding benefits of mtTokens and passive income streams. This is more than an investment—it’s a strategic move to capture value in the next wave of DeFi innovation.

Now serving his second term as the 47th President, Trump isn’t just making headlines in politics. His presence in the crypto world is growing too, with a digital asset portfolio valued at nearly $1.5 million. Crypto Whale in the White House According to Arkham Intelligence , Trump’s crypto holdings currently total $1,486,397.26. The standout in his wallet is TROG, a meme coin featuring a frog with Trump’s image, worth $948.7K. His portfolio also includes Ethereum, USDC stablecoin, and his own TRUMP meme coin. While his current holdings are impressive, they’re a big drop from their previous high of $32 million, showing just how unpredictable the crypto market can be. Billion-Dollar Crypto Profits Power Trump’s Empire Trump’s profits from crypto go far beyond what he’s currently holding. Forbes reports that he’s made over $1 billion from crypto-related ventures, adding to his estimated $5.6 billion net worth. Here’s a quick breakdown: His NFT collection earned $7 million, with $4 million after taxes. The Trump family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, is expected to bring in $390 million, with $246 million net. His TRUMP meme coin has generated $350 million in trading fees. Altogether, Trump’s estimated crypto stake stands at $1.2 billion. And with the market heating up again, many believe his portfolio could double in value in the next bull run. Cohen Proposes Budget-Friendly Birthday for Trump Not everyone is thrilled about the $45 million celebration. Congressman Steve Cohen (D-TN) introduced the HAPPY BIRTHDAY Budget Act (H.R. 2761), a light-hearted proposal suggesting a more modest celebration for Trump. Trump’s $45M birthday parade is days away—some estimates say $90M. A mountain of YOUR tax dollars wasted so one man can feel like a king. I introduced the HAPPY BIRTHDAY Budget Act to stop it. Not one Republican signed on.

While symbolic, it reflects the ongoing debate around public spending, especially when Trump’s crypto wealth is grabbing headlines. The Bigger Picture Donald Trump’s 79th birthday is a reminder of how deeply he’s involved in crypto. From meme coins and NFTs to billion-dollar profits, Trump is proving that digital assets are becoming a bigger part of political and financial influence. And with crypto markets showing signs of recovery, his holdings could play an even bigger role in the coming months.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-14 10:03:24

With market sentiment turning cautiously optimistic, savvy investors are scanning for tokens with strong narratives, rising adoption, and technical setups that echo previous bull cycles. In this piece, we spotlight five altcoins poised to explode in the coming quarter—projects that could deliver outsized returns just as legacy coins start to lag. SHIB Set for Big Gains as Crypto Market Eyes Bull Run Source: tradingview Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin known for its fun. It drew attention in 2021 with massive gains. Created initially as a “DogeCoin killer”, it's part of the Ethereum ecosystem. SHIB is affordable and has a strong community backing it. The team is working on Shibarium, a layer-2 solution aimed at faster and cheaper transactions. These innovations could boost its use and value. Patterns similar to 2021 show potential for another altcoin season. In this market, SHIB's low price and growing utility make it a tempting choice for investors looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Solana Shines Bright: The Next Big Bet in Crypto's Bull Run Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is grabbing attention as a rising star in the crypto space. It's a blockchain known for its fast and low-cost transactions, making it a worthy contender for the top spot. SOL's smart contract capabilities compete with Ethereum, but with greater speed and less fees. As the market looks for efficient platforms, Solana's potential grows. Many see its value surging in the next altcoin season. With more developers building on its network and a committed community, Solana is hard to ignore. Even after recent market dips, Solana's strong tech and growth signals make it an attractive pick in this cycle. Stellar (XLM): Bright Future Ahead Despite Market Dip Source: tradingview Stellar (XLM) is a digital currency designed for fast and low-cost international transfers. It allows users to send money across borders quickly using its cutting-edge blockchain technology. Even with recent market slumps, patterns reminiscent of 2021 suggest optimism. Stellar's focus on banking the unbanked and partnering with financial giants is promising. As major players embrace blockchain, XLM's utility may skyrocket. Its potential to streamline global payments makes it an exciting option in this cycle. Embracing decentralized financial solutions might be the edge investors are seeking, positioning XLM as a standout pick in the current market.

In May 2021, DGB attained an all-time high of $0.1825, before dropping more than 95% below. This decline has not reduced the interest of long-term holders and developers in the project. DigiByte could be one of the coins that attract the attention of investors again, given its solid fundamentals, community, and emphasis on security in its design, particularly in the case of an improvement in market conditions. In this DigiByte price prediction, we take a look at the short-term price potential of DigiByte, areas of support, and the technical indicators in our price prediction to determine what will be a possible move in terms of price for DigiByte.

The resistance is positioned at $0.00830, where the price faced strong rejection. Key support now lies at $0.00800, marking an important level for potential bullish defence. As of June 14, 2025, DigiByte (DGB) has extended its downward trajectory, having a 0.40% decline in the past 24 hours. The price now trades at $0.00816, signalling sustained bearish momentum. Sellers continue to dominate the market, with minimal signs of buyer interest at current levels. This ongoing slide underscores prevailing market weakness and cautious investor sentiment. Digibyte 24-hour chart analysis shows price drop as bearish momentum takes Control On the 24-hour chart, DigiByte (DGB) has shown continued bearish pressure, trading at $0.00816. The price reflects a downward trend, marked by consecutive red candles and a failure to hold previous support levels. This shows an ongoing dominance by sellers and a lack of bullish momentum. DigiByte Price Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.96, moving just above the oversold zone of 30. Its position below the 40.34 moving average suggests weak buyer activity and reinforces the bearish sentiment in the market. RSI has remained subdued for several sessions, indicating sustained selling without meaningful recovery attempts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence remains in bearish territory. The line is at -0.000404 and sits below the signal line at -0.000325. This divergence between the two lines points to prolonged downside momentum. The histogram also reflects negative pressure, with no bullish crossover in sight. DigiByte 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, DigiByte (DGB) continues to show weakness, trading at $0.00816 with bearish pressure intact. The price attempted a recovery but was quickly rejected near the $0.00822 level, confirming a lack of bullish strength. Sellers remain in control, keeping the asset below key resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 28.99, in oversold territory and below its moving average of 32.92. This indicates that despite being oversold, there is still no strong buying activity emerging to reverse the trend. RSI conditions suggest the asset may stay suppressed unless momentum shifts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also supports the bearish outlook. The MACD line is at -0.000239, while the signal line follows at -0.000215. Though the histogram shows a slight easing in bearish strength, the MACD has not yet crossed above the signal line, signalling that selling pressure remains in place.

Volume trends will help confirm the strength behind any breakout or breakdown. Is DigiByte a good investment? DigiByte offers strong long-term potential due to its secure proof-of-work blockchain and fast 15-second block times. Transactions confirm in just 1.5 minutes, making it practical for everyday use. Its active community and committed developers continue to drive innovation. These features position DigiByte as a solid choice for investors seeking real-world utility and strong technology.

The RSI14 climbed from near-oversold levels of 30.5 to 34.08, sparking short-term buying interest. At the same time, price was stable around the key $0.00787 low, with resistance at the 10-day SMA near $0.00882. The ongoing community initiatives around adoption and supply reduction may be improving sentiment, even as overall market liquidity remains down. Will DigiByte reach $1? Based on the recent upward trend, DigiByte’s price can reach $1 if positive market conditions and investor sentiment continue. Will DigiByte reach $10? Reaching $10 for DigiByte is highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term due to its current price levels and the significant market capitalisation required. Does DigiByte have a good long-term future? DigiByte has potential for a strong long-term future due to several key factors. Firstly, it boasts a robust, secure blockchain with a focus on speed and efficiency, making it one of the fastest and most decentralised blockchains in the market.

However, we expect DigiByte to start a cautious recovery. Throughout the year, the price is projected to trend upward. Will DGB manage to reach a new all-time high? In that case, the price of DGB could significantly increase. DigiByte Historic Price Sentiment DigiByte Price History: Coinmarketcap DigiByte’s native token, DGB, was introduced into the market back in 2014. DigiByte price remained at $0.01 for a couple of days before dropping even further towards $0.0003. The altcoin did not excel during its early days, and most investors opted to acquire other, more prominent digital assets. Nevertheless, the DigiByte cryptocurrency began to grow gradually and started amassing capital. Digibyte (DGB) hovered within $0.0003 for about three years before spiking during the spring of 2017. Investors who acquired DGB early made a threefold profit when the Digibyte price reached $0.001. For once, the DigiByte cryptocurrency market cap started to spell tens of millions of dollars. During the fall of 2017, a well-known payment platform, Paytomat, added support for DGB. On top of that, popular crypto exchanges listed the cryptocurrency. As a result, the DGB price started growing more resolutely. Early into 2018, the price of DGB reached a record high of 13 cents per DGB token and $1.2 billion in total market capitalization. Unfortunately, the pull-back phase knocked in and drove the cryptocurrency downwards. The sharp retracement transformed into a broad bearish trend, and indicators dropped. Another notable pricing event occurred when the price of DGB rose from $0.017 to $0.049 in April 2018, gaining more than 185 percent. Afterward, its price plummeted to a low of $0.004 in 2020. In January 2021, one DGB traded at $0.025 after a substantial rally. At the time of writing, one DigiByte token retails at $0.043. In October 2021 the price increased again to roughly $0.07. In Jan 2022 DigiByte’s price was around $0.05 and then price peaked again at approximately $0.125 in April the same year. In the year 2023 the price was around $0.02 in January and price range between $0.1 to $0.02 fo the rest of the year. DigiByte faced a slight increase to about $0.022 in January. Between June and July 2024,the price stabilized around $0.0076. In the following months, the price of DigiByte dropped sharply as it made a low below $0.006 in November. DGB price continued to consolidate below $0.009 in early 2025. As of June 2025, DigiByte trades at $0.00814, reflecting a modest rebound from its mid-2024 stabilization around $0.0076.",Crypto Price Predictions|altcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|LTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-14 10:10:00
45993436,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=169177,1749895825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45993436.jpeg,Donald Trump Crypto Earnings: Massive $57.3 Million Revealed from World Liberty Financial,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-crypto-earnings-disclosure/,"BitcoinWorld Donald Trump Crypto Earnings: Massive $57.3 Million Revealed from World Liberty Financial The intersection of politics and digital assets continues to be a hot topic, and a recent report has brought it sharply into focus. Imagine earning tens of millions from a stake in a decentralized finance (DeFi) project. That’s exactly what happened for U.S. President Donald Trump, whose latest financial disclosure reveals substantial Donald Trump crypto earnings from his ownership in World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Unpacking the Trump Financial Disclosure: $57.3 Million from Crypto According to a report by NBC News, citing President Trump’s 2025 financial disclosure released by the Office of Government Ethics, he earned approximately $57.35 million last year from his stake in World Liberty Financial. This significant sum primarily came from token sales associated with the project. The financial disclosure document itself is a hefty read, totaling 234 pages. A considerable portion, 145 pages, is dedicated to detailing Trump’s various stock and bond investments. However, it’s the mention of earnings from a digital asset project like WLFI that captures significant attention in the cryptocurrency space. Here are some key takeaways from the disclosure regarding this specific earning: Source of Income: World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Amount Earned: Approximately $57.35 million. Primary Method: Earnings derived mainly from token sales. Timeframe Covered: Calendar year 2024. What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and How Did it Generate DeFi Earnings? The report identifies World Liberty Financial (WLFI) as a DeFi project. For those new to the concept, DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, refers to financial activities conducted on a blockchain network without traditional intermediaries like banks. These projects often involve lending, borrowing, trading, and earning yield through smart contracts. The disclosure states that Trump’s earnings from WLFI were primarily from “token sales.” In the crypto world, token sales are a common way for projects to raise funds and distribute their native tokens to early investors or the public. The nature of Trump’s stake – whether he was an early investor, advisor, or held a different kind of ownership – is not explicitly detailed in the snippet, but the mechanism of earning was through the sale of these tokens. Understanding how DeFi earnings like this can materialize involves recognizing the potential value appreciation of a project’s native token. If a project gains traction and its token price increases, selling a large holding of these tokens can result in substantial profits, as appears to be the case here. Why Does a Political Figure’s Crypto Portfolio Matter? The financial activities of political figures crypto holdings are subject to intense scrutiny. Financial disclosures serve a crucial purpose: promoting transparency and identifying potential conflicts of interest. When a high-profile politician holds significant stakes in specific companies or projects, especially in emerging and less-regulated sectors like crypto and DeFi, it raises questions about: Potential influence on policy or regulation concerning that sector. How their public statements might impact the value of their holdings. The source and nature of the wealth being accumulated. President Trump has had a complex relationship with cryptocurrency, previously expressing skepticism but more recently showing openness and even launching his own line of NFTs and engaging with the crypto community. The TRUMP Memecoin: A Separate Story It’s important to note what this particular disclosure does *not* cover. The report explicitly states that the document, covering the calendar year 2024, does not include earnings from Trump’s popular memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP). Memecoins are a volatile and speculative class of cryptocurrencies often created around internet memes, cultural trends, or, in this case, political figures. The TRUMP memecoin gained significant popularity and saw considerable trading volume, particularly in late 2024 and early 2025. Any earnings Trump may have received from activities related to the TRUMP memecoin would fall under the financial disclosure covering the calendar year 2025, which will be released next year. This distinction highlights the different ways political figures are engaging with the digital asset space – from stakes in specific projects like World Liberty Financial to the creation or association with culturally driven tokens like memecoins. Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Politics and Digital Assets The revelation of such substantial Donald Trump crypto earnings from a DeFi project underscores the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance, reaching even the highest levels of political leadership. As the crypto market matures and adoption grows, we are likely to see more instances of public officials holding and reporting digital asset holdings. This trend brings both opportunities and challenges. For the crypto industry, it can signal growing legitimacy and adoption. For the political sphere, it necessitates clear guidelines, robust disclosure mechanisms, and careful consideration of potential ethical implications. The World Liberty Financial earnings, as detailed in the latest Trump financial disclosure , serve as a powerful example of the significant wealth being generated within the digital asset ecosystem and the importance of transparency as these assets become part of public officials’ financial portfolios. As the landscape continues to evolve, understanding the nature of these holdings, the mechanisms of earning (like token sales and DeFi earnings ), and the regulatory framework surrounding them will be crucial for both the public and policymakers. The involvement of high-profile political figures crypto investments ensures this remains a closely watched area. Summary: A Glimpse into High-Profile Crypto Wealth President Donald Trump’s 2025 financial disclosure has provided a rare glimpse into the significant crypto earnings being realized by high-profile individuals. The reported $57.3 million from his stake in World Liberty Financial, primarily through token sales, highlights the potential profitability within the DeFi space. This disclosure, while extensive, covers earnings only up to the end of 2024, leaving potential future revelations regarding other digital assets, like the TRUMP memecoin, for subsequent reports. It reinforces the growing presence of digital assets in political finance and the ongoing need for transparency and clear ethical considerations in this evolving domain.

Backed by growing institutional interest, regulatory clarity, and a dedicated community, XRP is emerging as a serious contender for the next major move—even as BTC hesitates. This article breaks down the technical signals, market behavior, and broader trends suggesting why XRP could surge ahead while the rest of the market treads water. Bitcoin Bulls Struggle as Battle Wages on Price Frontlines Source: tradingview Bitcoin wavers around one hundred five thousand, indicating a challenging period for bulls. Bears seem to have a slight edge with the price hovering below resistance at nearly one hundred eleven thousand. The coin's one-week rise of about three percent shows some potential, but the one-month gain is not as promising. The support sits close to ninety-eight thousand, providing a foundation to build on if bulls gather strength. As Bitcoin approaches its one-hundred-day moving average of one hundred eight thousand, breaking through could lead to growth. Achieving this could push the price towards the second resistance, translating to a potential gain of about ten percent. XRP Struggles as Bears Clamp Down, Eyeing Recovery to $2.68 Source: tradingview XRP teeters in a tight range between just over two to less than two and a half dollars, reflecting a market in a struggle between bulls and bears. Recent movements have pushed the price up by roughly two and a half percent this week, but it remains down nearly seventeen and ten percent in the last month and six months, respectively. Bulls aim for the first resistance at just over two and a half dollars, a leap of around nine percent from current levels. If momentum kicks in, XRP could aim for nearly three percent higher at the second resistance. Current indicators lean bearish, but eyes watch closely for signs of recovery. Why XRP Could Explode Here’s why XRP could outperform, even while Bitcoin struggles: Deep Liquidity Role vs. Messaging SystemsRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently stated that XRP could capture up to 14% of SWIFT's global liquidity volume within five years by serving as a bridge asset—not just a messaging tool. That’s a powerful long-term narrative for institutional investors. Speed & Cost Efficiency in Cross‑Border PaymentsXRP enables near-instantaneous currency conversions, reducing the need for pre-funded bank accounts and slashing intermediary costs—a stark contrast to the slower, fee-heavy SWIFT process. Tokenized Asset Growth PotentialRipple insiders at XRP APEX 2025 highlighted demand in the tokenized assets sector, suggesting XRP may serve as foundational liquidity for hundreds of billions of tokenized securities. Lower Correlation with BTCUnlike many altcoins that mirror Bitcoin’s price action, XRP often shows independent strength, making its recent consolidation a potential signal of bend—but-not-break resilience. Institutional Confidence & Community BackingRipple's proactive engagement with regulators, partners, and big‑name clients lends increasing credibility to XRP’s use-case, fueling renewed institutional interest and broader acceptance.

The team cited “fragmented liquidity” as the reason for the pivot back to Ethereum mainnet. The strategic shift comes after the price of the native SNX token has fallen by 83%. The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Synthetix has announced a major strategic pivot, setting a July 7 target to phase out all of its Layer-2 deployments on the Base network. The derivatives protocol stated it will now consolidate its focus on the Ethereum mainnet, a surprising move that goes against the broader industry trend of L2 expansion. The decision comes after the project’s native token, SNX, has suffered from significant bearish pressure and a lack of liquidity for several months. Why the Protocol Is Refocusing on Ethereum Mainnet According to Synthetix, the decision to phase out its L2 deployments stems from ongoing infrastructure instability and fragmented liquidity. Meanwhile, the liquidity provider (LP) vaults have stopped accepting deposits because of the latest decision.

Now, focus turns to a new cryptocurrency expected to surge 25 times its current value. This emerging coin could be the next significant opportunity in the digital currency market, drawing attention from those seeking substantial returns. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milesto ne The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Dogecoin Unleashed: The Shiba Inu Coin Shaking Up Crypto Markets Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They wanted a fun alternative to serious cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Using the Shiba Inu “Doge” meme as its logo, Dogecoin was designed to be friendly and accessible. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin is plentiful, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum supply. What began as a “memecoin” quickly grew, thanks to its active community and social media. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared, reaching a market cap over $50 billion and becoming one of the top ten cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin’s rise shows the power of community and social media in crypto. Influential figures like Elon Musk boosted its popularity with tweets. While Dogecoin lacks advanced technology of some cryptocurrencies, its simplicity is part of its charm. Its unlimited supply means it’s less likely to be a store of value like Bitcoin, but useful for tipping or small transactions. In the current market, Dogecoin remains a wild card. Its price can be volatile, driven by trends and online hype. For some, it could be an exciting opportunity, but it’s important to be cautious and do your research before investing. XRP: The Fast and Borderless Cryptocurrency Transforming Global Payments XRP is a digital currency that aims to make moving money as easy as sending an email. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP is fast, low-cost, and open to all. It doesn’t need a bank account to work, and transactions happen quickly without a central authority. With XRP, people can send money across borders without high fees or delays. Ripple, the company that supports XRP, was given 80 billion XRP to help develop the system. They use XRP to improve the network and hold some in reserve to release over time. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” showing its goal to make payments flow smoothly between different currencies. XRP has the potential to change how we think about money transfers. Its technology allows quick and cheap transactions, a big advantage over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can be slower and more expensive. In the current market, XRP looks attractive to those seeking a practical digital currency for real use. As more people and businesses look for faster ways to move money, XRP could become more popular. Compared to other coins, XRP offers a unique mix of speed, low cost, and accessibility. Many are interested in cryptocurrencies that solve real problems, and XRP fits well. Conclusion DOGE and XRP have shown strong returns, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans in a unique memecoin blending memes and sports.

If you’re following the cryptocurrency markets, you know that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on digital assets have been a major topic, especially after the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Now, the spotlight is firmly on Solana, with a key development suggesting institutional interest is rapidly gaining momentum. The Crucial S-1 Filing Milestone So, what’s the big news? According to a report by Cointelegraph, a total of seven applicants seeking to launch a spot Solana ETF in the United States have officially filed their S-1 statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Think of the S-1 as the initial registration form that companies or entities must submit to the SEC before they can offer securities (like ETF shares) to the public. It’s a foundational step, outlining the proposed fund’s structure, investment objectives, risks, and other essential details. Filing the S-1 is a necessary part of the journey towards potential SEC approval . It signals serious intent from these seven firms and kicks off the formal regulatory review process. While it doesn’t mean approval is imminent, it’s a concrete action that moves the possibility from theoretical discussion to active consideration by regulators. Navigating the SEC Approval Pathway Submitting the S-1 is just the beginning of a potentially lengthy process involving the SEC approval pathway. As Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out, there needs to be a significant “back and forth” between the SEC staff and the ETF issuers. This isn’t a one-and-done submission. The SEC reviews these filings meticulously, asking questions, seeking clarifications, and requiring amendments to ensure investor protection and compliance with securities laws. This iterative process of review and revision can take weeks or even months. It’s why Seyffart expressed doubt that these Solana ETF applications could be greenlit as soon as next week, despite the filings occurring. Key aspects the SEC will scrutinize include: The underlying market’s susceptibility to manipulation. Custody arrangements for the SOL held by the fund. Valuation methods for the ETF’s assets. Crucially, the treatment of the staking component (more on this below). The speed of the SEC approval process for spot Crypto ETF s has varied historically, influenced by factors like regulatory comfort levels and political considerations. The Complexities of Solana ETF Staking One of the most interesting aspects highlighted in the report is that staking is encompassed in all the S-1 filings submitted by the seven Solana ETF applicants. For those new to it, staking in proof-of-stake networks like Solana involves locking up SOL tokens to support the network’s operations and validate transactions, for which stakers earn rewards (more SOL). Including staking in an ETF structure presents a unique challenge and opportunity. On one hand, it could make the ETF more attractive to investors by potentially offering a yield component on top of price appreciation, mirroring the benefits available to direct SOL holders who stake. On the other hand, the regulatory classification and treatment of staking rewards are still areas the SEC is navigating, particularly in the context of investment products offered to the public. Seyffart noted the possibility that spot Solana ETF staking could theoretically be rolled out concurrently with SEC approval for staking on spot Ether ETFs. This suggests the SEC might be working towards a broader framework for how staking is handled within regulated crypto investment products. The decision on whether to allow staking from day one, or require issuers to launch a non-staking version first, will be a critical factor influencing the potential returns and structure of these funds. What the High Odds Mean for the Solana ETF Outlook Adding to the positive sentiment surrounding these developments, Bloomberg Intelligence raised its estimate of the likelihood that the SEC will approve spot Solana ETF s this year to a significant 90% on April 30. This substantial increase from previous estimates reflects growing confidence among market analysts that the regulatory hurdles are becoming less formidable, especially following the precedent set by Bitcoin ETFs and the ongoing review of Ethereum ETFs. A 90% probability is quite high in the world of financial predictions and indicates that analysts believe the fundamental requirements for approval are likely to be met, provided the issuers and the SEC can work through the detailed S-1 filings and address the complexities, particularly around Solana ETF staking . Potential Benefits of a Spot Solana ETF: Increased Accessibility: Allows traditional investors to gain exposure to SOL without needing to navigate crypto exchanges, wallets, or private keys. Institutional Adoption: Provides a regulated vehicle that large financial institutions and wealth managers can more easily include in client portfolios. Price Discovery & Liquidity: Could potentially improve price discovery and add liquidity to the Solana market. Enhanced Legitimacy: An SEC-approved ETF lends further credibility to Solana as an asset class in the eyes of mainstream finance. Potential Challenges & Considerations: Regulatory Clarity on Staking: As discussed, the SEC’s final stance on allowing staking within the ETF structure remains a key variable. Market Volatility: While the ETF structure mitigates some risks, the underlying asset (SOL) remains highly volatile. Competition: With seven applicants, the market could become competitive, potentially impacting fees and structure. Actionable Insight: For investors interested in Solana, the filing of these S-1s is a positive signal, but patience is required. The process involves detailed regulatory review. Keep an eye on SEC announcements and updates from the filing firms. The outcome regarding staking will be particularly important. Summary: A Significant Step, But Not the Finish Line The filing of S-1 statements by seven spot Solana ETF applicants is undeniably a significant milestone in the journey towards bringing a regulated Solana investment product to the U.S. market. It demonstrates strong interest from financial firms and moves the conversation forward with the SEC. While the high probability estimate from Bloomberg Intelligence suggests a strong likelihood of approval in 2024, the exact timeline remains uncertain due to the necessary “back and forth” with the SEC and the specific complexities surrounding Solana ETF staking . The market will be watching closely to see how these details are ironed out and when the SEC might feel comfortable giving the green light.

According to its recent filing, Méliuz said that the offering was priced at 7.06 reais per share, a 5% discount over its closing price on Thursday. This decision by the prominent company in Brazil showcases the growing interest from traditional businesses in adding digital assets to their balance sheet management and investment. According to Méliuz, the funds raised will be used to acquire more Bitcoin, with the company already holding about 320.25 BTC from its previous foray into the market. The decision to raise capital to purchase Bitcoin shows a strong conviction in the long-term value of the digital asset. Méliuz raises funds to purchase Bitcoin Several factors would have influenced Méliuz’s choice of pursuing a strategic investment in the asset, with Bitcoin currently seen as a hedge against inflation due to its capped supply. Its characteristics as a decentralized and immutable digital asset appeal to corporations seeking a store of value outside the traditional financial systems. Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury is also a form of diversification from traditional securities and currencies. As a fintech firm, Méliuz’s customer base is tech-savvy and interested in digital assets, making the move in line with the company’s brand and future offerings. Despite the volatility in the crypto market, the growth potential of Bitcoin is one of the key drivers of its adoption by corporations. For context, Bitcoin has grown steadily since its creation, moving from being sold for cents to over a hundred thousand dollars. The digital asset has also influenced the creation of other assets, making the crypto sector one of the most successful since its creation. The move to purchase more Bitcoin came earlier this year when the company launched a new strategy allowing it to allocate cash reserves in the cryptocurrency. The move saw the company label itself “the first Bitcoin treasury company” in Brazil. It is also expected to strengthen the company’s balance sheet, seeing that the appreciation in the price of the asset over the next few years can put it in a better financial standing compared to most of its peers. Aside from investors, the company is also expected to increase its user base and lead the fintech sector in Brazil. Crypto literacy in Latin America is on the rise Brazil has emerged as an important player in the Latin American cryptocurrency market. While regulatory clarity is improving, the country has also seen increased public interest in the sector. Méliuz is also following that trend, which has seen a wider interest in digital asset investment and adoption among individuals and corporations. Meanwhile, Méliuz is not the only corporation accumulating Bitcoin, with firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet also accumulating the digital asset. Days ago, Strategy announced the purchase of 1,045 BTC at $110.2 million, with each token costing about $105k. The move pushed the company’s total Bitcoin stash to 582,000, with an average purchase price of $70,086. The move by Strategy and other corporations to purchase BTC has influenced others, with more companies starting to add minimal Bitcoin to their treasuries. According to reports, about 26 companies hold more than 1,000 BTC in their treasuries, with seven holding 10,000 or more. In the past week, five companies have also purchased more BTC, using the announcement to boost their social media presence. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The decline, triggered by recent Bitcoin volatility , could severely affect Salvadorans who rely on remittances as a primary source of income. El Salvador Sees Sharp Decline in Crypto Remittances According to official data , crypto remittances to El Salvador dropped by 44.5% in Q1 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This marks the first significant drop since the country adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 . Back in Q4 2021, crypto remittances peaked at $57 million through the Chivo Wallet. However, the number has now halved, with crypto inflows down to just $16 million so far in 2025. In 2024, the total was $28.83 million, averaging around $7 million per quarter through roughly 27,000 transactions. Crypto transfers now account for a mere 0.52% of the country’s $3 billion in total remittance inflows—a steep decline from previous years. Why Are Crypto Remittances Dropping in El Salvador? The plunge is largely attributed to Bitcoin’s price volatility. Between January and May 2025, BTC fluctuated between $93,907 and $108,949, creating uncertainty and risk aversion among Salvadorans. Additionally, ongoing regulatory challenges and inconsistent market sentiment have contributed to the decline in crypto adoption for remittance purposes. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : EU Crypto Rules Spark Backlash Over Fast-Track Licenses , Why El Salvador Backed Crypto Remittances in the First Place El Salvador has long promoted crypto as a way to boost the economy. The government supported the adoption of Bitcoin and blockchain technology to tap into the $7 billion Central American remittance market. By integrating crypto into remittance channels, the goal was to reduce dependence on traditional services like Western Union and cut high transaction fees, allowing more money to reach families in need. However, despite these intentions, the current decline signals a failure to achieve meaningful adoption at scale. Consequences of Crypto Remittance Decline The falling numbers could have serious economic repercussions. A significant drop in crypto remittance inflows may impact: GDP growth Foreign exchange reserves Balance of payments Still, there’s some optimism. Digital remittances overall are projected to reach $148.39 million in 2025, an increase from 2024, indicating potential growth in non-crypto digital transfers. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A recent video from Stronghold was shared on X by SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), highlighting this trend and its potential impact on the crypto market. The video revealed that all Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) payments have already shifted to ISO 20022 as of 2022, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has encouraged American institutions to adopt the standard. This global realignment is expected to have direct implications on how digital assets integrate with traditional systems. STRONGHOLD: XRP AND XLM WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM THE ADOPTION OF ISO 20022 Listen closely. https://t.co/QYnwzUo0Qg pic.twitter.com/mdmczeftS0 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 13, 2025 ISO 20022 enables richer data exchange between financial institutions, improving transparency, efficiency, and compatibility across networks. The Federal Reserve System is scheduled to transition from the current Fedwire Application Interface Manual (FAIM) to the ISO 20022 standard in July, and more financial systems are making the switch. SWIFT has also confirmed a November deadline for full migration to this new standard. As it becomes the norm, digital assets capable of interacting seamlessly with this infrastructure are positioned for more significant roles in future payment ecosystems. XRP and XLM: Designed for Compliance Two cryptocurrencies often mentioned with ISO 20022 are XRP and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Both assets have been recognized by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for potential integration into systems working with the ISO 20022 standard. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Their compatibility, speed, and low transaction cost may provide an advantage as banks and payment providers seek digital assets that can support faster and more secure transactions without requiring fundamental overhauls to existing frameworks. According to the Stronghold representative, the company is leveraging ISO 20022 messaging alongside blockchain ledger payments in select projects. She stressed the importance of messaging standards in enhancing the reliability and efficiency of financial services. The Benefits of Stronghold’s Integration Strategy Stronghold’s approach suggests a practical application of ISO 20022 alongside blockchain networks. In a separate clip, Stronghold founder and CEO Tammy Camp described the company’s infrastructure as one that allows fiat on-ramps to distribute through Ripple, Stellar, and Interledger via API access. Many experts believe XRP can dominate ISO 20022 systems . Stronghold’s strategy uses live environments where blockchain-based financial tools connect with traditional currency flows. This actively contributes to the broader effort to unify traditional payment systems and digital assets, such as XRP and XLM, under one standardized messaging framework.

Shiba Inu (SHIB), a memecoin with growing DeFi utility, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi lending innovator, stand out. SHIB’s community-driven ecosystem and Mutuum Finance’s presale momentum spark interest. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is raising eyebrows, having secured $10,600,000 since its presale began, with over 550 million tokens sold and 12,000 holders. Phase 5 is underway at $0.03 per token, promising a 100% return at its $0.06 launch. As crypto prices fluctuate, these projects offer distinct paths. Let’s explore their potential for 2030. Shiba Inu’s community power SHIB is evolving beyond its memecoin roots. Initially a playful token inspired by a dog breed, it’s building a robust ecosystem. ShibaSwap, its decentralized exchange, enhances utility. The Shibarium Layer-2 solution boosts transaction speed. In 2025, SHIB’s price predictions range from $0.00003 to $0.00010, averaging $0.00006. By 2030, forecasts suggest a steady $0.00010. The “Shib Army” fuels momentum through social media. However, crypto prices face volatility from market sentiment. New memecoins could divert attention. Despite risks, SHIB’s low token price attracts diverse investors. Its community strength ensures visibility. Consequently, SHIB remains a notable long-term pick. Mutuum Finance’s innovative lending redefines DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is reshaping crypto lending with a dual-model system. Its peer-to-contract approach lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools. These pools generate passive income through automated interest rates. The peer-to-peer model fosters direct lending agreements, cutting out middlemen. This transparency empowers users to negotiate custom terms. Both models enhance efficiency in the crypto market. Moreover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Ethereum-based stablecoin, pegged to the USD, ensures stable transactions. Its layer-2 integration slashes fees and speeds up trades. This technical edge positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a leader in DeFi innovation. Consequently, investors see it as the best cryptocurrency coin to buy today. Security and community drive trust The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has finalized a CertiK audit, earning an impressive 80.00 security score. No vulnerabilities appeared in the audited smart contract. Additionally, the team launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders. These holders earn bonus tokens for maintaining their rank, sparking excitement. Furthermore, a $100,000 giveaway rewards early supporters. Ten winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens for a $50 presale investment. These initiatives make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a compelling crypto investment. Comparing these top crypto coins While tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) attract attention, they lack Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s utility. Cardano struggles with slow development, limiting short-term gains. Shiba Inu relies on hype, not functionality. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible DeFi solutions. Its lending models and stablecoin provide real-world use. Buying at $0.03 guarantees a 100% ROI at launch. Post-launch, analysts predict a rise to $2.50, yielding an 8,233% return. This potential dwarfs other crypto coins. Therefore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the best cryptocurrency coin to buy today in the crypto market. Shaping your crypto future The crypto market offers diverse opportunities. Shiba Inu (SHIB) leverages community enthusiasm and ecosystem growth. Its low price and ShibaSwap utility make it accessible. Yet, memecoin volatility poses risks. Conversely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers structured DeFi innovation. Its presale success, with $10,600,000 raised, reflects investor confidence. The 100% ROI at launch and potential $2.50 valuation excite analysts. Both tokens address different investor needs. SHIB suits community-driven enthusiasts, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appeals to DeFi-focused investors. Research both projects thoroughly. Monitor crypto prices and market trends. Which crypto to buy today for long-term depends on your strategy. Act now to explore these promising tokens.

It’s built on its own blockchain, which is designed for speed, scalability, and a seamless user experience. This has allowed it to combine the performance of centralized exchanges with the security and transparency inherent to decentralized financial systems. Whether you’re new to trading or just making the jump from traditional cryptocurrency exchanges, Hyperliquid offers an intuitive way to trade perpetual contracts directly from your wallet – no middlemen, no gas fees, and no sign-ups. This guide on how to trade on Hyperliquid presents a complete beginner’s walkthrough. It covers everything from setting up your wallet and placing your very first trade, while explaining order types, risk management, and taking full advantage of the platform’s features. Let’s dive in. Main Takeaways: Hyperliquid offers a CEX-like experience in a fully decentralized environment No sign-ups, KYS, or gas fees – just connect your wallet and trade Only USDC is accepted as trading collateral The platform supports perpetual futures with leverage and margin modes Hyperliquid doesn’t use AMMs, but has designed a completely decentralized order book Quick Navigation In Brief: What is Hyperliquid Key Hyperliquid Trading Features How to Trade on Hyperliquid How to Manage Risk, Liquidations Trading Fees on Hyperliquid Best Practices for Trading on Hyperliquid Who is Hyperliquid For? Pros and Cons of Trading on Hyperliquid Frequently Asked Questions How to Trade on Hyperliquid: Conclusion In Brief: What is Hyperliquid? We have a comprehensive long-form guide that answers the question what is Hyperliquid and provides an objective review of the exchange. Therefore, in this paragraph, we will briefly review the basics. Hyperliquid is a decentralized cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, known for offering extremely high-speed, low-latency trading without the need for traditional intermediaries or centralized control. It presents a familiar interface similar to that of Binance or Bybit in terms of user experience, but is built on its own blockchain infrastructure, enabling complete transparency, self-custody, and composability. Unlike many other top decentralized exchanges that rely on automated market makers (AMMs), Hyperliquid has implemented a fully on-chain order book, which offers performance and usability similar to those of centralized exchanges. This is a huge deal. Moreover, traders on Hyperliquid do not incur gas fees, making it significantly more cost-effective compared to other on-chain solutions. At its core are the perpetual futures contracts on a large number of cryptocurrencies, which allows traders to open both long and short positions entirely on-chain while taking advantage of tooling similar to that of centralized exchanges. To sum up, here are some of the core features of Hyperliquid: Decentralized order book High performance Zero gas fees for trading High-powered perpetual futures Self-custody Custom-built blockchain (the HyperEVM) Key Hyperliquid Trading Features Non-custodial and decentralized order book Hyperliquid is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange with no central authority exercising control over it. It’s non-custodial in the sense that your funds are stored on-chain and not within a centralized account or address. You are responsible for your funds and nobody else. It also uses a first-of-a-kind decentralized order book which mimics those of centralized exchanges but with the advantages inherent to DeFi. No KYC, no registrations You don’t have to register. All you need to do is open the Hyperliquid trading app and connect your non-custodial wallet to start trading. Thereby, you don’t have to worry about lengthy KYC procedures, as well as the potential of the exchange to freeze your funds. Low latency and extremely high throughput Hyperliquid is built on its very own blockchain, which has been designed from the ground up with the goal of providing all the necessary technology stacks to guarantee low latency and extremely high throughput when trading. Confirmation times are less than a second, and you receive the full-blown centralized exchange user experience (or better) on a completely decentralized system. No gas fees for trading Even though all of the transactions happen on-chain, you pay no gas fees for trading, which reduces overhead and makes the exchange a lot more effective for high-frequency traders, as well as for beginners. Supports cross-margin and isolated margin As mentioned in the guide further below, Hyperliquid supports both cross-margin and isolated margin modes, which is a feature typically reserved for centralized exchanges. How to Trade on Hyperliquid: Step-by-Step Guide The following is a step-by-step guide for beginners on how to trade on Hyperliquid. Main Points: You will need a compatible wallet to get started. Fund your wallet using the Hyperliquid bridge. Only USDC can be used for trading. Learn the trading interface before placing orders. Understand order types and risk settings. Setting up a wallet First things first, because Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange, you will need an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible wallet. There is plenty of choice here, but the most popular one is MetaMask – it has stood the test of time as one of the best DeFi wallets overall. Alternatives include Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect, Rabby, and others. If you’re not familiar with MetaMask and how to set it up, please check out this instruction manual – it’s incredibly easy and won’t take you more than a couple of minutes. Hyperliquid bridge: funding your account, supported tokens Once you have set up your wallet, you will need to transfer some money and fund your account. In crypto slang, that’s called “bridging.” Please note that Hyperliquid operates with USDC as trading collateral, which is what you will need to obtain. Here’s where the Hyperliquid Bridge comes into play, which is powered by deBridge. The process is once again relatively simple, and fortunately, we have a comprehensive guide available. Check out our instruction manual on the Hyperliquid bridge: how to bridge USDC to Hyperliquid . In brief, here are the steps: Go to deBridge and connect your wallet. Choose your source chain and the token you wish to transfer (remember: USDC). Select Hyperliquid as your destination. Confirm the transaction. If you don’t have money on-chain, you can simply withdraw from your account on a centralized exchange or, alternatively, you can buy crypto using MetaMask’s on-ramp credit card solutions. Once you are done bridging, your funds should arrive within a couple of minutes and you will be ready to start trading by connecting your wallet to Hyperliquid . The supported tokens include: USDC BTC ETH SOL However, please note that you can only use USDC as margin for trading purposes. All other assets must be swapped into USDC before you deposit. Once you have the Hyperliquid app open, you will have to navigate to the top right corner of the navigation menu and hit “Connect.” From there, select your wallet and sign the connecting transaction. It is a gasless transaction. Once you are connected, navigate to the bottom right of your interface and find the “Deposit” button. From there, simply select the chain you want to deposit from, the asset, and the desired amount. Confirm, and the funds will appear in your account within a couple of minutes. Making Sense of the Hyperliquid Trading Interface Now that you have everything set up with your funding, you’re ready to dive in and open your first trade. However, before you do that, you need to be familiar with the trading interface and its layout. For your convenience, we have numbered the important sections of the interface, so let’s break them down. Number 1: Chart Here is where you will monitor the chart and switch through the different trading modes. Notice that right next to the “HYPE/USDC” trading pair label, there is a small sign that says “Spot.” This means that you are currently looking and trading spot on Hyperliquid. If you want to change that, all you need to do is click on the drop-down menu and select whatever trading mode you want, as shown in the screenshot below: Apart from that, you can perform all the regular tasks that you would on a chart. For instance, you can draw resistance lines, add indicators, change time frames, and whatnot. Number 2: Order book Right next to the chart is the order book. This is where you monitor the depth of the market, the types of orders being filled, the trades being executed, and so forth. Pro tip: HyperDash is a specific informational dashboard built for Hyperliquid. It pulls information directly from the HyperEVM chain and provides incredibly useful information such as overall directional bias, current open interest, market depth, and whatnot. Number 3: Order placement This is where you place your trades. When it comes to both spot and perps, Hyperliquid supports all of the trading orders that you would find on a centralized exchange, which is one of the things that makes it the best-performing decentralized exchange in the industry, at least at the time of this writing in June 2025. Before we break down the different order types, please note that you have a few fields above that, which allow you to select the margin mode and adjust the leverage you want to use. As seen in the above image, cross margin mode means that all cross positions share the same cross margin as collateral. In other words, if one of them gets liquidated, your cross margin balance and any remaining open positions under assets in this mode may be forfeited as well. On the other hand, isolated margin mode allows you to manage risk on individual positions by restricting the amount of margin allocated to each of them. Now, let’s explore the different order types. The following are the four order types that you will use the most when trading on Hyperliquid. Market orders Market orders are the simplest type. They allow you to instantly open (or close) a position at the best available rates from the order book. In other words, your entry price might differ from the current market price depending on multiple factors, the most important of which is the current liquidity and market depth. *Note: When you use market orders, you incur taker fees, which are traditionally higher. Limit orders Limit orders are used when you want to open (or close) a position at a pre-specified price, which might be different than the current market price. Once the market price reaches your target limit price, the order will begin to fill. Please note that when using limit orders, it’s possible that your order gets filled partially because of insufficient liquidity. *Note: When you use limit orders, you incur maker fees, which are traditionally lower. Stop-limit orders Stop-limit orders and stop-market orders are used for take-profit and stop-loss purposes. For stop-limit orders, you specify a price at which you want a limit order to be placed. This is the “stop price”. Then, you input a price at which you want your limit order to be executed. This is the “price.” Once the market price reaches the stop price, it will automatically place a limit order at your specified price. Stop-market orders Stop-market orders allow you to place market orders with an additional condition: that they will be executed only when the current market price reaches a certain level (stop price, similar to stop-limit orders). Once the market price reaches this pre-determined level, the system will automatically place a market order. Number 4: Position tracking Last but not least on the interface is the section where you track your current position and balances. Here, you can monitor your unrealized profit and loss, entry prices, funding fees, liquidation prices, and pretty much everything of importance for your position. Placing Your First Trade on Hyperliquid Packed with the knowledge from this guide, let’s now place our very first trade on Hyperliquid. To do so, we are going to use a market order and the following graphic summarizes the process: First, you need to specify the leverage. For this, we have selected 5x. As you can see, we have around $24 available to trade, and we have used 100% of that to open a 5x leverage long position on HYPE/USDC. Below the “Place Order” button, you can see the liquidation price, the order value (5 x $23.80 = approx. $118.86), the slippage, the fees, as well as the required margin. We’re happy with that, so we will click “Place Order,” and the trade will be executed immediately. You can track the position in the bottom section, and if desired, you can close it using the respective button. It’s as easy as that. How to Manage Risk, Liquidations As mentioned in the previous sections of this guide, trading on Hyperliquid has been streamlined to a point where users have all the necessary tools to manage their risk effectively. Speaking of risk, when it comes to trading perpetual contracts with any type of leverage, the biggest one is getting liquidated. To those of you who may be new to leverage trading, liquidation is the event in which your position is forced closed because the price has reached a point in the opposite direction of your trade bias, which requires you to add collateral that you don’t have or don’t want to add. For example, if you open a 10x leverage long, your directional bias is long (price to go up). If the price declines, you will incur a loss. A liquidation would happen once you haven’t got sufficient collateral to keep funding your position. The general rule of thumb in this case is that if the price drops by 10%, it will reach your liquidation price and get force-closed (assuming you take no further actions). You will lose the margin that you have posted for that specific position. So, how can you prevent that from happening? Well, there are two ways you can go about it: Using a Stop-Loss You can use stop-limit orders and stop-market orders as effective stop-loss tools. For example, say you have a position opened for a BTC long at $100,000 with a 10x leverage and your liquidation price is at $90,000. You can set a stop-market order to be executed when the price reaches $95,000. Managing Your Position Manually Many traders prefer not to use stop-loss mechanisms because they fear market makers “hunt” them in vicious wicks that reach these levels only to bounce back (or decline, depending on your bias) immediately after that. To combat this, they would prefer to use extra-large collateral amounts and manage their positions manually. Of course, this is an option, but it requires confidence and a lot of knowledge. Trading Fees on Hyperliquid Naturally, trading fees are essential for those who wish to trade on Hyperliquid, so the following is a comprehensive breakdown. Please note, we will only discuss the base tier trading fees. Refer to this page for all the information on Hyperliquid trading fees depending on your current tier. Hyperliquid Trading Fees for Perps The fees are based on a rolling 14-day volume and are assessed at the end of each day. Spot Trading Fees Best Practices for Trading on Hyperliquid As you have probably noticed, the majority of this guide focuses on explaining the details of trading perpetual contracts on Hyperliquid, rather than their spot offering. With that in mind, here are a few of the best practices for leverage trading that surely apply to trading on Hyperliquid as well. Before that, take a look at our 15 must-read Bitcoin and crypto trading tips for more generalized information aimed at those of you who are new to the world of trading. Start Small, Especially with High Leverage Using leverage magnifies both gains and losses. If you are new, it is best that you stick to low leverage (e.g. 2x-3x). You should also consider trading small amounts. This will help you stay engaged while also learning about the game. Jumping into high leverage in pursuit of “life-changing” trades too early can wipe out your account with even minor market fluctuations. Use Isolated Margin to Limit Risk When trading with leverage, you should always consider isolated margin instead of cross margin. If your trade goes south and you are using cross-margin, your entire account balance is at risk. However, if you use an isolated margin, it’s only the margin you’ve assigned to that specific trade that can be wiped out. Understand Liquidation Mechanics Understand how liquidations work. Your liquidation price is the point at which your trade is forced to close to protect the exchange. Always keep your positions far from that level by using stop-losses or by manually monitoring them and adding margin whenever needed. Trade With a Plan, Avoid Emotions Emotions have no place in trading. Every trade you take should have a clear entry, stop-loss, and take-profit targets. Do not increase leverage just to chase losses or ride emotional highs. Stick to your trading plan – this will protect your capital. Who is Hyperliquid For? Hyperliquid caters to both beginners and advanced traders. Objectively, however, users with no prior experience or contact with Web3 technologies will likely face a somewhat more challenging time adapting to the systems. However, the team behind Hyperliquid has made it incredibly easy to onboard newcomers, and although there are a few hoops to jump through, the process is remarkably seamless and straightforward. Some might argue that the lack of a lengthy registration process (you only need a Web3 wallet) actually makes it easier. Pros and Cons of Trading on Hyperliquid Pros explained: True decentralization with CEX-like performance Low latency and fast execution Gasless trading Advanced trading features Clean user interface Stonr on-chain analytics potential Cons explained: Slightly steeper learning curve for absolute beginners Protocol-associated risks Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) How does Hyperliquid exchange work?

How to trade on Hyperliquid in the USA? U.S. citizens are currently unable to trade on Hyperliquid due to geographic restrictions. Some users have suggested the usage of a VPN, but this could be in violation of the platform’s terms and should only be carried out at your own risk and responsibility. Is Hyperliquid tradable on Coinbase? No, HYPE tokens – the native cryptocurrency of the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange – are not supported for trade on Coinbase, according to its official page . Which wallets support Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid supports all EVM-compatible wallets, including MetaMask, Rabby, WalletConnect, and more. Which chain is Hyperliquid on?

Can I buy Hyperliquid on Phantom? No, it is not currently possible to connect a Phantom wallet to the Hyperliquid trading interface. You need a compatible wallet such as MetaMask, Rabby, Wallet Connect, or other EVM-compatible solutions. Is there a Hyperliquid app?

45996357,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=169188,1749899445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45996357.jpeg,US Crypto Regulation: White House Blocks Crucial Conflict Provision in CLARITY Act,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/white-house-crypto-clarity-act/,"BitcoinWorld US Crypto Regulation: White House Blocks Crucial Conflict Provision in CLARITY Act In a move that has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency world and political observers alike, the White House has reportedly signaled its intention to reject a specific provision within the proposed U.S. crypto market structure legislation, commonly known as the CLARITY Act . This particular section aimed to introduce guardrails designed to address potential crypto conflict of interest issues, especially concerning senior political figures. This development is significant for the future of US crypto regulation and raises questions about the path forward for comprehensive US crypto policy . What Was the Rejected Provision About? The provision in question sought to establish clearer rules and restrictions around how senior political figures might interact with or benefit from the cryptocurrency space, particularly after leaving office or in ways that could be perceived as profiting from their position or insider knowledge. The push for this guardrail reportedly gained traction due to concerns raised about past instances, specifically mentioning President Donald Trump’s engagement with and apparent promotion of crypto assets, which some critics viewed as potential profiteering. The core idea behind the provision was to enhance transparency and prevent situations where individuals with significant influence in government could use that influence, or information gained from it, to unfairly benefit financially from the volatile and often opaque crypto markets. Proponents argued that such measures are essential for maintaining public trust in both government and the nascent crypto industry. Why is Crypto Conflict of Interest a Concern? The rapid growth and unique nature of the crypto market present novel challenges for existing ethics rules designed for traditional finance or assets. Here are a few reasons why conflict of interest in the crypto space, particularly for public officials, is a hot topic: Market Volatility and Speculation: Crypto markets are known for extreme price swings. Knowledge of potential regulatory actions or government policies could provide an unfair advantage. Decentralization vs. Centralized Power: While crypto promotes decentralization, government officials hold centralized power that can significantly impact the market through legislation, enforcement, or public statements. Lack of Established Norms: Unlike stocks or real estate, the ethical boundaries for politicians holding, trading, or promoting specific cryptocurrencies are still being defined. Public Perception: Any hint of officials using their position for personal crypto gain can erode public confidence in both the government and the legitimacy of the crypto industry itself. The rejected provision aimed to tackle these points head-on, reflecting a desire among some lawmakers to preempt potential ethical pitfalls in the digital asset age. The White House Crypto Stance: Why the Rejection? According to reports citing sources familiar with the matter, the White House has decided against supporting the inclusion of this specific conflict-of-interest guardrail in the CLARITY Act. While the precise reasons for the administration’s stance haven’t been officially detailed in public statements regarding this specific provision, several possibilities could explain the decision: Sufficiency of Existing Ethics Rules: The administration might believe that current ethics laws and disclosure requirements for public officials are adequate to cover crypto assets, treating them similarly to other financial holdings. Scope and Implementation Challenges: Crafting legislation that effectively and fairly targets potential conflicts in the diverse crypto ecosystem is complex. Concerns might exist about the provision being overly broad, difficult to enforce, or potentially infringing on individuals’ rights. Political Considerations: The provision reportedly stemmed from concerns linked to a specific political figure (Donald Trump). The White House might wish to avoid including language perceived as targeting political opponents, or it could be part of broader negotiations around the bill’s passage. Focus on Broader Market Structure: The administration might prioritize the core objectives of the CLARITY Act – establishing clear regulatory frameworks for the crypto market – and view specific conflict-of-interest rules for individuals as a separate or less urgent matter. This decision highlights one of the many challenges in developing comprehensive US crypto regulation . Balancing the need for clear rules with practical implementation and political realities is a constant negotiation. What Does This Mean for US Crypto Policy and the CLARITY Act? The rejection of this provision doesn’t necessarily doom the entire CLARITY Act, but it certainly adds another layer to the ongoing debate surrounding the bill. Here are some potential implications: Bill’s Passage: The inclusion or exclusion of specific provisions can impact support for the bill among different factions in Congress. The rejection might make the bill more palatable to some but could alienate others who felt the conflict-of-interest issue was crucial. Future of Ethics Rules: If this specific provision is out, the debate over how to address potential crypto conflicts for officials isn’t over. Lawmakers might pursue alternative legislative avenues or rely more heavily on existing ethics bodies. Perception of Regulation: For proponents of strong regulation and ethical standards, the White House’s stance might be seen as a setback, suggesting a less stringent approach to potential conflicts involving powerful figures. Continued Uncertainty: The back-and-forth over specific provisions underscores the difficulty in reaching consensus on comprehensive US crypto policy , leaving the industry and investors navigating a complex and uncertain landscape. The CLARITY Act aims to provide much-needed regulatory clarity, but this development shows that even within efforts to bring order, significant disagreements persist on the details. Challenges in Crafting US Crypto Regulation This episode with the CLARITY Act provision illustrates several inherent challenges in developing effective US crypto regulation : Challenge Description Defining Scope Determining what constitutes a “crypto business” or a “conflict” in a rapidly evolving digital space. Political Divides Significant disagreements exist between parties (and even within parties) on how crypto should be regulated. Balancing Innovation & Protection Creating rules that protect consumers and ensure market integrity without stifling technological advancement. Jurisdictional Issues Deciding which regulatory bodies (SEC, CFTC, etc.) have authority over different aspects of crypto. The debate over the conflict-of-interest provision is a microcosm of these broader challenges. It touches upon political motivations, the difficulty of applying old rules to new tech, and differing views on the level of scrutiny needed for those in power. Conclusion: The Ongoing Saga of US Crypto Policy The White House’s reported decision to reject the conflict-of-interest guardrail in the CLARITY Act is a notable twist in the ongoing effort to establish clear US crypto regulation . While the provision specifically addressed concerns like those related to President Trump’s crypto activities, its rejection highlights the broader complexities and political hurdles involved in crafting comprehensive US crypto policy . This development means that the specific ethical questions surrounding senior political figures and their potential crypto conflict of interest will likely remain a point of discussion, possibly to be addressed in future legislation or through other means. The path to a settled regulatory framework for the U.S. crypto market continues to be a challenging one, marked by debates over scope, enforcement, and the fundamental principles that should govern digital assets in the nation. As lawmakers and the administration continue to grapple with these issues, stakeholders in the crypto industry and the public will be watching closely to see how the final shape of US crypto regulation emerges, and whether future attempts will be made to address the ethical considerations raised by the rejected provision.

Imagine buying millions of tokens for a few thousand dollars—while watching the price inch closer to listing day. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has just entered its 27th stage, offering early investors a rare moment where low entry meets high potential. With a listing price set at $0.008, current buyers at $0.0003 could pocket $133,333 from a $5,000 stake. That kind of return isn’t a dream—it’s an unfolding reality. While meme coin presale buzz intensifies around Arctic Pablo Coin, Zerebro is making headlines with a token upgrade and Doginme just expanded its staking suite. But the spotlight right now is beaming on APC’s presale path and price-to-listing upside. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins—Arctic Pablo Coin, Zerebro, and Doginme—with a strong look at the project leading the charge as the best crypto to invest in this cycle. Weekly Burnouts: How Arctic Pablo Coin’s Token Burn Sets It Apart as the Best Crypto to Invest In Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t playing the usual meme coin presale game. Instead, it’s rewriting the rulebook with weekly token burns that create real-time scarcity. Every week during the presale, unsold APC tokens are permanently removed—forever reducing the circulating supply. This isn’t just deflation talk; these burns are transparent and verifiable on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring every investor can track the tightening supply. Even more compelling? Once the presale ends, any leftover tokens will also be burned. This layered burn strategy enhances long-term sustainability while boosting potential value for those who bought in early. These mechanics put Arctic Pablo Coin in a different tier among meme coins, setting it up as a serious contender for anyone seeking the best crypto to invest in 2025. For those watching the charts and wondering where to park capital before the next big bull move, APC’s deflationary playbook just turned up the heat. Blizzard Borough Breakthrough: APC Climbs to Stage 27 at $0.0003—Best Crypto to Invest in Before It Hits $0.008 Arctic Pablo Coin has reached its frosty destination—Blizzard Borough, the 27th stage of its location-based meme coin presale. Each stage before it wrapped faster than analysts expected, and now, this $0.0003 phase marks a defining entry point before the big leap to the $0.008 listing price. That’s a shocking 2,566.66% ROI in the making. Over $2.76 million has already been raised, and as each new location unlocks, the price continues its steady march upward. Time is ticking: once Blizzard Borough concludes, the next location will bring a price hike. Right now, $5,000 fetches 16,666,650 APC tokens. By listing day, that could translate to $133,333. It’s rare to witness such clean-cut math in meme coin presales—but this project thrives on transparency, scarcity, and timing. The presale is ending soon. The window to grab this at $0.0003 is closing fast. Don’t look back and wonder, “What if?” Arctic Pablo Coin is on track to become the best crypto to invest in 2025. Zerebro Launches Token Upgrade with Utility-Focused Layer Zerebro has successfully launched a smart token upgrade that introduces deeper DeFi functionality and a modular staking interface. This move empowers developers and investors by allowing customizable smart contract interactions directly through the native Zerebro wallet. Early adopters report smoother UX and better integration with decentralized apps. Analysts believe this upgrade positions Zerebro as a utility-first token to watch in the DeFi space, with scalable real-world application possibilities. Doginme Expands Ecosystem with Advanced Staking Portal Doginme has rolled out a multi-tier staking portal featuring dynamic APY rates, NFT-based rewards, and cross-chain compatibility. The update integrates directly into Doginme’s wallet, making it seamless for users to manage long-term token holdings. With this expansion, the project aims to retain investors while attracting liquidity from other meme token ecosystems. The Doginme team also hinted at future partnerships with gaming protocols, which could further boost token use cases in coming months. Final Verdict: Zerebro and Doginme Innovate, but APC’s Tokenomics Point to Wealth Potential All three tokens—Zerebro, Doginme, and Arctic Pablo Coin —are forging distinct paths. Zerebro is focused on utility. Doginme is growing its staking game. But when it comes to pure financial upside and timing, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as the best crypto to invest in right now. Its powerful token burn mechanics, combined with a location-driven meme coin presale and an ROI of over 2,566%, make APC a standout in a crowded market. Blizzard Borough might just be the final stop before APC explodes into listings—those who enter now could be the biggest winners. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions What is the current stage and price of Arctic Pablo Coin? APC is in Stage 27 (Blizzard Borough), priced at $0.0003. What is the listing price of Arctic Pablo Coin? The listing price is set at $0.008, offering over 2,566% ROI from the current level. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s token burn work? Unsold tokens are burned weekly during the presale, and any remaining after the presale ends will also be destroyed to reduce supply. Why is Arctic Pablo considered the best crypto to invest in for 2025? Its high ROI potential, transparent burn system, and unique meme coin presale model create strong upside for early investors. How much would $5,000 in APC be worth at listing? A $5,000 buy now could yield 16,666,650 APC tokens—worth $133,333 at listing.

For nearly three weeks, we’ve seen consistent interest flowing into the brand-new US Spot Ethereum ETF products. It felt like a one-way street of accumulation. However, that streak has just been broken. What Happened with US Spot Ethereum ETF Flows on June 13? According to data shared by analyst Trader T on X, June 13 marked a notable shift for US Spot Ethereum ETF s. These investment vehicles experienced their first day of net outflows since they began trading. The total net outflow for the day came in at $2.18 million. While the amount might seem relatively small in the grand scheme of institutional finance, its significance lies in breaking a pattern. Prior to June 13, these ETFs had recorded 19 consecutive trading days of net inflows. This consistent buying pressure had been a positive signal for market sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Digging into the Specifics of the ETH ETF Outflows Looking closer at the individual fund performances on this day reveals a mixed picture: Fidelity’s (FETH): This fund saw the most significant movement, recording a net outflow of $8.85 million. This suggests some investors using the Fidelity product decided to exit their positions or reallocate funds. Grayscale’s (ETHE): In contrast to Fidelity, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, which converted into an ETF, actually saw a net inflow of $6.67 million. Grayscale’s ETHE often experiences different flow dynamics compared to the newer, lower-fee ETFs, sometimes seeing inflows as investors potentially move funds or take new positions. Other ETFs: The remaining US Ethereum ETF products tracked in this data showed no change in their holdings for the day. Here’s a quick look at the breakdown: ETF Ticker Fund Manager Net Flow (June 13) FETH Fidelity -$8.85 million ETHE Grayscale +$6.67 million Others Various $0 million Why Do Spot Ethereum ETF Outflows Matter? Tracking ETF Outflows and inflows is crucial for understanding institutional and large-scale investor sentiment. While retail investors buy and sell crypto directly on exchanges, ETFs provide a regulated and often preferred avenue for traditional finance players, wealth managers, and even some retail investors within brokerage accounts. Consistent inflows signal strong buying interest and can provide underlying support for the price of the asset held by the ETF (in this case, Ethereum). Conversely, significant ETF Outflows can indicate profit-taking, a shift in sentiment, or reallocation of capital, potentially adding selling pressure or signaling caution. Breaking a 19-day inflow streak, even with a modest outflow figure, is noteworthy because it shows that the initial wave of accumulation might be pausing, or that some participants are already managing their positions actively. It reminds us that investment flows in any market, including the Crypto ETF space, are rarely linear and can change direction. Comparing ETH ETF Flows to Bitcoin ETFs: A Different Picture? It’s helpful to compare the early flow dynamics of the US Ethereum ETF s to their older siblings, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January 2024. Bitcoin ETFs saw massive initial inflows, but also experienced significant outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC as investors rotated into newer, cheaper options or took profits. The ETH ETF launch has been somewhat different – delayed, with less explosive initial inflows compared to Bitcoin, but a more consistent, albeit smaller, inflow trend over the past few weeks until this recent outflow day. This could be due to various factors, including differing market conditions at launch, investor familiarity, or the relative market cap size of ETH compared to BTC. What Could This Mean for the Future of the ETH ETF Market? One day of minor net ETF Outflows doesn’t necessarily signal a major reversal in trend. It could be a temporary pause, driven by specific large trades within Fidelity, or simply market noise. However, it does prompt investors to consider: Market Sentiment: Is this related to broader market conditions or recent price movements in Ethereum? Profit-Taking: Have some early investors in the ETFs decided to lock in gains after the recent price rally? Reallocation: Are funds being moved between different investment vehicles? Monitoring the flow data in the coming days will be essential to determine if this was an isolated event or the beginning of a period of more volatile flows for the ETH ETF market. Consistent, significant outflows would be a stronger signal of weakening institutional demand. Actionable Insights for Investors For those interested in or invested in Spot Ethereum ETF s or Ethereum itself, here are some takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on daily flow data from reliable sources. Look Beyond One Day: Don’t overreact to a single day’s data point. Look for trends over several days or weeks. Understand the Drivers: Consider what might be causing flows – regulatory news, price volatility, macroeconomic factors. ETFs as Access: Remember that ETFs offer a regulated way to get exposure to Ethereum, which is a key benefit for many, despite flow fluctuations. Diversification: Flows are just one metric. Consider Ethereum’s fundamentals, network development, and broader market trends as well. Concluding Thoughts: A Blip or a Trend Shift? The $2.18 million net outflow on June 13 is a crucial data point, primarily because it ended the consistent inflow streak for US Spot Ethereum ETF s. While small in value, it serves as a reminder that capital flows are dynamic. Whether this single day of ETF Outflows is just a minor blip or the start of a more volatile period for these nascent products remains to be seen. The market will be watching closely to see if inflows resume or if outflows become more frequent, providing further clues about institutional appetite for Ethereum exposure via ETFs.

45996868,https://coinpedia.org/?p=469949,1749900061,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Ripple IPO Could Break Records With $30B Valuation,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-ipo-could-break-records-with-30b-valuation/,"The post Ripple IPO Could Break Records With $30B Valuation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple could be on track to launch the largest initial public offering (IPO) in history, according to former company director Sean McBride. However, recent updates from insiders suggest Ripple may not file for an IPO anytime soon. So, is Ripple planning the biggest IPO ever, or is the hype too early? Ripple Share Buyback Signals $30 Billion Valuation Sean McBride recently posted on X , estimating Ripple’s valuation at $30 billion. This is based on Ripple’s ongoing share buyback program , where the company is purchasing at least $700 million worth of shares at $175 each. By multiplying this per-share price with the total share count, McBride arrived at the $30 billion figure — a valuation that would place Ripple ahead of many past IPO giants. How Ripple Stacks Up Against Historic IPO Giants If Ripple goes public with this valuation, it could surpass the biggest IPOs ever seen. Here’s a breakdown of the top IPOs by capital raised: Saudi Aramco – $25.6B (later increased to $29.4B) – Dec 2019 Alibaba Group – $21.8B (later raised to $25B) – Sep 2014 SoftBank Corp – $21.3B – Dec 2018 NTT Mobile – $18.1B – Oct 1998 Visa – $17.9B – Mar 2008 Ripple’s IPO could outshine even Saudi Aramco, making it a historic milestone in the crypto and fintech industry. Ripple IPO Date: When and Where Will It Happen? A couple of years ago, McBride predicted that Ripple would go public by 2025, potentially outside the U.S. due to its legal battle with the SEC. However, the scenario has changed: The SEC lawsuit is now nearly resolved . Donald Trump, a pro-crypto leader, is back as U.S. President. Regulatory support for crypto is growing rapidly in the U.S. This makes a U.S.-based IPO more likely than ever. Still, sources close to Ripple leadership have denied plans for a 2025 IPO, and even McBride has distanced himself from his earlier forecast. However, some analysts like Linda P Jones believe Ripple’s IPO could still happen within this year. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News Today: Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Volume Jumps 30% , Ripple’s Global Focus: Expansion Over IPO Ripple’s current strategy appears to prioritize acquisitions over public listing. With massive cash reserves, the company is under no pressure to go public. Key strategic moves include: $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road , making Ripple the first crypto firm to own a global, multi-asset prime broker. This move expanded Ripple’s reach from payments into trading, clearing, and financing, enhancing XRP and RLUSD utility. Ripple also tried acquiring Circle , the issuer of USDC, but the deal fell through as Circle was focused on its own IPO . Interestingly, Circle’s IPO on NYSE in June 2025 was a success, with its stock (CRCL) soaring 290% above its initial offering price. Final Thoughts Ripple may be setting the stage for a record-breaking IPO, but its current focus on strategic acquisitions and the uncertain timeline for going public make the situation unclear.One thing is certain — if Ripple does go public, it could redefine the crypto IPO landscape forever. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Although previously predicted for 2025 and possibly outside the U.S., a resolution to the SEC lawsuit and pro-crypto U.S. leadership make a U.S.-based IPO more likely, but no immediate plans are confirmed. Why is Ripple prioritizing acquisitions over an IPO currently? Ripple’s current strategy focuses on strategic acquisitions, like Hidden Road for $1.25 billion, to expand its services and enhance XRP/RLUSD utility, rather than immediately going public. How does Ripple’s valuation compare to other major IPOs? A $30 billion valuation would position Ripple’s IPO to surpass historic giants like Saudi Aramco ($29.4B) and Alibaba Group ($25B), making it potentially the largest ever.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-14 11:21:01

Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal shared the development on X, noting that Rule 3b-16 and several others are now gone. Rule 3b-16 is meant to expand the definition of an “exchange” to include DeFi protocols. This would have been possible due to the amendment defining an exchange to include “systems that offer the use of non-firm trading interest and communication protocols to bring together buyers and sellers of securities.” At the time, the proposal faced several pushbacks from the crypto community, with many calling for the regulator to remove the changes due to the impact it could have on crypto innovation. While the withdrawal is now happening under the new SEC Chair , Paul Atkins, talks of the SEC abandoning the rule have started since Gensler left the regulator. Former SEC acting chair Mark Uyeda noted a few months ago that he had advised the SEC staff to abandon part of the rule affecting crypto because the original proposal was meant to address alternative trading systems for the treasury markets. SEC withdraws crypto custody rules and others Meanwhile, the SEC also withdrew several other proposed rules , including those that are not necessarily impacting the crypto market. A major rescinded proposal was the Safeguarding Advisory Client Assets rule that increased custody requirements for crypto. Under the proposal, which would have applied to all investment advisers, firms must hold all client assets, including crypto, with a qualified custodian. This would have proven challenging for crypto investment firms, which usually hold cryptocurrencies in exchanges and wallets, entities that do not meet the criteria of qualified custodians. Uyeda was also involved in the efforts to withdraw this proposed rule, as he stated in a speech on March 17 that much of the public feedback the SEC got suggested concerns about the broad scope. Interestingly, he had earlier criticized some provisions in the rule as commissioner. He said then that the proposal could prevent an investment adviser from allocating funds to crypto. However, he still agreed with the need for rules to safeguard clients’ assets and supported the proposal. Beyond this, the regulator also withdrew 12 other proposed rules apart from these two. Some of these rules could impact crypto entities, including the proposed rules requiring entities to report positions of large security-based swaps and another on cybersecurity risk management and reporting for investment firms. Other rescinded proposals include Prohibition against Undue Influence over Chief Compliance Officers, Amendments to 14a-8, which is the Process for Including Shareholders Proposals in the Company’s Proxy Statements, and the Enhanced Disclosure for ESG investments. US regulators continue to shift away from regulation by enforcement Meanwhile, the latest round of SEC decisions moves the agency from its regulatory approach under Gensler. It continues the rollback of several anti-crypto policies implemented or about to be implemented under the previous administration. It is not just the SEC that has rescinded or withdrawn rules or guidances since President Donald Trump was sworn in. Other federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Office of Comptroller of Currency, have also taken similar decisions. Unsurprisingly, many have praised the changes as a welcome development as efforts to bring regulatory clarity to the crypto industry continue in Congress. While more progress appears to have been made on the GENIUS stablecoin act , the market structure legislation is also advancing in the House. Perhaps in a big sign of the changing times, the financial watchdog recently announced that former global head of institutional markets at Blockchain.com, Jamie Selway will become the Director of Trading and Markets, showing that the agency is bringing those with crypto industry expertise into its fold.

The plan: Use the Flare network’s DeFi capabilities to make XRP staking possible, even though XRP doesn’t support staking on its own. With over 10 million users in 140+ countries, Uphold CEO Simon McLoughlin says the platform is getting ready to test a system that could let users earn yield from XRP through a clever workaround. But in the U.S., regulatory challenges could slow things down. XRP Doesn’t Support Staking, So Uphold Is Getting Creative XRP doesn’t use a proof-of-stake system, which is normally how crypto staking works. That makes it tricky to offer staking in the usual way. But Uphold may have found a solution – by working with Flare, a fast-growing DeFi network . Here’s how it would work: when a user chooses to stake XRP, Uphold locks that amount in its own reserve. Then, it creates an equivalent wrapped version of XRP, called FXRP , on the Flare network. That FXRP can be used on Flare to generate returns, thanks to the network’s deep liquidity pools. “There’s a depth of liquidity in those pools that makes it viable for us, for the first time, to look at offering a beta test,” McLoughlin said. A small group of users may get access to the test soon. Uphold CEO eyes $XRP staking as 'feasible and promising' Simon McLoughlin, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Uphold, told The Block that Ripple (XRP) staking is ""feasible and promising."" Despite this, McLoughlin pointed to the challenges faced by XRP staking as Ripple is not a… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) June 14, 2025 U.S. Rules Could Complicate the Launch Uphold has been expanding its U.S. presence lately, including with a new debit card offering 4% XRP cashback. But staking is another story. McLoughlin says they need to be careful the wrapped version of XRP doesn’t accidentally count as a security, which would trigger U.S. securities laws. That all comes down to the Howey Test, a legal framework that decides whether something is considered an “investment contract.” If FXRP is seen that way, Uphold could run into serious regulatory issues. “We’ve just got to make sure that by wrapping XRP and putting it on a different network, there’s not an interpretation that says, well, actually, you Uphold are manufacturing a security that creates an expectation of profit,” McLoughlin explained. Even though the SEC recently said staking doesn’t automatically violate securities law, McLoughlin admits the U.S. situation is still tricky and it might delay things. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple IPO Could Break Records With $30B Valuation , What is The Howey Test? The Howey Test checks whether a transaction qualifies as a security. It looks for four things: Money invested A common enterprise An expectation of profit Profits coming from others’ efforts If all four apply, the asset may be regulated as a security, which is why Uphold is being cautious. While the U.S. may take longer to approve such a product, other regions could move faster. McLoughlin says the company is confident it can move ahead in markets where the rules are more flexible. What’s Next for XRP Staking? The cryptocurrency community observes intently as Uphold prepares for its beta trial. This Flare-driven staking approach may improve XRP’s functionality by integrating DeFi innovation with detailed compliance. With regulatory clarity approaching, Uphold’s initiative could establish a new benchmark for generating crypto yields. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

RSI and MACD indicators show weakening bullish momentum. Trading volume drops 45.66%, signaling reduced short-term conviction. Ethereum has reclaimed a major historical support level near $2,516, but a worrying divergence is emerging. While the price appears stable, key momentum indicators and declining trading activity suggest the asset may struggle to maintain upward pressure in the short term. At press time, ETH traded at approximately $2,530 , recovering from a recent intraday high.

Ethereum Is Holding a Historically Critical Support Level According to a chart shared by market analyst Rekt Capital, Ethereum has once again affirmed $2,516 as a crucial support level. Historical data since 2021 show this price zone acting repeatedly as a key point for major directional moves. ETH’s latest recovery from sub-$2,000 levels earlier in 2025 has brought the asset back above this key threshold.

It can overwhelm even experienced crypto investors. To make your journey easier, we will examine the most promising cryptocurrencies to help you make the right choice. In this article, we will discuss upcoming and promising projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and staples in the crypto sector. We will go into their features, downsides, and insights on current market trends. Whether you are a newbie to crypto or a seasoned crypto trader, this article will go a long way in clearing a path for you. Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) was the first true cryptocurrency in the world. Launched back in 2009 by an anonymous person, it has remained the top crypto project by market cap. In recent years, it has gained acceptance by leasing financial institutions and is now accepted by numerous merchants as a form of payment. Bitcoin (BTC) is used as a digital store of value by many of its holders, and accounts for a large chunk of the total market cap of the crypto sector. The main downside with Bitcoin (BTC) is that it is trading quite close to its highs. Even the most optimistic estimates forecast that Bitcoin (BTC) could rise to $200,000 per coin. At the current price of around $107,000, that would represent gains of around 93% for its holders. While that might be impressive in any other sector, it is quite small in the crypto world. To get the huge 100x returns, the best strategy to use is to invest in crypto projects at the presale stage. These are projects whose true potential has not been explored by the crypto community, and they are poised for massive gains. One example of this is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently in the presale phase, analysts forecast that it could rise to $3 per coin. At the current presale price of $0.03, that is easily a 10,000% gain. XRP XRP is a cryptocurrency created by Ripple Labs back in 2012. It is designed to be a form of cross-border payments on the Ripple payment network. The main advantage that XRP offers users is fast speeds and low transaction costs. Unlike most other blockchain projects, XRP uses a distributed consensus ledger known as the XRP Ledger, which is maintained by validators. This ensures fast transactions and low fees. The XRP coin has become popular due to its high liquidity and potential for global transactions. The main downside to XRP is that its supply is highly controlled by Ripple Labs. As such, its price can be modulated by a central authority, disappointing holders. Additionally, Ripple Labs is a private for-profit entity that is duty-bound to make decisions that benefit its shareholders, and not XRP holders. Ripple Labs has also been engaged in lengthy legal disputes with the SEC, which could place its goal of replacing the SWIFT financial system in limbo. Overall, Ripple is not expected to make massive gains in the long term. For massive returns of double digits, your best option remains Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are currently in the presale, where each token is selling for $0.03. So far, over 35% of the tokens set aside for the current phase 5 of the presale have already been sold. The presale has raised over $10.6 million from eager investors, who number around 12,000 to date. In the upcoming phase 6 of the MUTM token presale, the price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. That increase is expected to reduce the expected ROI based on the $0.06 listing price from 100% to 71.43%. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Works Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. When lenders join a pool, they deposit their funds and start earning an annualized percentage yield. The interest rate that they earn on their assets is based on the pool utilization rate. The borrowers who deposit their assets in the pools as collateral benefit from being able to park their assets while accessing their liquidity. That means they can engage in trades on the open market and benefit from market opportunities in real time. At the same time, they will retain full access to their assets. When the value of those assets goes up, they can simply repay their loan and enjoy the benefits of the increased value. To protect the users of the protocol, the project has been CertiK-audited and received a Token Scan Score of 80. Based on the result of the audit, the presale has seen a massive boost in participation. The interest is expected to rise even higher when the tokens go live, due to the planned release of the beta version of the platform. It will act as proof that the project has been working on the protocol behind the scenes, helping to boost the price of MUTM tokens on exchanges. With a beta version launch planned for day one of the token listing, this could boost the price of MUTM tokens to new highs. As such, purchasing the tokens now while the price is just $0.03 could lead to 100x or more returns based on the analysts’ forecast of $3 per token. This is one opportunity you do not want to miss.

Therefore, this poll shows that 91.3% of participants believe XRP has all it takes to become one of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. This outcome might be due to a potential mix of ecosystem catalysts, investor sentiment, and technical setups. For instance, XRP’s open interest continues to soar above the $4 billion mark, signalling heightened market liquidity and activity. Technical indicators also paint a bullish XRP picture with market analyst Vlad Hryniv recently stipulating, “XRP is flashing bullish signals after bottoming around April 7. A W-shaped double bottom is forming — often a strong reversal pattern. If we break above $2.35–$2.36 resistance, next stops are $2.44 and possibly $2.60.” Source: Vlad Hryniv XRP is also primed to soar to the psychological price of $5 upon exiting an ascending triangle. At the time of this writing, XRP was traversing the $2.25 zone, according to CoinGecko data. Ripple’s $5 Million Investment in APAC To spur blockchain innovation in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, Ripple intends to pump in more than $5 million via its University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI). This move is meant to nurture next-generation blockchain talent in Australia, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. Therefore, Ripple intends to enhance APAC’s potential as a strategic hub for real-world deployment, innovation, and blockchain talent.

Despite the rising global uncertainty, ETH continues to show resilience, holding firmly above the $2,500 support zone. Bulls remain in control for now, but selling pressure is building as bears attempt to push the price below the current range. Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with investors closely watching for any sign of breakdown or breakout. Related Reading: Solana Approaches Critical Support Amid Middle East Conflicts – Can Demand Hold? Top analyst Rekt Capital recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Ethereum’s ability to maintain $2,500 as a support level despite the recent dip. Historically, this price level has acted as a strong foundation for rallies to $4,000, including significant moves in August 2021 and early 2024. If ETH can continue defending this zone, it may signal that bulls are ready to build momentum toward a new leg up, possibly triggering broader altcoin strength. However, with rising geopolitical risks and increased volatility across risk assets, Ethereum faces a true test of strength. If this level holds, it may mark the start of Ethereum’s next significant move. Will history repeat itself, or are further corrections ahead? Ethereum Faces Pressure But Holds Critical Support Zone Ethereum has dropped over 14% since Wednesday, sparking widespread fear and uncertainty among traders and long-term holders alike. Just days ago, sentiment was overwhelmingly bullish, with many investors expecting ETH to break above the $3,000 level and confirm a broader altcoin rally. However, geopolitical instability has disrupted market momentum. On Thursday, news of Israel’s attacks on Iran and subsequent retaliations sent shockwaves across global markets, triggering a sharp risk-off reaction and a spike in volatility across crypto assets. Despite the intense selling pressure, Ethereum is showing resilience. Rekt Capital shared a technical breakdown pointing out that ETH continues to hold the $2,500 level as key support. This isn’t the first time ETH has used $2,500 as a launchpad—historical patterns from August 2021 and early 2024 show that maintaining this level has led to rallies toward $4,000. According to Rekt, Ethereum must continue demonstrating stability around this zone to avoid a deeper retrace and keep bullish momentum alive. For the past five weeks, ETH has successfully defended the $2,500 region, forming a solid base of support despite repeated tests. Whether Ethereum can hold this ground once again will likely define the direction for altcoins and set the tone for the broader crypto market in the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces Stress As Israel-Iran Conflict Shakes Sentiment – ETH/BTC Support In Focus ETH Holds Support After Rejection At Range Highs Ethereum is trading at $2,556 following a sharp rejection from the $2,830 level earlier this week. As seen on the daily chart, ETH remains locked within a multi-week range between roughly $2,500 and $2,830. Despite the recent volatility driven by geopolitical tensions, Ethereum has managed to hold above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which are currently sloping upward — a positive sign for momentum. The red 200-day moving average, located around $2,642, has acted as a firm resistance barrier. ETH briefly broke above this level but failed to close above it with strength, leading to a retracement. Volume has spiked during these recent sessions, reflecting growing interest and emotional price reactions amid the Israel-Iran conflict. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeats History – Key Support Holds Again Ahead Of Potential Rally A key area to watch is the $2,500–$2,520 support zone. This range has acted as a floor multiple times and could serve as a launchpad if bulls regain control.

Get ready for some market drama involving a prominent trader and the transparency of the blockchain. The world of high-stakes decentralized finance (DeFi), particularly on platforms like Hyperliquid , is often shrouded in pseudonymity, but on-chain data has a way of revealing movements, sometimes contradicting public statements. That seems to be the case with well-known trader James Wynn. Who is James Wynn, the Crypto Whale ? James Wynn is a name that has surfaced in the crypto trading community, particularly associated with large positions, earning him the moniker of a ‘whale’. Whales are individuals or entities holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market prices with their trades. Wynn gained notable attention earlier this year after reports indicated he suffered massive losses, estimated around $100 million, primarily from leveraged trading positions. Following those significant losses, Wynn reportedly stated he would step back from active trading. However, recent activity flagged by on-chain analytics suggests he might still be involved, or at least, wallets linked to him are. The Latest Liquidation Claims on Hyperliquid According to prominent on-chain sleuths like Lookonchain on X (formerly Twitter), James Wynn, despite his previous declaration to halt trading, has reportedly faced another liquidation event. This alleged liquidation occurred on Hyperliquid , a popular decentralized perpetual exchange known for its speed and liquidity. The claim is that following this recent trading setback, a wallet believed to belong to Wynn moved its remaining assets to a centralized exchange (CEX), specifically KuCoin. This type of movement – transferring funds from a trading wallet, especially after reported losses, to a CEX deposit address – is often interpreted as a de-risking move or preparation to withdraw funds. On-Chain Data : The Unseen Evidence? The core of this controversy lies in the power and transparency of on-chain data . While Wynn reportedly denies the liquidation and claims the specific wallet highlighted by Lookonchain is not his, the on-chain evidence presented tells a compelling, albeit circumstantial, story. Here’s what the on-chain records reportedly show: A wallet address (let’s call it Wallet A) was identified as potentially belonging to or being controlled by James Wynn. Approximately 21 hours prior to the report, Wallet A initiated a transaction. This transaction sent 1.152 ETH (valued at roughly $2,910 at the time) and 137,000 USDC. The destination of these funds was identified as a deposit address belonging to KuCoin, a well-known centralized exchange. Why is sending funds to a specific KuCoin deposit address considered strong evidence? CEX deposit addresses are unique to a user’s account. While it’s possible for someone else to send funds *to* a deposit address, it’s highly unlikely for a significant amount like 137,000 USDC to be randomly sent to a deposit address unless the sender controls the associated CEX account or is sending it on behalf of the account owner. Coupled with the timing (following reported liquidation) and previous associations, on-chain analysts use such patterns to link wallet activity to known entities or individuals. Understanding Hyperliquid : Why Whales Trade Here Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange built on its own blockchain, Hyperliquid L1. It has gained popularity, partly due to its architecture designed for high throughput and low latency, aiming to provide a trading experience comparable to centralized exchanges but with the benefits of self-custody and transparency inherent in DeFi. Key features that attract traders, including whales like James Wynn , might include: High Liquidity: Essential for executing large trades without significant price impact. Speed and Performance: Designed for fast order execution, crucial for active traders. Self-Custody: Users retain control of their private keys and assets, reducing counterparty risk associated with CEXs. Variety of Assets: Offers perpetual contracts on numerous cryptocurrencies. However, trading perpetuals, especially with leverage on any platform, including Hyperliquid , comes with significant risks, the most prominent being liquidation. Liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin falls below the maintenance margin level, typically due to adverse price movements. The platform automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, often resulting in the loss of the initial margin. The James Wynn Saga: Lessons from a Crypto Whale ‘s Trades The alleged recent liquidation and the subsequent movement of funds, whether from James Wynn directly or a closely associated entity, highlight several important aspects of the crypto market and trading: Transparency of On-Chain Data : The blockchain is a public ledger. While wallet addresses are pseudonymous, sophisticated analysis and behavioral patterns can often link addresses to individuals or groups, especially when interacting with regulated entities like CEXs. Risks of Leverage: This incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of high-leverage trading. Even experienced traders or ‘whales’ are susceptible to rapid losses and liquidation when markets move unexpectedly. Denials vs. Data: In the transparent world of blockchain, public statements can sometimes be quickly verified or contradicted by immutable transaction records. This creates interesting dynamics between market narratives and verifiable facts. The Role of On-Chain Analysts: Services and individuals specializing in on-chain analysis play a crucial role in providing insights into market movements, whale activity, and fund flows, offering a layer of transparency not available in traditional finance. For retail traders, the key actionable insight is the critical importance of risk management. Never trade with funds you cannot afford to lose, especially when using leverage. Understand how liquidation works on the specific platform you are using, be it Hyperliquid or another exchange. While following whales can sometimes offer insights, their strategies often involve capital and risks far beyond what is suitable for average traders. Summary: The Data Speaks, Despite the Denial The situation surrounding James Wynn ‘s reported liquidation on Hyperliquid is a compelling case study in the crypto space. While Wynn denies the claims and the association with the wallet in question, the on-chain data presented by analysts like Lookonchain provides strong circumstantial evidence of a wallet sending significant assets to a known personal deposit address on KuCoin shortly after the alleged event. This incident underscores the inherent transparency of blockchain technology, the persistent risks of leveraged trading even for large players, and the power of on-chain analysis in tracking fund movements. It’s a vivid reminder that in the world of DeFi, data often tells the true story, regardless of public statements.

According to the report , the broader market experienced geopolitical shocks and a short squeeze, while the crypto sector saw rising potential for ether (ETH). Global markets remained relatively optimistic until the end of the week, when macroeconomic instabilities triggered price reversals. Markets Shake Amid Middle East Tensions At the beginning of the week, markets saw a strong rebound, fueled by improved relations between U.S. President Donald Trump and billionaire businessman Elon Musk. Their public dispute the week before had led to a broad sell-off across cryptocurrencies and the equities market. However, the potential reconciliation between the two men, coupled with solid economic data and progress on trade agreements between the U.S. and China, fueled a significant rebound in risk assets. The recovery continued from Monday until Thursday, when renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East made the headlines. Binance found that reports of cross-border military activity and regional strikes caused a negative reaction across asset classes, with S&P futures, cryptocurrencies, and bond yields plummeting. Contrarily, oil and gold prices surged due to their reputation as safe-haven assets. ETH Sees Positive Developments Analysts expect the crypto market to recover soon; however, the historical data supporting this prediction is mixed. In January 2020, cryptocurrencies were not negatively affected by tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Instead, they rallied in the short term. Conversely, digital assets declined during the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February 2022; however, it did not lead to a prolonged downturn, as the market recovered within a few weeks. Analysts expect the same to be the case this time, with cryptocurrencies recovering in a few weeks. Moreover, the crypto market is witnessing a broader regulatory shift, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) chairman, Paul Atkins, becoming more accommodating with decentralized finance (DeFi). He has promised clearer regulatory guidance for the sector, and Binance believes this could push the area to outperform others, bolstering Ethereum as the largest DeFi ecosystem. Ethereum has seen several developments that could increase the possibility of an altseason. The SEC recently made clarifications that enable Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to offer staking, making them yield-bearing products. Spot Ethereum exchange-traded products (ETPs) have also not experienced a single day of net outflows since May 16. This streak is a first for ETH and longer than any seen in the history of spot Bitcoin ETPs.

Then it bounced back and Michael Saylor was quick to make his point. After BTC plunged 4.33% to hit $103,660 before rebounding 2.35%, the MicroStrategy founder took to X with a message that lit up the crypto crowd: “If it’s not going to zero, it’s going to a million.” It’s not the first time Saylor has predicted Bitcoin at $1 million , but this time, the timing hit different. His comment came just as panic was setting in and it instantly reignited one of Bitcoin’s biggest questions: Are we still on the path to something massive? Let’s dig into what Saylor has to say. Crypto Community Reacts Saylor’s post drew quick replies from longtime Bitcoin supporters. Author Adam Livingston replied with his own ultra-bullish take, saying he expects Bitcoin to reach $13 million by 2045. Meanwhile, Blockstream CEO Adam Back reminded followers of a wild play he once set up: a limit order to buy all 21 million BTC at 2 cents each. That bet, placed in 2020 with investor Alistair Milne, was cancelled, but it resurfaced in the conversation as Bitcoin volatility returned. $1million Bitcoin it is then, as it's not going to zero as I have a limit order at 2c/BTC for 21m BTC. Outbid @alistairmilne 's 1c with 2c/BTC 21mil BTC live order on @bitfinex . https://t.co/lcYBUnomYs — Adam Back (@adam3us) June 14, 2025 MicroStrategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin Saylor has never been one for just talk. His company is still buying. Now rebranded as Strategy, the firm added 1,045 BTC for $110.02 million in its latest purchase. That brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 582,000 BTC, currently valued at $63.85 billion. The company has also posted a solid return in 2025 so far, with its Bitcoin portfolio up 17.1% year-to-date. 8,000 Dormant BTC Moves, Eyes on Institutions On-chain data added to the buzz. A market analyst from CryptoQuant flagged that 8,000 BTC, untouched for 3 to 5 years, were suddenly moved from Coinbase Custody. That service is typically used by institutional investors, and the analyst believes the transfer could be tied to Strategy or spot Bitcoin ETFs. But for now, it looks like buying activity from these players may be on pause. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 14 June, 2025 , $415M in BTC Longs Wiped Out The recent drop shook sentiment and it triggered heavy liquidations. $415 million worth of long positions were wiped, compared to just $28.69 million in shorts. That’s a 1,446% imbalance, pointing to how unprepared bullish traders were for the crash. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East may have triggered the move, but the sharp recovery shows the market is still full of conviction, especially from names like Saylor. Bottom line: The market may be shaky, but Saylor isn’t. He’s predicting a million-dollar Bitcoin and investing like it. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin fell hard yesterday , due to the ongoing geopolitical tensions triggered in the Middle East. Some altcoins are showing signs of life, short sellers are being wiped out, and analysts believe a bounce could be coming. So, is this the start of a comeback? Bitcoin Crashes Amid Global Tension On one of the worst days this June, Bitcoin dropped nearly 4%, crashing to around $102,664. This drop was mainly due to rising tensions in the Middle East , which triggered panic across markets. As a result, the crypto space saw over $1 billion in leveraged positions wiped out in just one day. But within 24 hours, things began to change. While the market is still shaky, many coins have started to rise again. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 14 June, 2025 , Short Traders Take the Bigger Hit Today, another $190.25 million in leveraged trades were liquidated.

Shiba Inu gained 4%, Hyperliquid (HYPE) jumped 4.5%, Litecoin (LTC) rose 3%, Pi Network (Pi) increased 4.2%, and PEPE saw a 3.6% bump.

If so, you’ve likely noticed the growing excitement around US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These investment vehicles have become a significant gateway for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. The latest data reveals a truly encouraging trend that speaks volumes about the current market sentiment and the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Continue Strong Streak According to recent data from Farside Investors, June 13th marked a notable day for the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market. These funds collectively saw a substantial net inflow totaling $301.7 million . What makes this figure particularly significant is that it represents the fifth consecutive trading day where these ETFs have experienced net positive inflows. This consistent buying pressure is a key indicator that investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure through regulated products remains robust. Understanding net inflows is crucial. It means that on this particular day, the total amount of money flowing into these ETFs from new investments or purchases of shares exceeded the amount flowing out from redemptions or sales of shares. A streak of consecutive net inflows suggests sustained positive sentiment and accumulation rather than fleeting interest. Breaking Down the Bitcoin ETF Contributions While the overall figure is impressive, looking at the individual performance of the various US Spot Bitcoin ETFs provides a clearer picture of where the money is going. Here’s a breakdown of the top contributors on June 13th: BlackRock’s IBIT: Leading the pack by a significant margin, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded a massive $239 million in net inflows. This continues BlackRock’s dominance in attracting capital into the Bitcoin space via their ETF product. Fidelity’s FBTC: Following BlackRock, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw healthy net inflows of $25.2 million . Fidelity has consistently been one of the strongest performers alongside BlackRock since the ETFs launched. Bitwise’s BITB: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) added $14.9 million in net inflows, demonstrating steady interest in their offering. Grayscale’s GBTC: In a significant shift from earlier trends, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded net inflows of $9.1 million . For months after the conversion to an ETF, GBTC experienced significant outflows, largely due to its higher fees compared to competitors. Recent inflows suggest that this selling pressure may be easing, and some investors might even be re-entering or finding value in GBTC. Grayscale’s BTC (Mini): Grayscale’s new, lower-fee Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) also saw inflows, bringing in $7.5 million . This new fund is designed to offer a more competitive fee structure. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck’s Bitcoin Trust (HODL) rounded out the list of positive contributors with $6 million in net inflows. It’s worth noting that data for ARK 21Shares’ ARKB was not yet available at the time of the report. The remaining US Spot Bitcoin ETFs tracked by Farside Investors showed no change in their holdings for the day. What Does This Streak of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Signify? The consistent inflow trend, particularly the five-day streak, is a powerful signal for the market. Here’s why it matters: Sustained Demand: It indicates that the demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated, accessible products is not a one-off event but a sustained trend. Institutional Interest: While retail investors certainly participate, the significant amounts flowing into funds like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC are often attributed to larger institutions, wealth managers, and financial advisors allocating capital on behalf of their clients. This suggests increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption. Market Validation: The success and continued growth of these ETFs provide further validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset in traditional financial circles. Potential Price Impact: While not the only factor, consistent net inflows represent buying pressure on Bitcoin itself, as ETF issuers purchase BTC to back the new shares being created. This can contribute positively to Bitcoin’s price performance over time. Easing GBTC Pressure: The fact that GBTC is now seeing inflows, even modest ones, suggests that the large selling pressure from that fund, which weighed on the market for a period, may be subsiding. This period contrasts with earlier phases following the January launch, where initial euphoria was followed by some volatility and periods of net outflows, particularly from GBTC. The current streak suggests a more stable and growing base of demand. The Broader Context: Cryptocurrency ETF Landscape The success of the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is also influencing the broader Cryptocurrency ETF landscape. It highlights the demand for regulated crypto investment products and could pave the way for other single-asset or basket crypto ETFs in the future, assuming regulatory hurdles can be cleared. Investors are clearly looking for familiar, regulated wrappers to access the potential upside of the crypto market. While the focus is currently on Bitcoin, the infrastructure and investor comfort level being built by these products could eventually benefit other digital assets seeking ETF approval. What’s Next? Keeping an Eye on the Data For investors and market watchers, monitoring the daily inflow and outflow data for these US Spot Bitcoin ETFs remains a crucial activity. Continued strong inflows would likely be interpreted as a bullish signal for Bitcoin and reflect ongoing demand from traditional finance. Conversely, a return to significant outflows could indicate shifting sentiment or macroeconomic pressures. Other factors to watch include regulatory developments, changes in global economic conditions, and significant price movements in Bitcoin itself, all of which can influence ETF flows. Challenges and Considerations Despite the positive trend, it’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, remains volatile. ETF flows can change direction quickly. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment can all impact demand for these products. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance. Conclusion: A Strong Vote of Confidence The streak of five consecutive days of net inflows, culminating in the $301.7 million figure on June 13th, is a powerful indicator of growing confidence and sustained demand for Bitcoin via the US Spot Bitcoin ETF structure. Led by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, these funds are successfully bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. The data suggests that institutional adoption is not just a buzzword but a tangible trend driving significant capital into the Bitcoin ecosystem. As these inflows continue, they provide a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s position as a recognized and increasingly accepted investment asset.

Calling out this development, market analyst Crypto Sat noted, “SHIB is flashing a bullish reversal signal on the daily chart. After weeks of consistent lower highs and lower lows, the price action is now compressed into a classic falling wedge — a pattern that often leads to breakouts.” Source: Crypto Sat The analyst added that if SHIB follows history, falling wedges usually lead to solid upside runs for the second-largest meme coin. Therefore, Shiba Inu must hold the critical support base of $0.000012 with a breakout confirmation above $0.000013 being the linchpin. At the time of writing, SHIB was hovering around the $0.00001218 zone, showing that it’s a stone’s throw away from hitting the breakout point with higher lows continuously playing out. A higher low entails a price point where the lowest point of a pullback is higher than the previous low. Together with a higher high, they signal an uptrend. Shiba Inu Wallets Go Through the Roof The meme coin continues to witness soaring user growth, with more than 1,500,000 unique addresses holding Shiba Inu. Therefore, SHIB is witnessing more holders, which means wider distribution is needed to strengthen network effects, support decentralized projects, and boost liquidity. As the Shiba Inu holder count climbs, bullish sentiment continues to rock its community. Meanwhile, SHIB’s open interest recently witnessed a 4.11% increase, suggesting intensified market activity and liquidity.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,MARKET|SHIB|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 11:44:18

In a new interview at the Bloomberg Credit Forum, the DoubleLine Capital founder says the Fed will likely need to counter a lack of demand for the long end of US Treasuries in the form of quantitative easing (QE). QE is when a central bank buys assets, typically government bonds, to inject money into the economy, aiming to boost money supply and reduce long-term interest rates. Many investors have flocked to short term bonds this cycle, with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reportedly owning at least 5% of the short-term T-bill market. With a lack of demand hurting long-term Treasuries and boosting yields up to painful levels, Gundlach says the Fed will most likely respond with a similar reaction to the Covid-induced money printing campaign of 2020. He says that once yields get up to around 6%, a money printing agenda will come to the forefront. “There will come a moment where you have to pivot because there’s going to be a response. And I’ve got many ideas of what that response might be, but one of the leading candidates would be quantitative easing. So you get to a point where the rate is so uncomfortably high – what is that number? I’m going to guess 6% – where they say ‘this is going to be something where we’re going to be running a $5 trillion budget deficit with all this bond issuance when we go into a recession. And so they’ll pivot – I believe this is a sensible idea, there’s other ideas too – but the leading candidate is they will announce quantitative easing on buying long term treasuries, and when they do, you have to, very quickly – and hopefully you do it the day before they announce it [because] we don’t have access to the day before stuff, that’s for the primary broker dealers. But you would need to buy long-term treasuries as much as you possibly could. Because when that gets announced, it’ll be just like when they announced buying corporate bonds in Covid, where all of a sudden the corporate bond market went from being down 20 points to right back to where it started in just a matter of a few days you coud get a 20 point rally on the long bond if they announce they’re buying the long bond.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart cautioned that a swift approval is unlikely, despite optimism from market participants. In a post on X, Seyffart noted that there needs to be a regulatory back-and-forth before any green light. “If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were A LOT of filings over the preceding couple months before launch,” he wrote. Spot Bitcoin ETFs were eventually approved in January 2024, over a decade after the first application by Gemini’s Winklevoss twins in 2013. All Eyes on Staking Language in Solana Filings The filings from major players—Fidelity Investments, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and VanEck—all include language around staking, which has become a key area of regulatory focus. Fidelity submitted a new S-1 form, while others amended earlier filings. VanEck, which initiated the first U.S. Solana ETF application in early June 2024, submitted its amended version last. Seyffart confirmed , “All of them include staking language, I believe.” While experience with prior Bitcoin and Ether ETF approvals could help speed up procedural elements, he emphasized that staking remains an unresolved issue with no precedent yet set. The SEC is also reviewing proposals to add staking features to already-approved spot Ether ETFs. Staking, which allows holders of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ethereum to earn rewards, has raised questions about whether it constitutes a securities offering—a gray area that regulators have yet to define clearly. SOL, ETH ETFs Could See Staking Decisions Together Seyffart speculated that both Solana and Ether ETFs could potentially receive staking approvals simultaneously. “They could theoretically be launched with staking at the same time,” he said, while clarifying he has “no insight into what will actually happen.” Bloomberg Intelligence raised its estimate for Solana ETF approval in 2025 to 90% back in April. Meanwhile, in January, Consensys founder Joe Lubin expressed optimism that staking features for Ether ETFs could be authorized “soon.” Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas added to the excitement, suggesting an “altcoin ETF summer” could be on the horizon, with Solana poised to take the lead.

Staking Language Included In The Updated Filings The proposed ETFs from investment firms, including 21Shares, Bitwise, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, VanEck, and Canary Capital, seek to give US investors direct exposure to the price of Solana without them having to hold the altcoin directly. As per the revised filings, would-be issuers submitted updated S-1s, a registration statement required for a spot exchange-traded fund to gain SEC approval for public trading. The filings clarified language that would enable them to stake their held SOL. The staking component would allow issuers to generate yield on the Solana held in their funds, allowing them to deliver higher returns to investors. Friday’s moves come following a Tuesday report from Blockworks , which cited sources saying that the SEC had instructed prospective Solana ETF issuers to update their S-1 filings. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said at the time that this signals the agency is more likely than before to approve some of these products, giving a timeline of two to four months for spot SOL ETFs to begin trading. UPDATE: Multiple stories broke the news earlier this week that the SEC had reached out to issuers requesting them to submit updated documents for their Solana ETFs & to include staking. As of 5 PM EST we have 6 of the 7 hopeful Solana ETF issuers that have submitted those S-1's pic.twitter.com/WqPI2jf2CW — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 13, 2025 The SEC has also reportedly indicated its openness to staking within the ETF structure. On April 30, Bloomberg ETF analysts upped their estimated odds of the SEC approving a Solana ETF in 2025 to 90%, placing them at the top of their list. ETFs based on XRP follow closely with approval odds of around 85%. The SEC has greenlighted spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as well as hybrid Bitcoin-Ethereum funds. However, it has been hesitant to let issuers introduce products that track other altcoins beyond ETH, despite a rash of filings for funds that would track Avalanche, Dogecoin, XRP, and Official Trump. The agency recently postponed making a decision on several of those investment vehicles and asked for public comment. Some pundits believe Solana has a better chance at securing the regulatory nod under the more leniet SEC leadership of Paul Atkins , especially following CME’s listing of SOL futures , which is not a necessary step in the ETF listing process but is usually considered as beneficial. Solana currently ranks sixth on the crypto leaderboard, with a market cap of $77.4 billion. SOL is trading hands at around $146.74 at publication time, up a paltry 0.5% over the last 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko .",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 11:50:56

The ancient metal, long dismissed by economists and dumped by central banks after the collapse of the gold standard in the 1970s, has now climbed to the second most-held reserve asset on the planet—right behind the US dollar. Governments that once sold their gold for decades are now buying it again. And not in small amounts. Over the past three years, net central bank purchases have been over 1,000 tonnes annually, a record pace. That demand pushed gold above the euro in global reserves for the first time ever. The last time central banks held this much gold was back in 1965 during the Bretton Woods system. Trump’s policies trigger dollar doubts Donald Trump’s second term lit the fuse. His trade wars , unpredictable foreign policy, and fiscal blowouts drove investors and foreign governments to question the strength of the US dollar and Treasury bonds. The dollar, once the default haven in global crises, just dropped to a three-year low against the euro and pound. John Reade, chief market strategist at the World Gold Council, didn’t overcomplicate it. “It’s Trump, in a word,” he said . “It’s the risk and uncertainty from the new US administration.” Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs and increasing debt raised concerns over US fiscal discipline. His attacks on the Federal Reserve and US courts have only made things worse. Meanwhile, the price of gold has surged. This April, it hit a new intraday high of over $3,000 per troy ounce, beating the previous all-time high set in 1980. That marked a 30% rise just in 2025. After Israel bombed Iran, investors jumped into gold again, pushing prices close to that peak. For many, this wasn’t just another crisis hedge. It was a full-blown retreat from traditional safe assets like bonds. Central banks in Asia and beyond load up Most of the heavy buying came from countries outside the US and Europe. Central banks in China, Turkey, and India have been leading the charge. These governments are trying to reduce their exposure to the dollar in case they ever face sanctions similar to what Russia dealt with after the Ukraine invasion. Their goal isn’t high returns. They’re simply stacking assets that can’t be frozen, sanctioned, or printed out of thin air. With few other currencies offering enough liquidity or political neutrality, central banks are settling for gold. Oh, but demand comes with problems. When traders rushed to import gold into New York earlier this year over tariff fears, it clogged up the system. At the Bank of England, the world’s second-biggest gold vault, queues to withdraw metal stretched on for weeks. Bank staff couldn’t keep up with the requests. Eventually, Trump clarified that gold wouldn’t face tariffs. The old belief that US Treasuries were the safest place to park reserves doesn’t hold like it used to. Even private fund managers are sounding alarms. A recent Bank of America survey found that 45% of them think gold is overvalued right now—the highest number since 2008. Still, for the second month in a row, gold was called the “most crowded trade” in markets. Everyone seems to be in it, even the skeptics. Kenneth Rogoff, professor at Harvard and former IMF chief economist, said the narrative around crypto replacing gold doesn’t hold up anymore. “People often say bitcoin is the new gold. I say, ‘No, gold is the new gold.’” But not everyone’s rooting for a return to the gold standard. Economists argue that pegging currencies to a fixed asset caused more harm than good during past downturns, including the Great Depression. It limited governments’ ability to react to crises. That’s why even those who are bullish on gold don’t see it replacing the dollar anytime soon. Still, the fear is real. And the demand is real. So yeah, for now, gold is doing what it’s always done best—sit still, stay quiet, and hold its value while the rest of the world freaks out.

His message, published in a National Cryptocurrency Association post, lays bare the ever-present threat of digital scams and offers a clear roadmap for staying safe in today’s fast-moving crypto landscape. “Protecting yourself is just as important in your crypto wallet as it is in your email inbox or your ng app,” Alderoty cautioned. As cryptocurrencies gain broader adoption, bad actors have found new ways to exploit users. While blockchain technology offers revolutionary benefits, it also presents risks, especially for those unfamiliar with digital security. Protecting yourself is just as important in your crypto wallet as it is in your email inbox or your banking app. In my latest @FastCompany op-ed, I share some habits to stay safer. https://t.co/4xCuoFF0sr — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 13, 2025 Online Scams in the Crypto Era: What You Must Know Alderoty’s post outlines six of the most common and dangerous online scams targeting crypto holders. These schemes are designed to exploit trust, curiosity, and urgency—traits that scammers leverage to defraud even the most cautious users. Pig Butchering Scams: This elaborate deception begins with fraudsters creating fake emotional or social relationships. Whether posing as a romantic interest, a friendly mentor, or a business partner, their goal is always the same: to lure victims into investing in fake crypto schemes. Once the money is transferred, the scammer disappears, leaving the victim emotionally and financially devastated. Pump-and-Dump Schemes : These scams target lesser-known tokens, artificially inflating their prices through orchestrated hype across social media or messaging platforms. When unsuspecting investors buy in, the organizers dump their holdings at the top, causing the token’s value to crash, leaving victims holding worthless coins. Phony Crypto Giveaways: Social media is filled with posts promising to “double your crypto” if you send a small amount first. These offers are 100% fraudulent. Legitimate giveaways never require upfront payments, and any request for such should immediately raise alarms. Impersonation Scams : Scammers often pose as support agents, regulators, or known brands to trick users into revealing sensitive data or sending crypto to bogus addresses. Despite appearing professional, these impersonators’ true goal is to deceive and exploit others for personal gain. Phishing Attacks: Similar to traditional web attacks, phishing in Web3 involves emails, social media messages, or websites designed to mimic trusted platforms. The goal is to deceive users into entering their wallet credentials or recovery phrases, handing complete control over to the attacker. Random Messages and Cold Contacts : Unexpected texts like “How are you?” or “I found your number” should always raise red flags. These messages are often the first step in more complex scams. Scammers hope to create a false sense of familiarity and slowly reel victims in. How to Shield Yourself from Crypto Scams Alderoty stresses that online safety isn’t about fear, it’s about being equipped. By adopting a few simple yet effective habits, users can substantially reduce their risk of falling victim to digital threats, even as they continue to evolve. Here are the six safety tips every XRP holder and crypto user in general should follow: Keep Your Private Key Offline : Share your public address freely, but never expose your private key or recovery phrase. Think of your private key as the master key to your vault—if someone has it, they control your funds. Scrutinize Every Link : Be wary of random links, especially those in emails, DMs, or social media posts. Always verify the sender and hover over the URL to ensure it leads to a legitimate site. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Watch Out for Urgency Tactics : Scammers often try to rush you with lines like “limited-time offer” or “act now.” These high-pressure tactics are designed to bypass your judgment. Take your time and investigate before taking any action. Do Your Research: When considering a crypto investment, research the project’s development team, review its whitepaper, assess community feedback, and evaluate its reputation. Don’t be swayed by hype or anonymous endorsements. Trust Your Instincts, but Check the Facts : If something seems off—misspelled names, unofficial logos, or overly generous promises—stop and verify. Gut feelings are often your best early warning system. Avoid Unsolicited Messages : Ignore random DMs, texts, or emails from unknown individuals. Scammers often use unsolicited messages to initiate contact, whether posing as a new friend, a promising opportunity, or a fake support agent. Crypto Is About Empowerment, But Caution Is Key While the decentralization and control that come with crypto are empowering, Alderoty reminds users that personal responsibility is the cornerstone of digital safety. “Crypto gives people more control, more access, and more opportunity. But that means nothing without trust and safety,” he emphasized. He also noted that, according to a wide-reaching survey conducted by his organization, fewer than 1% of U.S. crypto holders have experienced fraud or breaches—a far lower figure than the 34% who have faced banking scams or the 40% who’ve encountered fraud on dating apps. This proves that when used wisely, crypto can be safer than many traditional online systems. Alderoty encourages newcomers to be “crypto curious,” but also vigilant. With habits such as two-factor authentication, cautious clicking, and secure key storage, users can confidently navigate the digital finance world. Bottom Line The rapid evolution of the crypto space brings both opportunities and risks. Scammers are becoming more sophisticated, but so are the tools and practices that can keep you safe. With the right awareness, crypto doesn’t have to be a risky endeavor; it can be a powerful tool for financial freedom.

This income was one of Trump's biggest earnings items in 2024, according to a financial disclosure released by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on June 13. According to the New York Post, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, called World Liberty Financial, was founded in 2024 by Zach Witkoff. Witkoff's father, Steve Witkoff, serves as Trump's special envoy for the Ukraine-Russia peace talks and the Iran nuclear deal. The platform's other founders are Trump's sons Donald Jr., Eric and Barron Trump.

If their prediction is to happen, the XRP Ledger could be processing billions of dollars worth of assets daily, which would definitely impact the native token’s price – but by how much? 14% of Swift’s Volume? Responding to the question asked at the XRP Apex 2025 event in Singapore earlier this week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said it’s important to distinguish SWIFT into two parts – messaging and liquidity. He focused on the second, as it could influence the XRP Ledger more since it is owned by the banks. “I think less about the messaging and more about liquidity. If you are driving all the liquidity, it is good for XRP … so I will say in five years, 14%.” Even if we remove the messaging part from this equation, SWIFT handles approximately $5 trillion in transactions per day, according to Statista’s conservative metrics. This puts the annual amount at around $1.25 quadrillion if we assume there are 250 business days yearly. 14% out of that mindblowing amount would result in a $175 trillion volume settled in Ripple’s cross-border token on its network annually, or $700 billion daily. Although not all value remains in XRP, the liquidity needed to ensure there are no delays should be at least $175 billion (daily) if one token is used around four times per day for settlements. When we asked ChatGPT about XRP’s price potential in such a scenario, it responded that the asset could blow up to somewhere above $20 when we considered all narratives. The SWIFT volume, even though it would be a massive portion, would still complement everything else that goes on in the Ripple (XRP) ecosystem – staking, holding, network expansion, RLUSD adoption, potential ETF approvals , etc. Ridiculous Predictions Time While a price tag of $10 or even $20 sounds quite mindboggling as of now (current price – under $2.2), the XRP Army was even more bullish following Garlinghouse’s comments. Predictions started to fly in, outlining ridiculous targets for the future, including almost $1,500 per coin. This #XRP bull flag has a $1,452.81 price target. Do you believe in it? pic.twitter.com/pRFksuCe9V — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) June 13, 2025 Some even brought up the aforementioned RLUSD adoption, which could also somehow push XRP’s price to the stratosphere. It’s official: $RLUSD is set to trigger a guaranteed $1,250 price for $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/RW0StcSHuv — KingXRP (@MRKingXRP) June 13, 2025 However, investors should be aware that these targets are simply numbers that have little substance to back them up, for now at least. Before you start allocating funds to XRP expecting such massive price surges, please beware that $1,250 per XRP would mean that its market cap would be north of $67 trillion – that’s more than Bitcoin, Amazon, Apple, Google, and gold combined.

Storm says that the U.S. Department of Justice is making it hard for him to defend himself in court. He had called six expert witnesses to support his defense, but the DOJ rejected five entirely and placed strict limits on the sixth, blockchain expert Matthew Edman. The case began after the U.S. sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2023, accusing it of helping North Korean hackers. But Storm denies the claims. The focus is now on whether he can get a fair trial without enough expert witnesses. I’m Roman Storm. I poured my soul into Tornado Cash—software that’s non-custodial, trustless, permissionless, immutable, unstoppable. In 31 days, I face trial. The DOJ wants to bury DeFi, saying I should’ve controlled it, added KYC, never built it. SDNY is trying to crush… — Roman Storm (@rstormsf) June 13, 2025 DOJ Denies 5 of 6 Proposed Experts The DOJ has pushed back hard, saying that most expert witnesses were not relevant to the core issue – his alleged role in violating international sanctions. It also criticized how the witnesses were selected and the methods they used. They argued that their testimony on topics like digital privacy, blockchain tech, tokenomics, and KYC rules was irrelevant to the case. “There are multiple deficiencies in the proposed testimony, including that they are inappropriate subjects for expert testimony, lack a reliable methodology or basis in facts and data, or are irrelevant, unfairly prejudicial, and confusing to the jury.” Community Support Grows Although Tornado Cash has been removed from the US Treasury’s sanctions list, Storm is still under pressure. But the support is growing for him. Many have donated to his legal fund, which he had called for several times during the case. The Ethereum Foundation pledged $500K from its treasury and raised $750K from the wider crypto community to help fund his legal defense. The EF is donating $500K to the legal defense of Roman Storm, and we will match up to a further $750K in donations from the community. Privacy is normal, and writing code is not a crime. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) June 13, 2025 But without expert witnesses, he may face major challenges in the court. Defense Team Requests More Time Storm’s legal team has requested a two-day extension to respond to the DOJ’s motion to block their expert witnesses. They say it won’t delay the case, but the DOJ is still opposing the request, even though it had asked for the same extension if needed. Storm still faces several charges for his role in running Tornado Cash.

While Ethereum undergoes internal changes and SUI tests resistance levels, a new contender— Qubetics ($TICS)—is gaining significant traction as it approaches the final stage of its presale. With bullish patterns appearing on price charts and major protocols reassessing their core strategies, market sentiment is shifting. While Ethereum navigates project management hurdles and SUI rides positive price momentum, Qubetics introduces a new level of value: uniting blockchains while offering practical, secure applications like its decentralized VPN. As crypto presales continue to reshape how early-stage investments work, Qubetics is increasingly recognised as one of the top cryptos to invest in today. The Interoperability Gamechanger: Why Qubetics Is More Than Just a Coin Qubetics addresses Interoperability by connecting isolated blockchains into one unified network. By bringing together Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and others, it allows users and businesses to transact, swap, or build across multiple chains, without the technical complexity. Imagine a DeFi startup in Texas issuing tokens on Ethereum but relying on Solana for faster payments. Qubetics bridges the gap. Or an e-commerce entrepreneur in Canada managing NFTs from different blockchains, all from one simple dashboard. Qubetics makes this kind of cross-chain flexibility possible. From NFT creators in Brooklyn to logistics companies in Seattle, the demand for seamless blockchain integration is growing, and Qubetics is already delivering. With its Web3 aggregator set to launch, $TICS is a working solution to a long-standing problem. That’s why Qubetics is emerging as one of the top cryptos to invest in today. Qubetics Presale: Final Stage, Final Call — Top Cryptos to Invest in Today The attention around Qubetics is not only about its utility, but also its timing. The project is now in its 37th and final crypto presale stage, with each $TICS token priced at $0.3370. So far, over 515 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $18 million. With over 27,900 holders already on board, fewer than 10 million tokens remain. With a listing price of $0.40, buyers at this stage lock in an immediate 20% return once trading begins. But projections suggest that this could just be the beginning. Analysts estimate that $TICS may rise to $5 or even $10 in the next market cycle. At that rate, a $15,000 investment today could grow to between $225,000 and $450,000—returns that rarely come twice. Unlike many other presale projects, Qubetics backs its momentum with real changes. The total token supply has been reduced from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, creating meaningful scarcity. In addition, 38.55% of the tokens are allocated to the community, giving actual users greater control over the platform’s direction. This strengthens Qubetics’ commitment to true decentralization. The Qubetics presale represents a shift in how early-stage crypto projects work: it’s scarcity-driven, community-led, and built around real utility. For those who missed early opportunities in Ethereum or were priced out of SUI, Qubetics offers a rare entry point. That’s why $TICS is quickly becoming one of the top cryptos to invest in today. Ethereum Shifts Gears: Geth Drama Signals Deeper Prioritization Crisis Geth project lead Peter Szilágyi recently accused the Ethereum Foundation of sidelining Geth, the main software powering Ethereum. According to his tweets, EF has stopped prioritizing Geth’s development, placing it “on life support” despite being central to Ethereum’s operation. Szilágyi noted he hasn’t seen any long-term planning or strategy support for years, raising concerns over sustainability and transparency. Ethereum developers scramble to fill positions. Szilágyi’s call-out mentioned the challenge of recruiting engineers capable of handling low-level languages like Golang or Rust—a must for core Ethereum software. What’s even more troubling is his claim that the Ethereum Foundation hasn’t posted a single Geth developer position publicly in over three years. SUI’s Bullish Setup: Price Holds Strong at Crucial Level SUI, meanwhile, is riding technical strength. At the time of analysis, the token trades at $1.11 and sits on a powerful confluence zone. It’s holding steady at the 50-day EMA and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the $1.47 swing high to the $0.92 swing low. As long as this zone holds, SUI remains primed for another leg higher. Trading volume is up 13% in 24 hours, and its RSI has reset, hinting at renewed buying strength. Market analysts suggest a clean break above $1.14 could push SUI toward a retest of $1.35, with a possible upside move toward $1.47 in the near term. That setup makes it a strong momentum candidate. Support zones are layered between $1.05 and $1.02, with a hard stop at $1.00. Should the bulls keep control, these levels could form the launchpad for SUI’s next rally. For market participants looking for breakout potential, SUI presents a technically compelling chart—and one that’s getting serious attention as part of the top cryptos to invest in today watchlist. Final Thoughts: Join Top Cryptos to Invest in Today The crypto market is clearly pivoting toward real-world use and community-first models. Finding top cryptos to invest in today is heating up. Ethereum’s internal shakeups expose a centralized blind spot. SUI, while technically strong, still lacks an all-chain utility layer. Qubetics, with its full-spectrum interoperability and final-stage token sale, checks both boxes, substance and timing. The final $TICS tokens are selling fast, and the 20% price bump at listing adds urgency. Now’s the moment to join this best crypto presale before the window shuts and the market wakes up to Qubetics’ long-term dominance. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is Qubetics and how does it work? Qubetics is a Web3 aggregator that connects top blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, enabling real-world interoperability for users and businesses. What makes the Qubetics presale stand out? It’s in its final stage, offering a fixed price with guaranteed 20% ROI at launch. Over $18M has already been raised. Is Qubetics among the top cryptos to invest in today? Yes, due to its cross-chain tech, community-first tokenomics, and real-world application, it ranks as one of the top cryptos to invest in today . What’s the SUI price prediction in the near term? If the $1.14 resistance is broken, SUI may test $1.35 to $1.47, riding on strong volume and bullish technicals. Why is Ethereum facing internal criticism right now? Lead devs claim the Ethereum Foundation is deprioritizing Geth, causing transparency concerns and project instability. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

46001063,https://crypto.news/?p=14388755,1749905240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/46001063.jpeg,"Trump turns crypto influence into income, ethics form shows $57m token windfall",https://crypto.news/trump-57m-fcrypto-venture-world-liberty-financial/,"President Donald Trump has reported $57.4 million in income from World Liberty Financial, his cryptocurrency venture backed by sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump. According to the Financial Times, citing a 200-page filing, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics discloses that one of Trump’s largest revenue sources among hundreds of financial interests is his crypto venture. The filing shows Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in World Liberty Financial. Instead of a direct investment, the tokens were obtained through his promotional activities on the network. The report also shows that Trump holds positions in holding companies linked to digital ventures, such as CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC, though these entities reported little to no income. The document includes Trump’s certification that the information provided is “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge,” and is subject to review by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. Earlier this year, Trump removed David Huitema as director of the Office of Government Ethics, an independent agency responsible for overseeing ethics rules and financial disclosures for the executive branch.

Trump’s crypto fortune fuels conflict-of-interest concerns According to 2024 SEC filings, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, was a “promoter” of the World Liberty Financial initiative. The venture operates as a decentralized finance platform offering cryptocurrency lending and trading services. Since it launched last year, World Liberty Financial sold 21 billion tokens in a public offering, generating $1 billion in funding. Trump’s involvement appears legal on the surface, but Democrats and some Republicans have flagged Trump’s willingness to profit while in office as a conflict of interest —particularly since the president holds substantial crypto stakes while influencing policy. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has dropped several high-profile enforcement cases against cryptocurrency companies since taking office. This has created a more favorable regulatory environment for the industry, one in which Trump has seemingly granted investors access to the executive branch if they’re Official Trump ( TRUMP ) owners. Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top House Democrat, recently opened a probe into the private dinner Trump hosted for top investors in his meme coin. In addition to World Liberty Financial, Trump Media & Technology Group declared its intention to raise $2.5 billion for a “bitcoin treasury” strategy and to introduce a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

Prior to the SEC dropping charges under the new leadership, the Biden administration had pursued the matter. DRW’s investment makes it among the largest financiers of Trump Media’s cryptocurrency expansion plans. The funding supports the company’s ambitions to acquire over $2 billion in cryptocurrency holdings and establish bitcoin treasury operations.

Short sellers faced $251,000 in liquidations, amplifying ADA’s upward nudge to $0.7242. However, ADA struggles to break its wedge pattern’s resistance. Without a high-volume breakout, it may stall. Moreover, Cardano’s methodical growth lags behind newer projects. Investors eyeing crypto prices today seek faster gains elsewhere, spotlighting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a stronger contender. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale ignites Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is captivating investors in its phase 5 presale. Priced at $0.03, the token has tripled from its phase one price of $0.01.

What Happened? The CBDT has identified widespread non-compliance related to crypto income and has sent notices via email, asking recipients to update their Income Tax Returns (ITRs). “The department has recently sent emails to thousands of defaulting persons to review their ITR and update it if any income on account of VDA (Virtual Digital Asset) transactions has not been properly declared,” a senior CBDT official confirmed . The undeclared income violates provisions under the Income Tax Act, 1961 and is now under close scrutiny. Why CBDT Launched This Probe This enforcement action is part of CBDT’s NUDGE initiative (Non-Intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable) under Section 80GGC. The focus is to detect tax evasion and money laundering in crypto activities. Key triggers for the crackdown include: Large crypto trades not matched with income disclosures Use of undisclosed offshore wallets Crypto profits converted into cash with no tax reporting Lack of foreign asset declaration by traders This action aligns with the Indian government’s efforts to bring transparency to the digital asset ecosystem and combat financial crimes involving crypto. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Faces $190M Liquidation—But Signs Hint at Upcoming Rally , What Crypto Investors Need to Do If you’ve received a notice or believe your crypto income is not properly declared, take the following steps: Review your past ITRs for any undeclared crypto gains Gather records of all VDA transactions File an updated return using ITR-U under Section 139(8A) Declare crypto income separately from other capital gains for clarity Timely compliance can help avoid penalties and formal investigations. What’s Next? The CBDT has made it clear that this is a final reminder. Those who fail to respond to the notice may be subjected to verification or in-depth scrutiny . “Those who fail to respond to the nudge may be picked for verification or scrutiny,” CBDT warned. This action signals a stricter enforcement environment for crypto users in India. As virtual assets grow in popularity, the tax department is stepping up efforts to ensure transparency and legal compliance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Rising uncertainty and tensions could also limit future rallies. The flagship cryptocurrency is down almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $105,103. Despite the decline and bearish sentiment in the overall market, BTC found buyers at lower levels, highlighting the market’s desire to buy the dip. BlackRock Holds 3% Of All Bitcoin BlackRock’s foray into the Bitcoin market through its flagship iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) heralded a new era in institutional adoption and accumulation of Bitcoin. IBIT has registered exponential growth since its launch, with BlackRock accumulating over 662,500 BTC , 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply, giving it over $72 billion in Bitcoin exposure at current prices. BlackRock’s IBIT reached $70 billion in just 341 days, making it the fastest-growing ETF in history. The world’s largest asset manager’s Bitcoin holdings now eclipse many centralized exchanges and even major corporate holders like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Only Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1.1 million BTC outnumbers IBIT, but the gap is quickly narrowing. If inflows continue at the current pace, BlackRock’s IBIT will soon become the single-largest holder of Bitcoin. BlackRock views Bitcoin as a crucial component of long-term, diversified portfolios, embracing its volatility as a tradeoff for potential upside. BlackRock is betting that broader adoption of the asset will stabilize price volatility over time. Improve price discovery, increase liquidity, and narrow spreads. The asset manager’s adoption and decision to accumulate over 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply through IBIT is a turning point in Bitcoin’s perception and how it is traded and regulated. Anthony Pompliano To Launch Bitcoin-Buying Vehicle Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano is in talks to launch a new Bitcoin-buying vehicle that will raise $750 million to fund purchases. Pompliano is widely expected to become the CEO of ProCapBTC, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) that will merge with publicly traded black cheque vehicle Columbus Circle Capital 1. ProCapBTC will look to raise $500 million in equity and $250 million in convertible debt as part of its merger, backed by Cohen & Company Investment Bank. The deal could be announced as early as next week. However, the terms of the deal are yet to be finalized.

In May, the company raised $250 million through an initial public offering sponsored by Cohen & Company Capital Markets. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) lost momentum after it crossed $110,000 on Monday. Bearish sentiment had taken hold by Wednesday as the price slipped below $110,000, falling to $108,687. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday and Friday as Middle East tensions escalated after Israel launched missiles against Iran, targeting its military and nuclear installations. The price plunged to a low of $102,832 on Friday but recovered to reclaim $106,000 and settle at $106,100. As tensions surged, BTC dipped while oil prices rose by 5%, with historical data suggesting the dip could be a buying opportunity. BTC’s performance during geopolitical tensions offers a compelling investment case. André Dragosch, the head of research at Bitwise Europe, highlighted this potential in a post on X, highlighting data from geopolitical events since 2010. According to the data, BTC averaged a price increase of almost 65% within 50 days, with a median gain of 17.3%. Blockstream CEO Adam Back reinforced this view to counter gold advocate Peter Schiff’s skepticism. BTC plunged to a low of $103,768 on Monday (June 2) but rebounded to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,902. The price lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3%, dropping to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. The price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and settling at $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged over 4%, crossing the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,251. It lost momentum on Tuesday, dropping to a low of $108,335 before recovering to reclaim $110,000 and setting at $110,253. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as the price fell 1.42%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $108,687. BTC continued to decline on Thursday, falling nearly 3% to $105,828. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,832 on Friday. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $106,106.

Meanwhile, Circle’s USDC recently launched on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Both developments could provide a huge boost for the XRP price, given the altcoin’s role in the XRPL ecosystem. XRP Price Gets A Boost With Ripple CEO Garlinghouse’s Prediction At the XRPL Apex Conference, Brad Garlinghouse predicted that the XRP could capture 14% of the volume that SWIFT processes by 2030. He noted that SWIFT has two key components: messaging and liquidity. The Ripple CEO added that liquidity is where the power lies and that if XRP drives the liquidity layer, it would gain significantly. This could also spark a surge in the XRP price in the process. Related Reading: Ripple Issues Stern Warning To Investors As CEO Celebrates New XRP Milestone Ripple uses XRP for its payment services, which it runs on the XRPL. In this case, Ripple is betting on taking 14% of SWIFT’s trading volume because of how fast and easy it is to process these cross-border transactions using blockchain technology. This isn’t the case for SWIFT, as the platform focuses more on interbank messaging for these cross-border transfers. In a now-deleted X post, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton commented on this prediction and what it could mean for the XRP price. He stated that SWIFT processes approximately $5 trillion in transactions daily. This means that 14% of SWIFT’s daily market volume equates to $700 billion daily or approximately $175 trillion annually. Deaton failed to give a particular price prediction based on these numbers. However, Fruition, another XRP community member, provided a calculation that could put the XRP price in triple digits. In an X post, they noted that SWIFT moves 150 trillion per year and that 14% of that is 21 trillion. Fruition added that 21 trillion through the XRPL means 58 billion tokens, which equates to $357 for the XRP price. Circle’s USDC Launches On XRPL In an X post, Circle announced that its USDC stablecoin is now available on the XRP Ledger, another development that is bullish for the XRP price. The stablecoin firm noted that XRPL users will now be able to use USDC for DeFi liquidity provisioning, payments, and it could also serve as a settlement option for infrastructure apps. Related Reading: Daily Timeframe Says XRP Price Is On The Verge Of Breakout Crypto analyst Moon Lambo broke down why the USDC launch on XRPL is bullish for the XRP price. He stated that this development will substantially increase the total value locked on the network, which is a major predictor of whether the XRP price will appreciate. The crypto analyst added how this provides additional utility for XRP. He noted that the altcoin will be used to pay gas fees on every USDC transaction on the network. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.15, up almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The hires come as Congress weighs legislation to clarify digital asset regulation and as the regulator adjusts its stance on several previously proposed rules tied to crypto. In a notice issued on Friday, the SEC confirmed the appointment of Jamie Selway as director of trading and markets. Selway, a veteran of traditional finance, also served as global head of institutional markets at Blockchain.com from 2018 to 2019. His dual expertise in finance and crypto signals the agency’s growing recognition of digital asset markets. Joining him is Brian Daly, a former partner at law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, who will head the SEC’s investment management division. Daly has previously advised clients on digital asset compliance and contributed to public commentary during SEC rulemakings. “I’ve long respected and appreciated the SEC’s commitment to regulatory oversight,” Daly said in a statement. Congress Considers CLARITY Act The new appointments come as lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives prepare to vote on the CLARITY Act, a proposed bill aimed at defining the regulatory boundaries between the SEC and the CFTC regarding digital assets . The legislation could significantly shape the landscape for crypto oversight in the United States. On Thursday, the SEC also announced it would be withdrawing certain proposed rulemakings issued between March 2022 and November 2023. This includes rules that would have expanded the definition of “exchange” to cover decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. The proposed rules also included tighter regulations for crypto custody practices. Leadership Gaps Remain at SEC and CFTC This withdrawal marks a notable retreat from the SEC’s previously aggressive approach to regulating digital assets, though analysts say the agency’s future direction could still shift depending on new leadership and legislative outcomes. Despite the recent hires, the SEC continues to operate with one vacant commissioner seat, with no nomination yet from President Donald Trump. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, whose term ended in June 2024 , is expected to step down by 2026. Meanwhile, the CFTC faces an even deeper leadership gap, with three commissioner seats currently vacant. Former CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz has been nominated by Trump to serve as chair, though no additional nominations have been announced.

According to the bill, the state wants to prevent AI models created by firms like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic from contributing to disaster scenarios. According to the bill , these scenarios include the death or injury of more than 100 people or more than $1 billion in damages or losses. The bill, known as the RAISE Act, represents a win for movements pushing AI safety. The movements have lost steam in the last few years as Silicon Valley and the Trump administration have continued to prioritize speed and innovation. Advocates focused on safety, including Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton and AI research pioneer Yoshua Bengio are behind the RAISE Act. If it eventually gets signed into law, the bill would establish the first set of legally mandated transparency standards for leading artificial intelligence labs in the United States of America. New York considers RAISE Act to limit AI-fueled disasters The RAISE Act has some of the same provisions and goals as the controversial AI safety bill SB 1047 in California, which was eventually vetoed. However, a co-sponsor of the RAISE Act, New York State Senator Andrew Gounardes, mentioned in an interview that he designed the bill in a way that it doesn’t stifle innovation among startups or academic researchers, a common criticism the SB 1047 faced. “The window to put in place guardrails is rapidly shrinking given how fast this technology is evolving,” said Senator Gounardes. The senator also said that most of the people who are well-versed in the AI sector have also recognized these risks, a development he called “alarming.” Meanwhile, the RAISE Act is now on its way to the desk of New York Governor Kathy Hochul, where she could either sign it into law or send it back for amendment. Another option would be for her to veto the bill, which is likely. If it is eventually signed into law, the RAISE Act will require some of the biggest AI labs in the world to publish safety and security reports on their frontier AI models. The bill also mandates AI labs to report safety incidents concerning AI model behavior or bad actors stealing an AI model, if it happens. If tech companies fail to live up to these standards, the RAISE Act empowers New York’s attorney general to bring civil penalties of up to $30 million against them. RAISE Act seeks to regulate AI labs The RAISE Act was designed to regulate the largest AI firms globally, including those based in California like OpenAI and Google , and those based in China, like DeepSeek and Alibaba. The requirements of the bill include a mandatory clause that applies to companies that used more than $100 million in computing resources to train their AI models and are available to residents in New York. Although similar to SB 1047 in some ways, the RAISE Act addresses some of the previous AI safety bills. For example, no clause requires AI model developers to have a kill switch on their models nor does it hold companies that post-train their models accountable for critical harms. Nevertheless, there has been pushback on the New York bill, according to co-sponsor of the RAISE Act, New York State Assembly member Alex Bores. He called the resistance unsurprising but added that the RAISE Act will not limit the developmental prowess of tech companies in any way. “The NY RAISE Act is yet another stupid, stupid state-level AI bill that will only hurt the US at a time when our adversaries are racing ahead,” said Andreessen Horowitz general partner Anjney Midha in a Friday post on X. Andreessen Horowitz and startup incubator Y Combinator were in fierce opposition to SB 1047. In addition, Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark also shared his grievances over how broad the RAISE Act is, noting that it could present risks to smaller firms.

Key Takeaways: Seven Solana ETF filings hit the SEC, including new entries and amendments from major issuers. Analysts say staking language in the filings could complicate approval timelines. Market optimism remains high, with Bloomberg projecting a 90% chance of approval by 2025. Despite the flurry of filings, analysts warn that approval remains far from guaranteed. “I think there needs to be a back and forth with the SEC and issuers to iron out details, so I doubt it,” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said . Analyst Warns Solana ETF May Face Long Road Like Bitcoin ETFs Drawing parallels to the protracted approval process for Bitcoin ETFs, he noted, “If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were A LOT of filings over the preceding couple months before launch.” Among the June 13 filings was Fidelity’s first S-1 registration for its Solana ETF. 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Canary Capital also submitted amendments to existing applications, while VanEck — the first firm to file for a Solana ETF back in June — rounded out the list with an amended filing of its own. Seyffart emphasized a key complication: staking. “All of them include staking language, I believe,” he said, underscoring that staking provisions, unlike past Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, could trigger regulatory pushback. While Ether ETF issuers are also seeking permission to offer staking features, the SEC has yet to sign off. They haven't yet. But I would not be surprised if they were to eventually do that. But right now it doesn't seem like they will be in the first wave (whenever these launch) — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 13, 2025 Still, market sentiment appears to be shifting. Bloomberg Intelligence in April placed 90% odds on a Solana ETF approval by 2025. And Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas added fuel to speculation earlier this week, posting: “Get ready for a potential altcoin ETF summer with Solana likely leading the way.” Seyffart admitted the SEC could theoretically greenlight staking features for both Solana and Ether ETFs simultaneously, but added, “I have no insight into what will actually happen.” SEC Pushback on Staking ETFs Raises Doubts About Regulatory Direction Last week, the SEC raised new objections to ETF proposals from REX Financial and Osprey Funds that include staking mechanisms for Solana and Ether. The regulator argued these funds may not qualify as traditional ETFs under current rules, casting uncertainty over the future of staking-enabled investment products. Manthan Davé of Ripple-backed Palisade said the resistance shows the SEC struggling to reconcile existing frameworks with fast-evolving crypto technologies. Davé pointed out the contradiction in the SEC’s stance—acknowledging that staking may not be a securities activity, yet resisting products built around it. This inconsistency, he warned, risks stifling innovation and sending capital offshore. He called for clearer guidance and modernized classifications that account for how staking underpins blockchain security and value creation. Without it, the U.S. may continue to lose ground in the digital finance race.

The announcement, made by crypto analyst Xaif on X, revealed that the tokens were permanently removed from circulation, igniting a range of reactions from the XRP Army. While some users celebrated the move as a sign of ecosystem maturity, others were left confused about the purpose and mechanics behind stablecoin burns. RLUSD Burn Explained RLUSD is Ripple’s enterprise-grade stablecoin , launched in late 2024 to offer secure, on-chain liquidity tied 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. Like other fiat-backed stablecoins, RLUSD is minted when users deposit USD and burned when users redeem their tokens for fiat. This ensures the circulating supply always matches the funds held in reserve. The recent 20 million token burn suggests that large-scale redemptions occurred, prompting the removal of an equivalent amount of RLUSD from the market. Though Ripple has not issued an official statement, the burn appears to be part of regular supply adjustments aimed at maintaining the stablecoin’s peg and preventing oversupply. BREAKING 20 Million $RLUSD Burned! 20M RLUSD permanently removed from circulation. Ripple’s ecosystem just got tighter. #XRP #RLUSD #CryptoNews pic.twitter.com/0Rx9rqpT51 — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 13, 2025 This activity is typical in stablecoin ecosystems and shows that RLUSD is working as designed, enabling smooth entry and exit for users while maintaining full backing and transparency. Mixed Reactions From the XRP Community Despite the technical soundness of the burn, the move drew a flurry of responses from the XRP community, ranging from curiosity to criticism. In Xaif’s post, several users voiced confusion about the implications. Alpha Whisky asked, “Why would RLUSD burn? What’s going on?”—a question that captured the general sentiment among those unfamiliar with stablecoin operations. Crypto Enthusiast added, “Makes no difference with RLUSD—it can be minted right?” suggesting that the burn may have little long-term significance. Another user, michelle511, questioned whether burning was even possible for fiat-pegged tokens: “How can stablecoins get burned? They’re tied to the US$?” This reflects a widespread misconception. While RLUSD is tied to the dollar, it doesn’t mean the supply is fixed. Supply changes dynamically based on user deposits and redemptions. When users exchange RLUSD for cash, the returned tokens are destroyed to preserve the 1:1 ratio. XRP Supply Debate Rekindled The discussion quickly shifted toward XRP itself. Normandy King commented, “Wish they burn XRP, not RLUSD ,” echoing a common frustration among long-time XRP holders. Many in the community have long advocated for reducing XRP’s large circulating supply, especially given the ongoing monthly unlocks from Ripple’s escrow. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, RLUSD and XRP serve very different purposes. RLUSD is a stable means of exchange, ideal for enterprise settlements and DeFi transactions that require predictability. In contrast, XRP is utilized for providing on-chain liquidity and facilitating cross-border transactions by bridging fiat currencies . Burning RLUSD doesn’t directly impact XRP’s supply or price, but it signals that Ripple’s broader ecosystem is becoming more active and efficient. A Sign of a Healthy Ecosystem? The 20 million RLUSD token burn has sparked mixed reactions within the XRP community, but some see it as a positive development. It shows that the stablecoin is being used as intended, issued when needed, redeemed when not, and carefully adjusted to meet real demand. As RLUSD adoption grows, such burns will likely become more common. Rather than being a cause for concern, these events underscore Ripple’s commitment to transparency and sound monetary management within its ecosystem. In the absence of official commentary from Ripple, speculation is inevitable. But for those who understand stablecoin mechanics, the message is clear: RLUSD is alive, active, and functioning with the reliability it promised at launch. As Ripple continues expanding its financial infrastructure, both RLUSD and XRP will play complementary roles —one offering stability, the other liquidity. And while the debate continues, the XRP Army remains on high alert, watching every move Ripple makes. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Measuring the same distance from the cup’s upper side gives it a target of $0.090, a few points above the current level. LUNC price rises as burn rate jumps LUNC chart | Source: crypto.news Terra Luna Classic ( LUNC ) token rose by over 10% on Saturday. This jump happened after the LUNC token burn rose by over 234 million in the last seven days, bringing the cumulative burn to 410 billion. Technicals suggest that the LUNC price has more gains in the coming weeks. It has remained in a tight range and formed a double-bottom pattern with a neckline at $0.00007253. LUNC has also moved in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory, pointing to an eventual comeback. A move above the neckline at $0.00007253 will point to more gains to the 50% retracement level at $0.0001135. Meanwhile, Bitcoin rallied past $105,000 at last check on Saturday. See below.

BTC is now stabilizing around $104,957, down just 0.17% in the last 24 hours, as traders reassess their risk appetite. According to data from Coinglass, more than 247,000 traders were liquidated in a 24-hour window. The most notable wipeout was a $200 million BTC long on Binance the largest single liquidation event of the year. Most of the damage occurred on Binance and Bybit, which together accounted for $834 million in liquidated positions. UPDATE: Over $1 billion were liquidated in the last 24 hours, with $943.31M from long positions. pic.twitter.com/VllxE4f3KM — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) June 13, 2025 The overwhelming majority were longs, as traders overleveraged on bullish momentum fueled by Circle’s IPO momentum and renewed interest in U.S.-based DeFi protocols. These forced liquidations act as automatic margin calls. When traders fail to meet required collateral thresholds, exchanges close positions to protect the broader system. But in times of sharp volatility, these measures often snowball, leading to rapid price declines and widespread market capitulation. Bitcoin Dominance Climbs as Altcoins Falter While altcoins suffered steep losses, Bitcoin price predction is is support above $104,000. The selloff appears to have driven investors back into BTC as a relative safe haven. Bitcoin dominance a metric measuring BTC’s share of total crypto market cap has risen sharply, suggesting that traders are fleeing riskier assets in favor of the original cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Technically, BTC is hovering just above the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $104,872 and sits on an ascending trendline that has supported price action since early June. The MACD histogram is flattening, showing early signs of bearish momentum waning. If bulls can reclaim the 50-period EMA near $106,351 and surpass the 0.5 Fib level at $106,788, a move toward $108,864 remains in play. This pattern suggests a possible higher low in the making, especially if the current consolidation zone holds. Small-bodied candles point to indecision and accumulation—typical behavior near the bottom of correction cycles. Short-Term Outlook: Bitcoin Eyes $108K if Momentum Builds Despite market turbulence, Bitcoin’s chart structure remains technically constructive. A move over the $106,350 level would indicate a short-term breakout, validating a reversal pattern and that could propel BTC toward $107,640 and $108,864. Trade Idea Recap: Entry: Above $106,350 with volume Stop: Below $104,000 Targets: $107,640 (initial), $108,864 (extended) With major altcoins bleeding and risk sentiment fragile, Bitcoin’s resilience could attract sidelined capital. Unless BTC breaks below $103,169, the broader uptrend remains intact. In the current environment, Bitcoin isn’t just a crypto—it’s the crypto safe haven. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,141,005.09 out of its $8,216,177 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand.

The decision was made earlier this month, and the review now underway could allow the administration to cut off Elon’s companies from billions in government deals if Trump decides to retaliate. The ongoing review involves at least $22 billion in government funding tied to Elon’s space company. One of the contracts under review is a $5 billion NASA deal involving the Dragon spacecraft , the only American system currently flying astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Trump mentioned the possibility of action during a press briefing on June 6 aboard Air Force One, saying, “We’ll take a look at everything.” Pentagon considers limiting SpaceX’s role in missile defense Officials at the Pentagon are now discussing whether Elon’s firm should continue playing a major part in Trump’s new missile defense system, nicknamed the Golden Dome. The system is part of a broader defense upgrade backed by the current administration. The Pentagon’s review of SpaceX’s participation runs in parallel with the White House contract review and could lead to reduced involvement in future projects. The White House did not respond to questions about Elon’s businesses but issued a short statement saying the Trump administration was “committed to a rigorous review process for all bids and contracts.” NASA said it would keep working with its industry partners to meet “the president’s objectives in space.” Elon, who Trump called his best friend and ‘First Buddy’ on more than one occasion, held a key role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cut spending and audit waste across the government, and now, that same process is being directed at Elon himself. A person involved in the review called it “political ammunition” to prepare if Trump chooses to cancel deals or subsidies. Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, said Elon may now face the same type of targeted scrutiny he once applied to others. “There’s an irony here that Elon’s contracts could be under the same type of subjective political scrutiny that he and his DOGE team have put on thousands of other contracts,” Amey said. “Any decision shouldn’t be based on the egos of two men but on the best interests of the public and national security.” NASA, intelligence contracts also at risk in political clash SpaceX isn’t just involved in launching rockets. It has a secretive deal with the National Reconnaissance Office, a top US intelligence agency, to build hundreds of surveillance satellites. That classified project expanded Elon’s reach into the defense sector and gave SpaceX a stronger role in national security. That contract, which remains active, is also being included in the federal review. Trump’s decision to escalate the fight came after Elon posted several now-deleted comments about the president. Elon had called for Trump’s impeachment and connected him to a convicted sex offender. He later tried to reverse course and walk back the attacks, but the government’s review had already been triggered. Before backing down, Elon threatened to shut down the Dragon spacecraft operation. That warning carried weight because no other US-owned vehicle is capable of transporting astronauts. Losing that system would disrupt both current and future NASA missions. The $5 billion Dragon contract is a cornerstone of US space activity, and tampering with it would have serious consequences. Whether Trump can legally cancel existing deals remains unclear, but federal lawyers are reportedly looking into it. What’s clear is that the administration wants to be ready. And perhaps just a tiny bit petty.

In a new report, the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky says 2025 kicked off with an alarming number of smartphone attacks. “Attacks on Android devices involving malware, adware or potentially unwanted apps in the first quarter of 2025 increased to 12,184,351.” That’s up from 8,780,221 attacks in the last three months of 2024. Trojans, a type of malware that appears harmless but secretly performs malicious actions like stealing data or enabling unauthorized access, were the most common mobile threat, accounting for 39.56% of total detected threats. The sudden increase in attacks is largely attributable to the banking trojan known as Mamont, as well as scam apps. Other reasons for the attack surge include counterfeit versions of popular smartphones that come preloaded with an Android malware called Triada. “This growth was largely due to the activity of Mamont banking trojans and fake money scam apps, along with the discovery of fake popular brand smartphones that came preloaded with the Triada backdoor, capable of dynamically downloading any modules from a server.” Kaspersky also says there were 180,405 malicious and potentially unwanted Android app installation packages detected in the first quarter of 2025, up from 141,779 in the last quarter of 2024.

After the court rejected its first proposal, WazirX has submitted a new plan to return a partial portion of the lost money. The final decision is expected by June 20. So, what’s going on, and why won’t users get back everything they lost? New Deadline: June 20 WazirX had earlier submitted a restructuring plan to the Singapore High Court, offering to return user funds after the massive hack in July 2023. But the court rejected that plan on June 4. In response, WazirX filed a formal request again on June 6, asking for reconsideration. Now, the Singapore judge has allowed the exchange time until June 20 to present a revised plan. On that day, the court will decide whether WazirX’s proposal is acceptable or not. Why Users Won’t Get Full Funds? According to a recent announcement from WazirX , it is planning to restart its business under a new structure. The WazirX is even planning to move its base from Singapore to Panama and rebrand its company name to Zensui. Meanwhile, the company claims it will return a percentage of the users’ funds, not the full amount. This means users might get back only a part of their money. Yes! If the plan is approved, WazirX will say its company is bankrupt and needs to start over. But here’s the catch—users who accept this payout might lose the right to file legal complaints in the future. Past Lies and Fresh Promises There have been many doubts about WazirX’s transparency. Earlier, they failed to get a license in Singapore and later shifted operations to Panama under a new name. Many believe the new restructuring plan is just another way to avoid accountability. Right now, over 4.4 million users are still waiting for clarity. If the new plan is accepted on June 20, users may finally receive some portion of their stuck funds. But the exact amount, method, and timeline for refunds remain uncertain. Until then, users can only wait and hope that this time, WazirX actually delivers.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-14 13:31:15

The altcoin, currently trading around $160 after a dip to $141, displays a bull flag pattern, hinting at a breakout past $300. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s strength above $108,000 fuels the crypto market’s optimism. Yet, a lesser-known token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is stealing attention. Priced at $0.03 in its presale, this new cryptocurrency has raised $10,600,000, sold over 550 million tokens, and attracted 12,000 holders. Investors are eyeing MUTM’s low entry point and high-yield potential, making it a standout in today’s crypto investment scene. Solana’s bullish breakout potential Solana’s crypto charts are flashing bullish signals, capturing traders’ focus. The bull flag pattern, formed after a climb from $95 to $184, suggests a breakout could push SOL past $200. A confirmed move might target $275 or even $300, a new peak. The MACD indicator supports this, showing a buy signal on the daily chart. However, the RSI at 48 remains neutral, indicating bulls need more control. Positive funding rates on exchanges like Binance reflect strong market optimism. If Solana clears $200 with high volume, crypto predictions point to rapid gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale ignites interest Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in its fifth presale phase, priced at $0.03. The project has raised $10,600,000, with over 550 million tokens sold and 12,000 holders joining since the presale began. Phase 5 is currently underway, but phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. At launch, MUTM will list at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% return for current buyers. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $2.50, offering an 8,233% gain from today’s price. The team recently completed a Certik audit, scoring 80.00 for security with no vulnerabilities found. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers unique utilities that set it apart. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) redefines DeFi lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in crypto investing with its dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract system lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools, earning passive income with dynamic interest rates. The Peer-to-Peer model fosters direct lending, promoting transparency and user-driven agreements. Built on Ethereum, MUTM’s stablecoin ensures secure, USD-pegged transactions. Layer-2 integration promises faster, cheaper transactions, enhancing user experience. The team’s beta platform will launch alongside the token, enabling immediate access to lending features. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also rewards top 50 holders with bonus tokens via a new leaderboard dashboard, boosting engagement. Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway splits $10,000 among 10 winners, requiring a $50 presale investment to enter. Simply submit a wallet address and complete all quest steps to participate. This innovative approach positions MUTM as a leader in DeFi. Why Investors are choosing MUTM Crypto prices today highlight Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a low-cost entry with high potential. At $0.03, it’s accessible, yet its $0.06 launch price ensures a 2x return. The predicted $2.50 post-launch value underscores its appeal as a top crypto to buy.

As whispers turn into filings and filings shift toward approvals, investor attention has surged toward Solana-based meme coins , long seen as speculative but increasingly recognized for their viral community dynamics and scalability potential. Solana’s high throughput and low fees have already made it the perfect breeding ground for meme coin culture. Now, with institutional access on the table, analysts are spotlighting nine standout tokens primed to benefit from ETF tailwinds. These tokens—led by OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) and SPX6900 (SPX)—are capturing unprecedented volume and social engagement. At the same time, two early access crypto presales have caught the eye of seasoned investors hunting for next-cycle outperformers. One of them, Neo Pepe ($NEOP), isn't built on Solana—but its mission and mechanism stand in stark ideological contrast to the hype-based models driving much of the Solana meme scene. Here’s what’s trending. These 9 Solana Meme Coins Could Be Crypto’s Biggest Winners if ETF Approval Lands Analysts at multiple trading desks, including sources from Delphi Digital and Messari, are tracking explosive community growth and liquidity rotations across these top meme coins on Solana: OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP)Riding both political momentum and memetic energy, TRUMP has surged on news of ETF filings. It’s become a speculative stand-in for election-cycle risk, and on Solana’s rails, it’s fast and cheap to trade. SPX6900 (SPX)A meme derivative of stock market culture, SPX has built its niche as the ironic answer to traditional finance. ETF buzz has brought new eyes to the project. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN)Unapologetically absurd, this token has grown thanks to its crude humor and TikTok virality. Despite its unserious tone, its volume is very real. dogwifhat (WIF)A long-standing favorite in the Solana meme community, WIF continues to grow, benefitting from ETF-driven network activity. Bonk (BONK)The original Solana memecoin, Bonk’s legacy gives it a liquidity moat that few can challenge. Still a go-to for many NFT community crossovers. Mog Coin (MOG)MOG’s lore-heavy ecosystem continues to gain traction with each Solana push. Its team remains deeply engaged with meme culture. Dog (Bitcoin) (DOG)The name might be confusing, but DOG has carved a clear identity on Solana. It’s riding the ETF hype to expand across non-crypto communities. Popcat (SOL) (POPCAT)Born from viral video content, POPCAT has built bridges to normie audiences and continues to attract Gen Z buyers. Turbo (TURBO)Self-referential, fast-moving, and marketed like a dopamine hit, TURBO represents the new generation of Solana memecoins thriving on high frequency and high humor. Each of these tokens offers a slightly different narrative hook, but what unites them is rapid community formation, Solana-native development, and ETF-fueled exposure. Two Underground Presales That Could Outrun the Rest While Solana-based tokens are stealing headlines, seasoned investors are also positioning ahead of the curve by identifying high-conviction presales that might ride the next cycle wave. These two crypto presale gems are particularly notable: 1. Solaxy (SOLX) A Solana-native presale with ambitions to gamify carbon offsetting and DeFi yields. Solaxy merges ESG themes with crypto-native tools—creating a green narrative investors increasingly find attractive. Still in early stages, its price point remains appealing for those with long-term conviction. 2. Neo Pepe Protocol ($NEOP) Not based on Solana, yet rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about Fast Growing Memecoins across Ethereum and Base. Unlike the hype-first Solana meme tokens, Neo Pepe Coin is positioned as a symbolic protest against centralized power, built around a serious memetic framework dubbed the Memetrix. Neo Pepe’s presale structure is what’s turning heads. It’s broken into 16 escalating stages, each with a higher price, fostering urgency and rewarding early action. But Neo Pepe is more than tokenomics. It introduces a DAO-powered Governance Model where decisions are made entirely by holders—ranging from exchange listings to treasury allocation. Its Auto-Liquidity Mechanism, which burns LP tokens on every transaction, is engineered to stabilize pricing and prevent post-launch crashes. The architecture is immutable, non-upgradable, and trustless—positioning the project as a rare breed: a Decentralized Power movement disguised as a meme coin. According to Neo Pepe’s Roadmap, the team has completed smart contract audits, initiated global marketing, and is preparing for its first decentralized exchange listings by Q3. Governance participation is already live via smart contract delegation, and early community members are actively shaping the token’s future trajectory. What Makes Neo Pepe One of Crypto’s Most Dangerous Meme Coins in Defi Game Here are the standout highlights that separate Neo Pepe Coin from the meme pack: Decentralized PowerFrom day one, Neo Pepe’s founders relinquished control. Proposals, treasury movements, and protocol upgrades are managed via DAO. No centralized decision-making. No backdoors. Auto-Liquidity MechanismEach transaction incurs a 2.5% fee. This is automatically split into ETH and $NEOP, added to Uniswap, and the LP tokens are burned permanently—ensuring liquidity depth and price floor resilience. Symbolic MessagingBuilt around the idea of escaping centralized financial control, Neo Pepe isn’t satire—it’s a cultural symbol. The protocol leans into serious decentralization ideology, attracting a different kind of holder. Top Crypto Presale MomentumNeo Pepe is attracting whales and grassroots investors alike. The hype has placed it among the best presales on platforms tracking early-stage crypto launches. Cross-Chain SupportInvestors can participate using ETH, USDT, USDC, or BNB on Ethereum, Base, and Binance Smart Chain—lowering friction for entry and maximizing inclusivity. For those fatigued by fleeting meme cycles and short-lived pump-and-dumps, Neo Pepe presents a long-game thesis that uses meme culture to deliver governance, transparency, and financial engineering at scale. Solana ETF Watchers Shouldn’t Sleep on Neo Pepe Solana’s ETF trajectory is lighting a fire under its memecoin ecosystem, giving rise to nine powerful contenders with massive upside and even bigger social reach. As institutional interest grows, these tokens may see continued speculative flow—especially as infrastructure like Solana-based spot ETFs gains regulatory clarity. Yet beyond the fast-and-funny tokens of Solana lies a quieter insurgency—Neo Pepe ($NEOP). A non-Solana memecoin that leverages a serious governance structure, immutable smart contracts, and symbolic meaning, Neo Pepe is delivering Crypto Investment Opportunity not just on paper, but through mechanism, participation, and community ideology.

46004280,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746730,1749908707,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46004280.jpeg,UK minister warns that AI skills gap threaten workers' jobs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uk-minister-warns-against-ai-skills-gap/,"A UK minister has issued a stern warning to workers in the country to adapt to the fast-growing AI technology or risk being left behind in the evolving job market. The warnings come amid the government’s push to make the UK a global leader in AI tech and innovation. At the same time, AI technology, despite its transformative abilities, is also seen as a threat to workers due to forecasts of job losses as businesses automate operations, leaving millions out of employment. UK to train 7.5 million workers in AI by 2030 According to The Guardian , technology secretary Peter Kyle called on workers and businesses to embrace AI technology, stressing the urgent need to “act now” to stay relevant in the market. Kyle, this week, met with tech industry bosses to deliberate on an initiative to train 7.5 million workers by 2030. The figure represents a fifth of the overall workforce in the UK. The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 to immediate success sparked vast investments into the AI sector, which also resulted in forecasts of massive job losses, especially in the financial services sector and law. “I think most people are approaching this with trepidation,” said Kyle. “Once they start [using AI], it turns to exhilaration, because it is a lot more straightforward than people realise, and it is far more rewarding than people expect.” Kyle. Kyle emphasized that the integration of AI technology in the economy is inevitable, warning that workers who fail to quickly develop new skills will face challenges. “There’s no one in employment at the moment that is incapable of gaining the skills that will be needed in the economy in the next five years,” said Kyle. “That is the optimistic way of saying, act now, and you will thrive into the future. Don’t, and I think that some people will be left behind. And that’s what worries me the most,” he added. UK government wants to close the skills gap According to Kyle, there seems to be a generational gap in AI, where individuals above 55 years of age utilize AI half as much as the over-35 demographic. Given this scenario, Kyle indicated the need to close the gap. He suggested simple training on basic AI, which should take just two and a half hours of training only. “People don’t need to get trained in quantum physics,” said Kyle. “They need to get trained in the basics of how AI works, how to interact with it, and to explore all of the potential it has for you as an individual in the workplace.” Kyle. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has admitted that there were still people “skeptical” about AI, who worry about the technology taking their jobs. He was speaking at the London Tech Week where he indicated that the government would attempt to prove that technology can “create wealth in your community…. create good job and vastly improve our public sector.” According to the Guardian, people in English speaking countries like the UK, US, Australia and Canada are more concerned about the prevalence of AI as compared to those in the largest EU economies, according to polling data shared with The Guardian. This comes as various projections on the impact of AI on jobs have been rendered. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned that AI tech could cause massive job losses in skilled professions like medicine, law, and finance. On the other hand, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has calculated 60% of jobs in advanced economies like the US and UK are exposed to AI, and half of these jobs may be negatively affected. Investment bank Goldman Sachs previously predicted that as many as 300 million jobs would be lost or diminished by the technology. However, in the UK, the Tony Blair Institute, which has called for AI adoption both in private and public sectors, has indicated the technology’s potential to mitigate job losses as it creates new roles.

In just 14 consecutive sessions, spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. have seen over $812 million in inflows, more than double Bitcoin’s total over the same period. According to Bloomberg , nine Ethereum ETFs are leading the charge, with funds like BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH capturing a large slice of daily volumes. This sudden influx of TradFi capital, which included a $240 million spike on June 11 alone, indicates that hedge funds, RIAs, and asset managers are increasingly turning to Ethereum as their entry point into the crypto market. CoinShares notes that ETH-based investment products generated $296 million in the past week alone, marking its highest total since the 2024 U.S. election. As regulatory clarity improves and ETF accessibility widens, Ethereum appears poised to benefit from deepening institutional confidence. But so far, price hasn’t quite caught up. Ethereum Faces Technical Roadblocks Despite bullish sentiment, Ethereum price prediction remains stuck under key resistance zones. After bouncing from a low of $2,439, ETH has been unable to break above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement ($2,518) and the 50-day EMA around $2,614. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview MACD momentum is recovering slightly, but the signal line still points to caution. Meanwhile, the downtrend line from early June continues to cap upside movement. Key levels to monitor: Bullish breakout: Close above $2,567 with strong volume could open the door to $2,614 and $2,647 Downside risk: A decline below $2,480 might uncover ETH to a retest of $2,439 or lower MACD confirmation: Needed to validate any breakout attempt Traders are watching these levels closely, as momentum builds around a potential move. Can Inflows Power a Breakout for Ethereum? While the price remains range-bound, the growing ETF inflow narrative may soon put pressure on the charts. Since June began, total inflows into Ethereum ETFs have climbed past $1.37 billion. That’s not a fluke; it’s a strong sign that Wall Street is gradually leaning into ETH exposure. But inflows alone won’t push ETH higher without technical confirmation. A breakout above the $2,567 mark, backed by volume and MACD crossover, would likely ignite bullish sentiment and accelerate retail follow-through. Bottom line: Ethereum is at a tipping point. TradFi inflows are bullish, but until ETH clears resistance, price remains locked in consolidation. Traders should track ETF volume trends and technical thresholds to stay ahead of potential breakouts or breakdowns. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,141,005.09 out of its $8,216,177 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority.

Bitcoin, fresh from a climb to $110k, sank to almost $102k when reports of Israeli action inside Iran reached desks, and talk of deeper United States involvement amplified the slide. The drop has rekindled an old argument: can this code based asset eventually share the pedestal with bullion or blue chip assets? A growing group of strategists says yes. They view the setback as the latest echo of earlier shocks that cleared the runway for larger climbs. Each flare-up in the past left Bitcoin stronger than traditional shelters, and many expect a familiar script to unfold again. Metals Rise First Yet Bitcoin Finishes Ahead Market history shows a reflex that rarely changes. Headlines of conflict push capital into metal vaults, where spot gold often pops, silver steadies, and Bitcoin stumbles. Early this week gold prices spiked past $3400 while Bitcoin slid under $103k. Traders who watch these rotations recall that the opening move seldom crowns the long term winner. ⚠️New War Escalation: What does this mean for #Bitcoin ?👇Markets are rattled:💥 $1.15B in crypto liquidations🛢 Oil up 13% on the news📉 Initial fear reaction in $BTC But here’s what happened last time tensions flared:Oil & Gold spiked short-termBitcoin dipped first...… pic.twitter.com/iup2osrHKy — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) June 13, 2025 February 2022 offers a clear template. As Russian troops crossed into Ukraine, gold broke above $1900 and Bitcoin slipped below $41,000. By early April, gold had lost that shine while Bitcoin hovered in the upper $46,000 zone, delivering the larger percentage gain and reclaiming the narrative. Analysts reading today’s tape note familiar clues. Exchange balances are shrinking, suggesting holders are moving coins to cold storage rather than capitulating. At midday Friday bids were already carrying the price back toward $105k, hinting that the rubber band has started its rebound. While there are definitely critics like Peter Schiff and many others who seem to disagree with Bitcoin being in the same league as metals like gold and silver, the sentiment seems to have been slowly shifting among major institutions already. [CNBC] Michael Saylor dismisses claims that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, comparing it to Manhattan real estate. He argues that just as developers issue debt to build more as property values rise, issuing debt or equity to buy Bitcoin is part of a functioning economy $MSTR pic.twitter.com/lEeIIJ8Ggj — BecauseBitcoin.com (@BecauseBitcoin) December 17, 2024 Michael Saylor sees the same setup through a real estate lens. Questioned live on CNBC about issuing fresh debt to accumulate Bitcoin even near record levels, the MicroStrategy chair pointed to developers in Manhattan who borrow relentlessly to put new towers on land that is already expensive. That cycle, he said, is simply how productive economies grow. His company now holds a profit of over 80% on its Bitcoin treasury, evidence that the approach is more disciplined than reckless. If geopolitical tension eventually nudges governments toward neutral digital rails for settlement, Bitcoin could gain extra utility and value. Such a move has historically ignited follow-on rallies in altcoins, turning drawdowns like the current one into rare openings rather than red flags. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Stock Up On Potential Top Gainers Snorter Snorter is being built as a Telegram native sniper bot designed to execute token buys the instant liquidity is added. The project, launched a few weeks ago, aims to offer one of the fastest and most precise trading tools for Solana. It strips away every unnecessary step. There is no dashboard, no browser extension, just clean Telegram commands and the quickest execution possible through direct blockchain interaction. The upcoming features marketed by developers include a copy trading engine where users can automatically mirror the moves of high-performing wallets. The bot is also being prepared for multi-chain compatibility, starting with Solana and expanding into other ecosystems shortly after launch. It is being developed with a fee structure that aims to be lower than most competing bots, giving it a cost advantage alongside its technical speed. Snorter has not launched yet, but its presale traction suggests that interest is building fast. It is already gaining attention in trading groups and among Solana native communities that follow new tool drops closely. YouTuber Claybro called it a 100x potential crypto, adding to its existing virality across various social media platforms. When the bot does go live, it is likely to draw early users who thrive on volatility and who want to be first in line when new tokens deploy. For those who treat speed as strategy, Snorter may become an essential tool. The fact that it is still in presale means the timing is early and quite possibly right where the real upside begins. Solaxy Solaxy is approaching its final presale phase and there is only a short window left before the platform goes live. Having raised over $48 million, it has become one of the most successful meme-aligned crypto offerings in recent months. But Solaxy is more than just another successful memecoin presale. It comes with utility as a Layer Two network engineered to facilitate fast and secure transactions between Solana and Ethereum. It bypasses traditional bridges by building its own rails, giving users smoother interoperability with less risk. Its staking model is layered with flexible options. Short-term pools offer conservative yields, while longer lockups deliver sharply increased APY that rewards those willing to commit. Solaxy’s fee rebate model ensures that staking rewards are returned in SOLX itself, consolidating value instead of diluting it across multiple assets. The geopolitical volatility that dragged Bitcoin down has led many investors to reevaluate where real utility may emerge next. With Solaxy so close to launch, attention is already turning toward protocols that can immediately deliver on their use cases. In a post correction bounce, speed and infrastructure tend to lead the charge. Both are areas where Solaxy seems prepared. SUBBD SUBBD does not just give creators a platform, but also gives their fans a revenue stream. The project tokenizes the future income of influencers, musicians, and video creators, allowing users to buy fractional stakes in their ongoing success. When revenue is generated, it flows into a smart contract vault that automatically splits payouts between the creator and their early backers. This structure removes the gatekeeping often found in traditional media and turns fans into financial participants. It also includes a discovery engine that highlights up-and-coming talent using engagement trends, giving early supporters a head start on limited allocation offerings. The tokenomics reward long-term holders by distributing protocol fees back to stakers, along with exclusive access to new creator drops. Despite wider market pullbacks, the creator economy is proving to be unusually resilient. In times when trust in institutions wanes, especially during global crises, individual creators often gain influence. SUBBD’s system allows that influence to be monetized fairly and transparently. With Bitcoin already showing signs of recovery, capital could soon pivot back toward utility-first platforms, making SUBBD a strong candidate for renewed attention. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper , as the name suggests, boasts a Bitcoin-themed concept and design style. But while it looks like another meme coin, it exists to do something else entirely. The project attempts to move value quickly, affordably, and without layers of complexity getting in the way. The protocol is lean and designed for direct usage, handling transactions that confirm almost instantly without bloating fees or requiring external dependencies. This makes it especially suitable for small or frequent transfers, whether between individuals or applications. The architecture has been built around a clear loop of movement and reward. Every completed transaction sends a portion of its fee back into staking pools and liquidity buffers. This creates a self-feeding structure that strengthens as more people use it. There are no side tokens, no secondary chains, and no unfinished utilities. What exists is already functional and being refined through iterative community feedback. As markets enter phases of hesitation, utility often becomes the metric that matters most. Traders stop chasing hype and start looking at whether a token actually does what it claims. Bitcoin Hyper directly relies on movement to justify its value. Its velocity-focused structure rewards real participation, not just passive holding. When geopolitical pressure destabilizes traditional financial rails, options that offer fast direct settlement begin to matter. Bitcoin Hyper may not dominate headlines, but its infrastructure is capable of handling practical demand. If confidence shifts back toward utility-driven tokens, this one is already in position to absorb it. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token is woven directly into a system that many users already rely on. The wallet itself supports over sixty chains, with full access to asset swaps, portfolio tracking, staking, and presale aggregation. It is already live, active, and adopted by a broad user base. The wallet’s recent feature in the New York Post did not trigger its rise, but it has helped fuel a more noticeable uptick in both usage and user interest, especially from those outside the immediate crypto circle. The token acts as an access layer rather than a marketing prop. Holding it gives users lower swap fees inside the app, higher yields on certain staking pools, and first entry positions into presales curated through the aggregator. Rather than trying to gamify rewards, Best Wallet keeps things practical. Staking the token simply boosts what the user can already do inside the wallet. The platform’s presale aggregator has drawn particular attention in recent months as users search for early stage tokens before major listings. In a space where speed often determines entry, this has become one of the more practical tools to have. As centralized exchanges face more scrutiny and markets react to global tension by pulling funds off platforms, wallets like this become the default solution. Best Wallet Token ties directly into that behavioral shift. With confidence returning slowly to crypto, systems that offer genuine control, transparency, and deep chain support could be the ones that benefit first. This token is already embedded at the center of that movement. Conclusion While Bitcoin’s recent dip has reignited comparisons with metals and real estate, the broader takeaway is that innovation-driven crypto projects often recover stronger and faster. From fast settlement protocols to creator-powered economies and high utility infrastructure, the space is already pivoting toward tokens that do more than sit idle. Each of the projects discussed above reflects that shift in its own way, offering distinct value beyond short-term speculation. As Bitcoin stabilizes and capital begins to move again, these are the types of ideas that tend to benefit first and sometimes most.

According to the Financial Times, this investment was made to support the company's Bitcoin move, which has exceeded $2 billion. The investment is notable because it comes just nine weeks after the SEC investigation into Wilson’s crypto company Cumberland concluded, after the SEC dropped a lawsuit against Cumberland in March that included allegations of being an “unregistered crypto broker.” Chicago-based DRW bought about 4 million shares of TMTG last month, according to investor records, marking one of the largest investments ever made by TMTG, which is also behind the Truth Social app. The company’s largest investor in the funding round for Bitcoin was reportedly Jane Street, with a stake of about $375 million. Related News: SEC Now Making Its Intentions Clear: High-Level Appointments Related to Cryptocurrencies DRW stated that they evaluated the investment decision based on “the benefits of holding Bitcoin in company balance sheets.” The statement said, “We have been strategically involved in the crypto asset ecosystem for decades. This transaction was evaluated entirely from this perspective.” Don Wilson has advocated for a restructuring of U.S. securities regulators, proposing the creation of “an entirely new regulatory agency” to replace the SEC and CFTC. “Wilson has long called for a clear regulatory framework,” a DRW spokesperson said. Wilson’s interest in crypto is not new. In 2015, he auctioned off 70,000 Bitcoins that the U.S. government had seized from the Silk Road. The assets are worth about $7.7 billion today. DRW also has a number of funds tied to digital assets, including transactions related to MicroStrategy’s rebranded Bitcoin-focused entity “Strategy.” *This is not investment advice.

Seasonality is favorable for HIVE in June and July, and revenue/earnings estimates have improved significantly since January. HIVE's mining capacity and efficiency are set to surge, with major growth expected in both Bitcoin mining and HPC/AI segments. Valuation is extremely attractive on both price-to-sales and tangible book value, supporting my reiterated strong buy rating. Back in January, I covered small-cap Bitcoin miner HIVE Digital ( HIVE ) , calling it a strong buy at the time. I had my reasons, including firm price support at $2.80. That didn’t work out, however, as the massive slide in equities globally into the April low saw HIVE blow right through $2.80 on the way to $1.26. Events like that are why we use stops, and why we don’t become bag holders. At any rate, this stock is well-off from where I called it a strong buy; has my view changed? Not really, and below I’ll detail why the value proposition is even better today than it was five months ago. An Extremely Bullish Setup I recognize my last call was wrong, and that’s fine; it happens. I noted the line in the sand was $2.80, and if you sold at that point, your losses were minimized. Today, my line in the sand is the rising 50-day SMA, which we can see below in blue. StockCharts That level is currently $1.77, which is 12 cents below where the stock closed on Friday. It’s also rising, so it will gradually drift higher as the days go on. I would not hold HIVE under that line. Now, why do I say this is extremely bullish? We have a series of higher lows, two rising moving averages, and the 20-day EMA ahead of the 50-day SMA. So long as the 50-day SMA holds on any pullbacks, this is a textbook uptrend setup. The momentum indicators are mixed. The PPO is bullish, the RSI is neutral, and the Chaikin Money Flow index is bearish. With that in mind, I’d become more bullish if we had a sustained move in the RSI ahead of 60, and a reading above zero on the CMF. But for now, the price chart itself is enough for me, and I really like this chart. Bullish Seasonality And A Stock That’s Just Too Cheap Before we look at the fundamentals, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention seasonality. HIVE has only been public for a few years, but have a look at June and July. Seeking Alpha Returns are hugely positive for this time of year, lending credence to the idea that if you’re going to own HIVE, you really couldn’t select a better time. The opposite is true of August and September, so that’s something to watch for, but the chart and seasonality are lining up nicely. Let’s kick things off with a look at where estimates stand. Seeking Alpha The last three revisions have been down, which is obviously not something we want. I will say, however, that when I covered HIVE in January, estimates for 2027 were for just 27 cents in earnings; that’s gone all the way to 41 cents today. Similarly, estimates for 2025 have risen from a loss of 24 cents to a loss of 16 cents. Revenue estimates have exploded higher as well, with 2026 sales rising from $221M to $360M today. In other words, unless these estimates are just nowhere close to reality, HIVE has gotten enormously cheaper in the last five months. HIVE has now also passed 10EH/s in peak hashrate. The company expects 11.5EH/s by the end of this month, on its way to 25EH/s by the end of its Q4. In addition to ramping to 25EH/s, efficiency is set to rise pretty significantly as well. Investor presentation Today’s efficiency is something like 18 J/TH, but it should improve to 16.5 later this year. That helps reduce mining costs, which boosts mining margins. Investor presentation This table is illustrative of what HIVE’s mining operations could look like once it’s fully built out at 25EH/s. At the current Bitcoin price, HIVE expects mining margin of about $330M annually. At $150K per Bitcoin, it’s more like $575M. HIVE’s margins are enormously dependent upon the price of Bitcoin, as is any company that mines anything (gold, silver, copper, etc.). If you’re bullish on HIVE, you are bullish on Bitcoin. As we’re looking at those mining margin numbers, let’s remind ourselves that HIVE’s market cap is $300M as of Friday’s close. We can see below that relative to other miners, HIVE is tiny today. That’s set to change as we reach the end of September, assuming HIVE’s 25EH/s capacity comes online as expected. Investor presentation Other miners are growing as well, but HIVE has the most relative growth coming based upon current info. Mining is a relative game, so HIVE is going to be much more competitive in a few months than it is today. The other piece of the equation here is that the company’s HPC and AI growth is set to be outstanding in the coming months. Investor presentation Annual recurring revenue in Q1 was $15M, but is set to be $100M by the end of this fiscal year. If HIVE gets anywhere near that, again, that’s a great growth lever for a stock with a $300M market cap. Is It Really That Cheap? HIVE’s valuation, as I mentioned above, has gotten much better. That’s true if you’re using 2027 EPS estimates, or if you’re looking at price-to-sales and tangible book value. Let’s start with P/S. TIKR Today, shares are at 1.16X forward sales. Its three-year average has been 2.56X, which is obviously a 120% premium to today’s price. I don’t see how there is any conclusion I can draw from this chart other than the stock is cheap. In addition, we can use tangible book value, and it’s unbelievably cheap there as well. TIKR The most recent TBV reported was $3.10 against a share price of $1.89. As we can see below, shares at 0.61X TBV is well below the 1.51X average. TIKR In conclusion, HIVE is absolutely very cheap. If growth plans in both Bitcoin mining and HPC come to fruition, HIVE should be even cheaper in the coming months. With a bullish setup in the chart, and what I view as a favorable fundamental backdrop aligned with a cheap valuation, I’m reiterating my strong buy rating on HIVE.",HIVE|HIVE:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-14 14:00:00

Deaton estimates a 70% chance that Judge Analisa Torres will approve the joint motion recently filed by Ripple and the SEC. The XRP lawsuit has just taken another turn, as Ripple and the SEC filed a joint motion to end the lengthy legal battle. This move follows Ripple’s effort to access the $125 million currently locked in escrow. Under the proposed agreement, $50 million would be paid to the SEC as a fine, while the remaining $75 million would be returned to Ripple. Both sides argue the deal would expedite resolution, avoid further appeals, and finally close a legal battle that has lasted over four years. Deaton revealed that he will talk about the XRP lawsuit’s chance of success in more detail tomorrow. He will explain why Judge Torres should approve it and why she might not. After that, his US legal and regulatory news for digital asset holders, CryptoLaw, will conduct a poll to see what everyone thinks. Deaton refers to the SEC’s action against the crypto industry as “aggressive” Following Deaton’s speculation on the 70% chance Judge Torres would grant relief on the XRP lawsuit, he replied to public comments, stating that he did not anticipate receiving compliments or flattery from those involved. Instead, he wished the SEC would acknowledge some responsibility for past aggressive actions against the crypto industry. The attorney mentioned that the SEC would admit that its previous leaders were too harsh regarding crypto. Deaton also noted that another judge, Sarah Netburn, earlier expressed that SEC lawyers did not have a faithful allegiance to the law. He also mentioned the recent Debt Box case , where SEC lawyers received penalties for their behavior. Furthermore, John Deaton recognized that pending regulatory developments, including Crypto Clarity and Genius Acts, could have been cited in support of the motion. Meanwhile, a former SEC official, Marc Fagel, shared his worries about the SEC’s logic in their most recent court filing. Citing the agency’s reference to elections and policy focus changes, he argued that it is not a strong legal argument. Bill Morgan speculates that the SEC-Ripple filing will be approved soon The SEC and Ripple filed a joint letter to the Southern District of New York’s US District Court on May 8, 2025. The motion stated that approval would eliminate potential appeals and conserve court resources. The letter stated, “The solution suggested by the parties will protect the resources of the Second Circuit… and end 4.5 years of intense legal battles.” If accepted, it will officially wrap up one of the most closely followed cases in cryptocurrency regulation. Analysts like Bill Morgan think the judge will probably agree to the motion, even if the reasons mostly focus on procedural details. As the XRP lawsuit progresses in court, the price of XRP stays within a narrow trading range. Technical indicators reveal consolidation as the price stays close to important support levels. If the price of XRP drops below $2.00, it might see more selling pressure. However, it could rise to $2.50 if it returns from this level. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index is at 41.18, indicating a slight bearish trend, but there is still potential for the price to recover.

This concentration, which spans across 216 entities that include governments, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), public and private companies, centralized exchanges, and DeFi contracts, ultimately indicates growing institutional maturity and adoption. The total amount of BTC held by major institutional and custodial entities has skyrocketed to 6,145,207 BTC today, which represents a whopping 924% increase over the past decade. This rapid growth demonstrates how centralized players have steadily accumulated a larger share of the network’s supply, reshaping Bitcoin’s ownership structure in favor of institutional dominance. Market Maturation According to a joint report by Gemini and Glassnode, just three entities dominate Bitcoin adoption across most institutional categories, holding between 65% and 90% of total BTC holdings. This concentration reflected how early entrants shaped the strategic direction and legitimacy of Bitcoin within institutional finance. On the other hand, private company holdings are more evenly distributed, which indicates a broader base of adoption at that level. While such dominance may decrease as institutional participation expands, the early leaders continue to play a central role in driving capital inflows and positioning Bitcoin as a credible macro asset in traditional finance. Custody has slowly shifted away from centralized exchanges toward ETFs, funds, and DeFi protocols, which now serve as primary gateways for spot market access. While balances on centralized exchanges have declined over the past two years, this does not signal a tightening supply. Instead, most of that Bitcoin has moved into custodial vehicles like US spot ETFs. The combined holdings of these spot custodians have remained relatively stable and range between 3.9 million and 4.2 million BTC since June 2021. This is indicative of a reallocation rather than a reduction in circulating supply. Despite the stability in total holdings, these custodians exert significant influence on price action, driven by their sensitivity to market shifts. Monthly inflows and outflows can swing dramatically, by as much as $10 billion, which makes these entities key players in BTC’s short-term trajectory, even as the overall structure of the spot market becomes more institutionalized and regulated. Sovereign BTC Treasuries Government-held Bitcoin reserves have grown significantly, particularly in the US, China, the U.K., and Germany, where most acquisitions come through legal enforcement rather than market purchases. The US stands out with more than 200,000 BTC, largely sourced from major law enforcement seizures. These include 69,369 BTC taken from the Silk Road case in November 2027 and 94,643 BTC recovered from the Bitfinex hack in February 2022. After a brief decline, a portion of the US government’s remaining balance was formally converted into a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) following an executive order by President Donald Trump on March 6th. In the UK, Bitcoin has been seized by the National Crime Agency through operations targeting cybercriminals. China, after banning crypto activities, confiscated over 194,000 BTC in November 2020 in its crackdown on the PlusToken Ponzi scheme. Germany also accumulated Bitcoin through criminal investigations, but officially liquidated all its holdings by April 29th. These sovereign holdings form a unique category in the crypto ecosystem: largely dormant, yet capable of influencing markets if moved.

In a recent post on X, Edo Farina, a well-known XRP supporter, reminded the community of Garlinghouse’s bold claim that XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT’s global payments volume within five years. The post featured a group photo taken at the Singapore Fintech Festival, showing Garlinghouse alongside top-level figures from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including Christine Lagarde and Jessie Cheng, further reinforcing the credibility behind Ripple’s ambitions. Farina’s message, “When Brad Garlinghouse tells you XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT volume, you better be paying attention”, highlights the importance of Garlinghouse’s projection earlier reported by Timestabloid . For XRP holders and institutional observers alike, the message is clear: Ripple is not merely competing with traditional systems—it’s positioning XRP as a serious alternative to the decades-old SWIFT infrastructure. When @bgarlinghouse tells you $XRP could capture 14% of SWFIT volume, you better be paying attention. pic.twitter.com/RVLlCWaylq — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 13, 2025 Ripple’s Target: Replacing a Legacy Giant SWIFT, the global standard for interbank messaging, moves trillions of dollars across borders but is plagued by inefficiencies—slow settlement times, high costs, and lack of transparency. Ripple, using its XRP-powered On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform, seeks to solve these issues by offering near-instant, low-cost international transactions. Garlinghouse’s 14% estimate may sound ambitious, but it’s grounded in Ripple’s increasing integration with financial institutions worldwide. The company’s technology is already being used in regions like Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. If Ripple captures even a fraction of SWIFT’s volume, it would mark a major shift in the global payments ecosystem—and would significantly increase XRP’s utility and market relevance. IMF Connections Strengthen Ripple’s Standing The group photo shared by Farina isn’t just symbolic—it speaks volumes about Ripple’s growing influence at the highest levels of global finance. Garlinghouse was pictured with Christine Lagarde, now President of the European Central Bank, and Jessie Cheng, IMF’s Fintech Counsel who previously worked for Ripple. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The image was taken during a meeting of the IMF’s Interdepartmental Working Group on Finance and Technology, signaling Ripple’s active participation in shaping the future of digital finance. This isn’t the first time Ripple has engaged with global policy institutions, but the photograph gives the public a rare glimpse into its real-time involvement. It underscores that Ripple’s vision is being heard, not just within crypto circles, but among central banks, regulators, and financial policymakers. XRP’s Role in the Future of Finance As Ripple continues expanding into stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and tokenized assets, XRP’s function as a bridge currency grows increasingly relevant. The 14% SWIFT volume projection is no longer a far-fetched dream—it’s a long-term objective rooted in the company’s ongoing enterprise and policy-level engagements. While debates continue within the XRP community and the broader crypto space, the momentum behind Ripple is clear. Farina’s post served as a timely reminder that when someone like Garlinghouse makes a prediction, it’s worth more than passing attention—it’s a signal of where global finance may be heading. And if XRP fulfills even part of that promise, the impact will be transformative. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Kaspa: The New Dawn of High-Speed Cryptocurrency Kaspa is a new kind of cryptocurrency that aims to change how we think about blockchain technology. Unlike traditional blockchains that discard blocks created at the same time, Kaspa uses a special method to let them exist together and puts them in order. This makes its network more like a web than a chain, allowing it to handle transactions much faster. Right now, Kaspa creates one block every second, but it’s aiming for ten blocks per second, and even dreams of reaching a hundred. This leads to confirmation times that are lightning-fast, only limited by how quickly data moves across the internet. Kaspa brings many exciting features to the table. It has tools to explore the network’s structure, saves space by trimming unnecessary data, and plans to support simpler proofs for verifying transactions. In the future, it wants to make it easier to build additional layers on its network, which could lead to innovative new services. In today’s market, where speed and scalability are crucial, Kaspa stands out with its forward-thinking approach. While other cryptocurrencies may struggle with slow transactions and congestion, Kaspa offers a glimpse into a faster, more efficient future for digital money. Ondo Finance: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Innovation Ondo Finance is pioneering a new path by combining the stability of traditional finance with the innovation of blockchain technology. By tokenizing stable, income-generating assets like US Treasuries, Ondo makes high-grade financial products more accessible to a broader audience. Its structure includes an asset management arm that creates these tokenized products and a technology arm that develops decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to enhance their functionality. Collaborations with respected firms like BlackRock and the use of Coinbase for crypto asset custody highlight Ondo’s commitment to quality, security, and regulatory compliance. In today’s market, where volatility is common, Ondo’s focus on real-world, income-generating assets offers a different approach. Their product USDY combines the accessibility of a stablecoin with the added benefit of yield, secured by US Treasuries and bank deposits. This blend might appeal to non-US investors looking for regulated and transparent financial options within the crypto space. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, Ondo’s unique position at the intersection of traditional finance and DeFi could make it stand out among other digital assets, especially for those interested in stability and tangible backing over high-risk speculation. VeChain’s VET: Revolutionizing Supply Chains with Blockchain Power VeChain is transforming how we track products globally. By using blockchain technology, it brings transparency to industries like food, fashion, and automotive. Each product gets a unique ID and sensor, allowing detailed tracking through the supply chain. This helps verify authenticity and manage recalls efficiently. VeChain’s native token, VET, ranks among the top 40 in market cap, showing its strong adoption in real-world applications. Founded by Sunny Lu, former CIO of Louis Vuitton China, VeChain moved from Ethereum to its own blockchain, VeChainThor, in 2018. It introduced a dual-token system with VET for value transfer and VTHO for transaction fees. Its proof of authority mechanism enhances transaction validation. With partnerships like PricewaterhouseCoopers, Walmart China, and BMW, VeChain demonstrates practical use cases. In the current market cycle, VET looks attractive due to its unique focus on supply chain solutions. While staking rewards are low, the potential for growth and passive income is promising. Compared to other coins, VeChain’s real-world utility sets it apart, making it a noteworthy player in the blockchain industry. Stellar Lumens: Bridging the World’s Financial Systems Since 2014, Stellar (XLM) has been on a mission to make money transfers faster and cheaper. It’s a decentralized network that uses blockchain to move funds quickly. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that aim to replace traditional finance, Stellar wants to improve it. With Stellar, you can send any type of currency—dollars, euros, or even Bitcoin—across borders with ease. Its own cryptocurrency, Stellar Lumens, helps make these transactions smooth. Big companies have noticed; Stellar has processed billions of transactions and partnered with major firms to connect different financial systems. Stellar’s potential lies in uniting diverse financial networks. People can use Stellar apps to send money globally, and businesses can build blockchain tools or handle payments on the network. The Stellar Development Foundation, backed initially by Stripe, is pushing its use for things like NFTs and smart contracts. In today’s market, where speed and low fees matter, Stellar stands out. While some cryptocurrencies struggle with slow or costly transactions, Stellar offers a practical solution that’s already making a difference. As global finance evolves, Stellar Lumens looks like a promising player to watch. Conclusion KAS, ONDO, VET, and XLM show promise, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out, uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth through a unique, community-driven ecosystem.

46007085,https://zycrypto.com/?p=107389,1749912904,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Tornado Cash Founder Roman Storm Stands Trial Next Month for Money Laundering Charges,https://zycrypto.com/tornado-cash-founder-roman-storm-stands-trial-next-month-for-money-laundering-charges/,"Roman Storm, co-founder of Tornado Cash , is set to stand trial on July 14 at a Manhattan Federal Court, facing charges of conspiring to launder money and operating an unlicensed money transmitter. Tornado Cash is a cryptocurrency-mixing service that allows users to increase their privacy, but also enables hackers to launder proceeds from exploited platforms. The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has voiced its support for Storm, commenting on X that privacy is normal and that writing code is not a crime. The EF has supported Storm since he was indicted in August 2023 for helping build Tornado Cash. US authorities allege that the mixing service is responsible for laundering over $1 billion in illicit funds. Tornado Cash allows users to disguise the link between a sender and receiver, thus allowing users to anonymize their transaction history. US authorities believe this service has enabled criminals to disguise their illicit transactions and profit from illegal activities. Storm’s defence, however, claims that the case against him threatens open source innovation and may stifle future attempts by developers to engage in the DeFi market. US authorities have changed their approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. The case against Roman Storm comes after a new administration has scaled back regulatory activities against crypto developers. In December 2024, the US Treasury’s Office dropped its sanctions against Tornado Cash. Storm’s defence argued that the case against their client should be dropped since regulators had changed their stance towards the mixer service. Storm wrote on X that he has a court case next month and that the DOJ wants to bury DeFi. He explained that US authorities wanted him to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures with the mixing service, which would have made the service obsolete. Storm concluded that the DOJ was blocking his witnesses from testifying and that if successful, it would crush the DeFi market. The DOJ dismissed Storm’s expert witnesses from participating in the court case. Storm was adamant that US authorities were aiming to crush him during the trial. However, the expert witnesses planned to provide details about digital privacy, blockchain technology, and KYC requirements. Storm’s defence team would argue that the KYC requirements could not apply to Tornado Cash. However, the prosecutors felt these topics were irrelevant to the current case. The prosecutors dismissed the first expert witness, Matthew Green, because he didn’t disclose any relevant opinions to the case. However, prosecutors commented that Green disclosed details about the Tornado Cash protocol that may have been relevant to the case. The prosecutors scrutinized all of Storm’s expert witnesses, one by one, questioning the relevance of their testimony. The DOJ further criticised the expert witnesses for judging the appropriateness of KYC requirements for Tornado Cash. According to the DOJ, such judgments should be reserved for the judge, not the expert witnesses. The Ethereum Foundation (EF) commented on X that they had donated funds to support Storm’s defence and would match up to $750,000 donated from the community. The EF believes that Storm is innocent and should not be prosecuted for creating privacy-enabling technologies. Storm is raising funds for his trial next month and hopes to raise $2 million. Storm was indicted in 2023 for conspiring to commit money laundering. He immediately cited the First Amendment as a defence to dismiss the charges. Meanwhile, a hacker who stole $23 million in crypto from Bittrue exchange in 2023 is starting to launder the funds through Tornado Cash. The hacker sent $30 million to Tornado Cash to anonymize the funds. The hacker made money from the stolen funds by selling the ETH tokens and buying them when the price of Ethereum was much lower. It is unclear whether the hacker is working alone or with a group. The actions of hackers may further complicate the ongoing case against Storm. DOJ officials may see the actions of hackers as proof that the privacy-focused service facilitates criminal activity.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 14:55:04

For investors and traders alike, this extended period of consolidation has become a source of both frustration and anticipation. According to crypto analyst BitBull, this stagnant price action may soon be nearing its breaking point — and when it does, the move is expected to be anything but subtle. The Agony of the Range For over six months, XRP has hovered between key resistance and support levels, failing to make any definitive move in either direction. During this period, the asset has repeatedly tested upper boundaries only to retreat, and dipped toward the lower edge of its channel only to bounce back. This back-and-forth movement has left many holders wondering when the breakout will finally arrive — and more importantly, in which direction. BitBull captured this sentiment in a recent post on X, writing: “XRP has been stuck in this range for 193 days. It’s always the same story — you hold, it chops. You sell, and it breaks out. When this range resolves, it won’t ask for permission.” The implication is clear: the longer the consolidation continues, the more powerful the eventual breakout is likely to be . $XRP has been stuck in this range for 193 days. It’s always the same story you hold, it chops. You sell, it breaks out. When this range resolves, it won’t ask for permission. pic.twitter.com/M8JbvMPmUN — BitBull (@AkaBull_) June 14, 2025 Historical Context and Market Psychology Historically, prolonged periods of sideways movement in the crypto market have often preceded explosive price action. This pattern is rooted in classic market psychology. As traders grow weary of unchanging price levels, many exit their positions out of boredom or frustration. This results in a thinning of liquidity, and when a significant catalyst emerges, price often moves rapidly due to the absence of meaningful resistance or support. For XRP, the current consolidation phase is further complicated by the ongoing legal overhang from its case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While progress has been made, the market continues to tread cautiously as potential settlement is still pending. Why This Breakout Could Be Different Unlike previous surges, the next major move out of this range could carry broader implications for XRP’s role in the evolving financial ecosystem. Ripple has continued to expand its presence globally, striking deals with banks, central banks, and financial institutions. With developments like the EVM-compatible sidechain, the utility narrative around XRP has never been stronger. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Yet despite all this progress, the price remains stuck — a disconnect that BitBull and others believe won’t last much longer. The current range acts like a coiled spring. The longer it compresses, the greater the momentum once it’s released. BitBull’s warning that XRP “won’t ask for permission” when the range resolves isn’t just about volatility; it speaks to the sudden and decisive nature of crypto market breakouts, particularly after months of accumulation and quiet buildup. What Comes Next? Whether XRP breaks to the upside or slips downward will depend on a convergence of technical signals and fundamental developments. Regulatory clarity, broader crypto market sentiment, and renewed institutional interest could all play a role in tipping the balance. For now, analysts like BitBull are urging traders to stay vigilant. This long-standing period of chop may be nearing its end, and when it does, XRP’s next chapter could unfold rapidly and without warning. In the volatile world of crypto, patience often pays. But as XRP inches closer to resolution, holders may soon discover whether their patience will be rewarded — or tested yet again.

Boasting transparency through its ongoing audit by Cyberscope and a $1 price prediction from market analysts, Ruvi AI is positioned as a serious competitor in the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem. Ripple (XRP): A Leader in Cross-Border Payments Ripple (XRP) has earned a prominent spot in the blockchain world by revolutionizing cross-border payments. Its distributed ledger technology enables financial institutions to process transactions instantly and cost-effectively, eliminating traditional banking inefficiencies. XRP plays an integral role in Ripple’s payment solutions, acting as a bridge currency to facilitate smooth and rapid international exchanges. Ripple has cultivated partnerships with leading banks and financial institutions worldwide, bolstering its reputation. Despite these achievements, competition from innovative blockchain projects like Ruvi AI has started attracting attention away from Ripple as investors broaden their portfolios. Transparent Progress Through Cyberscope Audit Ruvi AI has reinforced investor confidence by undergoing a thorough audit by Cyberscope, a leader in blockchain security assessments. The audit focuses on reviewing Ruvi AI’s smart contract robustness, platform security, and code integrity to ensure a trustworthy ecosystem for users and stakeholders alike. The Cyberscope audit places Ruvi AI on a credible footing alongside established projects like Ripple. By prioritizing trust and transparency, the project signals its dedication to long-term success and market reliability, traits that resonate with institutional investors and whale participants. A Record-Breaking Presale Ruvi AI’s strong debut has been showcased through its thriving presale, which has quickly gained momentum among investors. Phase 1 sold out in just two weeks at $0.010 per token, delivering early backers a 50% ROI when the price climbed to $0.015 in Phase 2. The explosive growth has attracted more than 1,600 holders and allowed Ruvi AI to raise over $1.7 million so far. Adding to the excitement, Ruvi AI recently announced its first token listing and a partnership with a leading exchange, demonstrating active progress on its roadmap. With further updates expected in the coming weeks, Ruvi AI’s growth potential is undeniable. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Merging Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence Ruvi AI takes a bold step beyond conventional blockchain applications by integrating artificial intelligence into a decentralized platform. The project offers users a superapp that enables the creation of AI-driven content in formats such as text, video, images, and audio. By addressing real-world needs in sectors like marketing, automation, and creative production, Ruvi AI is redefining the possibilities of blockchain technology. The $RUVI token is central to Ruvi AI’s operations, powering transactions, enabling staking rewards, offering governance participation, and providing access to premium features. This practicality, combined with groundbreaking technology, positions Ruvi AI as a competitor not only to Ripple but also to other established crypto platforms. Lucrative Investment Opportunities Ruvi AI’s presale includes a VIP tier system designed to maximize early investment potential. Here’s a breakdown of the projected returns for participants based on the $0.015 presale price, a listing price of $0.07, and the forecasted $1 post-listing valuation: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI ($750 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $4,900 (553% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI ($1,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $11,200 (647% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI ($7,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $70,000 (833% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $1,000,000 (13,233% ROI). These scenarios reveal why Ruvi AI has emerged as an appealing opportunity, especially for savvy investors eager to capitalize on its impressive ROI potential. The Final Word Ruvi AI is rapidly becoming a focus of attention, especially for crypto whales looking for the next high-growth investment opportunity. Its successful presale, commitment to trust through a Cyberscope audit, and practical technology integrating AI and blockchain cement its status as a serious project ready for exponential growth. With analysts predicting a $1 price target and strong whale participation, Ruvi AI stands out among competitors like Ripple. Investors seeking to secure a stake in this groundbreaking initiative are encouraged to act now before Ruvi AI dominates the blockchain conversation in 2025 and beyond.

One of the best ways to make a profit is to find a new crypto project that shows massive potential and buy in before it explodes in value. A good example of this strategy is the early Bitcoin (BTC) buyers. Back in 2010, Bitcoin (BTC) was worth around $0.20, topping at $0.39 that year. Keen investors who understood the technological marvel that it was back then bought small stakes of $100 or more. Since then, their investment has grown into millions of dollars. In June 2025, the opportunity for such massive returns exists, but only if you know where to look. One of the best examples of such an opportunity is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently in the presale phase, analysts are forecasting some of the biggest returns witnessed in the crypto sector since 2020. Let us take a deep dive into projects that could turn your fortunes around in the ongoing June 2025 crypto bull run. Toncoin (TON) Toncoin (TON) is a project that was supposed to launch back in 2019 before the SEC put a stop to it. Since then, the project has reinvented itself and is now known for its promise of high performance. As Telegram seeks out opportunities in Web3, Toncoin (TON) is expected to play an important role. TON is popular for its low transaction fees, the ability to handle numerous transactions at once, and its growing integration with Telegram. The main downside to this project is that it is highly centralized. Besides that, the project is already trading at the peak of its success. Consequently, holders should not expect massive returns of 100x or more, like those who got in early. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a popular meme coin that rose to the top through sheer grit from its community. With no real use cases, the SHIB meme coin has been able to claim its spot among the top 20 coins by market cap. While this is impressive, SHIB is known to be extremely volatile. As such, unless you are one of the big investors holding millions of dollars’ worth of tokens, plotting a profitable exit is nearly impossible. This has made it so that every exit opportunity that SHIB investors get, they use it to build the MUTM token investment. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) expected to deliver some of the biggest returns in this altcoin season, this is a solid strategy that many other meme coin investors are copying. At this rate, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale could conclude earlier than envisioned. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale So far, over $10.6 million has been raised in the ongoing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. The project has already passed a CertiK audit, which has been a major boost to trust in the project. Over 35% of the tokens set aside for the current phase 5 of the presale have already been sold, barely two weeks after it began. In the current phase 5 of the presale, tokens are selling for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. The price is expected to rise by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6 to $0.035. At the current price, buyers are expecting a 100% guaranteed return on investment (ROI) based on the planned listing price of $0.06. To date, approximately 12,000 unique buyers have purchased their MUTM presale tokens. A major catalyst for the presale is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway . In this giveaway, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team plans to give away $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens to ten lucky winners each. Qualifying for this reward is extremely easy; users only need to purchase $50 worth of MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale. The Mutuum Finance Protocol Design The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. When lenders deposit their funds, borrowers can access those funds and pay interest. Part of this interest goes to the lenders, while the rest goes into the reserve factor. The amount that goes to the reserve factor is determined based on the overall qualities of a token. Generally, more stable coins like ETH and stablecoins have a lower reserve factor of around 10%. Meanwhile, more volatile tokens like meme coins have a reserve factor of up to 35%. Funds in the reserve factor are used to stabilize the ecosystem from unexpected market swings. This ensures that the protocol does not suffer from insolvency, ensuring users can continue to earn passive income for the life of the protocol. To support the MUTM tokens’ price, part of the protocol profits will be used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market. That will ensure the price keeps rising, boosting the profile of the protocol, which will get more people to join the protocol. Mutuum Finance is a perfectly designed ecosystem that is built for stability and long-term gains. Coupled with the optimistic forecasts by analysts, buying MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale at the low price of $0.03 per token could be your biggest win of 2025.

As Donald Trump’s campaign reignited debates around digital assets, the market reacted with sharp, unsettling twists that caught even seasoned investors off guard. Still, in the middle of the market mayhem, one surprising player is lighting up the charts. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is standing tall with a fiercely loyal community and sharp tech upgrades. Its jaw-dropping price of just $0.00000035 continues to turn heads. Add in an irresistible 80% bonus with the code FLOPPY80 , and it’s no wonder this underdog is fueling serious FOMO across the crypto scene. The Donald Trump Effect: Why The 2024 Election Sent Crypto Markets Into Overdrive When Donald Trump clinched victory in the 2024 election, his return to the White House sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, significantly reshaping the trajectory of crypto and the broader market landscape. The 2024 election outcome triggered a drastic shift in market sentiment as Donald Trump adopted a decidedly pro-crypto stance, unveiling ambitious plans to make the US the “crypto capital”. He also appointed a crypto czar, dismantled restrictive regulations, and reportedly even used federal policy to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve—all signaling to the market that Donald Trump meant business with crypto. As Bitcoin (BTC) eyes $112,000, social data shows the most bullish crypto chatter since Donald Trump won the 2024 election, hinting at rising market euphoria and a potential crypto cooldown. Yet this market momentum carries risks, as hedge funds warn of a crypto bubble fueled by Donald Trump’s crypto agenda, with the 2024 election injecting fresh volatility into a market still adjusting to his return. In essence, the 2024 election has transformed the market dynamics of crypto, with Donald Trump at the center, rewriting rules around crypto, igniting price climbs, and challenging the market to balance excitement with caution. Forget The Noise: FloppyPepe (FPPE) Stands Tall In Donald Trump’s Crypto Turmoil With 80% Bonus While the broader crypto market reels from post-2024 election volatility tied to Donald Trump’s bold agenda, one unexpected altcoin is flipping the script— FloppyPepe (FPPE) .

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $81 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $241.53 by 2031. Ethereum Name Service is a network that allows crypto-enthusiasts to rename their crypto addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As decentralized identities and Web3 technology are adopted, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $20.26 Market Cap $739.23Million Trading Volume (24-hour) $70.59 Million Circulating Supply 100 Million ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $20.73 24-h Low $19.51 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day Volatility) $ 15.36 (-24.74%) 50-Day SMA $ 20.65 14-Day RSI 41.03 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 45 (Fear) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $21.04 Ethereum Name Service price analysis: ENS hovers at key support as momentum weakens amid sideways consolidation TL;DR Breakdown : ENS is trading near the lower Bollinger Band, which indicates mild selling pressure MACD shows weakening momentum as the signal line overtakes the MACD line Price stability above 20 dollars is crucial to prevent further downside risks Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart ENS/USD chart Image Source: TradingView Based on the 1-day chart for Ethereum Name Service (ENS) on June 6, the asset has shown a moderate rebound after testing lower Bollinger Band support near $19.85. It trades near the middle band at $21.91, suggesting a neutral to slightly bullish posture. RSI stands at 51.28, indicating mild momentum without entering overbought or oversold zones. Price action remains constrained within the Bollinger Band envelope, hinting at a potential consolidation phase. For a bullish continuation, ENS needs to close above the upper band near $23.98. However, a drop below $19.80 may invite further downside pressure toward previous support levels near $16. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis ENS/USD chart Image Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of Ethereum Name Service (ENS), the price is hovering near the lower Bollinger Band, currently at $19.71, suggesting mild downward pressure. The MACD shows a weak bearish crossover, with the signal line slightly above the MACD line, hinting at a loss of bullish momentum. The Balance of Power indicator is volatile but currently at its upper extreme, suggesting sporadic buy-side interest. For a short-term uptrend, ENS must close above the mid-Bollinger band at $21.26. However, failure to maintain above $20 could prompt further weakness. Overall, the chart leans neutral to bearish unless stronger volume supports recovery. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $20.13 BUY SMA 5 $21.33 BUY SMA 10 $22.14 BUY SMA 21 $ 21.45 BUY SMA 50 $18.44 BUY SMA 100 $ 19.58 BUY SMA 200 $21.92 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 20.40 BUY EMA 5 $18.95 BUY EMA 10 $ 17.40 BUY EMA 21 $16.96 BUY EMA 50 $19.04 BUY EMA 100 $ 22.17 BUY EMA 200 $23.59 SELL What to expect from ENS? Based on both the 1-day and 4-hour charts, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is exhibiting a bearish outlook. On the daily chart, the price hovers near the lower Bollinger Band with a declining RSI at 44.45, indicating fading bullish momentum. The 4-hour chart confirms this weakness, with the Balance of Power at –0.78 and the MACD showing bearish crossover below the baseline. Price has failed to sustain above the $22 resistance zone, suggesting continued selling pressure. Unless ENS finds strong support around $19–$20, further downside is likely. A break above $22.50 would be required to signal potential trend reversal. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $100.37 on average by 2029. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending to $241.53 by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest. Recent news/opinion on Ethereum Name Service ENS Users Can Now Display Their .eth Names Across Web3 Apps Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has introduced an easy way for users to personalize their web3 identity by setting a primary ENS name—such as yourname.eth —instead of the default hexadecimal address. Users can do this by visiting app.ens.domains , selecting their preferred name, and confirming the update in their wallet. Once set, platforms like Uniswap, OpenSea, and Etherscan will display the user’s ENS name in place of the wallet address. Only one primary name can be linked per address, and while not necessary for transactions, it enhances user visibility across ENS-supported platforms. Want wallets or dapps to show yourname.eth instead of a 0x? → Go to https://t.co/5tArNzDa07 and choose your preferred name → Click “Set as primary name” → Confirm in your wallet Now every ENS-enabled wallet and dapp displays yourname.eth, not the hex. pic.twitter.com/11TzqzoGvi — ens.eth (@ensdomains) June 3, 2025 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has been integrated into SheFi’s curriculum, empowering Cohort 13’s 3,000+ members to personalize their crypto experience.

According to an on-chain analytical piece from Glassnode, Bitcoin could surge past its all-time high of $111,970, attained in May, to hit never-before-seen price levels, “should the market enter price discovery.” Notably, Bitcoin’s current price is determined by buying and selling activities. Factors such as supply and demand, liquidity, and market sentiment are some of the determining factors observed in the price discovery process for assets like Bitcoin. According to Glassnode’s analysis, a key support level is essential for Bitcoin to maintain underlying bullish pressure. The Short-term holder cost basis—the average acquisition price of Bitcoin by crypto investors who have held the asset for 115 days or less—interestingly doubles as the aforementioned support level. As seen in Glassnode’s report ; “The $97.6k Short-Term Holder cost basis continues to serve as a pivotal support level necessary for maintaining local bullish momentum.” In contrast, the bulls are primed to retest a new ATH if the nearest resistance level is broken in the near term. “On the upside, the $115.4k zone emerges as the first significant resistance should the market enter price discovery.” The report read. After failing to sustain momentum above the $101,000 price level last week, Bitcoin bulls are making a notable comeback. Recovery gains sustained this week sent the asset to $110,300. With Bitcoin around 1.5% away from its previous all-time high, renewed interest in the asset suggests that investment confidence has been strengthened for the near term. At the time of this report, Bitcoin is trading at $108,729, while 7-day gains surged by 4.06%.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 15:07:33

It has seen Bitcoin rise to a new monthly high, with altcoins riding the wave. June feels like a massive revival for the crypto sector, providing a chance for those who missed the wave in May to make their profits. However, smart investors know the real gains are not in large-cap coins. Instead, the best way to ride this wave is to invest in small-cap coins and watch your investment grow by 3,000%. One such project to consider in this bull cycle is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Let us learn more about the most promising projects of June 2025. Polygon (POL) Polygon has struggled since it made the decision to rebrand from MATIC to POL. Since that time, it has struggled to regain the trust of its community. However, it is still a respectable name in the layer 2 scaling industry. POL has struggled in the past month, falling over 14%. Some analysts are expecting the price to drop even lower, and they are seeking a perfect entry. One of the reasons why POL made it into this list is that it is one of the veteran networks of the crypto industry, and is a great bargain under $1. However, the gains are not expected to be as massive as those of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) has experienced some exceptional growth in recent years. Today, it is one of the biggest ecosystems for meme coins. It is fast, and transactions are extremely cheap. Additionally, it has a huge online following. A major downside of this project is that it is extremely centralized. Besides that, the SOL coin has struggled to find growth in recent months. For instance, it has fallen nearly 50% since its January all-time high. While it could experience some growth going forward, investors should not hold their breath for double-digit gains as with Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Growth-Oriented Behemoth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to deliver strong growth by expanding its user base and strengthening its ecosystem. The project has already attracted a community of more than 20,000 followers across social platforms, including over 10,500 on X alone. One of the basic ingredients for a successful project is a massive initial user base, which Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has secured. The other requirement is often innovative product design, which Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has flawlessly achieved. Protocol Design The Mutuum Finance protocol is built as a decentralized, non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. When participating as lenders, users deposit their assets in a liquidity pool and earn passive income via interest. The interest rate in each pool is based on a pool’s utilization rate. The pool design is meant to dynamically increase and reduce the interest rate for lenders and borrowers to ensure a system that achieves optimal capital efficiency. When the interest rate rises, it encourages borrowers to pay back their loans, while lenders are attracted to the pool due to higher yields. That boosts the liquidity in the pool while lowering the interest. Liquidations And Over-collateralization To protect the protocol’s solvency, the team has set strict parameters for overcollateralization. This is a recognition that the market price of crypto fluctuates often. As such, they provide for a headroom and incentives to ensure the protocol is safe during extreme market movements. If the value of collateral falls below a defined threshold, then a portion of that collateral is liquidated. A liquidator is incentivized using a liquidation bonus to purchase the collateral, thereby eliminating the possibility of bad debt from the ecosystem. Deposit And Borrow Caps The protocol comes with deposit and borrowing caps meant to protect its long-term health. A deposit cap is the maximum amount of an asset that can be added to the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. It ensures that the overall ecosystem does not have too much exposure to an asset with high volatility. At the same time, it provides protection from unlimited asset minting. The deposit cap is set by checking the on-chain volume, the price volatility, and the historical performance. The borrow cap is the limit on how much of a given asset can be borrowed from the Mutuum Finance ecosystem. This limitation is especially important for tokens that show signs of price manipulation. By restricting how much they can borrow, it reduces the possibility of insolvency due to price manipulation. MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the token presale stage. So far, over $10.55 million has been raised in the ongoing presale from around 12,000 unique buyers.

Troller Cat’s Stage 8 Presale Tops the 8 Best Cryptos to Hold Long Term,https://timestabloid.com/45k-into-1-13m-troller-cats-stage-8-presale-tops-the-8-best/,"Ever wondered what would happen if a squirrel, a cat, and a Roman goat started outperforming your stock portfolio? Welcome to the meme coin jungle of 2025. Meme coins have never been more chaotic, and 2025 is shaping up to be the year of narrative-fueled madness. Between Popcat, Peanut the Squirrel, and Apu Apustaja, new tokens are flying off the blockchain and into investor portfolios like confetti at a meme parade. But one cat has everyone glued to the charts—and it’s purring in presale mode. Troller Cat ($TCAT) just launched its presale and is already making noise. Currently in Stage 8 out of 26, it’s raised over $250,000, gained 1,100+ holders, and delivered a 319.8% price increase since Stage 1. The listing target? A sharp leap to $0.0005309, which means anyone getting in now at $0.00002099 could be sitting on a 2,429.30% ROI. But there’s a catch—Stage 9 begins tomorrow, raising the price by 35.01%. Every minute delay means a higher entry point. If timing is everything, this is the clock to watch. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Troller Cat isn’t your average pixel coin—it’s a narrative-driven meme machine with laser eyes on galactic domination. Built on Ethereum and fully audit and KYC approved, this troll-themed coin blends humor, strategy, and deflationary mechanics. From the 26-stage Walk of Fame trolling history to a Play-to-Earn Game Center that burns tokens using ad revenue, this cat means business. It’s not just trolling—it’s monetizing the chaos. The staking system offering 69% APY is already live during presale, with the added bonus of a referral program (spend $25+, unlock your code, and both parties earn a 10% bonus). The presale is fully transparent—coins are accessible at launch, liquidity is locked for two years, and no funny games behind the scenes. With the coin’s listing price projected at $0.0005309, a $45,000 investment at Stage 8 ($0.00002099) could grow to an eye-watering $1,139,040. Roadmap & Future Plans: The Galaxy’s on the Menu Troller Cat is clawing toward the stars—literally. After listing on UniSwap, the roadmap continues with centralized exchange listings, community governance, metaverse expansion, and even AI-based trolling mechanics. A cosmic prank empire in the making, its final phase includes cross-chain integration and interstellar meme warfare. Yes, seriously. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Troller Cat blends memes, staking, and deflationary games into a story-driven investment play. It’s already up 319.8%—and it hasn’t even launched yet. Don’t miss your shot at 2,400% ROI. 2. Popcat ($POPCAT) Popcat is the meme coin embodiment of a cat’s smug expression paired with explosive sound effects. It quickly clawed into viral status with its simple mechanics—tap to “pop,” earn rewards. Despite its meme-first approach, Popcat integrates real-time leaderboards and social-based reward loops, making engagement both fun and profitable. Its integration with mobile browsers and Twitch streamers gives it broad appeal and makes it a low-barrier entry point into the meme coin craze. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Popcat is as loud as it is loveable. With interactive features and influencer support, it’s got enough hype to stay relevant—and maybe even pounce ahead. 3. Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) Peanut the Squirrel spins crypto chaos into a forest-themed frenzy. Inspired by classic cartoon squirrels and modern Reddit humor, this coin is hyper-focused on collecting—nuts, acorns, NFTs. Its in-game “Nutwork” lets users stash digital rewards and unlock squirrel-powered perks. Peanut’s low supply and high engagement model give it a playful scarcity twist, backed by an acorn-banking system for yield farming. Why This Coin Made It to the List: PNUT is cute, chaotic, and sneaky-smart. A true underdog (or undersquirrel?) story that could store away long-term value. 4. Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) A Roman god-goat hybrid walking the blockchain battlefield, Goatseus Maximus enters with meme might and DeFi firepower. With gladiator-themed NFT staking and “arena combat” reward pools, it blends meme lore with token-burning battles. Every transaction adds to the war chest for community events.It’s ludicrous and oddly genius—gamified gladiator gains for the digital age. Why This Coin Made It to the List: GOAT lives up to its name. With strong branding and mechanics that reward early warriors, this goat might just stomp its way to the moon. 5. Simon’s Cat ($CAT) Straight from the internet’s beloved animation series, Simon’s Cat meanders into crypto with elegant mischief. The token taps nostalgia and established brand power, launching collectible animations as NFTs and sneakily integrating staking through “nap-time” mechanics—earn while your cat rests. Simon’s Cat carries a trusted tone that gives it meme legitimacy in a sea of anonymous devs. Why This Coin Made It to the List: When meme meets memory, you get a coin with real character. $CAT is cute, cuddly, and strategically poised for a slow-burn climb. 6. Apu Apustaja ($APU) The infamous green frog is back—but not as Pepe. $APU reclaims a lost internet legend and injects it with decentralized soul. Community-run, meme-fueled, and culture-first, APU’s mission is to return meme power to the people. Its main mechanic? Hold and vote. The more $APU you own, the more you influence memes, marketing, and movement. Why This Coin Made It to the List: $APU turns nostalgia into governance. And in meme culture, owning the narrative is the real alpha. 7. Act I: The AI Prophecy ($ACT) This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a scripted experience. $ACT rolls out in “Acts,” with each phase unlocked by the community’s interaction. Combining AI-generated plotlines with tokenomics, it fuses storytelling and staking into one wild ride. Gamified prophecy events, choose-your-own-adventure burns, and AI-themed NFT artifacts round out its surreal world. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Part sci-fi, part strategy, $ACT is the most cinematic meme coin on the list. It’s not just a token—it’s an experience you stake into. 8. Test ($TST) Built to mock testnets and experimental chains, $TST began as an inside joke and now sits comfortably in top trending meme tokens. It’s lean on features but strong in community. Its anti-roadmap and self-aware branding won over traders who were burnt by overpromises. By doing “nothing,” it ironically did everything. Minimalism meets meme magic. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Test proves that not every coin needs bells and whistles—just a tribe that gets the joke. Sometimes, low effort = high returns. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the Best Cryptos to Hold Long Term are Troller Cat, Popcat, Peanut the Squirrel, Goatseus Maximus, Simon’s Cat, Apu Apustaja, Act I, and Test. But among them, Troller Cat ($TCAT) is the one lighting up the meme-verse in real time. With Stage 8 closing tomorrow, a 2,429.30% upside, and massive community energy already in motion, it’s clear this cat isn’t just trolling—it’s taking over. Add in 69% APY staking, game-fueled burns, and a galactic roadmap, and you’ve got a meme coin that actually delivers on every tick box. Buy now before this cat claws its way out of reach.

21719264,https://coinpedia.org/?p=255573,1749914169,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Stablecoin Performace in 2025 Jan To June,https://coinpedia.org/research-report/stablecoin-performace-research-report/,"The post Stablecoin Performace in 2025 Jan To June appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Stablecoins have cemented their role in the digital finance revolution as one of the stabilizing forces in the crypto market. These are pegged to stable reserves like fiat currencies, for instance, the US dollar, which helps minimize price fluctuations. Welcome to Coinpedia’s H1 2025 report. This analysis contains a comprehensive examination of the stablecoin sector from authentic sources. This report showcases the information needed for market participants and enthusiasts to make well-informed decisions and identify opportunities. Keep reading to know more. Stablecoin Market Cap ATH: Prediction Rises to $2 Trillion The first half of 2025 marked a historic moment, with the total stablecoin market cap hitting an all-time high of $251.55 billion, up from $204 billion on January 2. This growth pushed stablecoins’ share of the total crypto market cap from 7.9% to 8.9%, reflecting increased investor confidence and usage. Source: IntoTheBlock Despite the ATH market cap, the optimism has not subsided one bit; in fact, it has turned more intense with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s forecast of flipping $2 trillion by the end of 2028 . Under a more advanced prediction, analysts from Citigroup have also estimated that the market cap could reach as high as $3.7 trillion by 2030 . This shows high expectations for growth and displays how opportunistic this sector has become, supported by analysis from major financial institutions. Market Composition and Dominance According to DeFiLlama , there are now 264 stablecoins , out of which 162 have a market cap above $1 million . Tether (USDT) continues to dominate the market, with USDC emerging as a strong second. Stablecoin Dec 2024 Cap ($B) Jun 2025 Cap ($B) Dec 2024 Dominance (%) June 2025 Dominance (%) USDT 138 154 71.06 65.64 USDC 41 61 21.52 26.02 USDe 5.5 5.78 2.87 2.46 DAI 3.4 3.65 1.77 1.55 FDUSD 1.9 1.57 0.99 0.67 FRAX 0.64 0.31 0.33 0.13 TUSD 0.497 0.494 0.26 0.21 PYUSD 0.51 0.975 0.26 0.42 RLUSD 0.03 0.366 0.02 0.16 Notably, USDT’s dominance has declined slightly, while USDC’s share has grown steadily. PYUSD and RLUSD showed positive movement, indicating growing investor interest in newer stables. Exchange Activity and On-chain Signals Exchange flows remained high throughout the first half of 2025. Net inflows were consistent, indicating strong demand. On-chain volume also rose sharply, from $982 billion to $1.394 trillion by May. Additionally, active stablecoin wallet addresses saw a steep rise, signaling a steady influx of users. Source: IntoTheBlock Blockchain Preferences by Stablecoin A look into chain dominance reveals strong preferences among leading stablecoins: Stablecoin Top Chain (%) Rest (%) USDT Tron (50.11%) Ethereum (40.44%) USDC Ethereum (61.58%) Solana (13.29%) USDe Ethereum (96.92%) others DAI Ethereum (87.62%) others FDUSD Ethereum (80.38%) Solana (8.28%) RLUSD Ethereum (83.76%) XRPL (16.24%) FRAX Ethereum (48.77%) Fraxtal (32.85%) Clearly, Ethereum remains the central hub for stablecoins, with TRON and Solana gaining notable activity. Institutional and Corporate Adoption Meanwhile, the regulatory environment became a catalyst. The GENIUS Act , up for Senate vote on June 17, could reshape the stablecoin landscape. It requires stablecoins to be backed by U.S. dollars or highly liquid assets and enforces annual audits for those over $50 billion in market value. President Trump’s vocal support for the bill is expected to bolster the dollar’s strength in digital finance. The Trump administration is clearly orchestrating based on a pre-planned long-term strategy, to preserve the supremacy of the dollar amid geopolitical challenges. Similarly, this bill would clearly change the stablecoin domain, as issuing stablecoins wouldn’t be an exclusive luxury limited to financial tech companies like Circle and Tether. But Santander and Société Générale have entered, raising the hype with a new generation of bank-issued stablecoins. At the same time, traditional institutions joined the race. Bank of America is fast-tracking its own stablecoin project, awaiting the regulatory green light. On the corporate front, Circle, the firm behind USDC stablecoin, enjoyed the growing stablecoin market with its latest move this H1 2025 as it went public. Its shares jumped 235% on day one, clearly indicating the strong adoption. Furthermore, companies like Amazon, Walmart , and Expedia are said to be exploring blockchains and the crypto sector for launching their own stablecoins, possibly to cut card processing fees and streamline payments. TRON and New Entrants Apart from giant Ethereum, TRON continues to be a key blockchain for stablecoins. In a major milestone, recently, Justin Sun confirmed that World Liberty Financial Inc. (WLFI) minted its USD1 stablecoin on TRON. Such launches underscore the growing shift toward blockchain-native financial tools. #TRON has announced the first minting of the USD1 stablecoin on the TRON blockchain. @worldlibertyfi ’s strategic decision to mint USD1 on TRON signals a growing trust in the network’s robust infrastructure and demonstrates increasing institutional confidence in TRON’s ability… pic.twitter.com/vHg1vXKeSJ — TRON DAO (@trondao) June 13, 2025 Moreover, Issuers like Tether are also seeing financial rewards. Recently, Tether reported over $1 billion in Q1 2025 profits , largely from U.S. Treasury yields tied to reserve assets. End Note: The Stablecoin Era Strengthens The first half of 2025 showcased a new phase of stablecoin evolution. From rising volumes and dominance shifts to wider institutional use and legislative support. Now, stablecoins are clearly on the path to becoming foundational elements of the global financial system. As the year continues, the outcome of the GENIUS Act and further corporate moves could define the next leap forward for digital dollars. Moreover, per the dominance perspective, Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) continue to dominate the market, where Ethereum remains the central hub for major stablecoins, while TRON and Solana are also increasing as stablecoin launchpads. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

What is the GENIUS Act and its impact on stablecoins? The GENIUS Act, up for a Senate vote on June 17, requires stablecoins to be backed by U.S. dollars or highly liquid assets and mandates annual audits for those over $50 billion in market value, aiming for regulatory clarity.

Key Takeaways: GameStop upsized its convertible note offering to $2.25B, with a 32.5% premium conversion price. The company holds 4,710 BTC but remains noncommittal about future crypto purchases. Proceeds may fund investments or acquisitions, with trading cards now a core revenue focus. The move comes just months after a similar $1.5 billion raise in April and follows the company’s recent entry into Bitcoin. Shares of the Texas-based retailer dropped 24% over the past week, closing Friday at $22.14, despite holding steady after the announcement. GameStop’s Zero-Coupon Notes Come with 32.5% Conversion Premium The notes, which bear no interest, carry a conversion price of around $28.91 per share — a 32.5% premium over the stock’s Thursday afternoon average. The structure mirrors the strategy employed by MicroStrategy, which has used premium note offerings to expand its Bitcoin holdings without immediate dilution. GameStop first disclosed it had purchased 4,710 Bitcoin in March , pushing the stock above $28 at the time. Whether the company plans to expand its crypto reserves remains uncertain. CEO Ryan Cohen has made it clear that GameStop won’t emulate other firms or signal its buying patterns. In a recent interview, he declined to say whether more BTC purchases were planned. The press release kept options open, stating that proceeds would be used for “general corporate purposes,” including investments aligned with GameStop’s investment policy and “potential acquisitions.” $GME GameStop just locked in the terms for their convertible note offering. Upsized to $2.25 billion from the original $1.75B, with 0.00% interest, meaning bondholders don’t get paid unless they convert. GameStop gave buyers the right to purchase up to $450M more in notes… pic.twitter.com/qnN4pVLM39 — Han Akamatsu 赤松 (@Han_Akamatsu) June 13, 2025 While vague, the language leaves the door open for further digital asset moves. GameStop’s previous crypto ventures have been mixed. The company launched an NFT marketplace during the last market cycle but shut it down early last year. At its annual shareholder meeting, Cohen pivoted focus toward trading cards—now making up nearly 30% of quarterly revenue. “We’re focusing on trading cards as a natural extension of our existing business,” he said. With capital in hand and crypto already on its books, GameStop could revisit Bitcoin when market conditions align. 223 Companies Hold Bitcoin A growing list of firms is embracing Bitcoin as a balance sheet hedge or strategic investment. Recent data shows 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, up from 124 just days earlier. In total, more than 819,000 BTC, approximately 3.9% of the total supply, is currently held by public firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. Last week, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet unveiled an ambitious new target to amass 210,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2027. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong.

Trading between $108,600 and $110,200, Bitcoin’s steady climb reflects strong institutional interest. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in its phase 5 presale, priced at $0.03. Having raised $10,600,000 with over 550 million tokens sold and 12,000 holders, this altcoin promises a 100% return at its $0.06 launch. Investors are buzzing about its potential to hit $5 post-launch. Let’s explore Bitcoin’s current dynamics and why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a top crypto pick. Bitcoin faces key resistance Bitcoin is battling resistance between $110,000 and $112,000. Prices hold steady above $108,000, with a 3% gain recently. Institutional inflows, particularly into crypto ETFs, fuel this momentum. Funds saw $167 billion in May, with Bitcoin leading the charge. Global economic shifts, like rising bond yields and a weaker dollar, push investors toward Bitcoin. Regulatory talks, including the CLARITY Act, signal a maturing crypto market. However, crypto charts show traders hedging against pullbacks, as negative funding rates hint at caution. If Bitcoin breaks $112,000, new highs are possible. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresh opportunity in this vibrant market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale ignites Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing crowds in phase 5 of its presale. Priced at $0.03, up 200% from the $0.01 opening phase, it guarantees a 100% return at the $0.06 launch. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price jump to $0.035, narrowing the early-entry window. The project has raised $10,600,000, with 550 million tokens sold and 12,000 holders onboard. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $3, a 9,900% increase from today’s price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s utility-driven model sets it apart in the crypto market. Furthermore, its innovative approach to lending captivates investors seeking high-yield opportunities. Innovative lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending system. Its Peer-to-Contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools, earning passive income with dynamic interest rates. This ensures lenders gain more while borrowers pay less. The Peer-to-Peer model fosters direct, intermediary-free lending, promoting transparency and user control. Built on Ethereum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stablecoin resists algorithmic instability, ensuring secure transactions. Layer-2 integration enhances speed and cuts fees, making it user-friendly. Consequently, this robust infrastructure positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a leader in crypto investment, offering practical solutions for modern DeFi challenges. Security and community engagement The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has finalized a Certik audit, scoring an impressive 80.00 for security. No vulnerabilities were found in its smart contracts, and zero security incidents occurred in the past 90 days. The team also launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. A $100,000 giveaway excites the community, splitting $10,000 among 10 winners. Eligible participants need a $50 presale investment and must complete all entry steps. This initiative strengthens Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal as a top crypto pick. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto market due to its immediate utility. Unlike many tokens, its beta platform launches alongside the token, allowing instant asset deposits and interest earnings. Revenue from stablecoin borrowing supports the treasury, which buys back MUTM tokens, boosting demand without diluting supply. This strategic tokenomics drives long-term value. Bitcoin’s $110,000 resistance highlights market caution, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a bold alternative. With crypto prices rising and investor interest spiking, now is the time to explore this altcoin. Join the presale to secure your stake in the best crypto to buy now.

The unauthorized setup was discovered during a routine inspection and used a KamAZ truck equipped with 95 mining rigs and a mobile transformer substation. It was illegally drawing energy from a 10-kilovolt line—enough to supply an entire small village, state news agency TASS reported . Two suspects reportedly fled the scene in an SUV before the police arrived. Sixth Power Theft Incident in Buryatia This Year Buryatenergo, a subsidiary of Rosseti Siberia, verified that this is the sixth instance of crypto-related electricity theft in the area since January. Authorities have cautioned against the effects of illegal mining on the network, including voltage drops, overloads, and blackout risks. Crypto Mining Bans Spread in Russia Buryatia has seasonal mining bans from November 15 to March 15 due to electricity deficits. Outside of those dates, only approved operators in areas like Severo-Baikalsky and Muisky can mine. At the national level, Russia expanded mining prohibitions in late 2024. Mining is now prohibited in high energy seasons in places like Dagestan, Chechnya, and occupied eastern Ukraine territories. A total year-round ban is also now in place in the southern Irkutsk region—host to BitRiver’s big data center launched in Bratsk in 2019. Hacker Group Targets Russians for Secret Mining Apart from physical theft, cyber-based mining attacks are also rising. Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky recently linked the hacker group “Librarian Ghouls” (also “Rare Werewolf”) to a cryptojacking campaign targeting Russian users. Through phishing emails that pose as official documents, the group infects systems, deactivates antivirus protection, and conducts mining operations in the early morning hours to avoid detection. The malware also steals login credentials and evaluates system specs to optimize crypto mining output.",Blockchain|Sticky|Mining,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-14 15:26:19

Aerodrome Finance ( AERO ) price jumped to $0.7786, up 177% from its lowest level in March this year. This surge has brought its market capitalization to $619 million. AERO token jumped after Coinbase, the biggest American crypto exchange, said that it would add decentralized exchanges on its Base Blockchain to its main application. This addition will expose Aerodrome to its 10.8 million monthly active users, possibly boosting its volume and revenue. To some extent, the integration is similar to Coinbase’s integration of Morpho into its platform. Morpho is an AAVE rival that facilitates borrowing and lending in a decentralized manner. Dune Analytics’ data shows that $550 million worth of Bitcoin has been collateralized for USDC on Coinbase. https://twitter.com/wagmiAlexander/status/1933513854467616843 AERO price also jumped after Aerodrome Finance’s network continued to dominate the DEX industry on Base. Data shows that the volume processed in the network has jumped 10x in the last twelve months and has just crossed the $100 billion mark. It has also beaten popular names on Base like Uniswap and PancakeSwap. Aerodrome Finance token also jumped as the number of its token holders soared. Dune Analytics data shows that there are now 629,954 AERO token holders, a big increase from 200,000 in January.

It has moved above the 50-day and 200-day weighted moving averages, a sign that bulls are slowly prevailing. AERO has formed an ascending triangle pattern whose upper side is at $0.7786, which coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. The Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have pointed upwards. Therefore, a clear breakout above this resistance will point to more gains, potentially to the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $1.3058, about 78% above the current level.

In line with the bullish price predictions is a fresh outlook from a market expert focused on alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins.

In a post shared on X, the analyst informs his 6,000 followers that a handful of altcoins outperform Bitcoin. As such, the market could soon witness a massive price rally within the broader altcoin market. “An Altcoin Season is happening right now! Altcoin Seasons can unfold within hours, days, or weeks — and we can’t afford to miss these opportunities.” He wrote. As displayed in the altcoin and Bitcoin index chart shared by the market expert, many altcoins appear to be trading at a higher volume than Bitcoin this June. More specifically, 47 of 56 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 900 minutes. The trend signals renewed interest in the altcoin market, suggesting a price rally might be closer than expected. However, the analyst maintains that the bears have not fully exited the market as market volatility is expected to continue. “Take advantage of it [the altcoin season], because the coming days will bring high volatility and great opportunities.” He added. XRP and Ether bulls remain wide awake despite heightened volatility Most altcoins within the top 50 category are trading in red at report time. However, leading altcoin Ether and XRP appear to have successfully retained gains from the previous week. Ether and XRP have emerged as the highest gainers, with 7-day gains of 2.62% and 3.85%, respectively.

The investors allege that O’Neal misled them by appearing in ads for the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange. The payout is about $1 million more than the $750,000 O’Neal was reportedly paid for his role in an FTX commercial. The former basketball star was among several celebrities, including Tom Brady and Larry David, who were sued for promoting the exchange before its collapse in late 2022. O’Neal has maintained that he was simply a paid actor in the ad, saying after the exchange’s collapse he was “just a paid spokesperson for a commercial.” If the settlement is approved, O’Neal will be released from all future claims tied to the lawsuit. He will not be allowed to seek reimbursement from the FTX bankruptcy estate and will not have to admit any wrongdoing, according to the CNBC report. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of FTX users who deposited funds between May 2019 and late 2022, before the company’s dramatic failure. FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and investors. His sentence could be cut by over four years.",Markets|FTX|Lawsuit|Shaquille O'Neal|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-14 15:33:05

In May, the Crypto timing model by Weiss Crypto Ratings, a cryptocurrency tracking and analysis platform, outlined a bullish outlook for the asset. A week later, the asset hit a new ATH with a price value of $111,886. This time, the model is painting yet another bullish case scenario for the cryptocurrency market. As seen on its official page on Twitter, now known as X, Weiss shared that its model forecasts an incoming trend pattern expected to occur in the last quarter of the year. The Crypto timing model points to November as when the market is most likely to experience a 4-year-cycle high. According to our Crypto Timing Model, we’ll likely see the 4-year-cycle high in November. — Weiss Crypto (@WeissCrypto) June 9, 2025 Is the 4-year market cycle still valid? For starters, Crypto has followed a 4-year pattern—a market movement pattern driven by the Bitcoin halving event. The trend typically ushers the market into periods of major losses and gains. As experienced during the 4-year cycle, an accumulation phase precedes a bear market, and a bullish phase follows right after. The 2011-2013 market cycle launched the trend, which has been observed for over a decade. Although experts claim that the presence of institutional investors has disrupted the cycle, it remains to be seen how Bitcoin and the broader market perform in the months ahead. Meanwhile, the big bull is trading at $103,091 at report time. The global crypto market correction brought a notable price pump recorded by a handful of top cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Bitcoin bulls appear to be making a much-needed recovery, as daily gains briefly surged, sending Bitcoin to an intraday high of $107,000 on June 9. Glassnode describes the price jump as a move “likely fuelled by a wave of short liquidations,” adding that the negative funding rates from the previous week point to an increase in short appetite, resulting in today’s short squeeze.",Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 15:36:51

According to crypto analyst Xoom, a key resistance level on the XRP/BTC chart, dubbed the “red zone,” could soon give way. If that happens, XRP is expected to “rip to the upside,” marking a decisive shift in momentum after months of stagnation. Xoom’s latest insight, shared on X, highlights this crucial area that has consistently rejected XRP’s past attempts to break higher. Yet, this time, the setup looks different. With volume building and Bitcoin dominance showing early signs of cooling off, many believe XRP’s long-awaited surge relative to Bitcoin may be approaching. The Red Zone Xoom’s analysis zeroes in on a range on the XRP/BTC chart that typically lies between 0.000012 and 0.000015 BTC. This level has historically served as a strong resistance barrier, halting upward movement and sparking selloffs. However, every time XRP has managed to break through it, notably in 2017, 2021, and briefly in 2023, the result was a fast, powerful rally. Once XRP breaks through the red zone on XRP/BTC… it rips to the upside. pic.twitter.com/iuMTBDM3HJ — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) June 14, 2025 The term “red zone” reflects not just the technical ceiling, but also the psychological weight this region carries for traders. Each failed attempt to push through has made the zone even more significant, and now, XRP is once again pressing up against it. According to Xoom, once this barrier is breached, there may be little standing in the way of a major upside move. XRP/BTC: Why It Matters While many focus on XRP’s price in U.S. dollars, the XRP/BTC pair often provides a clearer picture of its strength in the broader crypto market. A breakout here would signal that XRP is outperforming Bitcoin, something that historically attracts fresh capital from traders rotating out of BTC and into high-utility altcoins. A decisive break above the red zone would likely trigger increased trading volume, bullish momentum, and renewed institutional interest. It would also mark the end of XRP’s extended underperformance relative to Bitcoin, a trend that has weighed on investor confidence in recent months. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Momentum Meets Macro Catalysts A fundamental factor is that the drawn-out legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may soon come to a close. The parties have already refiled for settlement following Judge Torres’ procedural rejection of the first filing. A finalized resolution could act as a major catalyst, lifting legal uncertainty that has long suppressed XRP’s price action. Taken together, XRP’s improving fundamentals and the tightening XRP/BTC structure set the stage for a potential breakout. For Xoom and many others, the message is clear: once XRP breaks through this red zone, the move won’t be gradual. It will be swift, sharp, and likely to catch the market off guard. After months of pressure, XRP may finally be ready to explode . And if it does, as Xoom warns, it won’t just edge upward, it will rip.

Previously, individuals selling up to R$35,000 (around $6,300) worth of crypto per month were exempt from taxation.

The tax will apply regardless of where the assets are held, including in overseas exchanges or self-custodial wallets.

From the explosive rise of SPX6900 (SPX) to the cheeky yet potent Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) , Solana’s meme ecosystem is thriving in both market sentiment and developer momentum. But while Solana-native tokens are stealing much of the spotlight, a deeper dive into the broader crypto landscape reveals an Ethereum-based outlier shaking up the crypto landscape— Neo Pepe ($NEOP) —a token that has been quietly building a formidable following under the radar. This article explores the Top Meme Coins on Solana right now and spotlights the emerging presale that’s becoming impossible to ignore. 5 Solana Meme Tokens Blowing Up Right Now Solana’s low fees and rapid settlement have made it fertile ground for meme coin experimentation. This month, a few standout contenders have seized community attention: SPX6900 (SPX) SPX is a market parody coin gaining serious traction among trader circles. Designed to mock equity index mania, it’s been surprisingly stable despite meme volatility. It thrives on Twitter narratives and chart humor. Official Trump (TRUMP) Political memecoins are surging in a U.S. election year. TRUMP on Solana mixes humor, controversy, and surprising technical stability. Its price doubled in May and is up another 40% in early June. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Yes, it’s real. Backed by nothing but gas and social virality, FARTCOIN is the quintessential “degen” play. Its liquidity is growing, and community efforts to build tools and “flatulence-based staking” (yes, really) are ongoing. dogwifhat (WIF) The mainstay Solana memecoin continues to build brand value and has recently teased a bridge to Arbitrum. Popcat (POPCAT) With a pixel-art aesthetic and high meme factor, POPCAT has found utility through a click-based web game, bringing a layer of fun utility few Solana tokens match. These coins highlight Solana’s incredible velocity in memecoin launches and its ability to host fun, fast-moving projects. But where Ethereum’s higher gas fees might dissuade memecoins, Neo Pepe Protocol embraces them for an entirely different reason—governance and permanence. Presale Set to Shock Crypto’s Stagnant System While Solana meme tokens build momentum off hype and speed, Neo Pepe Coin is deploying a different strategy—long-term infrastructure and Decentralized Power . It’s not simply another meme—it’s a Symbolic Messaging tool that represents rebellion against centralized crypto manipulation and rigid protocol control. Here are a few standout elements of the Top Crypto Presale right now: 1. Tiered 16-Stage Presale Structure Neo Pepe’s presale isn’t a free-for-all. It’s a Progressive, Capped Stage System , where each tier increases the token price as demand climbs. Early entrants benefit from lower costs and are rewarded for long-term conviction. The first stage started at just over 5 cents; the final caps at $0.162690, aiming for a full $50M raise. 2. Auto-Liquidity Mechanism with Burned LP Every buy or sell incurs a 2.5% transaction fee that feeds directly into liquidity on Uniswap. But here’s the twist— LP tokens are burned . Permanently. That means each transaction reinforces price stability and reduces circulating supply, a rarity in meme coin design. 3. Fully On-Chain Governance Model Through the NEOPGovernor contract, any holder with 1 million $NEOP can propose changes. Proposals undergo a 1-day review, followed by a 7-day vote and a 48-hour timelock to allow community scrutiny. No central team can override results. 4. Unique Meme Philosophy Neo Pepe isn’t about jokes—it’s serious symbolism. Dubbed the Memetrix , it presents a visual and thematic metaphor for financial independence. Every token purchase becomes a statement of protest against centralization, echoing broader DeFi themes. The meme, here, carries meaning. What Sets Neo Pepe Apart From Every Other Presale Let’s break down what separates Neo Pepe from the flood of presale tokens and high-speed Solana launches: True Community Ownership No dev wallets. No override switches. Governance is coded into the protocol’s core from the first block. Transparent Tokenomics Of the 1 billion total supply, 45% is for presale, 25% for marketing, 10% each for liquidity and development, and 5% each for giveaways and ecosystem growth. Strategic Roadmap From its Awakening in Q2 2025 through Ascension and Evolution , Neo Pepe’s milestones aren’t arbitrary—they are community-governed. Upcoming events include CEX listings, platform testing, and global partnership pushes. Built for Serious Players While tokens like BONK and MOG attract temporary traders, Neo Pepe attracts ideologically-aligned crypto users—those who see memecoins as more than speculative plays. Even now, visitors digging through the best presale dashboards will find a wealth of resources, live token allocations, DAO integration tools, and immediate access to join the uprising. Verdict on Solana Hype vs. Neo Pepe’s Vision While Solana’s meme coin scene continues to innovate with ultra-fast launches and niche community humor, Neo Pepe ($NEOP) is leading an entirely different category of growth: symbolic utility tied to governance and sustainability . The meme is the mask—it hides an engine of decentralized finance rigor, on-chain treasury control, and real community participation. For those looking to jump into a fast growing memecoin with a Governance Model that actually works, Neo Pepe isn’t just a gamble—it’s a movement. Solana will continue to foster creative chaos, and tokens like TRUMP and SPX6900 are essential players in that wild ecosystem. But Ethereum-based Neo Pepe is carving a slower, deliberate, more architected path. One not driven by hype alone—but by design.

Bitcoin led the way lower, dropping to $103,556 — its worst one-day performance in June—while Ethereum, Solana, and the rest of the majors lagged behind in a bout of compelled selling. Where the Pain Was Worst: Exchange Breakdown Binance was hit hardest in the carnage, with $458 million in liquidations — over 91% of longs. Bybit wasn't too far behind, at $375 million worth of liquidations, close to 94% of longs. OKX and Gate each lost over $125 million, with HTX, Coinex, BitMEX, and Bitfinex finishing off the list with dozens of millions more. These were mostly losses from speculators who were betting on a continued rally — only to be surprised by the sudden geopolitical and macroeconomic storm. Bitcoin lost $446 million in long liquidations alone, with Ethereum losing $303 million. Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP all experienced tens of millions of forced sells, demonstrating just how widespread and severe the pain was across the market. Why Leveraged Longs Are Still High — and Vulnerable Despite repeated warnings, the leverage hunger has not abated. BTC and ETH funding rates have remained positive, which means the traders continue to be strongly speculating on the higher side — even as volatilities have risen. This ongoing optimism provided the context for a traditional liquidation cascade: when prices fell, stop-losses and margin calls triggered a domino effect, which fueled the sell-off and closed out more positions at each major support. How Liquidation Cascades Shape the Market With so many traders on one side of the ship, a little shake will send the market into chaos. The numbers indicate that the first $20 million in liquidations arrived within an hour after the breaking news, but as selling snowballed out of control, nearly $1 billion was lost in just 12 hours. This feedback mechanism — where all liquidation induces further selling — is why crypto corrections are so brutal and why heatmap tools are now an indispensable tool for risk management. “If BTC drops to $92K, bulls could lose $8B more. Watch the heatmap.” — @CoinGlass, June 13, 2025 Heatmaps not only show where the pain was — they show where it is likely to be next. According to recent data, if BTC dips to $92,500, over $8.4 billion of long positions would be liquidated, which would be a critical ”pain point” for bulls. A breakout higher towards $121,900 would short-squeeze, which could unleash a short squeeze of nearly $14 billion. Hedging Ahead of the FOMC: What Traders Can Do Now Since the Federal Reserve's FOMC sits on June 18, volatility has hardly ceased. Historically, FOMC announcement days are marked by sharp spikes in crypto market volatility since rate decisions and forward guidance are reacted to by traders. Many individuals are now reducing exposure, contracting stops, or buying put options to hedge against further downside. Institutional desks are seeing increasing demand for downside protection, with traders targeting deep out-of-the-money puts as insurance against another liquidation cascade. The broader macro environment — rising inflation, geopolitical tension, and uncertainty regarding the Fed's policy — makes risk management more critical than ever before. Traders need to watch the funding rates, heatmaps, and the all-important support levels, and stay alert for the sentiment shifts as the Fed announcement approaches. The Bottom Line The $1.16 billion liquidation event is a testament to the dangers of a highly levered, sentiment-driven market. As war news and inflation reads collide with packed derivatives bets, only the ones that manage risk and watch the heatmaps will make it through the next leg. With the FOMC lined up, expect more fireworks—and remember: in crypto, the only thing certain is volatility.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-14 15:51:24

Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at $2,530 at last check on Saturday, inside the narrow range where it has remained since May 10. This price is about 85% above its lowest level in April this year. Data shows that American investors are aggressively accumulating Ethereum. SoSoValue numbers show that spot Ethereum ETFs have had inflows in the past five consecutive weeks. These funds added $528 million in inflows this week, a big increase from last week’s $281 million. This increase brings the cumulative net inflow to $3.85 billion and the total amount held by these funds to over $10 billion. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF has had $5.23 billion in inflows and now holds $4.1 billion in assets. Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH ETFs hold $2.8 billion and $1.3 billion in assets, while Fidelity’s $1.3 billion in inflows. You might also like: Dow Jones lower by 1.79%,markets rattled as Israel-Iran conflict escalates A likely reason for the ETH accumulation is that it became undervalued as its price plunged in April. The closely-watched market value to realized value or MVRV dropped to minus 0.86 on April 9. A falling MVRV indicator signals that an asset is highly undervalued because it compares the current market cap and the realized value, which is the price at which each coin was last moved and aggregated across supply. Ethereum also maintains a big market share in key crypto industries. It has a total value locked of $134 billion and a market dominance of 62%. It also has a stablecoin dominance of 50%, with its total holdings rising to $125 billion. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Ethereum price has formed a bullish flag pattern. This pattern comprises a vertical line, which represents the flag pole. It also has a flag, which can be a horizontal or a descending channel. It is now in the flag section. ETH price has formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages crossed each other. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where it bounces back, and possibly retests the psychological point at $3,000. A move above $3,000 will boost the possibility of it soaring to $4,000 eventually.

Coins trading under $0.10 are being snapped up fast as traders position themselves for the next big cryptocurrency breakout, with hopes of landing a 20x return before July. Among them, PEPE, the viral memecoin, continues to ride high on community hype and speculative volume. But the real buzz is surrounding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi token priced at just $0.03 that’s already making waves in underground crypto circles. The official presale of Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5, with MUTM priced at just $0.03, rapidly approaching the Phase 6 price of $0.035. That’s after already soaring 200% since launch. With the token set to go live at $0.06, early buyers are locking in a guaranteed 2x ROI. For investors chasing high-reward plays, these top summer altcoins are shaping up to be more than just a seasonal trend. PEPE Primed for Meme Coin Comeback This Summer PEPE is currently trading around $0.000013, down from its May high of $0.000016, but still commanding significant interest in the meme coin market. After forming a classic “double-bottom” bounce, analysts predict that a breakout above $0.000014 could spark a move toward $0.000030. With social sentiment riding the greed zone and whale wallets holding strong, PEPE is earning its place among the top tokens this summer. As excitement builds and FOMO creeps in, attention is also shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for those chasing even more explosive returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Mania: $10.5M Already In, Are You Missing Out? Mutuum Finance is exploding in popularity, and it’s not hard to see why. With its innovative two-way lending model, this DeFi powerhouse has already attracted over 12,000 investors and raised $10.5 million, and it’s not slowing down. The MUTM token price is set to jump to $0.035 in Phase 6, marking a 16.67% surge, meaning those who get in now are positioned for major gains. Early adopters are locking in profits. Certik-Approved and DeFi-Ready: Mutuum’s Lending Revolution Is Here Mutuum combines both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, giving users reliable returns from USDT pools via the P2C model and full control of direct crypto transactions via the P2P model. Certik has also audited Mutuum’s open-source smart contracts. That’s a huge green flag for investors, especially those looking for stability. The Next Big Stablecoin? Mutuum’s USD-Backed Token Could Be a Game-Changer Mutuum Finance is riding the DeFi wave it’s building its own. Their upcoming overcollateralized USD-backed stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, is designed to maintain price stability and avoid the pitfalls of algorithmic stablecoins. With the infrastructure already audited and certified, Mutuum is laying the groundwork for massive adoption, and those paying attention now could reap the biggest rewards later. In addition, the platform is running a massive $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. As cryptos under $0.10 heat up, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as more than hype, it’s a real DeFi coin. With $10.5M raised, 12,000+ investors, and a presale price of $0.03 ahead of a $0.06 launch, early buyers are securing a 100% ROI before summer even starts. Backed by a Certik audit, dual lending models, and an upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin, MUTM offers serious upside potential. Don’t miss the chance to 20x, join the presale now.

46010122,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=771666,1749916812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46010122.jpeg,Why Bitcoin Price Continues To Rise Despite Soaring Treasury Yields  — Analyst,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/why-bitcoin-price-continues-to-rise-despite-soaring-yields/,"Over the past few weeks, the Bitcoin price has maintained a somewhat healthy momentum, forging minor swing highs and lows in its bull run revival. Interestingly, this early-week upward movement has been corrected following the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. All in all, the overall positive outlook for the premier cryptocurrency has remained, even though it has been observed to be against historical perspective. An on-chain analyst on social media platform X has delved into this strange phenomenon in the BTC market and the possible reasons behind it. Bitcoin’s Historical Correlations With Macro Instruments In a recent post on the X platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost broke down what, until recently, used to be conventional expectations in the Bitcoin market relative to broader macroeconomics. The crypto pundit mentioned that investors consider key indicators when trying to decipher what institutional sentiments and the broader state of global liquidity may be like. Related Reading: Solana Approaches Critical Support Amid Middle East Conflicts – Can Demand Hold? The key indicators investors highlighted in this analysis include the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US dollar against a basket of major foreign currencies, and the US Treasury Yields, which basically represent the return investors earn on United States government bonds. According to Darkfost, the above chart illustrates a well-known macro principle: when both the DXY and bond yields are on the rise, capital tends to flee risk assets (one of which is Bitcoin). As a result, the premier cryptocurrency becomes susceptible to corrective movements. According to the on-chain analyst, this principle is backed by historical trends, as bear markets in crypto have coincided with strong uptrends in both yields and the DXY. On the other hand, when there is a loss of momentum in DXY and yields, investor appetite tends to shift towards risk. The reason for this, Darkfost explained, could be expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, which fuel bullish sentiment across crypto markets. BTC Breaks Conventional Macro Logic In the post on X, Darkfost then went on to point out that the current BTC cycle has been unusual. The online pundit reported that there has been a decoupling between the Bitcoin price and bond yields, which manifests as a seeming annulment of the usual macro principles. The analyst noted that the Bitcoin price continues to maintain its upward movement, despite yields reaching some of their highest levels in Bitcoin’s history. But this holds, he was sure to note, when the DXY declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Most Reliable Signal Just Flashed—Next Stop: $170,000 What this anomaly suggests, Darkfost inferred, is that Bitcoin has taken on a new role within the macro landscape, one that increases its perception as a store of value. To take it further, this means that BTC, as of now, may react a little less conventionally to the macro forces believed to influence the crypto market. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price sits just beneath $106,000, reflecting an almost 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum (ETH) showed signs of rising, only to fall back quickly, catching many buyers off guard. Hyperliquid (HYPE), a new player in derivatives, gained 12% as interest grew in its approach to decentralized futures trading. Amid all the movement, BlockDAG (BDAG) is getting the most attention. It has raised $299.6 million so far, sold 22.4 billion coins, and is now priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29. Backed by real progress, BlockDAG is proving it’s more than just a trending name. It’s moving forward with strong results, useful products, and a clear strategy that makes it a top performing crypto ahead of Ethereum and HYPE when it comes to long-term strength. Ethereum’s Bull Trap Shakes Market Confidence Ethereum recently appeared ready for a breakout, rising past a key point near $2,700. But according to BitcoinSensus, this jump was short-lived and became a bull trap. Many new buyers entered long positions before the price dropped again, slipping back below important support. This reversal slowed Ethereum’s momentum and raised questions about price manipulation by major players. Right now, Ethereum may keep trading in a wide range unless it holds firmly above $3,000. Ethereum remains a leader in DeFi and Layer-2 solutions, but the recent price action has left some watchers unsure. Its strong background is still there, yet the constant swings continue to shake confidence among those hoping for stable growth in the short term. HYPE Climbs 12% on Real Platform Activity Hyperliquid (HYPE) is catching more eyes after its recent 12% rise. This growth follows new excitement about its role in trading perpetual futures on-chain, directly challenging big platforms like Binance and Bybit. Unlike coins that rise only on rumors, HYPE’s increase is tied to real activity. More users are joining the platform and using its smooth, easy-to-use setup for making leveraged trades. For many, HYPE represents the next stage in DeFi tools, faster, more open, and built around real use. Still, as a mid-tier name, HYPE faces tough competition. It has shown promise, but long-term growth depends on proving its strength in a busy market. BlockDAG Surges Past $299.6M With Real Growth, Users, and Results BlockDAG is gaining traction as one of the strongest crypto projects of 2025. It has raised $299.6 million and sold 22.4 billion coins. The project is now in Batch 29, where each coin is priced at $0.0276. Early participants from Batch 1 have already seen returns of 2,660%. One reason for this strong rise is BlockDAG’s focus on product over promises. The X1 mining app is already live and being used by over 1.5 million users. This app works on smartphones and allows people to mine BDAG coins without needing expensive or technical gear. This simple setup has helped bring in users at an early stage, something not often seen during presales. BlockDAG also uses a clear and planned structure for its presale. With 45 total pricing rounds, the system is easy to follow. Each stage shows consistent growth in both price and community activity. This approach gives people a better understanding of where the project is headed and adds to overall trust. With large-scale adoption already in motion, strong fundraising, and 1.5 million users actively mining, BlockDAG is clearly more than just an early-stage idea. Its working product, growing numbers, and steady planning have positioned it as a top performing crypto. While many projects are still trying to build their first tools, BlockDAG is already running and reaching new heights every day. Final Thoughts In a space filled with noise, swings, and wild guesses, the projects that show steady progress are beginning to shine. Ethereum’s false breakout showed how quickly hope can fade. HYPE’s 12% rise shows there is room for new names, but questions still remain about long-term value. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is rising on real data. It has raised almost $300 million, onboarded over 1.5 million users, and built a live product people are already using. With the current price at $0.0276 in Batch 29, momentum is building. This project offers a strong mix of working results, steady growth, and a clear plan. That makes it one of the top performing crypto projects today.

These firms are announcing plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP. However, many have weak financial positions and extremely low market values. According to Sigel, these announcements are not genuine business strategies but appear to be efforts to boost stock prices through misleading information. VanEck Exec Spotlight Crypto Treasury Anomaly Several companies with market capitalizations under $100 million have made bold claims about buying large amounts of digital currencies. Some of these companies have promised to invest between $300 million and $800 million in crypto, even though their total value is much lower. These claims have sparked doubts among analysts and investors. Sigel highlighted Trident Digital Tech as an example. Recently, the company, valued at just $16 million, announced plans to raise $500 million to acquire XRP . The gap between its value and stated goal has caused many to question whether the announcement is possible. Sigel Likened Crypto Treasuries Plans To a Pump and Dump Scheme The VanEck Executive points out several warning signs. Most companies making these bold claims have no known track record in the crypto industry. They usually lack the funding needed to carry out such large investments. In many cases, these announcements come when the crypto market is rising. Segel suggests they are timed to take advantage of investor excitement. He warned that these patterns match the behavior seen in pump-and-dump schemes. President Trump was accused of this tactic in January. In this scheme, insiders push up stock prices with exaggerated news and then sell their shares for a profit. This leaves regular investors with overvalued stock and heavy losses. A Broader Industry Trend The problem is not limited to one or two companies. Addentax Group, a Chinese clothing company worth only a few million dollars, said it plans to buy $800 million worth of Bitcoin and TRUMP tokens. Likewise, DeFi Development Corp announced it would sell $5 billion in shares to purchase Solana . After the announcement, its market cap jumped from $7 million to $379 million, demonstrating how such statements can instantly influence investor behavior. Other companies, including Classover Holdings and Webus International, have made similar promises. Each claimed it would raise hundreds of millions to buy digital assets despite their total value of less than $100 million. Industry analysts are warning investors not to take such announcements at face value. Investors are advised to examine the company’s financial reports and ability to raise funds before making any investment decisions.

Buyers are now aiming for a push above immediate Fib levels; however, sellers are strongly defending further surges. The 24-hour volume dropped to $1.8 million, showing a decline in interest in trading activity today. Manta is trading at $0.214, surging by over 5.8% in the last 24 hours.

Manta/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA lines The 4-hour Manta price chart suggests MANTA continues to face bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart.

MANTA price chart The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near support levels and boost an upward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening bearish positions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.261, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.321. MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.194, resulting in a correction to $0.159. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.22. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.2. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus. He talked about the incident in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday, describing how he came very close to being caught but managed to avoid it just in time. MANTA price prediction June 2025 If the altcoin market witnesses a surge in buying pressure this month, we might see a rebound in the MANTA price. In June, we expect Manta’s price to record a minimum of $0.17 and a maximum of $0.37. The average price is expected to be around $0.25.

Its speed, low fees, and meme coin activity have made it a favorite during the latest bull cycle. But with SOL already sitting above $170 and many calling it “fairly valued,” some investors are now asking: what’s next? If you’re looking for high-upside opportunities beyond Solana, June is offering plenty of bullish setups. Here are five must-buy cryptos this month, all primed for potential growth. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Coin Momentum Meets Real Tech Little Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t just riding the meme coin wave; it’s the wave. As the first meme coin to launch with its own Layer‑2 blockchain, Little Pepe is setting itself apart with a foundation built for scalability, speed, and security. As of June, it’s doing more than just launching tech; it’s also lighting up crypto Twitter, Telegram, and presale trackers. In under 48 hours, LILPEPE has already: Sold over 215 million tokens out of 500 million allocated for presale Raised more than $215,000, showing early community conviction Ranked high on top presale trackers, outperforming many rivals Attracted coverage from influencers who were early to DOGE and SHIB But what’s pushing momentum to fever pitch is its social media firestorm. Telegram channels have surged with presale chatter, Twitter mentions are rising sharply, and several YouTubers are calling it “the next $PEPE with actual infrastructure.” Unlike DOGE or SHIB, which added utility much later, LILPEPE is launching with core infrastructure: Sniper-bot protection is baked in at the protocol level Ultra-fast, near-zero gas transactions Pepe’s Pump Pad: A meme launchpad enabling fair, secure token launches with locked liquidity and anti-rug mechanisms 0% tax on trades, making it friendly for volume-driven meme traders Its tokenomics also signal a long-term growth model, with 26.5% of supply allocated to presale buyers, 13.5% for staking, and 30% reserved to power its Layer-2 ecosystem. LILPEPE aims to recreate Shiba Inu’s energy—but this time, with a chain, a roadmap, and a clear use case from the outset. Many believe it could indeed be the real heir of the OG PEPE, surpassing it with SHIB-like momentum. With influencers already picking it up and social sentiment turning bullish, this might be the best time to get in early before centralized exchange listings go live and the crowd follows. Chainlink (LINK): Ready for a Major Breakout Currently trading around $15, LINK is forming a bullish pennant, which is often a sign of a potential breakout. Experts like Crypto Avi and Bitcoin Buffalo predict price targets between $30 and $36, forecasting 100–190% gains. Big players like Visa are already testing real-world use cases with Chainlink’s tech, proving it’s more than just hype. As Bitcoin dominance cools, altcoins like LINK are ready to shine. If momentum holds, a breakout could come fast. Dogecoin (DOGE): Classic Meme Coin With New Momentum Dogecoin is heating up again, and June 2025 is its breakout month. Currently trading around $0.20, DOGE has seen a surge in momentum thanks to Elon Musk’s recent comments and rising whale activity. Technical indicators suggest a potential breakout if the price flips key resistance around $0.23. If that happens, targets like $0.40 or even $0.77 aren’t far-fetched. With traders eyeing the $2.28 Fibonacci level, Dogecoin’s meme-powered magic may just be getting started. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN): Solana Meme Token With a Coinbase Catalyst Fartcoin will officially land on Coinbase on June 12, and it’s already turning heads. Running on the Solana network, this meme coin pumped 16% after the listing announcement; clearly, interest is growing fast. Market-wise, Fartcoin has just broken out of a falling wedge pattern, a bullish setup hinting at further upside. If it holds support around $1.05, it could aim for $1.33 next. With Solana gaining traction and meme coins still hot, Fartcoin might be the underdog winner of June 2025. Hyperliquid (HYPE): The Most Watched L1 Right Now Hyperliquid (HYPE) has been on a tear. After hitting a new all-time high of $43.82, the token is closing in on a $14 billion market cap and has even surpassed Sui in the rankings. Whales are pouring in. One address recently acquired over $9.9M worth of HYPE. With $248 billion in May trading volume and a growing DeFi ecosystem, this Layer-1 is challenging even Solana’s dominance. Technical analysts are now eyeing $50 as the next key resistance level, with Fibonacci projections as high as $77 or $103 if momentum holds. Final Thoughts June is shaping up to be a breakout month—not just for the majors like Solana, but for altcoins with real fundamentals, fresh narratives, and momentum to match. Whether you’re in it for meme coin madness or utility-driven projects, there’s a lot to be excited about. But among them all, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is carving out a category of its own—bringing structure to the chaos of meme markets. With its Layer 2 vision, sniper-proof launchpad, and fast-selling presale, LILPEPE might just be the most promising new cryptocurrency of the month. Ready to get in early?

Three major transfers from one wallet contributed most of the 537 million SHIB burned. Weekly Shiba Inu token burns reached 687 million, marking a 481% increase from the prior week. Shiba Inu (SHIB) ‘s burn activity has shown no signs of slowing down, as the community has burned over 537 billion tokens in the last 24 hours. According to on-chain data the daily SHIB burn rate has spiked by 3,484%.

The Treasury’s June 3rd and June 10th buybacks , which are historic in size, allow the agency to repurchase securities maturing between May and July of this year. The move has triggered social media speculation that a stealth quantitative easing operation is now underway, with the Treasury mimicking the Federal Reserve’s money-printing tactics to stimulate the economy. Skeptics argue that by repurchasing illiquid bonds with borrowed funds, the Treasury is subtly propping up the bond market to maintain confidence in an overextended system. But Bianco Research’s Jim Bianco says claims that the Treasury’s moves are a form of quiet QE are way off the mark. “Everyone is calling Treasury buybacks “stealth QE.” They misunderstand. This is the Treasury, not the Fed… The Treasury cannot “print.” The Treasury borrows new more liquid “on-the-run” bonds and uses the proceeds to buyback old illiquid “off-the-run” bonds. Buybacks do not “create money,” rather they improve the overall quality of the bond market. Buybacks support the bond market in that they make it more liquid so it reduces the (lack of) liquidity premium. But that’s only a few basis points.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently touted the agency’s “big toolkit” to support the bond market if needed, citing buybacks as a strategic option to enhance liquidity and stabilize conditions.

As market sentiment starts to shift, three altcoins in particular—PYTH, Solana, and Injective—are drawing increased attention from savvy insiders. These projects combine real-world utility, innovative infrastructure, and early-cycle positioning that could translate into outsized gains in the next bull run. Here's why smart money is rotating into these under-the-radar plays. PYTH: A Promising Star Amidst Market Turbulence Source: tradingview PYTH is gaining attention as a decentralized oracle network, connecting real-world data to blockchain applications. With the recent market dump, some coins are set to rise, and PYTH seems to be a strong contender. Drawing parallels to 2021, many altcoins performed exceptionally well after a dip, and PYTH might follow suit. It provides fast and reliable data, which is crucial for smart contracts. As more blockchain apps grow, demand for accurate data feeds like PYTH will likely surge. In the current cycle, PYTH’s innovative technology and utility make it an attractive option for those seeking opportunities in the altcoin season. Exploring the Potential of Solana Source: tradingview Solana is an exciting crypto project catching eyes again. It’s known for super-fast transaction speeds and low costs. Created as an answer to Ethereum’s scalability issues, Solana can handle more transactions per second. Many developers love building projects on it because it’s efficient. As we've seen before, similar strong tech foundations can really pop during bull seasons. Solana's current lower price might be a bargain for investors. With the next altcoin season predicted by many crypto enthusiasts, Solana could be a shining star. It’s worth keeping an eye on what this promising coin can do in the upcoming market cycle. INJ: A Rising Star Ready to Shine in the Next Altcoin Season |Source: tradingview Injective Protocol (INJ) is catching eyes as a key player in this crypto cycle. It's not just another coin; it's a platform designed for fast and low-cost trading. Unlike others, it aims for full decentralization, allowing traders to customize and create any market they imagine. The flexibility and speed it offers make it a standout. In a season where altcoins can thrive, INJ looks especially appealing. The repeat patterns of 2021 suggest another altcoin run could be in the cards, and INJ's innovative tech positions it well to ride that wave. Its potential for growth in a bullish market makes it an attractive option to watch. Conclusion Ethereum remains a foundational asset, but in this phase of the market cycle, hidden gems like PYTH, Solana, and Injective are where the real growth stories may unfold. From decentralized data feeds to lightning-fast L1 performance and customizable trading platforms, these tokens are tapping into core crypto narratives with long-term potential. As smart money continues to diversify beyond the majors, these three projects stand out as serious contenders for the next breakout wave. The whales are buying ETH—but the forward-looking investors are loading up on what comes next. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The billionaire hedge fund manager said that after Donald Trump signed a new executive order supporting US aerospace, the idea of flying aircraft for cities suddenly “sort of became real.” Jason is now the top shareholder of Vertical Aerospace, a struggling British company that wants to launch an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft—called the VX4—by 2028. The VX4 is designed to carry six people and fly up to 100 miles on a battery, which the company says could get someone from Manhattan to the Hamptons in under an hour. Jason took control of the firm late last year after forcing out founder Stephen Fitzpatrick and converting $130 million of debt into equity. The company had crashed to just $82 million in value after its post-SPAC price collapse. “Vertical wouldn’t be here if he hadn’t come up with the idea,” Jason said . “But at the end of the day, what the company needs now are not skills that he possesses.” Jason saw potential after saying no to Vertical’s equity pitch Jason’s involvement started in 2021. After walking away from meme stock profits that brought in around $250 million, he wanted to refocus his fund on its roots: lending to distressed businesses. But after a quiet pitch from Vertical’s chairman, Dómhnal Slattery, Jason passed on buying equity. He wasn’t interested. Weeks later, Slattery returned with another offer: what about debt? That’s what got Jason moving. He had just been through online drama from Reddit traders after profiting from AMC and GameStop trades. People vandalized his firm’s Wikipedia page with insults. He ignored the noise and looked into flying taxis. The logic was simple—global cities are overcrowded, tunneling is expensive, and road expansions are almost impossible. As Jason put it, “You’ve got to go up.” Vertical was already far behind its US competitors. While companies like Archer, Beta Technologies, and Joby Aviation were pulling in investors like Amazon, Toyota, United Airlines, and Delta, Vertical was still raising money to survive. It secured $90 million in January but is going to need more soon. CEO Stuart Simpson confirmed the firm needs multiple new fundraising rounds to complete the $1 billion certification process for VX4. Joby wants to operate its own flying taxi service. Archer shared flight plans for New York and Los Angeles, and Beta already flew passengers in test flights while building 50 charging stations across 22 states. Meanwhile, Joby is working to launch a service in Dubai this year. Together, they’ve raised $1.4 billion in the last 12 months. Jason’s firm is playing catch-up. Vertical’s plan is to sell the aircraft, not operate them Vertical doesn’t want to be an Uber-in-the-sky. Jason’s model is to sell aircraft the way Airbus and Boeing do. Each sale then locks in contracts for servicing and battery replacements every year. That’s where the long-term money is. Simpson told Wall Street Journal that if all goes well, they’ll start delivering aircraft in 2028, assuming they meet strict European safety rules. Jason’s rivals say they’ll start flying passengers in the US in 2025 or 2026, but he called that “too optimistic.” He believes the VX4 will come a bit later but could stand out by being the only one to meet EU certification. Still, that’s not enough to guarantee success. “This is one of those bets that you make, and if it works, it’s one you’ll talk about for the next 20 years,” Jason told WSJ.

The Brazilian government, which currently presides over the alliance, announced on Friday that Vietnam would join BRICS as a “partner country.” Partner countries, a category the bloc established last year, aren’t full-fledged members but are invited to participate in the BRICS summit and can endorse the alliance’s declarations. Vietnam is the 10th partner country, joining Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda and Uzbekistan. BRICS held its initial summit in 2009 was originally just called BRIC, which stood for its four founding members: Brazil, Russia, India and China. The acronym changed to BRICS after South Africa joined the following year. In 2024, it expanded membership to other nations, including Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates, and Indonesia joined in early 2025. Brazil also claims that Saudi Arabia is part of the bloc, but the Middle Eastern country has reportedly eschewed formal membership in the intercontinental economic alliance to avoid antagonizing the US. Brazil says current BRICS priorities include “facilitating economic transactions between bloc countries, such as the use of local currencies; the development of international payment platforms; cooperation in government procurement; and the promotion of trade facilitation measures, among others.” In 2023, the alliance reportedly began working on creating a common currency backed by gold and potentially additional precious metals and assets to circumvent reliance on the US dollar, though officials from several of the bloc’s member countries claimed in early 2025 that they weren’t pushing for de-dollarization.

The selection timing comes as the broader cryptocurrency market stabilizes following recent sell-offs sparked by escalating tensions in the Middle East. According to the AI model, these picks are backed by strong fundamentals and engaged communities that could help drive their long-term price growth. Cardano (ADA) Cardano ( ADA ), trading at approximately $0.62, has long stood out for its academic rigor and methodical development. ADA seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Known for its peer-reviewed approach and careful rollout, the blockchain has steadily built a robust and expanding ecosystem without the volatility typically tied to hype-driven tokens. ChatGPT noted that if ADA can break above $0.70 with strong volume, the token could be on track to revisit the $1.50 to $1.80 range in Q3. Despite its slow and steady progress, the AI pointed out that Cardano still appears undervalued compared to other layer-1 networks like Ethereum ( ETH ), especially as its real-world use cases grow, notably in Africa, where it’s being used for digital identity and education initiatives. XRP XRP was ChatGPT’s second pick, praised for its resilience amid regulatory scrutiny. Once bogged down in a high-profile lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP has since regained credibility and investor confidence after a court ruling found the asset was not a security. However, legal proceedings are ongoing, with both sides pursuing a settlement . Currently trading at $2.13, XRP remains one of the most widely used cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments.

The AI model believes a move to $5 is realistic in the short to mid-term and even sees long-term targets in the $7 and $8 range if utility-driven demand continues to grow. Asked how to split a hypothetical $1,000 investment , ChatGPT suggested allocating $600 to Cardano, citing its higher growth potential, and $400 to XRP due to its strong institutional ties and improving legal position.

Ruvi AI’s (RUVI) Ongoing Audit Offers a Path to Steady Growth and Massive Profit To Early Investors in 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tired-of-shibs-volatility-ruvi-ais-ruvi-ongoing-audit-offers-a-path-to-steady-growth-and-massive-profit-to-early-investors-in-2025/,"For investors frustrated with the wild price swings of meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ruvi AI (RUVI) presents a stable and promising alternative. With an ongoing audit by Cyberscope and projections of massive profits for early adopters, Ruvi AI is carving out a compelling niche in the evolving cryptocurrency market for 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Story of High Volatility Shiba Inu entered the cryptocurrency scene as a community-driven meme coin and quickly gained a massive following. Inspired by the success of Dogecoin, SHIB provided an accessible and inexpensive entry point for speculative investors. Its massive price rallies captured headlines and spurred enthusiastic trading activity credited to viral campaigns and online communities. However, SHIB’s speculative nature and lack of foundational utility have led to erratic price swings. The extreme volatility has made it a high-risk choice for cautious investors. While some traders profited significantly, those left holding through downturns have endured steep losses. This instability has investors seeking projects with stronger fundamentals and stable long-term prospects like Ruvi AI. Cyberscope Audit Establishes Credibility One key factor distinguishing Ruvi AI from speculative projects like Shiba Inu is its commitment to transparency. Ruvi AI is undergoing a Cyberscope audit, a rigorous evaluation conducted by a trusted blockchain security firm. This audit ensures the integrity of Ruvi AI’s system, including its smart contracts and platform security. This emphasis on trust aligns Ruvi AI with the expectations of today’s investors, who prioritize transparency and reliability over risk. By proactively addressing these concerns, Ruvi AI positions itself as a credible and secure investment opportunity. Presale Success Fuels Investor Confidence Ruvi AI’s presale launch has been an outstanding success, marking it as a rising star in the crypto space. Phase 1, priced at $0.010 per token, sold out within just two weeks. Early investors pocketed a 50% return as Phase 2 launched at $0.015. To date, Ruvi AI has raised $1.7 million and amassed over 1,600 holders. Momentum is further bolstered by Ruvi AI’s first exchange listing and a strategic partnership with a reputable trading platform, which enhances liquidity and market reach. With additional updates and milestones expected soon, Ruvi AI continues to build excitement among investors. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Building the Future with Blockchain and AI Ruvi AI disrupts the industry by combining blockchain technology with advanced artificial intelligence. This decentralized superapp empowers users to generate AI-driven content, including text, video, audio, and images. By targeting industries like marketing, automation, and creative production, Ruvi AI delivers solutions with practical, real-world applications. At the core of the platform is the $RUVI token, which enables seamless transactions, staking rewards, governance participation, and premium feature access. This utility-focused approach sets Ruvi AI apart from speculative coins, cementing its potential to transform industries and drive steady growth. Lucrative Investment Scenarios for Early Participants Ruvi AI’s structured presale tiers offer substantial bonuses and remarkable ROI possibilities. Here’s a snapshot of projected returns based on investments at the $0.015 presale price, a $0.07 listing price, and a $1 token valuation post-listing: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI ($750 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $4,900 (553% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI ($1,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $11,200 (647% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI ($7,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $70,000 (833% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $1,000,000 (13,233% ROI). These scenarios illustrate why Ruvi AI offers one of the most exciting opportunities for early investors. The Final Word For those weary of the volatility that characterizes meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ruvi AI presents a viable alternative focused on stability and growth.

Bittensor (TAO) has been steadily rising, fueled by interest in its decentralized AI reward system. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) signals renewed retail excitement with rising wallet numbers and strong technical signs. Both projects attract attention, but one is preparing for something bigger. BlockDAG (BDAG) is not just riding presale hype; it’s aiming for lasting brand impact. Its growing reputation as a top crypto to watch is supported by a potential US-based sponsorship deal. This major partnership could raise BlockDAG’s profile far beyond charts and exchange listings. While hype can be short-lived, real-world recognition lasts. If this deal goes through, BlockDAG could secure a long-term leadership role by offering utility, exposure, and momentum well beyond launch. Bittensor (TAO) Shows AI-Driven Strength Bittensor’s (TAO) price has held steady, moving between $395 and $405 since June 9, bouncing about 5% from resistance near $387–$390. Daily volume stays strong at $140 million to $142 million, showing solid market interest. Technical indicators point up: TAO has moved above its 20, 50, and 100 EMAs on short-term charts, signaling renewed buying. ACD crossovers and an RSI near 70 show momentum gaining, though short pauses near $407–$414 are possible. Looking forward, TAO could climb toward $450–$475 if it stays above the breakout zone near $397. Analysts note its work with AI subnet integrations, steady daily volume above $100 million, and a 0.89 correlation with the top 10 crypto market moves. This means if the market does well, TAO likely will too. Holding above $387–$390 is key to keeping this positive trend alive. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Sees Wallet Growth Despite Whale Exit Shiba Inu’s on-chain data reveals some shifts in price action. Large whale transfers over $100K fell by 91.5%, dropping from 24.3 trillion SHIB on June 5 to 2.06 trillion on June 9. Despite fewer large trades, SHIB’s price rose from $0.0000129 to $0.0000134, a 4.6% gain that broke through the 100-day SMA. This volume surge during resistance testing suggests growing retail support. SHIB’s community is also expanding. Wallets holding SHIB hit a record 1,511,101—around 0.011% of the world population, according to ZyCrypto. On Shibarium, daily transactions jumped 7,154%, leaping from 63,820 to 4.63 million in just five days. This surge in layer-2 activity adds fuel to retail-driven price moves. BlockDAG’s US Sponsorship Set to Break New Ground BlockDAG’s rumored US sponsorship deal could shift the project’s course significantly. The partnership aims to make BDAG a household name in mainstream culture. National branding and broadcast exposure could put BlockDAG front and center before it even lists on major exchanges. This is a smart play for lasting impact in a space where many fade quickly after presales. This kind of visibility does more than boost prices; it builds trust. For those wondering which crypto stands out now, few compare to what BlockDAG offers. This is more than marketing—it’s proof of credibility. Aligning with top sports partners means BDAG plays in a different league, focused on sustainable market leadership. Timing is crucial. BDAG is in Batch 29, priced at $0.0276. More than $303 million has been raised, with over 22.6 billion coins sold. This price offers one of the best market entry points before aiming for a $0.05 listing. That could deliver a 2,660% return, but this window is closing fast. Add to this BlockDAG’s 2 million active users on its X1 app, a CertiK audit, EVM compatibility, and viral features like Buyer Battles, and it’s clear why BDAG appears on many best crypto lists. It’s no longer just a presale; with growing brand trust and engagement, BlockDAG looks set to lead the next market cycle from day one. Final Thoughts Bittensor (TAO) holds firm above $300 with strong bullish signals. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) gains momentum as whale activity slows and wallet numbers grow. Both show rising interest, but the real standout might be BlockDAG. With its upcoming US sponsorship, popular X1 app, and ongoing presale, BlockDAG is building brand strength few can match. Its $0.0276 price offers a rare early entry before the planned $0.05 listing. This is more than hype; it’s a clear strategy. By timing global visibility with affordable pricing, BDAG aims for lasting traction well beyond launch. For those watching the best crypto right now, BlockDAG blends brand readiness, user activity, and growth potential into a top contender today.

From meme magic to DeFi innovation, these projects are drawing both whales and retail degens into what could be one of the hottest alt seasons in years. However, while all four have strengths, one is stealing the spotlight as the Dogecoin killer. It boasts 87x upside potential, and it’s still in presale. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Dogecoin Killer With 87x Potential While Dogecoin still holds cultural relevance, its upside is limited. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is here to finish what DOGE started—only smarter, faster, and with real blockchain utility. It’s not just a meme coin. It’s the first Layer 2 chain built specifically for meme coins, optimized for speed, zero gas, and anti-sniper bot trading. Pepe's Pump Pad is at the center of its utility, a meme Launchpad baked directly into the LILPEPE chain. Projects launched here are liquidity-locked and rug-proof by design, providing instant access to a meme-native community. The LILPEPE chain introduces infrastructure for the next wave of viral crypto tokens. Investors are buying in early. The Stage 1 presale is now live, with over $200,000 raised to date. At the current price of $0.0015, buyers are locking in a low cost. Once Stage 1 sells out, the price jumps to $0.0025, with top CEX listings already secured and the team teasing a future listing on the world's largest exchange. Momentum is building fast. What sets LILPEPE apart is its serious upside. With a low market cap and massive narrative strength, analysts estimate an 87x price surge, which would see the project enter the top 100 or top 50 alongside DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. That kind of return doesn’t just beat the old Dogecoin. It buries it. Hyperliquid (HYPE): The DEX That’s Outperforming Centralized Giants Hyperliquid ($HYPE) is making waves as the go-to decentralized exchange for power traders. With a market capitalization of over $14.4 billion and record-breaking perpetual volume, the protocol is quickly becoming a serious challenger to the dominance of centralized exchanges (CEX). It’s one of the few DeFi platforms seeing daily volume growth as whales and influencers pile in. One of those influencers is Andrew Tate, who recently posted 25x leveraged ETH and BTC longs via Hyperliquid. This move sparked a significant pump and drew global attention to the protocol. Open interest surged to $1.68 billion, while daily trading volume jumped 147% in just one day. The token also set a new all-time high above $43, with experts projecting a year-end price of $150. Hyperliquid Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Adding fuel to the fire, Binance.US has teased a potential listing of $HYPE . If it lands, it could drive another wave of inflows from retail traders. As DeFi gains more mainstream attention this summer, Hyperliquid is a clear breakout candidate. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN): A Meme With $2 Ambitions and Real Market Moves Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) may have started as a joke, but it’s backed by serious momentum. After a whale invested $2 million in the token, FARTCOIN recently spiked to above $1.40, breaking out from a bullish wedge pattern. Now, technical indicators like the golden cross and shark harmonic formation suggest the next leg up could reach $2+, a 60% gain from current levels. Fartcoin Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Perpetual futures trading has also exploded. Coinbase confirmed that it will list FARTCOIN futures starting June 12, driving open interest to a record $713 million. This kind of volume places FARTCOIN in the same speculative tier as top meme coins, such as PEPE and FLOKI. While there is still volatility, with some whales trimming their bags, the roadmap, exchange support, and social buzz suggest that FARTCOIN has more potential, mainly if a spot listing follows. Cardano (ADA): The Old Giant Poised for a Massive Breakout Cardano ($ADA) might not be new, but it’s far from done. With fresh momentum building, analysts point to a potential 666% rally as ADA targets $5.35, based on Fibonacci extensions and bullish market sentiment. The token trades near $0.67 and shows signs of a breakout past $0.77 resistance. Cardano Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Recent listings on Bitstamp through Robinhood have brought ADA back into the U.S. spotlight, countering past regulatory headwinds. On-chain signals indicate growing buying pressure, with the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) turning positive —a historically reliable bull signal for ADA. With a highly active developer community and increasing institutional interest, Cardano is still one of the most fundamentally sound altcoins in the space. If its price momentum continues into July, it could surprise even long-time holders. Summer 2025 Buy Plan: One Token Leads the Charge And It’s Not DOGE If you plan to maximize your crypto investment this summer, watch Little Pepe, Hyperliquid, Fartcoin, and Cardano. While all four tokens are worth watching this summer, only one is positioned to deliver actual early-mover gains: Little Pepe ($LILPEPE). It’s not just riding meme hype. It’s building the infrastructure for the next meme coin bull run, with built-in utility, sniper bot defense, and a chain designed for speed and scalability. With Stage 1 of the presale live, over $200,000 already raised, and top CEX listings on the horizon, LILPEPE is quickly proving that it's not just a Dogecoin killer—it’s the future of meme cryptocurrency. Buy early at littlepepe.com and secure your spot before the price jumps in Stage 2. This frog’s not just hopping. It’s coming for the throne.

While it may sound like a dream, history has shown that the right altcoins at the right time can deliver life-changing returns. As the market sets up for another explosive cycle, five standout cryptocurrencies—each with unique technology and growing momentum—are catching the eyes of forward-thinking investors. From AI-driven networks to Ethereum challengers, these projects may hold the keys to outsized gains in the years ahead. Here's a look at the coins that could transform portfolios—and lives—by 2026. Solana: A Promising Star in the Altcoin Season Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is a fast-growing blockchain known for its high-speed and low-cost transactions. It uses a unique system called Proof of History to process thousands of transactions per second. Even though the market recently faced a dip, history hints at exciting times ahead like in 2021. Solana's technology aims to make it a strong competitor for Ethereum, especially in the field of decentralized apps and NFT platforms. With continuous upgrades and a solid community, Solana stands as an attractive option in this current market cycle for those seeking growth opportunities in altcoins. Keep an eye on SOL as it could shine brightly amidst the potential altcoin season. ENA Coin's Bright Future: Seize the Moment in this Bullish Market Source: tradingview ENA is a promising altcoin making waves in the crypto world. It focuses on fast and secure transactions, which appeals to many users. The coin is built on a robust blockchain that offers innovative features. As the market shows patterns similar to the bullish runs of 2021, ENA stands out with its strong fundamentals. Its growing community and development team are actively working on new updates. In this current market cycle, ENA looks attractive due to its advanced technology and potential for growth. This could be the perfect time to hop on the ENA train before it picks up more speed. NEAR Could Shine Bright in Upcoming Altcoin Season Source: tradingview NEAR Protocol is a promising crypto with unique tech features. It's a platform that aims to make decentralized apps more user-friendly and scalable. NEAR uses a sharding technology, which allows it to process transactions quickly and at low cost. In the recent market dip, NEAR showed resilience, thanks to its strong community and innovative approach. It could be an attractive choice as altcoins often rally after Bitcoin stabilizes. With its focus on developer support and easy integration, NEAR might just be ready to rise as the next big player in the altcoin season. Keep an eye on this coin as the market prepares for a potential bull run. FET: Ready to Soar in the Next Altcoin Season? Source: tradingview Fetch.ai (FET) is a gem in the crypto world. It uses AI to connect and support smart economies. This coin helps systems to automate tasks without human input. Imagine a world where apps work smarter and devices communicate seamlessly. That's the power of FET. As the market prepares for an altcoin season, FET stands out with its unique tech. Its focus on AI-driven solutions can make it a strong player. With 2021-like patterns emerging, FET's potential shines brightly. In the current cycle, it looks like an attractive investment. POLKADOT: Shaping a Promising Future Amid Market Volatility Source: tradingview Polkadot (DOT) is a rising star in the crypto world, aiming to create a connected blockchain ecosystem. By allowing different blockchains to communicate and share information, it makes the decentralized world more unified and efficient. The technology behind Polkadot is seen as innovative, as it supports seamless upgrades without hard forks and fosters open collaborations. In this market phase, DOT looks like a promising option. It could play a key role in the next altcoin season by offering advanced features that many other coins don't. With patterns echoing the trends of 2021, Polkadot holds the potential for significant growth as the market recovers. Conclusion While no investment is without risk, Solana, ENA, NEAR, FET, and Polkadot are more than just hype—they're foundational plays in the next phase of crypto innovation. With strong tech, real-world utility, and growing ecosystems, these five coins could be perfectly positioned to ride the next altcoin wave. For those bold enough to act early and hold through the noise, a $1000 bet today could become something extraordinary by 2026.

With just $100, picking the right plays now could mean the difference between small returns and a portfolio-altering moonshot. Among the contenders, three tokens stand out for their mix of community energy, upcoming catalysts, and explosive growth potential: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , SUI, and Jupiter (JUP). Each brings a unique advantage, but one of them — still trading under $1 — already shows signs of momentum that could leave even Solana in its wake. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Primed to Crush Expectations If you had $100 and had to bet it all on one crypto with moon potential, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the one that could change your life. Currently selling at just $0.001, LILPEPE isn’t just another meme token — it’s building the world’s first Layer 2 blockchain for meme coins. That’s right: an entire ecosystem designed only for meme tokens, complete with its own meme launchpad and sniper bot protection. Within 24 hours of launching its presale on June 10, 2025, LILPEPE raised over $200,000, a blistering pace for a new entrant. Backed by a team of anonymous crypto veterans — some of whom have helped build major meme coins already in the top 100 — this project isn’t just about fun. It’s about creating a meme-first infrastructure that solves real-world problems like gas fees, sniping bots, and token creation hurdles. LILPEPE’s upcoming listings on two major centralized exchanges, combined with plans for a debut on the world’s largest exchange, are already stirring up buzz. Once it hits the open market, many believe the price could rally to $0.25 or even higher by year’s end — that’s a potential gain of more than 16,000% from current levels. While Solana is above $160 and still struggles with intermittent congestion, LILPEPE’s future Layer 2 promises lightning-speed, low-cost, bot-proof transactions. It’s not a stretch to think this new chain could start pulling developer and trader activity away from Solana and toward its meme-centric universe. Sui (SUI): Next-Generation Blockchain With a $11.9 billion market valuation and trading at $3.49, SUI has increased by 65% over the past year, following an 800% rise in 2024, from $0.50 to $4.50. Partnerships with Circle for USDC integration and a $1.2 billion DeFi TVL underscore its growth. Long-term optimism is partly driven by Sui's expanding ecosystem and ability to enable enterprise-grade dApps. It's not far-fetched to think of a climb near $7 as additional initiatives begin on the Sui network and user engagement rises, especially when the DeFi and GameFi stories gain momentum. Driven by dApp and gaming usage, analysts project SUI reaching $7. Jupiter (JUP): Solana’s DeFi Powerhouse Leading swap aggregator Solana's Jupiter (JUP) enhances DeFi liquidity by leveraging technologies such as perpetual trading, dollar-cost averaging, and limit orders. JUP, trading at $0.5, has climbed 9.05% in 24 hours; a Chaikin Money Flow increase indicates increased buying power. Plans for token burning, buybacks, and Jupiter's part in Solana's $4.77 billion TVL ecosystem inspire hope. Analysts expect JUP to achieve $3 by mid-2025 if Solana's ETF clearance generates DeFi activity. Jupiter’s close linkage to Solana’s ecosystem means it gains most from an ETF-driven SOL rise, but its growth is constrained compared to LILPEPE. Conclusion: Small Capital, Big Dreams If you're entering the market with $100 and want maximum impact, it’s about smart positioning, not just brand names. SUI provides a solid foundation in a rising Layer 1. JUP puts you at the centre of Solana’s DeFi movement. But Little Pepe (LILPEPE) offers something entirely different: a chance to get in on the ground floor of the next meme coin phenomenon before the crowd. As history has shown with DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE, meme coins can go from obscurity to billion-dollar valuations seemingly overnight. And with LILPEPE already attracting major attention, the window for early entry is closing fast. You can still grab tokens directly from littlepepe.com during the presale phase — but by the time the market wakes up, this one may already be out of reach. So if you’re asking where to put your $100 in crypto this month, the answer might just be hiding in plain sight — with a smiling frog and a whole lot of momentum.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose to $105,300, up by 2.4% from its lowest point on Friday, and 5% above this month’s lowest point. SoSoValue data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $301 million on Friday, even as Bitcoin’s price dropped to nearly $100,000. This pushed total weekly ETF inflows to $1.3 billion—a sharp reversal from the previous week’s $128 million in outflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF, whose ticker symbol is IBIT, had daily inflows of $238 million on Friday, bringing its cumulative figure to $49.7 billion. It now has $70 billion in assets, making it the fastest-growing ETF in finance. You might also like: AVAX price down 9.75% on geopolitical tensions, but technicals saw it coming The SPDR Gold Trust, which was launched in 2004, has accumulated $103 billion in assets. This means that IBIT may flip the biggest gold ETF in the next few months or in 2026 if the trend continues. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF has had over $11 billion in inflows, while Bitwise’s BITB has had $2 billion since inception. A possible reason why Wall Street investors bought Bitcoin’s dip is that it maintains strong fundamentals. BlackRock’s data shows that Bitcoin beats the stock market after a major geopolitical event such as the Iran and Israel attacks . Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has plunged from 1.5 million in January to 1.1 million today. Falling Bitcoin supplies at a time of falling supplies will likely boost the price in the long term. Bitcoin price long-term chart point to a multi-year breakout BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The monthly chart indicates a strong Bitcoin price breakout in the near term. This chart shows that Bitcoin formed a rounded bottom between Dec. 17 and March 2021. Since November 2021, Bitcoin has been forming another rounded bottom. The price remains slightly below the ascending trendline connecting the upper side of these rounded bottoms. Therefore, the coin may be about to exit an eight-year trendline, which could push it much higher in the long term.

Today, it is a serious consideration for professionals, households, and full-time traders seeking alternatives to conventional investments like equities or real estate. For those not inclined to navigate highly volatile markets such as forex or wait years for traditional assets to yield returns, digital currencies offer faster entry points, flexible strategies, and increasingly practical utility. As June 2025 unfolds, new frontrunners are commanding attention—not simply through speculation but through measurable community growth, robust technological infrastructures, and steady capital inflows. A few key names are separating themselves from the noise by delivering on their promises and aligning with long-term market needs. Among them, Qubetics , Bitcoin Cash, and Arbitrum have positioned themselves as leading options for those evaluating the best crypto to invest in June 2025. These projects combine purpose, performance, and user-focused innovation. Let’s explore what makes each of them worth a closer look. Qubetics ($TICS) – Best Cryptos to Invest In With Real Interoperability Power Interoperability has long stood as one of blockchain’s most persistent bottlenecks—chains operating in isolation, each with its own token standards, logic, and access constraints. This fragmentation limits the broader utility of Web3, leaving developers, businesses, and users scrambling between ecosystems. Qubetics is tackling this issue head-on by positioning itself as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, effectively eliminating the invisible barriers that separate chains. With its innovative infrastructure, Qubetics unites disparate networks into a singular, efficient interface. Whether it’s a creator launching NFTs on Solana, a DeFi strategist accessing liquidity pools across Ethereum and Polkadot, or a global company deploying multi-chain smart contracts for supply management, Qubetics creates a universal, low-friction gateway for all. Participants can execute tasks, access data, or transfer assets seamlessly without needing multiple wallets or bridges. It is this pragmatic, forward-thinking solution that places Qubetics among the best cryptos to buy for June 2025 heading into 2025. Supporting this powerful narrative is a high-impact, time-sensitive entry opportunity. Qubetics is currently in Stage 37—its final presale phase, offering tokens at a fixed price of $0.3370. Over $18 million has been raised, more than 515 million tokens have been sold, and a thriving community of over 27,900 holders has already formed. Only 10 million tokens remain before the sale closes, and with a confirmed listing price of $0.40, participants at this stage are positioned for an instant 20% return. For those acting now, the Qubetics presale represents a final window before price appreciation becomes market-driven. Notably, early projections show a 197% ROI if $TICS reaches $1, and up to 4,350% ROI at $15—numbers grounded in the token’s reduced supply, community-led distribution, and high-utility design. As both a technological aggregator and a scarcity-backed asset, Qubetics stands tall among the best cryptos to invest in for those looking to capture meaningful upside. Anyone seeking to secure their place in what many analysts consider the best crypto presale of 2025 would do well to act before the last tokens disappear. Bitcoin Cash: Built for Payments, Held for Potential Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has always been that straightforward cousin of Bitcoin—more agile and designed specifically for transactions. Where BTC is sometimes seen as digital gold, BCH is often pegged as digital cash. It’s this practicality that’s kept it relevant in discussions about the best cryptos to buy for June 2025. The crypto community respects BCH for its low transaction fees and faster processing times. It’s found strong adoption among small businesses and peer-to-peer traders who want a reliable payment system without the wild fee spikes. With thousands of active nodes and an expanding ecosystem of wallets and merchant tools, BCH has become a go-to asset for those who believe in the decentralized peer-to-peer cash vision. Arbitrum: Scaling Ethereum with Serious Backing Arbitrum, one of Ethereum’s leading Layer 2 solutions, has carved out a strong reputation by making Ethereum more scalable and affordable. If you’ve been frustrated by Ethereum gas fees and sluggish transaction times, Arbitrum probably caught your attention. The protocol has attracted major dApps, DeFi projects, and developer communities that see the benefit of its optimistic rollup tech. As more apps migrate to or integrate Arbitrum, buyers continue to treat ARB as a foundational Layer 2 asset. For those looking to diversify away from Layer 1 exposure while staying in Ethereum’s orbit, Arbitrum stands tall as one of the best cryptos to buy for June 2025. Conclusion: Which Crypto Stands Out for June 2025? Each of these three—Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Arbitrum—brings something different to the table. BCH offers simplicity and stability. Arbitrum delivers scalability and speed. But Qubetics, with its eye on interoperability and impressive crypto presale momentum, is catching serious attention. $TICS isn’t just some future potential story—it’s already crossing stages, hitting price targets, and engaging a growing army of backers. If it lands at $10 or $15 post-launch, the returns could be monumental. The team’s commitment to cross-chain accessibility isn’t just theoretical—it’s already being built, supported, and used. So if you’re asking yourself which are the best cryptos to buy for June 2025 , Qubetics should be circling the top of your list. This isn’t the time to sit on the fence. Head over to the presale, grab your share, and watch what happens when interoperability goes mainstream. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics one of the best cryptos to buy for June 2025? Qubetics is tackling interoperability, solving a core Web3 issue. With over $17.9 million raised and a growing token holder base, its fundamentals are strong. Is Qubetics currently in a crypto presale? Yes, Qubetics is in Stage 37 of its crypto presale at $0.3370. Over 515 million tokens have already been sold, with more than 27,800 holders onboard. How does Bitcoin Cash compare to newer projects like Qubetics? While Bitcoin Cash is solid for peer-to-peer transactions, it doesn’t offer the multi-chain capabilities Qubetics brings. Qubetics aims to integrate various blockchains into a seamless Web3 experience.

BRETT, or Based Brett, is a meme cryptocurrency launched in February 2024 on the Base blockchain, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Inspired by the character Brett from Matt Furie’s “Boys’ Club” comic series, BRETT aims to engage users through humor and community interaction. It has quickly gained popularity, boasting a market cap exceeding $1 billion and a total supply of 10 billion tokens, with a fixed supply ensuring scarcity. BRETT operates on a renounced contract, meaning the creator cannot alter its supply or functionalities, which fosters a decentralized governance model driven by community engagement. The token does not impose transaction fees, making it attractive for trading and long-term holding. Its cultural significance and partnerships in decentralized finance enhance its utility and value in the crypto space.

The price has sharply dropped to $0.04300, trading below the middle Bollinger Band ($0.05590) and approaching the lower band near $0.04127, indicating a strong downtrend. The RSI at 38.78 reflects weakening momentum and hovers close to oversold territory, which could prompt short-term consolidation or a minor bounce. However, unless the price reclaims the mid-Bollinger region and RSI crosses above 50, bearish dominance remains intact. A breakdown below $0.04127 may accelerate losses toward deeper support zones. The trend remains bearish unless key technical levels are reclaimed with volume. BRETT/USD 4-hour chart BRETT/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of BRETT/USDT, the asset is currently experiencing bearish momentum. Price is trading below the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.0496) and hovers close to the lower band ($0.0389), indicating selling pressure. RSI is at 36.40 with a descending trend, reflecting weak buying interest and proximity to oversold territory. Despite a minor bounce from the lower band, there is no strong confirmation of reversal. Unless BRETT reclaims the mid-band level, it risks consolidating at lower levels or breaking down further. If support at $0.0389 fails, the next drop could extend toward $0.0350 or below in the near term.

Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, BRETT is showing consistent bearish momentum. The asset is trading below the mid-Bollinger Bands on both timeframes, with price hovering near the lower bands—around $0.0389 on the 4-hour and $0.0412 on the daily. RSI values remain weak, at 36.40 and 38.78 respectively, indicating fading buyer strength and possible oversold conditions. While a brief consolidation or bounce may occur, the overall trend suggests continued downside risk. A decisive break below current support zones could lead to further declines toward $0.0350 or lower. Recovery is unlikely unless price reclaims the mid-band resistance levels. Is BRETT a good investment? BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends. Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis’s critical prediction, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT’s near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future? BRETT is projected to reach between $0.70 by 2027 and $0.2 by 2030, depending on market conditions and the adoption of the Base network. Its growth is expected to be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory developments.

The conflict saw investors flee risk assets and led to more than $700 million in liquidations in the crypto market in just 24 hours, according to CoinGlass . BNB, however, managed to maintain a narrow trading range of just over 1%, resisting a broader altcoin pullback. BNB, after the sell-off, failed to break above $660, its immediate resistance level according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, and has since been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern. Despite the setback, the coin has stayed above key support at $640, a zone aligned with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Trading volume analysis suggests sellers dominate near $655.5, while a buyer base forms around $649, the model shows. Technicals signal a mixed picture. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) turned negative, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits just under 50, hinting at fading momentum. Yet the 50/200-day moving averages are nearing a golden cross, and the Chaikin Money Flow indicator remains positive, a setup that has historically preceded upward reversals, according to the model. But sentiment around BNB isn’t all bullish. Net Taker Volume, a gauge of aggressive sell pressure, hit a multi-week low of -$197 million. Meanwhile, even as Binance Smart Chain’s perpetual trading volume rose exponentially month-over-month, this activity doesn’t appear to have sparked new demand for BNB.

Ripple’s (XRP) institutional interest keeps it relevant, and DOGE seems poised for modest moves in the short term. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining traction thanks to its innovative lending ecosystem and early-stage presale buzz. Currently trading at $0.03 in its presale’s Phase 5, MUTM has raised over $10.6 million, passed a CertiK audit, and is projected for an explosive rally. Many now see MUTM as the most promising cheap crypto to buy now and a realistic contender for 2025’s next millionaire-maker. XRP Holds Steady Around $2.25, Waiting for the Next Catalyst Ripple’s XRP remains firmly anchored around $2.25, with fluctuations between $2.24 and $2.33 and trading volumes signaling strong investor interest. The token has formed a solid support base near $2.28, while resistance at roughly $2.31 has repeatedly limited further upside, a classic neutral setup that may precede a breakout. Fundamental developments continue to bolster the outlook. Meanwhile, emerging tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are quietly gaining attention at the lower end of the market for those seeking next big crypto potential. Mutuum Finance Enters Phase 5 of Presale as Investor Interest Surges Mutuum Finance is gathering real momentum as it enters Phase 5 of its presale. As a new project, the platform is a potent competitor in the DeFi sector that provides an inflation-resistant and scalable alternative to meme coins focused on speculation. The interest of investors is also building up, and the project has already gathered more than 10.6 million dollars, and over 12 000 people hold the tokens. At this stage, the price of one MUTM is $0.03, and the official launch price will be doubled to $0.06, providing those who decide to support us at this stage, with a substantial chance of earning in the short term and an opportunity to grow in the long term. DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance offers an innovative non-custodial liquidity protocol allowing people to have full ownership of their assets when engaging in decentralized lending. The platform is developed on the basis of the dual lending model featuring Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer systems. The Peer-to-Contract structure operates under the control of smart contracts that smoothly vary interest rates in real-time according to the activity in the market. This brings about stability in the automated process to both the lenders and the borrowers. The Peer-to-Peer model on the other hand allows users to completely sideline intermediaries and instead allow borrowers and lenders to get in touch with each other. It is especially useful to people who transact with volatile assets like meme coins. Combined, those systems introduce a flexible and user-friendly experience of DeFi lending that is more controllable and secure than its centralized counterpart. CertiK Audit and Mutuum Finance Stablecoin Beyond its lending innovation Mutuum Finance also has intentions to launch a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The stablecoin offered by Mutuum will be capable of maintaining a stable condition even in a turbulent market as opposed to the situation being experienced with the algorithmic stablecoins. It consists of open-source smart contracts and has already undergone a rigorous audit by CertiK one of the most reliable brands in the sphere of blockchain security. Such an audit not only confirms the security of the infrastructure of the platform but also strengthens the overall transparency approach of Mutuum Finance, as well as its safety and reliability from the long-term perspective of the DeFi ecosystem. Mutuum Finance has raised $10.6M+ at 0.03 by 12,000+ investors. The launch price will be 0.06 and this offers 100% gains. Supported by CertiK audit, actual DeFi utility, and a USD-pegged stablecoin, the project has a strong potential to succeed.

To help you find the right coins, this list of coins will prove useful. It is especially so with the altcoin season looming. Already, Bitcoin (BTC) has begun to show signs of a new resurgence, nearly retracing its May all-time high. One thing to keep in mind is that crypto investments are time sensitive, and opportunities appear almost as fast as they fade. One of the best strategies for success is to invest in new altcoins that show signs of being the next big winner in the crypto sector. That will mean targeting projects that are in the presale phase, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which analysts forecast could rise 3,456% when it goes live. Let us dig deeper into your best crypto coins to buy this summer. DOGE DOGE recently experienced a massive slump after Trump and Musk entered into an online tiff. However, Musk recently issued a public apology to Trump, which sent the price of DOGE roaring once again. Just a few hours after Musk tweeted his apology, the price of DOGE was up by double digits. That has cemented the firm correlation between Musk and the price of DOGE. His influence on its price became even more pronounced after he was appointed as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, the recent price movements point to DOGE being an unreliable source of long-term gains. Its erratic price movements based on the tweets of Musk make it so that plotting a plan for massive profits is difficult. A better option is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), whose growth will be based purely on market dynamics, making it a better prospect. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM), unlike the DOGE meme coin, is a token built for utility. Its protocol design provides a lasting avenue for lenders to earn passive income. When lenders deposit their assets in a pool on the protocol, they also receive mtTokens. These mtTokens can be used on any secondary exchange that accepts the ERC-20 token standard. Consequently, holders can earn passive income while still having full access to crypto market opportunities in real time. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team plans to establish pools that pair with mtTokens on DEX such as Uniswap. This will ease pressure on internal liquidity, while providing excellent avenues for the holders to earn from existing market opportunities. The mtTokens are also a convenient means by which holders can actively track their earnings in the Mutuum Finance protocol. This is because they represent both the initial deposit and interest accrued over time. This system enhances the user experience since holders of the mtTokens no longer have to actively claim or compound their gains. The mtToken system enhances transparency and allows non-custodial ownership of assets. Presale Enjoys Massive Success Because of its revolutionary design, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a massive success. Over $10.6 million has been raised in the presale to date from around 12,000 unique buyers. The presale is in phase 5, where each token is going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will increase by 16.67%. Additionally, Mutuum Finance is running a $100,000 giveaway in which ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. To qualify for this massive giveaway, you only need to contribute a minimum of $50 in the ongoing presale. Analysts forecast that the price of MUTM tokens could rise by 3,456%. As such, if you bought $500 worth of tokens at the current price of $0.03 each, you stand to grow your investment to $17,280, not bad for a relatively new crypto project. Binance Coin (BNB) BNB is the native token of the Binance exchange and can be used to pay fees and other services. Since its launch in 2017, its value has increased over 5000x. While investors in June 2025 cannot reasonably expect to get such gains, it could still be worth looking at. Bottom Line June 2025 has turned out to be an exciting time for the crypto industry. The top of the market is roaring again, which means it is time to look for new promising projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for massive rewards. While it might be tempting to look at leading coins and be dazzled by the large size of each coin, keep in mind that crypto is fractional, and you will only get what you pay for. For instance, if the price of BTC rises from $100K to $150K, your return on a $100 investment would only be $50. The same investment in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be worth nearly $4,000 based on recent analysts’ forecasts. Make the wise choice this summer, secure your MUTM tokens while the opportunity is still available.

According to Glassnode , XRP’s 30-day percentage change in realized cap—a metric that measures the total value of coins moved at their last price—has jumped +4.2%. Solana has only seen +1% growth over the same period. $XRP is pulling ahead again. Its 30D % change in Realized Cap just hit +4.2%, outpacing $SOL modest +1%. Capital is rotating faster into #XRP , hinting at stronger short-term conviction: https://t.co/cOSVts1PMm pic.twitter.com/W0eub7oGTe — glassnode (@glassnode) June 13, 2025 This divergence means capital is rotating into XRP faster than Solana, implying short-term accumulation by traders who are positioning for a breakout. Realized cap is especially useful during times of uncertainty, as it shows wealth that has actually moved on-chain rather than speculative market value. A higher realized cap growth often correlates with more network activity and investor confidence. For context: XRP 30D Realized Cap: +4.2% SOL 30D Realized Cap: +1% The big jump in XRP’s realized capital could be seen as a sign of shifting sentiment among retail and institutional traders alike, possibly ahead of regulatory clarity or broader crypto market momentum. XRP Technical Analysis Says Be Cautious Despite the on-chain strength, XRP’s chart is still cautionary. It’s trading at $2.13, down 0.70% in the last 24 hours and stuck below a descending trendline that has rejected every bullish attempt since early June. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Price action failed to reclaim the 50-period EMA on the 2-hour chart (now at $2.19), and XRP has printed a lower high. Red-bodied candles with rejection wicks at $2.18 show continued resistance. The MACD has a slight bullish crossover, but the histogram is fading, so not much momentum for now. Key Technical Levels: Resistance: $2.18, $2.22 Support: $2.09, $2.0474, $2.0042 EMA Barrier: 50-EMA at $2.19 XRP price prediction remains bearish unless XRP breaks above the descending trendline and confirms strength above $2.22; traders may continue to see downside pressure. XRP Trade Setups to Watch As XRP consolidates under resistance, traders have clearly defined levels to monitor for both bullish and bearish strategies. Short Trade Idea: Entry: Rejection near $2.18 Stop: Above $2.22 Targets: $2.0936, $2.0474 Long Trade Setup: Entry: Breakout and close above $2.22 Stop: Below $2.18 Targets: $2.27, $2.3365 For now, the fundamentals suggest investor interest is heating up, but price must follow through with a clean breakout to confirm the next leg higher. Until then, XRP remains at a technical crossroads. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,141,005.09 out of its $8,216,177 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply.

Notably, analysts remain broadly optimistic about XRP’s long-term outlook, pointing to historical trends, current price movements, and key resistance levels as strong indicators backing this bold prediction. XRP Price Eyes $1.5 Trillion Market Cap And 27% Dominance Despite still experiencing strong consolidation, the XRP price is reportedly on track to capture 27% of the total crypto market dominance and reach a $1.5 trillion market cap. This projection by a prominent market analyst, Egrag Crypto on X (formerly Twitter), has sparked discussions within the XRP community, drawing mixed reactions over the possibility of this ambitious forecast. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Flag Pattern Above Accumulation Zone That Points To $5 Target At the heart of this analysis is the notion that the total crypto market cap could eventually expand to a $5.5 trillion valuation, possibly driven by skyrocketing institutional adoption, broader retail participation, regularity clarity, and more. Under such a scenario where XRP is also forecasted to command a 27% market share, its total market cap would equate to roughly $1.485, bringing its projected price close to a historical all-time high of $27. Supporting Egrag Crypto’s optimistic outlook is a historical analysis of XRP dominance levels, particularly focusing on the 0.5 Fibonacci Retracement level around the 5.75% mark. The analyst shared a detailed price chart, identifying this key level as a long-standing resistance zone where XRP dominance has been consistently rejected, first in October 2019, then in November 2020, and again in January and March 2025. According to the analyst, repeated testing of this key resistance is likely to trigger a breakout reaction once it is breached. He offered a unique analogy, describing the resistance testing as “knocking on the door—the more you knock, the higher the chances it opens.” Having already knocked on this resistance level four times in the past, XRP is now approaching its fifth attempt. The analyst believes that this could be the moment the “door” opens, signaling a potential breakout that could lead to a rise to the projected $1.5 trillion market cap and 27% dominance. Notably, the XRP market cap currently stands at $2.77 billion, meaning it would need to surge by over 54,000% to reach the ambitious $1.5 trillion valuation. In addition, XRP’s present market dominance is around 3.93%—a far cry from the projected 27% market share. This highlights the scale of the growth required, both in value and influence, for XRP to meet the analyst’s forecasted milestones. Bull Flag Set-Up Support Analyst’s Bold Predictions Adding strength to Egrag Crypto’s optimistic market cap and dominance forecast is the emergence of a Bull Flag formation on the macro XRP chart, which historically signals continuation to the upside following a consolidation period.

On June 13, the organization announced a $500,000 donation to help cover legal costs for the Tornado Cash co-founder. Storm is facing serious charges related to the crypto mixer project. The outcome of this court trial is expected to play a key role in shaping the future of decentralized finance (DeFi). EF Pledges $750K Match in Storm’s Defense The Ethereum Foundation, which supports Ethereum blockchain development, shared this news in a recent X post. In addition to the donation, the foundation promised to match up to $750,000 in further community contributions. The Foundation says privacy should be seen as normal, and creating code should not be treated as a crime. This highlights a bigger concern in crypto about punishing people for building open-source software. This financial support comes as Roman Storm prepares for trial on July 14 in New York. He is accused of conspiracy to commit money laundering and violating U.S. sanctions laws. This is related to his role in creating and running the Ethereum-based coin mixing service . Tornado Cash Sanctions Stir Industry Concerns In 2022, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added Tornado Cash to its sanctions list. Officials claimed criminals, even the Lazarus groups affiliated with North Korea, use these tools for money laundering and hide stolen funds trails. This move sparked concern across the crypto community, especially from industry leaders. In 2023, Coinbase played a major role in challenging the government’s actions. In March 2025, OFAC removed a crypto mixing service from its list of sanctioned entities. Months later, prosecutors dropped one charge against Roman Storm, accusing him of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. However, the court ruled that Tornado Cash operates as autonomous software and cannot be treated as property. Nevertheless, they are still moving forward with other serious charges. These include money laundering and conspiracy to break the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Roman Storm Fights Back, Denies Allegations Despite the mounting allegations against him, Storm has denied wrongdoing . He argued that the charges violate his rights under the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech. His legal team has tried to have the case dismissed. He is aiming to raise $2 million to cover his defense and has already begun calling on the crypto community for help. In a recent X post , Storm urged the crypto community to recognize the high stakes of his legal battle. He warned that if he loses, it could mark the end of decentralized finance freedom. The outcome of this trial could set legal precedents for Tornado Cash and other developers working on similar technologies.

The revelation came through a detailed financial disclosure filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which was viewed by the Financial Times. The 200-page report identifies World Liberty Financial as one of Trump’s most significant sources of income, with the president holding 15.75 billion governance tokens. Rather than purchasing the tokens, Trump received them as part of promotional activities related to the platform. Token Holdings Raise Conflict-of-Interest Concerns The report also details Trump’s transactions with other crypto-related companies like CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC, although these companies reported minimal income. While swearing that the filing’s contents are “true, complete, and correct,” ethical concerns have been raised by critics. Trump removed David Huitema, head of the Office of Government Ethics, from office earlier this year, which raised further controversy over his crypto dealings. The SEC, now chaired by Trump appointee Paul Atkins, has eased enforcement actions against crypto firms — a move some say directly benefits Trump’s online venture. World Liberty Financial: $1B Raised, A-List Backers World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance platform, conducted a token offering last year that raised $1 billion through the sale of 21 billion tokens. Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff was a “promoter” for the project, 2024 SEC filings show. Criticisms from both sides of the aisle have been raised over whether Trump’s ongoing profit from crypto investments presents a conflict of interest, especially when creating policy impacting the industry. DRW Investments Shores Up Trump’s Digital Dreams Major financial backing has come from DRW Investments, led by Chicago trader Don Wilson. DRW invested $100 million in Trump Media just weeks after its affiliate Cumberland received SEC enforcement relief from the new administration. This support enables Trump Media’s plans to raise $2.5 billion for a bitcoin treasury strategy and the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Investigations Underway Representative Jamie Raskin has launched a congressional probe into a private dinner Trump hosted for anchor investors in his meme coin, adding pressure on an already controversial crypto portfolio.

Dogecoin burst into popularity with the help of a strong community and support from celebrities like Elon Musk, making it the first meme coin in the cryptocurrency space. SHIB later on marketed itself as the “Dogecoin killer” and followed suite with a large ecosystem and aggressive marketing. In the past, both gave investors huge profits. However, in 2025, a new cryptocurrency will take the meme currency throne, and it won’t be fake. Enter $LILPEPE Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is a new player in the cryptocurrency realm that is quietly gaining attention. This isn’t just another token with a frog face that people are buying because they remember it. It’s a Layer 2 meme chain that was created with a clear goal in mind, is easy to grow, and features tokenomics that can take off the charts. This is the next meme currency that will make you a fortune. The World of Meme Coins Has Undergone Significant Changes. With its colourful Shiba Inu mascot and “just for fun” mindset, Dogecoin sparked the meme coin revolution. It showed that culture and community might change the market. Shiba Inu went even further by creating a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem that includes staking, governance, and its own Layer 2 network, called Shibarium. These initiatives made early investors rich, but the days of getting 100x returns on first-generation meme coins may be over. Why? Because the meme coin industry has changed. Investors are no longer satisfied with only hype. People want tokens that do something, such as those supported by infrastructure, utility, and speed. A meme currency needs to gain popularity and be functional today. This new hybrid age needs more than just memes; it needs intelligent design. That’s where Little Pepe shines. What Sets Little Pepe Apart? Little Pepe is more than just a meme. It is the native coin of a Layer 2 blockchain designed to power the future of meme-based innovation. The $LILPEPE chain is built on the Ethereum blockchain. It addresses the most frustrating issues with DeFi, including high gas fees, slow transactions, and network congestion, while preserving the culture, fun, and virality that make meme coins so popular. This is what makes $LILPEPE different: No taxes on transactions – Little Pepe is different from other tokens that take a cut of your profits with buy/sell taxes. With Little Pepe, you keep all of your money. Very low gas fees – You won’t be able to trade Uniswap for $30 to $50 anymore. The Layer 2 architecture ensures that transactions proceed smoothly, which is beneficial for both active users and degens. Finality that happens in a flash— Transactions settle almost immediately, making $LILPEPE more useful in real time. A meme-centric launchpad —an infrastructure built in for launching the next generation of viral meme tokens on a network developed just for them. Little Pepe is what Dogecoin and SHIB could have been if they had emerged in today’s crypto world, with modern technology, developer tools, and smart tokenomics from the outset. Why $LILPEPE is a Potential Millionaire-Maker The first sale of Little Pepe is going for $0.001. The team expects to sell the product for $0.01 and above. That alone is a five-fold increase for anyone who buys early. But that’s not the end of the possibilities. The demand for $LILPEPE could surge as more projects commence on the Little Pepe network and more people utilize it due to its low fees and rapid speeds. A price of $0.10 is likely, representing a 10x return from the debut and a 42x return from the presale entrance. Little Pepe’s return on investment (ROI) chances are on a whole other level compared to the 5x estimates for XRP and the speculative 10x aspirations for SHIB. The Plan for Meme Chain to Take Over The three-phase strategic roadmap for Little Pepe sets it apart from other fads. Each phase is meticulously planned to foster meaningful growth, community involvement, and practical usefulness. Being pregnant The start of the movement. People are discussing the presale, partnerships are being formed, and the Little Pepe moniker is gaining rapid popularity on social media. The mainnet launch and the first top-tier CEX listings mark the end of this phase. These have historically been pivotal events that cause prices to fluctuate rapidly. Growth As the chain goes online, the ecosystem starts to grow. The launchpad draws in meme makers and degens. Developer tools and robust APIs make it easy to start on the chain, leading to a high level of activity on the network. More charts, feeds, and watchlists are showing $LILPEPE. Dominance In this last step, Little Pepe becomes the go-to Layer 2 for meme productions. Hundreds of tokens, dApps, and communities use the $LILPEPE chain. The original token moves up the list and into the Top 100 crypto assets by market cap. Dogecoin and SHIB Walked so that Little Pepe Could Soar Let’s be honest: Dogecoin isn’t going anywhere. It’s famous, yet it remains outdated and is rarely used in real life. SHIB has several advantages, including a vibrant community and real-world applications. However, it also has several problems due to its ample token supply and complex tokenomics. Little Pepe is a new option that combines the meme culture of DOGE, the ambition of SHIB, and the technological backbone of a next-gen Ethereum Layer 2—all without the baggage. It’s quick, enjoyable, and has the potential to grow. In a market where memes and infrastructure are inextricably linked, $LILPEPE isn’t just keeping up; it’s leading the pace. Conclusion DOGE and SHIB created news—and made millionaires—during the bull run of 2021. But the meme coin millionaires of 2025 won’t come from popular trends of yesterday. Little Pepe and other brave, useful, and community-driven enterprises will be where they originate from. $LILPEPE isn’t just the next meme coin; it’s the next meme chain. It has no taxes, lightning-fast transactions, and a plan for mass adoption. If you’re still on the fence, now is your chance. Head on over to littlepepe.com to get tokens.

These under-the-radar assets are quietly earning trust from some of the most influential financial players. Discover which digital coins are capturing serious attention and could be set to surge in value. SOL Price Update: Bear Pressure and Key Levels Amid Recent Declines SOL has witnessed a sustained decline over the past month with a drop of 16.89% and a broader decrease of 34.52% over the previous six months. The one-week performance slipped by 0.74%, indicating a gradual weakening in momentum and market sentiment. The coin’s price behavior over these periods shows a steady fall without any major rebounds, reflecting pressure from broader market forces and a general reluctance among buyers to drive prices higher. The recent trend underlines the challenges faced by SOL, marking a period of persistent downturn and underperformance against its previous levels. Currently, SOL trades within a range of $136 to $182.20, with a clear key support at $115.84 and a resistance level at $207.90. A second layer of support exists around $69.81, while a secondary resistance is noted near $253.93. The technical indicators point to a bearish bias with the Awesome Oscillator registering -9.18 and a Momentum Indicator at -6.40. The RSI lingers at 39.67, suggesting potential for oversold conditions without a solid bullish recovery. Bears are presently in control, although the price’s proximity to vital support could invite short-term buying interest. Upbeat Altcoin Set Amid Price Corrections and Key Levels Sui ’s price trajectory shows a clear downward trend over recent months with a one-month drop of 22.18% and a six-month decline of 36.31%. The coin has moved between $2.77 and $4.01, reflecting consistent pressure on price that has intensified over the half-year period. These figures indicate a significant sell-off and a lack of strong buying support over these time frames, resulting in steadily lower levels and increased volatility. This behavior illustrates the challenges the coin has faced in recovering from recent bearish market conditions. Sui currently trades within a range where its vitality is tested by key support around $2.29 and resistance near $4.77, with a secondary safety net at $1.05 and further resistance pushing up to $6.01. Bears appear to dominate, as indicated by a negative Awesome Oscillator and a slightly bearish Momentum Indicator. The RSI hints at potential oversold conditions, suggesting a possible upward bounce if buyers step in near support. Trading within these levels requires caution, with opportunities to buy on dips near $2.29 and to consider short positions if the price approaches $4.77 resistance without breaking higher. Ethereum Price Trends: Analyzing Recent Movements and Current Levels Ethereum dropped roughly 2.12% over the past month and faced a sharper decline of about 35.49% over six months. Price behavior shows a period of drop in investor confidence and increased volatility, highlighting a market that has been under pressure. The movement over these periods reflects a cautious investor stance and a lack of strong upward momentum, with noticeable weaknesses affecting overall sentiment throughout recent trading sessions. Currently, Ethereum trades within a range from around $1923.57 to $2961.91, with a primary resistance near $3395.40 and support near $1318.72. The market lacks a clear trend, leaning toward bearish sentiment as indicated by the RSI near 50.70 and negative momentum. Trading strategies should focus on buying near support and selling near resistance, specifically looking to initiate positions close to $1318.72 and targeting initial resistance at $3395.40, while staying alert for potential breakout signals. Conclusion SOL , SUI , and ETH are showing strong potential and winning over major institutional investors like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. These projects provide promising technology and reliability that could shape the future of crypto investments. Notably, their innovation and growth are attracting serious attention in the financial sector. As a result, they may well become leading players in the crypto market.

Price action remains pinned near the lower end of its recent $145–$149 consolidation zone, following a broader multi-day correction across crypto markets tied to rising geopolitical tension. Despite recent weakness, two major institutional developments suggest deepening engagement with the Solana ecosystem. First, Bloomberg’s James Seyffart confirmed on Friday that this week that all seven spot Solana ETF issuers — i.e. including Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, Franklin, Bitwise and Canary Marinade —submitted updated S-1 filings with the SEC. Each filing now includes staking provisions, making them structurally aligned with solana’s on-chain economics. Second, DeFi Development Corp, a Nasdaq-listed Solana treasury firm, announced on Thursday that it entered into a $5 billion equity line of credit (ELOC) agreement with RK Capital. The facility allows DeFi Dev Corp to issue shares gradually to fund additional SOL accumulation, rather than relying on a single, fixed-price offering. This follows a minor regulatory setback: on Wednesday, the company applied to the SEC for the withdrawal of registration statement on Form S-3. It said it wanted to withdraw a prior S-3 filing due to technical eligibility issues flagged by the SEC. The firm said it would file a resale registration statement in the future to raise the capital it needs. Despite the filing hiccup, the company emphasized its continued commitment to growing its SOL treasury, which currently holds over 609,190 tokens — valued at more than $97 million. CEO Joseph Onorati said in Thursday's press release that the new capital structure offers a “clean, strategic path” to scale exposure while compounding validator yield. SOL’s price appears to be stabilizing as these institutional tailwinds strengthen, even as retail activity remains subdued. Technical Analysis Highlights SOL traded in a 24-hour range of $4.57 (3.08%), from $144.13 to $148.70. Initial strength faded, with price drifting toward the $144 support level. Resistance remains firm near $149, while short-term rejection hit $145.78. High-volume selling occurred between 13:41–13:47 UTC, with a sharp drop from $145.95. A volume spike at 13:23 UTC aligned with the failed breakout. Whale accumulation continues below $146, though follow-through remains limited.

Table of Contents Ripple: Good long-term prospect, but short-term? Little Pepe: The Memecoin with real infrastructure Roadmap: From presale to nemecoin dominance Conclusion: A war of long-term stability vs. short-term profits With a price target of $5-$8 over the next 100 days and enormous institutional backing, having resolved its legal issues, XRP is poised to succeed in the long term. However, for short-term investors who want to catch the wave, there may be a new entrant in town that’s causing a splash: Little Pepe (LILPEPE). As XRP holds firm in the conventional territory, there is a unique short-term play with LILPEPE . With zero tax, Layer-2 blockchain status, and a meme-driven community rapidly gaining traction, LILPEPE offers a fascinating short-term investment opportunity for those seeking a quick return. You might also like: XRP targets $5 but Little Pepe presale steals the spotlight as it raises $200,000 on day 1 Ripple: Good long-term prospect, but short-term? Ripple is currently trading at $2.33. It has always been considered a safe and stable investment due to its financial sector adoption. Its capability to enable cross-border payments instantly and at minimal costs has earned it the backing of various financial institutions and banks. With its Ethereum-similar transaction speeds and deployment of its XRP Ledger and RippleNet networks, it is little wonder that Ripple is making waves in the industry. In 2025, Ripple emerged from its SEC lawsuit in good standing and was poised for enormous price appreciation. With analysts’ target price estimate of $5-$8 for XRP within the next 100 days, the judicial ruling and institutional purchases have fueled investor optimism. The success of Ripple will ultimately depend on how warmly the market embraces its regulatory clarity, institutional partnerships, and continued integration into the international payments system. Although the future of XRP is bright, the short-term gains are unlikely to be as quick as others would wish. The XRP price action is driven by the overall market sentiment, regulatory, and institutional demand. They will also likely take some time to realize that, and may not be the best option for people seeking immediate growth in their portfolios. Little Pepe: The Memecoin with real infrastructure Step forward, Little Pepe, a memecoin that is rapidly making waves with its progressive thinking and Layer 2 blockchain design. While all the other memecoins rely on hype and community power, LILPEPE is emerging as an infrastructure-memecoin. It introduces a greatly needed degree of stability and scale to the memecoin space, which is otherwise defined by network congestion, expensive transaction costs, and a lack of utility. However, the most significant difference between LILPEPE and other memecoins is that the project utilizes a Layer-2 blockchain, enabling it to offer blisteringly fast transaction speeds and effectively no fees, making it both a convenient tool for traders and content creators. Being the most scalable project, with a current presale price of $0.001, LILPEPE may be a better candidate for making quick trades and short-term investments. Compared to Ethereum-based memecoins, which are often bedeviled by high gas fees during periods of increased demand, LILPEPE’s blockchain maintains a low trading cost, and transactions are executed quickly. Furthermore, LILPEPE offers zero tax trading, which means investors don’t have to worry about buy/sell fees that typically deduct a portion of their profits in traditional memecoin marketplaces. This renders LILPEPE highly attractive to traders who want to ride meme coin upswings without hindrance from excessive fees. Roadmap: From presale to nemecoin dominance Little Pepe’s roadmap is arguably its most exciting feature. It boasts a clear strategy for adoption, expansion, and virality. This is what lies ahead for LILPEPE: Phase 1 – Pregnancy: Launch of presales and viral marketing campaigns. Meme campaigns on Twitter and Telegram go into hyperdrive, generating community buzz and social media traction. Phase 2 – Birth: Listing on Uniswap + 2 large centralized exchanges (CEXs). Targeting a $1 billion market cap, with an aggressive marketing push to raise awareness. Phase 3 – Growth: Layer 2 implementation completion, turning LILPEPE into a high-performance, scalable ecosystem. Pepe’s Pump Pad goes live, enabling creators to deploy tokens easily. Targeting the Top 100 on CoinMarketCap, bringing LILPEPE to top-tier memecoin status. With massive milestones on the horizon, LILPEPE is poised for explosive expansion, making it a perfect pick for short-term investors seeking to capitalize on the memecoin craze. How to invest in LILPEPE in the presale Investing in the presale of LILPEPE is simple: Download MetaMask or Trust Wallet Fund wallet with ETH or USDT (ERC-20) Visit the official website and link wallet Buy LILPEPE tokens Tokens will be claimable when the presale ends, and the price increases with every level of the presale, so don’t wait too long to buy at the lowest price. Conclusion: A war of long-term stability vs. short-term profits Ripple and Little Pepe offer distinct investment propositions. XRP offers long-term stability and institutional investor-friendly real-world utility, while LILPEPE provides short-term profit for those who want to be part of the memecoin bandwagon. LILPEPE’s Layer-2 structure and zero-tax design might be a better alternative for those who wish to achieve quick returns.

While flying under the radar, these altcoins have shown impressive growth and potential. Curious investors might find these hidden gems worth a closer look. Discover the three top-performing altcoins that are poised for a breakout. AB Altcoin Surges with Explosive Gains and Bullish Signals AB past performance shows a dynamic progression with a one-month price change of nearly 68% and a staggering six-month surge of over 17,5%. The weekly increase of 43.33% reflects rapid upward movement coinciding with sustained positive momentum. Price volatility has characterized recent trading, as the asset has demonstrated significant price leaps displaying both short-term energy and long-term explosive gains. These marked improvements highlight a coin that has managed to capture investor interest, climbing steadily against expectations and setting the stage for further bullish action. Current trading sees the asset fluctuating between $0.004 and $0.012, with resistance at $0.015 and support at $0.0004. Indicators suggest bulls are in control, but the Relative Strength Index of 71.01 indicates an overbought situation. Caution is advised due to the high RSI and compressed price space. Trading ideas could focus on buying near the support of $0.0004 and planning exits as the price approaches resistance. The lack of a clear trend allows for opportunities in short-term fluctuations, making it essential to monitor momentum shifts. Hyperliquid Growth and Key Levels Support Bullish Momentum Hyperliquid demonstrated strong performance over the past month with a noticeable surge, as prices climbed by approximately 66%. The half-year trend has also been impressive, with an overall increase of about 75%, showcasing a consistent upward trajectory that has attracted sustained investor attention. A sharp 25 jump was observed in the last week, underlining positive sentiment among traders and stakeholders. These steady gains over various timeframes highlight the coin’s potential for continued expansion. The current trading environment for Hyperliquid shows the coin moving within a price range from $21.20 to $42.08, with clear technical markers for traders. A primary support level is identified at $9.73, while initial resistance stands at $51.47 and a secondary obstacle appears at $72.35. Although bulls seem to maintain the upper hand, caution is warranted due to the possibility of an overextended market. Trading ideas include looking for dip buying opportunities near support and monitoring price action around resistance levels for breakout validation. Fartcoin Market Analysis: Bit of Back-and-Forth Momentum Last month FARTCOIN showed a slight dip of 6.82% as Fartcoin traded closer to its mid-range levels, hinting at a period of consolidation that came after an impressive six-month gain of 19.31%. Price action over the past six months demonstrates overall strength with gradual upward movement despite short-term pullbacks. Recent fluctuations reveal a coin that experiences both robust short-term rallies and periods of cautious selling, indicating a market that is neither overly bullish nor overly bearish. Current trading sees Fartcoin moving between a low of $0.78 and a high of $1.51, with immediate support at $0.49 and resistance first coming into play at $1.94 before encountering further resistance at $2.66. Technical indicators show a momentum reading around 0.29 and an RSI near 51.65, suggesting that neither bulls nor bears have complete control. While the week’s price surge of 27.58% points to bullish energy, traders should note the absence of a clear, sustained trend as recent month-long declines have tempered the overall outlook. Tactical moves might include buying near the established support level and carefully testing the resistance zones, while watching for shifts in momentum that could tip the balance further in favor of bulls or bears. Conclusion AB , HYPE , and FARTCOIN have showcased impressive gains this week. Their performance has caught the attention of many investors. Despite being lesser-known, these altcoins have risen in value and interest. Each of these coins brings unique offerings and potential to the market. Their rise signals a dynamic shift and offers fresh opportunities. This week's success stories highlight the evolving nature of the crypto market.

Experts Are Watching These Key Levels,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/can-ripple-xrp-and-litecoin-ltc-finally-break-out-experts-are-watching-these-key-levels,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have their eyes on Ripple and Litecoin . These digital assets are flirting with key levels that could signal big changes. This article delves into the critical points experts say may trigger significant moves. Curious about which coins are poised for growth? Read on for insights that could impact your investment decisions. XRP: Past Declines and Key Levels Set the Stage XRP experienced a notable drop in the last month, declining approximately 17.71%. Over the past six months, it fell around 11.48%. A brief recovery in the last week provided a slight gain of 1.38%, indicating short-term bounce backs within a broader downtrend. Price fluctuations during these periods reveal a market that has been testing its support levels and facing consistent selling pressure, underscoring the coin’s volatile nature. XRP is currently trading between $1.95 and $2.53. Resistance is at $2.88, while support is at $1.73, with higher challenges at $3.45 and lower at $1.15. An RSI of 40.93 alongside a moving average of -0.8 indicates a prevailing bearish sentiment. Price momentum remains weak with negative readings from key indicators. Bulls should aim for a break above $2.88, while bears could target the support at $1.73. The market currently lacks a clear trend, urging traders to exercise caution. Litecoin Struggles with Bearish Trends Amid Key Price Levels Litecoin dropped nearly 20% in the past month and suffered a decline close to 30% over the last six months. The consistent downward pressure reflects a period of weakness that has unsettled market participants. Price movements during these periods have emphasized a lack of strong recovery, hinting that investors have been cautious amid persistent selling. The coin's performance over these time frames has underscored gradual losses, marking a shift away from previous bullish behavior and indicating that caution has been at the forefront of market trends. At present, Litecoin is trading within a range between $76.45 and $102.35. Traders should note a primary support level at $65.82 and resistance at $117.63, with a second support at $39.91 and further resistance near $143.53. The Awesome Oscillator at -4.68 and a Momentum Indicator of -6.47 alongside a Relative Strength Index of 39.16 suggest that bears currently dominate, with little evidence of a clear upward trend. Trading ideas include considering short positions near resistance and monitoring for reversal signs if bulls can push past these barriers. This landscape calls for careful positioning to profit from small shifts within the range. Conclusion Ripple (XRP) and Litecoin (LTC) are being closely monitored by experts. XRP's key resistance level could signal a breakout if surpassed. LTC has shown potential growth patterns too. Analysts believe that surpassing these key levels could lead to significant upward movements. Observing trading volumes and market sentiment will be crucial in the coming days. Investors are focused on these levels to gauge the next steps for both XRP and LTC. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

46015948,https://timestabloid.com/?p=71014,1749924316,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple (XRP) Vs SEC: John Deaton Predicts Final Outcome in Latest Analysis,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-and-secs-joint-request-john-deaton-explains-what-it-means-and-way-forward/,"In what could mark a critical turning point in the protracted SEC v. Ripple litigation, the two parties have jointly requested an indicative ruling from U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres. The motion asks whether the judge would be willing to dissolve the permanent injunction against Ripple and reduce its $125 million penalty to $50 million—a deal that would effectively end the four-and-a-half-year legal battle. But as legal expert John Deaton explains that the path to resolution is anything but straightforward. Judge Analisa Torres’ handling of the SEC v. Ripple case took another twist when she rejected the parties’ initial attempt to secure approval for a reduced fine and dissolved injunction via a joint request, while many expected the judge to swiftly approve the proposed settlement. Legal expert John Deaton and founder of CryptoLawUS, explains that the rejection was rooted in legal rigor, not judicial resistance. “This wasn’t a case of rubber-stamping,” Deaton said. “She threw a curveball.” Ripple & SEC's Joint Request for an Indicative Ruling: What Does it Mean? https://t.co/XTLQgEydQ4 — CryptoLaw (@CryptoLawUS) June 14, 2025 Why the Initial Request Failed Deaton argues the rejection was both procedural and substantive. “First of all, you cited the wrong rule,” he pointed out, referring to the parties’ reliance on inappropriate procedural grounds. But more critically, Judge Torres emphasized that exceptional circumstances—a high legal threshold—had not been adequately demonstrated. “You haven’t shown me the exceptional circumstances that would justify undoing my injunction,” Deaton paraphrased the judge’s stance. After presiding over a four-and-a-half-year litigation and issuing a meticulously reasoned decision, Judge Torres was not about to casually reverse her judgment. According to Deaton, the judge essentially told both parties: “You’ve got to do some effort. You’ve got to meet this high standard.” This high standard stems from the principle that final judgments can only be modified under extraordinary conditions, especially when the relief includes deterrent elements like permanent injunctions and sizable penalties. What Could Convince the Judge Despite his criticism of the initial brief, Deaton believes the revised joint request contains enough legal precedent to justify a favorable indicative ruling. Citing Second Circuit case law, the parties argue that a court may alter a judgment to facilitate settlement if doing so would conserve judicial resources and end appeals. “There is enough case law cited in the SEC-Ripple brief that allows the judge to give her something to hang her hat on,” Deaton observed. A crucial point is the mutual dismissal of appeals. The SEC has already agreed to drop its challenge to the ruling on XRP’s programmatic sales, while Ripple will drop its appeal of the institutional sales ruling—but only if Judge Torres agrees to the proposed modifications. “If you don’t give us an indicative ruling… Ripple won’t drop their appeal,” Deaton explained. That means prolonging the litigation at the appellate level and potentially forcing the district court to revisit unresolved prongs of the Howey test, such as the “common enterprise” factor—something Judge Torres never fully addressed. That would tie up her courtroom with new fact-finding proceedings. The Missed Opportunity While Deaton sees a plausible legal basis for the judge to grant the motion, he criticizes how the SEC and Ripple minimized the public interest dimension of the original judgment, particularly the deterrent effect of the injunction and the $125 million penalty. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 “They blew the public interest,” Deaton said. “Her injunction is, ‘Ripple, you’re not allowed to violate securities laws.’ That has value.” The brief portrayed the injunction and monetary fine as having little broader significance, which Deaton believes undermines the judge’s original rationale. Moreover, he faults the parties for not citing the overwhelming public engagement in the case. “They didn’t even address that… 75,000 people knocking on the door saying they want access to this asset class,” Deaton noted. He stressed that Judge Torres had previously cited XRP holders’ affidavits in her ruling, signaling that she does care deeply about public sentiment and investor interest. A Reasoned Prediction Ultimately, Deaton predicts that Judge Torres will issue the indicative ruling the parties seek, but not without conditions. “I think she’ll grant it—like by 70%,” he said. He believes the case law supporting settlement facilitation, combined with the strategic benefit of ending costly appeals, gives the judge sufficient legal cover. “The Second Circuit has ruled that saving judicial resources and ending litigation can justify modifying a judgment,” Deaton emphasized. Importantly, the case-specific nature of the injunction means Torres can approve the settlement without undermining the legal precedent she established regarding XRP’s non-security status in secondary market transactions. “Your ruling isn’t reversed,” Deaton noted. “People can still cite it… because it’s one of the first impressions related to crypto.” A Crossroads in Crypto Jurisprudence This moment represents more than just the closing chapter of a long-running legal drama. It is also a litmus test for how U.S. courts will balance finality, public interest, and evolving regulatory posture in the crypto space. Whether Judge Torres grants the joint request may depend not only on the case law presented, but also on whether she believes the resolution honors both the public interest and the legal integrity of her courtroom. “She’s not just going to erase four and a half years of work,” Deaton concluded. “But if you show her the right legal basis, she’ll listen.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum in phase 5 of the presale at a price of $0.03 per token, having collected $10,600,000 and sold more than 550 million tokens to 12000 holders. One of the most popular altcoins, Dogecoin, trades at $0.1912 and looks like it might break out. Both tokens present rare chances in the crypto market, as they have caught the attention due to their different strategies. As the market heats up, these projects stand out for their potential. Let’s explore why these coins are capturing investor interest. Dogecoin’s breakout potential Dogecoin (DOGE) is causing excitement through its historical cycle patterns. Analysts point to its historical rampages, such as the 8,200 percent increase between 2015 and 2018 and an unbelievable 43,000 percent growth between 2020 and 2021. DOGE is consolidating at the moment and changing hands at $0.1912, yet analysts expect a breakout to the upside of $2.28 using Fibonacci extensions. This could mean a 1,000% gain from current crypto prices. The optimism is driven by the resilience that the coin has demonstrated in the market, as well as by the market sentiment. In addition, the capability of DOGE to revert the price baselines following breakouts indicates stability in the long term. Investors are watching the $0.24 resistance level closely, as a break could spark significant upward momentum in crypto prices. Mutuum Finance presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in phase 5 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.03. The project has raised $10,600,000, with over 550 million tokens sold to 12,000 holders. Phase 5 is currently underway, but phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. At launch, MUTM will list at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% ROI for current buyers. Analysts project a potential post-launch value of $2.50, offering an 8,233% return from today’s price. Furthermore, the team recently completed a Certik audit, scoring 80.00 for security, with no vulnerabilities found, bolstering trust in its infrastructure. Mutuum Finance’s innovative lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract system lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools, earning passive income through automated interest adjustments. The Peer-to-Peer model fosters direct lending, enhancing transparency and user control. Built on Ethereum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a stablecoin pegged to the USD, ensuring secure transactions. The platform’s Layer-2 integration promises faster, cheaper transactions, setting it apart in the crypto market. Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway splits $10,000 in MUTM among 10 winners, requiring a $50 presale investment to enter. This initiative boosts excitement as crypto investing grows. Mutuum Finance’s strategic edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rewarding its top 50 token holders with bonus tokens via a new leaderboard dashboard, incentivizing long-term commitment. The platform’s revenue model redirects earnings to buy MUTM tokens, supporting value without diluting supply. Its beta platform will launch alongside the token, allowing immediate access to lending and earning features. This contrasts with Dogecoin’s speculative appeal, as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility. Consequently, its focus on scalability and user empowerment positions it as a leader in crypto investment. Investors are drawn to its low entry price and robust roadmap, signaling strong growth potential. Promising paths ahead Top cryptocurrencies like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Dogecoin are lighting up the crypto market in 2025. MUTM’s presale at $0.03 offers a 100% ROI at launch, with analysts eyeing a $2.50 post-launch target. Dogecoin’s cycle patterns hint at a $2.28 breakout, driven by historical trends. Both coins cater to different investor goals: DOGE for speculative gains, MUTM for DeFi utility. As crypto prices fluctuate, these projects offer compelling opportunities. Don’t miss out—research these tokens and consider joining Mutuum Finance’s presale or tracking Dogecoin’s next move to capitalize on their potential.

The call was confirmed by the Kremlin and came just after Israel launched a large-scale aerial campaign known as Operation Rising Lion. According to TASS, Russia’s Yury Ushakov, who serves as Vladimir Putin’s top aide on foreign policy, briefed reporters after the call and said Moscow had warned Washington well before the violence began. Ushakov said, “The Russian president recalled that our side proposed concrete steps before the current escalation, which were aimed at finding mutually acceptable agreements in the ongoing negotiations between representatives of the United States and Iran on the Iranian nuclear program.” He added, “Russia’s principled approach and interest in a settlement remains unchanged and, as Vladimir Putin noted, we will continue to act on this basis.” Meanwhile, Trump said on Truth Social that Putin had actually called to wish him a happy birthday. He said: “President Putin called this morning to very nicely wish me a Happy Birthday, but to more importantly, talk about Iran, a country he knows very well. We talked at length. Much less time was spent talking about Russia/Ukraine, but that will be for next week. He is doing the planned prisoner swaps – large numbers of prisoners are being exchanged, immediately, from both sides. The call lasted approximately 1 hour. He feels, as do I, this war in Israel-Iran should end, to which I explained, his war should also end.” Israel strikes Iranian nuclear sites with 200 jets The Israeli military opened the offensive on the night of June 13, deploying 200 fighter jets to target over 100 locations inside Iran, including suspected nuclear research facilities. This marked one of the largest airstrike campaigns in the region since 2006. Israeli officials did not give a complete list of targets but confirmed that the goal was to damage Iran’s nuclear capabilities directly. Tehran’s response came just hours later. By that evening, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps fired missile salvos into Israel, hitting various locations. Among them were military air bases, and one of the missiles reportedly struck the Israeli Defense Ministry building in Tel Aviv. Israeli officials acknowledged that while some facilities were damaged, the Iron Dome defense system intercepted most of the incoming projectiles. The growing exchange between the two countries has already hit global energy markets. Kalshi, a prediction platform that tracks financial risk, forecasted that oil prices could climb as high as $94.10 a barrel within the year due to the disruption of Iranian oil infrastructure. Global investors are bracing for possible inflationary effects that could ripple across multiple economies. Iran threatens US military bases as markets wobble On June 14, Fars News, which operates under Iran’s state media network, reported that senior Iranian military officials warned the fight will expand to include US military bases stationed across the Middle East. Although no timetable was given, the report indicated that Tehran considers American forces legitimate military targets if Washington is seen as backing Israeli strikes. The S&P 500 index, a key benchmark for US equities, reflected market anxiety. On Friday, it dropped by 1.1% and closed the week down 0.4%. For context, those numbers weren’t enough to cause a full-blown correction, but they did show a rare failure of the market’s usual strategy—buying the morning dip. The index hovered just above its 20-day average, a trend level often used as a psychological line of defense for traders. A break below that level, followed by another 3% slide, would still fall within the “normal” range of pullbacks in a bull market. But given the geopolitical climate, those numbers may not stay routine for long. Analysts are watching the market closely, not just for price movements but for changes in behavior. Over the past few months, the S&P 500 has been riding one of the strongest recoveries after a 15%-plus correction, showing tight pullbacks and aggressive buying on weakness. That pattern may be harder to maintain if the Middle East war stretches into July or if Iran follows through on threats against American troops. So far, there’s no indication from the White House on how Trump will respond if US assets are attacked. While the Pentagon has not issued public statements, insiders expect the military to raise threat levels at all bases in the Gulf and Red Sea regions.

His outlook follows recent losses that dragged the broader market lower, triggered by escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. After failing to hold above $106,000, Bitcoin began what Poppe described as a “cascade south,” slicing through liquidity zones and prompting a wave of sell-offs, he noted in a June 14 X post. A brief bounce followed, but the recovery was quickly rejected at the same $106,000 level, now acting as firm resistance. The leading digital currency had regained bullish momentum earlier, only to lose it after a liquidity sweep and sharp rejection at a local high. Now, the $101,500 to $102,500 range could serve as either a launchpad for recovery or a setup for further downside. To this end, Poppe noted that a fresh rally could take shape if Bitcoin holds above $102,500 and consolidates. But if selling pressure intensifies, he sees the $98,000 to $99,000 zone as a strong candidate for a high-probability long entry. $BTC has a very similar picture. We couldn't hold above $106K and then we started to cascade south taking all the liquidity. Bounce upwards, instant rejection at that crucial level. Two options; – Sub $100K buy opportunity if this continues to fall. – Price holds around… pic.twitter.com/dOCjnBBtOP — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 14, 2025 At the same time, Bitcoin’s volume profile supports this view, highlighting heavy selling after the failed breakout. A lower support zone could also be a trap for late short positions, offering an ideal re-entry point for bullish traders. Key Bitcoin price levels to watch In a separate June 14 analysis, RLinda noted that Bitcoin is consolidating within a broad range between $100,600 and $110,400. The Middle East geopolitical tension spike briefly disrupted its bullish structure, pushing the price down to $102,500 before a sharp recovery. That rebound reinforced support at $102,500, with $106,200 now a key resistance level. Despite market uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to hold above critical support. According to the analyst, short-term trading strategies remain viable if the cryptocurrency stays within the $100,600 to $102,500 range. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $104,600, down 0.4% on the day and nearly 4% for the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

Responding to a user’s question regarding token plans for MetaMask, Lubin announced that the company is developing short- and medium-term strategic plans and that the first token distribution will take place on the LINEA network. He noted that future protocols are designed to work in synergy with each other. A few days ago, ConsenSys shared the news of a significant acquisition with the public. The company announced that it acquired the Singapore-based Web3Auth platform. This move aims to strengthen MetaMask’s user-friendly structure. Web3Auth allows users to log in to their crypto wallets with popular social media accounts such as Google, Facebook, and Discord.

According to some publications, the POTUS described the Israel-Iran situation as “very alarming,” as there’s no closure in sight. BREAKING: President Trump tells Putin that the situation in the Middle East is “very alarming.” — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 14, 2025 Recall the events that transpired between the two nations located in the Middle East as Israel hit Iran first on Friday morning, killing over 70 people in the process, including high-end generals and nuclear scientists. Iran responded last night, but the damage was significantly less. Although Trump previously expressed hope that Iran could be closer to signing a nuclear deal now, he and Putin were reportedly concerned about the recent escalation, as the conflict is nowhere near a resolution. Nevertheless, both still “did not rule out a return to negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program,” reported the Moscow Times, citing a statement from the Kremlin. Israel’s attack against Iran earlier this week had an immediate and profound impact on the cryptocurrency market, with BTC slumping from a Thursday peak of $108,500 to under $103,000 on Friday morning. Iran’s response failed to influence the market in a similar manner, but BTC is back in the red after Trump’s most recent remarks.

Dogelon Mars (ELON) is a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and billionaire Elon Musk. It is created on Ethereum and Polygon, and the name is a mash-up of “Dogecoin” and “Elon,” with a Mars twist, representing its aim to go to the moon. Although it might sound like a joke, Dogelon Mars has amassed a significant following online, counting more than 300,000 followers on Twitter and 84,000+ on Telegram. The coin’s founders remain anonymous, a common trait in meme coin projects. Since its launch in 2021, ELON has stayed active, reducing the chance of it being a rug pull. At its peak on July 31, 2021, ELON traded at $0.00003263 but has since dropped by 99.63%. While Elon Musk is not associated with Dogelon Mars, his name has caused the token to spike. For instance, it occurred when Musk purchased Twitter, ELON’s price briefly surged due to social media hype, then corrected.

Dogelon Mars (ELON) has shown short-term gains, but its long-term outlook remains weak. Despite a 13.93% yearly rise and 239.13% over three years, the token lacks development, utility, and a roadmap, a fact supported by the latest data. Competing meme coins on Ethereum and Solana are gaining ground, and forecasts suggest ELON could lose value after 2025 and fade by 2030.

The game allows players to collect $ELON tokens, dodge villains, and explore a Martian landscape. Now live for public testing, it can be accessed through GD Games, signalling a new phase of community engagement for the Dogelon Mars ecosystem and meme coin project.

The Dogelon Mars cryptocurrency (ELON) is down today due to weak market conditions and a lack of bullish catalysts. Bitcoin’s drop and rising dominance have pulled liquidity from altcoins, including ELON. With low trading volume and no recent project updates, particularly in the Uniswap liquidity pool, minor whale sell-offs have had an outsized impact on its price. Will Dogelon Mars recover? ELON is experiencing fluctuations with a recent upward trend; there are signs of potential recovery. Will ELON reach $1? Reaching a closing price of $1 for Dogelon Mars (ELON) is highly unlikely due to its massive circulating supply and the unrealistic market capitalisation required. Significant demand increases and supply reductions would be necessary to approach such a price. Will ELON reach $10 It is highly unlikely that the ELON token will reach $10 due to its enormous circulating supply and the unrealistic market capitalisation required. Will ELON reach $100? Reaching $100 for Dogelon Mars (ELON) is virtually impossible, as it would require a maximum price level that is not feasible given its vast circulating supply and the astronomically high market cap and capitalisation it would necessitate. Dogelon Mars price prediction for June 2025 Based on the price fluctuations of Dogelon Mars at the beginning of June 2025, the average ELON rate is expected to be $0.00000012.

Dogelon Mars historic price sentiment Dogelon Mars price history Dogelon launched and reached its ATH of $0.00003263 in May 2021. In May 2021, it reached its all-time high (ATH) of $0.00003263. This rapid ascent was driven by a combination of market speculation, social media hype, and the broader bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. The downward trend persisted throughout 2022, reflecting a broader correction in the cryptocurrency market. By the end of the year, ELON had lost approximately 99% of its ATH value. The cryptocurrency market faced increased regulatory scrutiny, market saturation with new meme coins, and reduced retail investor interest, all contributing to the decline in ELON’s price. In 2023, ELON started the year on a relatively low note, with its price fluctuating around $0.0000001756. However, there was a notable peak in 2023, when ELON reached $0.0000005196. This spike was likely driven by short-term speculative trading, possible minor endorsements, or temporary positive market sentiment. By the end of 2023, the price had stabilized somewhat but remained much lower than its previous peaks, continuing to fluctuate around $0.0000001756. At the beginning of the year 2024, a broader crypto market spike provided some upward momentum for ELON, pushing its price to $0.000000227. Mid of 2024The crypto market spiked, and pushed ELON to $0.000000227. However, the price has since dropped and now fluctuates around $0.00000018 to $0.00000019. Following the spike, ELON’s price began to decline again, reflecting the coin’s ongoing volatility and the speculative nature of its trading. In October 2024, ELON stayed near $0.000000188 as meme coin interest cooled across Ethereum and Solana. By December 2024, the token hovered around $0.000000182 with little change in trading volume. In January 2025, ELON opened at $0.000000130, showing no strong rebound despite a broader altcoin bounce. March 2025 saw a brief rise from a Bit2Me promo, but the price quickly dropped back near $0.000000128. In May 2025, ELON slipped below its 10-day SMA, closing around $0.000000122 with weak RSI and bearish MACD. As of June 14, 2025, Dogelon Mars (ELON) is trading at approximately $0.0000001200, reflecting continued bearish pressure and declining investor interest.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|ICO|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-14 18:42:11

According to recent court documents, the retired superstar is settling a lawsuit where he’s accused of promoting FTX, which went bankrupt in 2022 after its chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found to be mishandling billions of dollars worth of customer funds as well as defrauding investors. “This proposed settlement… results from the tremendous efforts of the parties, with negotiations informed by previous mediations and settlement agreements which were reached in this action. Defendant O’Neal has agreed to provide $1,800,000 in monetary relief in exchange for reaching this early settlement, which amount will be paid within 30 days after the effective date of the settlement.” However, the agreement between the parties is still pending approval from the court. O’Neal and other marquee celebrities – such as fellow NBA superstar Stephen Curry, NFL quarterbacks Tom Brady and Trevor Lawrence, MLB pitcher Shohei Ohtani, Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary, and supermodel Gisele Bündchen – were all accused of failing to perform due diligence before promoting FTX in a class action lawsuit filed in 2022. O’Neal, who received $750,000 to endorse the crypto exchange, first agreed to a settlement in April, though the amount at the time was undisclosed. Bankman-Fried was found guilty of his crimes in 2023 and was sentenced to 25 years behind bars in 2024.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-22-analyst-says-2-region-is-the-next-biting-nails-phase-heres-why/,"In a direct message to XRP investors, analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) revisited his 2022 technical analysis that forecasted a long-term target of $22. At the time of the post, XRP was trading at just $0.37. Now, with the price standing at $2.14, the analyst believes that investors who failed to buy earlier are not the only ones at risk of missing out. His latest comment suggests that today’s $2 region will soon be seen as another missed opportunity. He highlighted how many had ignored XRP’s potential when it traded below $0.40, and pointed out that hesitation may repeat itself even as XRP continues its upward trend. #XRP – was 0.37c But TA was presenting $22. Now If I take you back in Time will buy #XRP At 0.37c I know many of you are biting there nails right now. Trust me 2$ region is the next biting nails phase. ONLY FEW https://t.co/aajvaDtjTz — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 13, 2025 Cup and Handle Structure Points to Much Higher Targets The chart originally shared by EGRAG in August 2022 remains central to his prediction. It shows a clear long-term cup and handle formation beginning in 2018, with XRP eventually breaking above key technical thresholds and setting the stage for higher extensions. According to Fibonacci levels drawn on the chart, the most prominent long-term price targets lie well above the current $2 range. Among these targets, $4.3792 (Fib. 1.414) is notable as it sits close to the $4.22 target recently set by another well-known analyst. $6.49 at the 1.618 Fibonacci extension is another notable target, and the targets continue climbing until the potential peak at $45.03 (Fib. 2.618), another target he has previously set for the asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, EGRAG has emphasized $22.99 as a major psychological and structural target within this setup. He recently predicted that the asset could reach this level by December , and previously noted that while the road may be “stumbly,” the structure provides a roadmap that supports this outlook. With XRP now firmly above the $1.10–$1.50 zone, which his earlier chart labeled as pivotal, the asset’s breakout confirms his earlier projections. Attention has now shifted fully to price targets beyond $2, with no technical relevance remaining below that level in his current narrative. The Fear of Buying Late EGRAG’s message reveals a recurring dynamic in crypto markets where investors often fail to act when assets are undervalued and become paralyzed by doubt when prices rise. Meanwhile, prominent voices in the crypto space have repeatedly advised investors to buy XRP and wait rather than waiting to buy. According to the analyst, waiting on the sidelines now may result in regret later, just as it did in 2022, and anyone looking to profit from the crypto market needs to get in early.

Filed in a Florida federal court, the proposed agreement would end a class action lawsuit that accused the former NBA star of promoting FTX as a safe and reliable investment, particularly through high-profile events and social media campaigns. All-Inclusive Deal The plaintiffs in the case are FTX users who deposited funds or purchased the exchange’s proprietary token, FTT, between May 2019 and late 2022. During this period, the company had aggressively expanded its reach through celebrity endorsements. Unlike other endorsers such as Tom Brady, Steph Curry, and Naomi Osaka, whose cases were mostly dismissed or unresolved, O’Neal remained legally entangled after a prolonged effort to serve him court papers. While O’Neal denies any wrongdoing, the proposed settlement is structured to be final. The entire amount will cover attorney fees, administrative costs, and payments to affected investors. The agreement also prevents him from pursuing compensation from the FTX bankruptcy estate – a clause that effectively severs any future legal or financial entanglement with the case. FTX, once the world’s third-largest crypto exchange, imploded in 2022 amid allegations that its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried , misused billions in customer deposits. In March 2024, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison, while the company has since claimed that it will be able to repay most users. Final Chapter O’Neal had previously distanced himself from crypto markets, stating in interviews that he lacked understanding of the technology and was simply a paid spokesperson. Despite this, his involvement in promotional content, especially during FTX’s final stages, became a central element in the lawsuit, which argued that his celebrity endorsement contributed to the public perception of FTX as a legitimate investment. The deal would not only bring closure to O’Neal’s involvement but also establish a precedent for how high-profile celebrity endorsements in the crypto industry may be scrutinized moving forward, if approved by the court. Meanwhile, the payment is due within 30 days of judicial approval, closing a chapter on O’Neal’s ties to one of crypto’s most notorious failures.

With stronger fundamentals and a higher return on investment (ROI) potential, this blockchain-AI hybrid project is rapidly becoming an attractive choice for forward-looking investors. Tron (TRX): A Pioneering Platform in Decentralized Content Since its launch in 2017, Tron (TRX) has been a major force in the blockchain ecosystem. The platform was built to decentralize the internet, allowing content creators to bypass intermediaries and monetize their work directly. Tron’s scalability and ability to process up to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) have contributed to its adoption across various industries, particularly entertainment. One of Tron’s most notable achievements was acquiring BitTorrent, a move that empowered its ecosystem with decentralized content-sharing capabilities. It has also gained recognition through partnerships with major brands like Samsung. However, with new projects such as Ruvi AI bringing fresh innovation and practical utility to the table, Tron faces increasing competition in the race for relevance and investor interest. Cyberscope Audit One of Ruvi AI’s key differentiators is its focus on transparency. The project is currently undergoing an audit by Cyberscope, a highly regarded blockchain security firm. This audit encompasses a thorough review of Ruvi AI’s code and smart contract infrastructure, providing investors with assurance about the platform’s integrity. This commitment to building trust establishes Ruvi AI as a credible competitor to longstanding platforms like Tron. By taking steps to ensure security and reliability, the project appeals to both retail and institutional investors looking for safer choices in the cryptocurrency market. Momentum Builds Through a Successful Presale Ruvi AI’s presale performance demonstrates its immense potential. Phase 1 of the presale sold out in just two weeks at a price of $0.010 per token. When Phase 2 launched, with tokens priced at $0.015, early investors saw a 50% gain on their initial investment. To date, Ruvi AI has garnered over 1,600 holders and raised $1.7 million in funding. Adding to its milestones, Ruvi AI has secured its first exchange listing and partnered with a reputable trading platform, ensuring liquidity and accessibility. With more announcements expected in the near future, investors are keeping a close eye on the project’s progress. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Pioneering Blockchain-AI Synergy Ruvi AI merges the benefits of blockchain with the power of artificial intelligence (AI), making it a standout project with wide applicability. The platform functions as a decentralized superapp, enabling users to generate AI-driven content, including text, audio, video, and images. This unique combination has positioned Ruvi AI to disrupt industries ranging from marketing to creative production and automation. The $RUVI token lies at the heart of this advanced ecosystem, enabling a range of functions, from staking rewards to governance participation and premium feature access. Unlike projects driven by speculation, Ruvi AI’s focus on utility makes it a compelling choice for both businesses and individual users. Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI’s Presale Ruvi AI’s tiered presale system offers lucrative opportunities for early participants. Below are the potential returns for three VIP levels, based on the $0.015 presale price, a $0.07 listing price, and a post-launch $1 valuation: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI ($750 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $4,900 (553% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI ($1,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $11,200 (647% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI ($7,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $70,000 (833% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $1,000,000 (13,233% ROI). These scenarios highlight Ruvi AI’s immense potential to generate exponential returns for early investors. Why Ruvi AI is a Smart Investment Ruvi AI combines blockchain innovation with AI, addressing real-world challenges and adding tangible value to the crypto space. Its successful presale, transparent auditing process, and commitment to utility make it a standout project that could redefine the industry. Analysts predict Ruvi AI will emerge as a major player in 2025, offering higher ROI potential and stronger fundamentals than competitors like Tron. For investors looking to secure a position in this groundbreaking initiative, the time to act is now. Take advantage of the presale to maximize growth potential while the opportunity lasts.

Dalio says in a new post on X that there’s always a “current most popular meme” that everyone believes in but is bound to lose its status. “These memes typically are due to a mix of extrapolating what happened before and emotional considerations. Also, most investors typically don’t take into consideration market pricing. In other words, they tend to identify what has been a great investment (e.g., a strongly performing company) as great, and they don’t pay enough attention to its pricing, even though its pricing (whether it is cheap or expensive) is the most important thing.” Dalio says this behavior sets the stage for potential market missteps, especially in the current economic climate. At this time, it is typical for almost everyone to be looking to make money by buying assets that they believe will go up (rather than betting on them going down), and they quite often use leverage.” Dalio’s meme trading advice follows dire warnings he’s recently issued about the US economy. Earlier this month, Dalio argued in an interview on PBS that the government needs to lower its budget deficit as a percentage of GDP from 7% to 3%. “It has to be done with three things, and it has to be spread out among these three things, because any one of those three things would be too painful. Those three things are tax revenue, spending cuts and interest rates. Although Congress and the president in the process does not deal directly with the third of those, right now a trillion dollars – half of our deficit – is interest payments, and not only do we have a trillion dollar interest payment, in the next year, we have nine trillion dollars of debt maturing that has to be either rolled over or sold… So there’s what I call my 3%, three-part solution, which was very similar to 1991-1998. It was cut by 5% of GDP, the budget deficit, in those years was cut by 5% of GDP by spreading it around. So those are the three things that are needed.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

More than 537 million worth of SHIB coins have been taken out of circulation. This caused the burn rate to jump by 3,484%, a massive increase from the day before. This turn of events has made the SHIB community more hopeful for the token’s future. This came after the SHIB ecosystem improved its decentralized finance (DeFi) toolkit. Massive Token Burn Fuels Shiba Inu Price Jump Burning coins usually helps reduce the total supply, making the remaining coins more valuable. Following this large burn, SHIB’s price increased by 4.12%, trading at $0.000012, and its total market value crossed $7.2 billion. This price bounce came shortly after SHIB dropped by 10% earlier in the week. This drop was caused mainly by a bigger dip in the crypto market, which reacted to rising tensions between Israel and Iran. Furthermore, Shibburn tracking platform shows that the recent increase in SHIB’s burn rate continues a trend seen earlier this week. In a notable move, one wallet alone burned over 500 million SHIB in the past 12 hours. The Shiba Inu community has used token burning to help support long-term value. As SHIB’s price went up, its future open interest rose by over 4%, reaching $141.85 million. According to Coinglass data, traders are showing more confidence in SHIB’s short-term performance. A rise in open interest usually means more trading activity and a stronger belief in the token’s direction. This geopolitical tension also shook the entire crypto market. Bitcoin’s price (BTC) dropped 2.8% after the incident , falling from $106,042 to $103,053. However, the flagship crypto seems to be back on a bullish path. According to CoinMarketCap data, it is trading at $105,092 at the time of writing, up 0.27% in the past 24 hours. SHIB Whale Activity Drops Despite Price Uptick Even though the token burn and price rise are good signs, data shows that large-scale SHIB holders are pulling back . In the past 24 hours, large transaction volume has dropped 65%. Wallets with at least $100,000 worth of SHIB have seen a significant slowdown in activity. This points to weakening interest among big investors, possibly due to recent market uncertainty. On June 6, the enormous transaction volume hit 17.63 trillion SHIB. However, this has dropped to just 948.59 billion SHIB, showing that many big investors are pulling away. Experts say if larger investors continue to reduce their holdings, it may put downward pressure on the SHIB price. Still, if the burn rate remains high and market confidence improves, SHIB could regain strength.

However, this dream hit a major stumbling block after geopolitical tensions quickly escalated in the late hours of Thursday, June 13. It didn’t take much time for Israel’s airstrike against Iran to impact the global financial markets, with crypto prices succumbing to a fresh wave of downward pressure. Specifically, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has lost about 6% of its value in the past 24 hours. Is Capital Flowing Out Of ETH Into BTC? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha shared fresh insights into the wave of volatility that recently hit the cryptocurrency market. The crypto pundit noted that Ethereum and Bitcoin were particularly impacted by the recent global happenings. Related Reading: A Rare Bitcoin Signal Is Flashing: Could the Bull Run Just Be Getting Started? Firstly, Taha noted the decline in the Ethereum Open Interest (OI) on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the ETH OI metric experienced a significant 19% dip in the past 24 hours, coinciding with a decrease in price. The Open Interest indicator estimates the total amount of money flowing into derivatives of a specific cryptocurrency at any given time. A falling OI value is often considered a bearish signal, as it suggests a decline in investor confidence and positive sentiment. According to Taha, this latest abrupt decline in the Ethereum Open Interest points to a wave of panic-induced selling, with investors instinctively exiting their long positions. “Traders likely rushed to close their long positions, either manually in fear of deeper losses or automatically via forced liquidations as stop-loss triggers were hit,” the analyst said. Taha drew a parallel relationship between the falling Ethereum Open Interest and the flow of Bitcoin out of Coinbase, the largest centralized exchange in the United States. CryptoQuant data shows a significant withdrawal of 7,000 BTC from the trading platform in the past day. According to Taha, this substantial exchange outflow of Bitcoin, coinciding precisely with the Ethereum OI decline, suggests fresh buying and that large investors may be strategically repositioning for accumulation. This trend might not be particularly positive for ETH, as it shows that capital might be rotating back into the premier cryptocurrency. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,546, reflecting an almost 4% decline in the past 24 hours.

According to crypto analytics platform Santiment , wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH — referred to as whale and shark wallets — have added a net total of 1.49 million ETH over the past 30 days. This group increased its combined holdings by 3.72% and now controls 26.98% of the total ether supply. Santiment noted that while smaller, retail-driven wallets have been taking profits, these large holders have steadily accumulated. The divergence in behavior highlights growing long-term conviction among ether's key stakeholders, even as retail sentiment appears to be wavering following recent price declines. At the same time, U.S.-listed spot Ethereum ETFs registered $2.2 million in net outflows on Friday, marking the end of a 19-day inflow streak. The reversal, as confirmed by data from Farside Investors , is the first sign of slowing institutional demand via these ETFs since late May. Still, ether's broader structure remains intact. Following a pullback from recent highs near $2,870, ETH continues to hold above a historically significant support zone near $2,500. The persistent accumulation by whale and shark wallets may provide an important floor for price, particularly if macro conditions stabilize and regulatory clarity improves. Technical Analysis Highlights Ether traded between $2,499.39 and $2,580.53 over the past 24 hours. Price peaked near $2,580 in the early hours before entering a steady decline. The token briefly dipped below $2,500 before bouncing to close near $2,518.76. Late-session volume surged, particularly around 17:30–18:00 GMT, coinciding with the rebound. Support appears to be forming around $2,500, a key psychological and technical level.

Kaanch with its state-of-the-art Layer 1 infrastructure has the potential to beat the competition, and this makes it an attractive investment opportunity with high potential in a fast-changing environment. Ethereum’s Stagnation Opens the Door for Kaanch’s Rise Source- X Ethereum’s Struggle: Can It Keep Up? Ethereum is currently changing hands at $2,530.23 after falling by 0.36 percent in the last 24 hours. The network continues to grapple with the problem of high gas prices and transaction delays. The outflows in Ethereum ETF of -2 million on June 13, 2025, versus +302 million in Bitcoin ETF, show its decreasing market momentum. These drawbacks reveal a major loophole in the scalability-affordability aspect, which allows new-age blockchains such as Kaanch to take over the market. Kaanch’s Lightning-Fast Technology Crushes Competition Kaanch Outpaces All: 1.4M TPS Leaves Ethereum in the Dust Kaanch Network sets a new standard in blockchain performance with an unprecedented 1.4 million transactions per second (TPS) and 0.8 second finality, making it 100 times faster than Ethereum and guaranteeing trades are executed instantly and smart contracts flow smoothly. With near-zero gas fees, unlike Ethereum and Solana, Kaanch is well suited to dApps, microtransactions, and payments. The network, secured by 3,600 decentralized nodes, is unrivaled in terms of security and scalability, making it the platform of choice by enterprises and developers looking to get cost-effective solutions. Presale Frenzy: Don’t Miss Kaanch’s Explosive Growth Kaanch’s Presale Surge: 23000% Gains Await Early Investors. Kaanch tokens are currently available in Stage 6 of its presale at a price of $0.32, which will increase by 100 percent to $0.64 in the following stage. Having raised $2,193,177, the project signals strong investor demand. Kaanch has a fixed supply of 58 million tokens, ensuring low dilution, and the upcoming listing on Bitmart at a price of $30 per token is bound to blast off liquidity. The presale allows investors to purchase using ETH or USDT and live stake up to 30% APY. Investors who are interested in this project should visit the Kaanch presale website and purchase some of the presale which is moving quickly before the prices skyrocket. Kaanch’s Ironclad Security and Real-World Impact Kaanch’s Fortified Future: Audited and Asset-Ready. Kaanch is audited by SpyWolf and VerifyLab, making it safe and transparent to investors. Its emphasis on real world asset tokenization (including assets such as gold, real estate and digital bonds) differentiates it against competitors who are challenged with practical use cases. Its enterprise-friendly design is further bolstered by the .knch domain system and wallet verification, making Kaanch a leader in secure, scalable blockchain integration for businesses and individuals. Community Power Fuels Kaanch’s Meteoric Rise Kaanch’s Community Edge: Governance That Outshines Rivals. The transparent governance and accessible staking dashboard of Kaanch will enable the community and lead to long-term stability and participation. Kaanch will outperform Ethereum and Solana due to the analysts predicting a possible 23,000% increase in value after listing because of its scarcity and the use of AI to power smart contracts. With the BitMart listing at the end of June 2025, Kaanch is poised to make a huge entry into the market, and this is the opportune moment that investors should pounce on. Conclusion The advanced technology, the bombastic presale momentum, and the practical use of Kaanch Network make it an outstanding project of 2025. With Ethereum struggling with resistance and scalability problems, Kaanch high speed low cost solutions present an attractive alternative. Those interested in investing in it, as it is projected to grow by 23,000 percent, would be wise to hurry up and purchase some tokens before the presale is over and it gets listed on BitMart to gain even more traction in the market.

Describing the development as a potential shift away from reliance on the U.S. dollar, FinanceBro points to a proposal within the XRPL ecosystem that could revolutionize how enterprises engage with digital assets and payments. This growing narrative is more than hype. It reflects a deepening interest in blockchain technology by traditional corporations, who now recognize the potential of decentralized platforms like the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to facilitate secure, fast, and cost-efficient financial operations. The move suggests that the future of corporate finance may be far more blockchain-native than previously imagined. MUST SEE: CORPORATIONS LAUNCHING THEIR OWN CURRENCIES ON THE #XRP LEDGER!! PROPOSAL GETS RIDE OF USD!! pic.twitter.com/jawRjdQ5ZF — FinanceBro (@FinanceBroYT) June 13, 2025 The XRP Ledger: A Corporate-Friendly Infrastructure The XRP Ledger has long distinguished itself through its speed, scalability, and minimal transaction fees. Unlike most blockchains, it settles transactions in under five seconds, a trait that aligns perfectly with the high-frequency, high-volume needs of enterprise-grade operations. More importantly, the XRPL is designed to support the issuance of tokens—both fungible and non-fungible—making it an ideal platform for launching company-specific stablecoins or internal currencies. This isn’t merely theoretical. Ripple, the developer behind much of XRPL’s core infrastructure, has been actively expanding use cases for tokenized assets, including the launch of its stablecoin, RLUSD, in December 2024. RLUSD is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and is backed by U.S. dollar deposits and short-term U.S. Treasuries. The XRPL has recently welcomed several fiat‑backed tokens, including XSGD (Singapore dollar), EURØP (euro), USDB (Brazilian real), and others. Notably, Circle’s USDC, pegged to the U.S. dollar, has also been launched on XRPL as of June 12, enhancing its on‑chain liquidity and enterprise utility. Meanwhile, Ondo Finance introduced a $693 million treasury-backed token (OUSG) on XRPL , illustrating a growing appetite for real-world asset tokenization. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Corporate Currencies: A Strategic Shift? The notion of corporations issuing their digital currencies on XRPL signals a more transformative trend. Companies may no longer want to rely exclusively on fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. Instead, by issuing their own tokenized representations of value, they can unlock powerful efficiencies in supply chains, customer loyalty programs, and international payments. Such tokens could be tailored to specific ecosystems. For example, a global retailer might issue a branded token redeemable for goods and services within its stores, usable for rewards, or transferable between users. Likewise, multinational manufacturers could tokenize invoice settlements across their global vendor networks, slashing delays and foreign exchange costs. These digital assets would be launched on a public yet enterprise-ready ledger like XRPL, allowing for interoperability, transparency, and regulatory compliance, features that are increasingly in demand amid evolving financial oversight. A Quiet Revolution Underway The XRPL’s native support for token creation, combined with increasing institutional interest, is paving the way for a new class of corporate currencies. What once seemed like a fringe concept is quickly gaining traction—and may soon become a cornerstone of how businesses operate in the digital age. While it’s too early to say how widespread or rapid this shift will be, the trajectory is clear: corporations are no longer content with merely adopting crypto; they’re beginning to create it. And the XRP Ledger appears to be their platform of choice. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The asset briefly slipped to $0.6176 before stabilizing, holding its footing despite a sharp wave of selling from large holders. According to recent market data, whales have offloaded over 270 million ADA —worth roughly $170 million — in a move that has added significant pressure to the token’s price action during a week marked by geopolitical volatility. Yet, amid the sell-off, the Cardano Foundation unveiled a new product aimed at enterprise adoption. On Thursday, the organization launched Originate , a blockchain-based solution for verifying product origin and authenticity. Designed to help businesses streamline compliance and protect against counterfeits, Originate allows companies to digitize and track critical product data on-chain, enabling instant verification by consumers and regulators. On its website, the Foundation emphasized that Originate is built to strengthen brand trust in industries where supply chain transparency is critical. By positioning itself as a tool for regulatory compliance and consumer assurance, the product may help bolster Cardano’s reputation in enterprise circles —especially at a time when investors are searching for real-world use cases beyond DeFi and staking. The announcement comes just days after ADA was added to the Nasdaq Crypto Index , joining Bitcoin and Ethereum. While short-term sentiment remains fragile due to whale behavior and broader risk-off macro trends, Cardano’s expanding institutional profile could provide longer-term support. Technical Analysis Highlights ADA ranged between $0.6176 and $0.6428, closing near $0.6229, a 1.71% daily loss. Resistance remains strong near $0.642–$0.645, while price broke below support at $0.636. Heaviest volume spikes occurred after 18:00 GMT as price dipped below $0.62, triggering brief sell-off followed by consolidation. Trend remains bearish with lower highs forming throughout the day, and rejection at $0.635.

Institutional whispers, on-chain wallet activity, and strategic buys all point to a quiet accumulation of a few top tokens, and XRP and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are front and center. While XRP continues to cement its place as a utility-driven asset with cross-border appeal, it’s the explosive upside of MUTM, still trading under $0.03, that’s triggering real FOMO among early movers. The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 12,000 investors. More than $10.5 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 2x profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. Some analysts are already tagging it as the best crypto to buy in 2025, predicting a potential breakout to $1 or beyond. As investors ask what to buy before June ends, these two tokens are rising fast on the smart money radar. XRP Consolidates Around $2.30 Ahead of Key Catalysts XRP is trading near $2.30, navigating a tight range between $2.27 and $2.32 with intraday volatility remaining subdued. On‑chain activity has surged, with daily active addresses spiking over 1,600%, indicating increased investor engagement, while futures open interest confirms heightened institutional positioning. Facing resistance at approximately $2.50 and key support around $2.20, XRP is approaching a critical inflection point tied to the upcoming June 16 legal ruling and rising ETF anticipation. The market’s neutral tone reflects a cautious wait-and-see stance, though positive outcomes could catalyze a sharp breakout. A secondary narrative has emerged alongside XRP’s consolidation, as speculative interest builds in smaller-cap tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) under current market conditions. Mutuum Finance Presale Skyrockets: $10.4M Raised and 11,900 Investors Can’t Be Wrong Mutuum Finance is rapidly carving its place in the DeFi lending space, having already attracted over $10.5 million and built a thriving community of 12,000+ holders. Right now MUTM tokens are available at just $0.03 but in the next presale round prices will jump to $0.035 meaning anyone who buys now locks in an instant 16.67% profit. When Mutuum officially launches at $0.06 early investors could see a massive 100% gain. This is the kind of growth that DeFi investors dream about. The Power of Dual Lending: Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Models Changing the Game Mutuum Finance’s secret weapon is its hybrid lending system that blends: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Lock your USDT into smart-contract-driven liquidity pools and earn passive income, no hassle, all automated. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Cut out the middleman and lend or borrow directly, with full control and privacy over loan terms. This combination gives users unmatched flexibility, privacy, and competitive yields, putting Mutuum ahead of the pack. Built on Trust: Certik-Audited & Backed by a Stable USD-Pegged Coin Security is vital in crypto and Mutuum Finance delivers. Its open-source smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by Certik, one of the blockchain industry’s top security firms. On top of that, Mutuum is creating a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on Ethereum, designed to maintain long-term price stability and avoid the collapse risks that have tanked algorithmic stablecoins. Huge Rewards for Early Backers To reward its earliest supporters, the platform is hosting a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will each win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This is your chance to join a thriving community earn amazing rewards and ride the wave of what could be the next big DeFi success story. Smart money is quietly stacking XRP and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) before the altseason. XRP hovers near $2.30 as legal and ETF catalysts approach. Meanwhile, MUTM, at just $0.03, has raised $10.5M+ from 12,000+ investors, with a launch price set at $0.06, a guaranteed 100% ROI.

According to Swissblock, Bitcoin is “stalling below $110,000” and the upward trend is now under pressure as a broad trading range appears to form between the resistance level and a price of $100,000. “Consolidation may last, but one thing’s clear: No breakout without strong fundamentals.” Source: Swissblock/X Bitcoin is trading at $104,447 at time of writing, around 7% below the all-time high of just under $112,000 reached last month. Earlier in the week, Swissblock had warned that a failure by Bitcoin to break out amid a lack of fresh investor flows could lead to a double-top. A double-top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern formed when the price of an asset forms two consecutive peaks, an indication that there’s a strong resistance level that the price is unable to pierce through. Source: Swissblock/X According to Bitcoin Vector, a joint report by Swissblock and on-chain analyst Willy Woo, BTC liquidity has been trending lower for the past couple of days, an indication of falling volume levels, a declining number of transactions and reduced activity. But Bitcoin Vector says a further correction is unlikely. “Here’s the interesting part: network growth remains stable, participants are not leaving the market.

Yet, a surprising force is now breaking through the ranks: BlockDAG. After raising over a staggering $303 million in its presale, BlockDAG has not only caught the eye of retail and institutional investors alike, it has shifted the very structure of what many considered the best altcoins to watch this year. While XRP continues to flirt with technical breakouts and Stellar builds on its cross-border payments ecosystem, BlockDAG has detonated a presale shockwave that’s impossible to ignore. With batch 29 now underway and the launch price confirmed at $0.05, the momentum behind BlockDAG’s rise is unmistakable, and it’s far from finished. XRP: Price Momentum Signals a Possible Breakout XRP has reignited bullish interest, hovering around the $2.29 mark as technical indicators point toward a possible breakout. Traders are closely watching the $2.40–$2.50 resistance zone, a stubborn ceiling that XRP has struggled to breach in recent months. A key catalyst here is the formation of a mini-golden cross, with the 50-day EMA crossing above the 100-day EMA, a classic signal of upward momentum. This technical alignment, combined with a tightening triangle pattern and declining volume, suggests that the XRP market is coiled for a sharp move. If volume returns, many expect a clean push toward $2.60 or even $2.80. The current XRP price momentum reflects renewed trader confidence as Ripple continues to weather regulatory uncertainty. While past rallies have fizzled at resistance, the technical space now appears more favorable, making XRP a name to watch again among the best altcoins in 2025. Stellar (XLM): Expanding Use Cases Fuel Market Outlook Stellar (XLM) continues to build bullish credibility as its price hovers above $0.28, up 3% in the past day. Momentum is being driven by a surge in both investor trust and ecosystem expansion. The Stellar (XLM) market outlook remains strong thanks to continued traction from institutional players, with its third year of partnership with MoneyGram facilitating $30 million in transactions. Technical indicators are also optimistic, with on-chain metrics showing rising volume and growing developer activity. XLM’s Soroban smart contract platform has driven a 7x spike in activity, and the network now boasts ISO 20022 compliance, increasing its appeal in European regulatory circles. A $100 million developer fund and ongoing integrations with stablecoin platforms like Rain further enhance its real-world utility. While regulatory overhang in the U.S. poses risk, Stellar’s cross-border use case and tokenization ambitions ensure its continued inclusion among the best altcoins for forward-looking investors. BlockDAG Rockets Toward the Top with Over $303M Raised in Presale With over $303 million raised, BlockDAG is now cemented as one of the most financially successful presales of 2025. This fundraising figure becomes even more surprising when considering that the project is still in batch 29, with thousands of new users joining its ecosystem each week. At its current presale price of $0.0276, BlockDAG is offering early investors a chance to lock in what many are calling a “pre-launch discount,” especially as the confirmed launch price sits at $0.05. That’s a significant increase baked in for early holders, before even considering post-launch momentum. But BlockDAG isn’t just about aggressive pricing. The project’s DAG-based Layer 1 architecture enables ultra-high throughput, low latency, and full EVM compatibility, making it a prime destination for both DeFi developers and enterprise-grade apps. Its X1 mobile mining app, already downloaded by over 2 million users, introduces a Proof-of-Engagement model that lowers the entry barrier for everyday users while maintaining network decentralization. Perhaps most intriguing: BlockDAG has teased a major sponsorship with the USA, a cultural alignment that could propel the project into mainstream visibility and global entertainment markets. This fusion of sports, tech, and tokenomics could give BlockDAG the brand leverage most crypto projects can only dream of. In this context, BlockDAG’s $303 million raise isn’t just impressive, it signals a major shift in investor trust and market positioning. It hints at far more than hype: a foundation for long-term dominance, mainstream adoption, and potential disruption across the altcoin space. This could be just the beginning.. Bottom Line: A New Order May Be Forming As BlockDAG crosses the $300 million mark, its gravity is impossible to ignore. While XRP price momentum holds promise and the Stellar (XLM) market outlook builds on real-world use cases, BlockDAG is doing something neither has achieved in 2025: capturing liquidity, headlines, and users simultaneously. The coming weeks will be critical. If BlockDAG delivers on its technology with the strength it promises, bolstered by five confirmed exchange listings and growing USA speculation, it may not only join the best altcoins list but leapfrog to the top. For now, XRP and XLM remain strong. But with BlockDAG’s show stopping performance, their dominance is no longer guaranteed.

46021433,https://timestabloid.com/?p=71027,1749931288,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Proponent: Nobody Can Stop What’s Coming for XRP,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-proponent-nobody-can-stop-whats-coming-for-xrp/,"The XRP community is once again buzzing with anticipation following a bold declaration from Edo Farina, a prominent XRP advocate and CEO of Alpha Lions Academy. In a recent post on X, Farina declared , “Nobody can stop what’s coming for XRP,” reigniting excitement about what many believe is an inevitable breakout for the digital asset. While the statement may seem ambitious, it reflects a growing sentiment among XRP supporters who view current developments, both legal and technological, as setting the stage for a significant surge in value and adoption. XRP’s Road to Regulatory Clarity Farina’s statement comes at a pivotal time for XRP. Ripple, the company closely associated with cryptocurrency, is nearing the final phase of its long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As previously reported, legal experts such as John Deaton have argued that Ripple’s strong legal standing could set a precedent, influencing future cases involving other crypto assets. In their latest joint court filing, the SEC and Ripple are requesting an “indicative ruling” to determine if Judge Torres would approve a revised settlement proposal. If granted, this could bring a formal close to a lawsuit that has held XRP back for over four years. Catalysts Fueling the XRP Breakout Narrative Farina’s confidence in XRP’s trajectory is not without reason. Recent technical and fundamental developments suggest that the asset may be preparing for a significant move. On the infrastructure side, Ripple has successfully launched its stablecoin, RLUSD, marking a bold foray into the digital dollar space. This not only enhances liquidity on the XRP Ledger but also increases the potential use cases for XRP in cross-border payments and DeFi applications. At the same time, the XRPL ecosystem is expanding rapidly. As reported earlier by TimesTabloid, multiple enterprises are exploring the creation of tokenized assets, including stablecoins, on the XRP Ledger. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This wave of adoption aligns with Ripple’s long-term vision of positioning XRPL as a core infrastructure for the tokenized economy. With more corporate interest flowing in and with Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions growing, the network is steadily becoming a critical backbone for blockchain-based finance. Community Optimism and Institutional Interest XRP’s recent price action may not fully reflect the underlying momentum, but many see this as the calm before the storm . Farina’s assertion resonates with the belief that once the legal uncertainty lifts and macro adoption initiatives mature, XRP could experience a dramatic price revaluation. Analysts have also observed that XRP’s current trading range mirrors consolidation patterns seen before past explosive moves, adding weight to the bullish narrative. Central bank trials involving RippleNet and increasing institutional integrations across corridors in the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America all bolster confidence in XRP’s long-term viability. The Calm Before the Storm? Whether Farina’s prophetic tone will prove accurate remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: momentum around XRP is building across multiple fronts. With legal closure on the horizon, network upgrades in motion, and real-world adoption accelerating, XRP may be poised for a breakout that few saw coming, but that its supporters have long awaited.

The hedge fund boss said he believes the asset is moving from speculative territory into something more foundational, with price behavior starting to look closer to legacy markets. Laffont explained that Coatue had initially avoided bitcoin because of how unstable it used to be. But now, the math is changing. “It’s intriguing to me that maybe … the cost of getting into bitcoin is shrinking,” he said. “If the beta shrinks, that would be very interesting.” The term beta is used to compare an asset’s volatility to the broader market. Institutions buy in as behavior of holders changes Laffont pointed out that Bitcoin has climbed almost 13% so far in 2025. That’s not what stood out to him, though. What mattered more was how price movements now feel more controlled than in previous years. In 2022, bitcoin lost more than 60% of its value while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 33%. It was one of those years that kept Coatue on the sidelines. Fast forward to April 2025, after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs, and the picture looked very different. From April 2 to April 10, bitcoin dropped about 5%, while the Nasdaq fell over 6%. That’s the kind of performance that signals a maturing asset. He said this improvement in behavior wasn’t just about price. It’s about the people holding it. Laffont noted that there’s been a sharp decline in the number of bitcoin wallets that sell their entire holdings after just one month. “That’s come down a lot,” he said . Instead of trading in and out, more holders are staying in for the long run. That’s a critical change in market dynamics, especially when it comes to institutional comfort. Another sign of that change? Big names are getting involved. Laffont mentioned BlackRock, saying the firm played a leading role in bringing bitcoin ETFs to the market. That kind of participation wasn’t possible until recently. Now that the biggest asset managers are getting behind it, more institutions are following. Laffont believes this is pushing bitcoin toward becoming a necessary part of portfolios. He said the asset only represents about $2 trillion out of the world’s $500 trillion in total wealth. That’s still a tiny share. But if people keep valuing it, he argued, it “has to become more central.” The growth potential, by his measure, is still huge. Laffont admits missing the early wave and tells others not to overdo it Coatue hasn’t stayed completely out of crypto. Laffont said the firm has investments in both private and public companies in the space, including Dune Analytics, Hut 8, and CoreWeave. CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure firm, works with bitcoin miner Core Scientific. Still, Laffont made it clear he regrets not going deeper into bitcoin itself. “Every night, I wake up at about three in the morning and I go, ‘What an idiot. Why didn’t I invest more in bitcoin?’” he said. He blamed his delay on overthinking. Laffont said he used to focus too much on complex theories and debates about use cases. But the core truth was simple: value grows when people believe in it. “As long as other people think it’s valuable, it gets more valuable over time – and that’s what we missed,” he said. Now, he said he tells investors to consider putting “one or two or 3% or 4%” of their assets into bitcoin as a way to protect themselves from inflation. He also described how his clients fall into three groups. There are the ones who trust him and don’t ask questions. Then there are the ones who confront him with “Why did you miss one of the biggest trends in the world?” And finally, there are the cautious ones who are still uncomfortable with anything crypto-related. “That,” Laffont said, “is the dying population.” He said those people are getting fewer every year. Even as Laffont has warmed up to bitcoin , he still warned people not to make it the center of their portfolios. “For those of you that think bitcoin is going to be important, my recommendation is never make it such a big portion of your portfolio that it becomes the driving factor of the portfolio,” he said.

As financial markets reacted to this news, Bitcoin prices dipped to below $103,000 before experiencing a modest rebound to climb into the $105,000 price band. Notably, top market analyst Ali Martinez has observed that the premier cryptocurrency must maintain a particular support line to avoid a major correction based on the active trading channel. $100,000 Support Key To Bitcoin Bull Challenge In an X post on June 13, Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price movement. The expert reveals that BTC has stylishly maintained a range-bound movement since 2024 amidst major price surges and extended market corrections. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops Below $105K as Binance Net Taker Volume Turns Deep Red Over the last six months, Martinez’s analysis shows that Bitcoin has largely traded between $78,500 and $110,000, establishing multiple vital support and resistance levels within this corridor. During this period, the maiden cryptocurrency has famously retested the upper boundary five times while bouncing off the lower boundary four times. Following Bitcoin’s most recent crash and the propensity for higher market volatility, especially with the potential of a full-scale war in the Middle East, Martinez warns it is critical for Bitcoin bulls to maintain a price point above the $100,000 level, which represents the next major support level in the market. The analyst explains that in line with price behavior within a set trading channel, a decisive close below the $100,000 price point strongly increases the chances for a price return to the lower boundary at $78,500. This situation presents a potential 25% price devaluation for current BTC holdings. On the other hand, maintaining price action above $100,000 keeps bullish momentum intact and raises the probability of a retest of the $110,000 resistance zone, perhaps with the hope of a decisive price breakout beyond the trading channel. However, a breakdown below $100,000 would not necessarily trigger an immediate correction to $78,500. Notably, Martinez’s analysis reveals that support levels at $92,000 and $86,000 could provide Bitcoin bulls with ample opportunity to reassert market control. BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $105,194 following a 1.79% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is up by 37.04%, indicating a boost in market transactions and general trading activity. With a market cap of $2.07 trillion, Bitcoin remains the crypto market leader with an impressive 62.75% dominance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern?

This comes due to the growing concerns over a rise in yields on superlong bonds. Since last summer, the central bank has slowed down the buying of Japanese government bonds by 400 billion yen ($2.8 billion) every three months. This was meant to counteract the effects of quantitative tightening. However, because of the bond market’s volatility, the BOJ’s policy board is planning to discuss slowing down the process by half to 200 billion yen per quarter. The yield on 30-year bonds hit a record high of 3.2% last month. This was due to a buyers’ strike that is still going on among local life insurers. But even though they have since dropped to about 2.9%, many experts still see the BoJ in a tough spot because it has been slowing down its long-term bond-buying program. The board will meet on Monday and Tuesday, and most members are expected to back the tapering slowdown. Meanwhile, the current plan for buying JGB will stay in place until March of next year. The bank is expected to hold the policy rate steady at 0.5%. Tapering of bond purchases by the BOJ increases the yields The BOJ began unprecedented quantitative easing in 2013 to pump money into the economy with massive JGB purchases. In September 2016, it added yield curve control to its tools. By buying bonds, long-term rates were kept low. In March 2024, the bank moved toward adjusting its policy. It stopped buying bonds as a policy tool and started buying less each month in August of that year. In July 2024, the amount paid for things was 5.7 trillion yen monthly. Beginning in August 2024, the BOJ cut back on buying JGB. In January 2026, it will drop to 2.9 trillion yen. If the cut is made to 200 billion yen every three months starting in April 2026, the amount bought will be about 2.1 trillion yen every month from January 2027. However, some investors in the market believe that the tapering of bond purchases by the BOJ is contributing to the yield rise. Tapering bond purchases “is now on autopilot, and if there is any hawkish action going forward it is likely to be in policy rate settings,” said Katsuhiko Aiba, Citi Japan economist. Economists at Bank of America said that one of the most important things to watch for is whether the BoJ makes it clear that it plans to do another interim review in 2026 and whether it expresses its view on the appropriate “terminal” purchase amount of JGBs, or the amount it buys some years in the future. According to Goldman Sachs economists , price cuts will happen more slowly over the next year until they reach 2 trillion yen monthly. The BOJ still wants to keep interest rates from going up and keep the market from going crazy by continuing to sell off government bonds. On the other hand, bonds purchased by the BOJ in the past reaching maturity are helping reduce its debt holdings. The BOJ owned about 560 trillion yen of government bonds at the end of December. This was 52% of the total amount of outstanding government debt. Because tapering is going so slowly, the BOJ has received criticism that its “holdings are still too large.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Many have given up and moved on; some have even stopped using MetaMask on account of its many issues. Without any airdrop commitments, there was simply little incentive to keep using the platform. However, there is now a glimmer of hope because Joseph Lubin, the founder of Metamask’s parent company Consensys , has hinted at a possible token launch in the future for its web3 protocols, and many hope its wallet service will be one of them. Lubin’s comments renew community hopes Sharplink Gaming (SBET), famously introduced as the Microstrategy of $ETH, tanked 75% overnight after a few crypto news sites and KOLs shared an SEC filing and claimed the whole cap table sold 100% of their shares. This had investors spooked and resulted in the stock falling by about 75% in after-hours trading. Apparently, these people did not really dump their shares as the sites suggested, and Lubin was one of those who clarified the situation. Lubin also engaged a thread from another user breaking down how users could take advantage of the fall. That was when someone charged Lubin to tokenize $SBET so it could be available for purchase on-chain. In his response, Lubin sounded positive and hinted at the potential of $SBET and many more protocols getting tokenized. It was under that response that one user took the opportunity to ask about MetaMask getting an airdrop. “You’re probably so tired of this question, but will there every be a meta mask token?” The user asked. “Not a governance token, even a meme token would do. I can understand the difficulty of making it fair. Wallet age and consistency of use would be a great metric for an airdrop.” We have a short and medium term plan/strategy. It involves protocolization of our current products and other initiatives. And Web3 protocols need tokens. First out of the gate will be LINEA. Soon. More to come on this. And they will all be synergistic with one another. — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) June 14, 2025 In response, Lubin pointed out that there is a “short and medium term plan/strategy” in place that “involves protocolization of our current products and other initiatives.” “And Web3 protocols need tokens,” he wrote before adding that the “first out of the gate” will be LINEA and that the tokens will all be “synergistic with one another.” Lubin on the next protocol to get a token after LINEA After Lubin revealed LINEA as the first protocol to get a token, some users started speculating on the next protocol to get a similar treatment. One user suggested it would be Infura, but Lubin chipped in to say the answer to the question is most likely the Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN). “DIN will probably be the next one. But don’t hold me to that,” he wrote. DIN will probably be the next one, but don't hold me to that. DIN is the Decentralized Infrastructure Network, an expansion of Infura.

Speaking at the XRPL Apex event, Garlinghouse offered a forecast that, within the next five years, XRPL could facilitate as much as 14% of the total transaction volume currently processed by SWIFT, the widely used global interbank messaging system. Garlinghouse emphasized that the real challenge in cross-border payments lies in liquidity, not messaging. He pointed out that while SWIFT remains essential for moving information between financial institutions, its primary function is ultimately to support the transfer of actual monetary value. He argued that blockchain platforms like XRPL are better positioned to streamline this function through native liquidity and real-time settlement capabilities. Quantifying the 14% Projection Following the CEO’s statement, a user on X known as “XRPMillionaire” used xAI’s Grok to break down the implications. Based on SWIFT’s estimated $150 trillion in annual transaction volume, 14% would represent $21 trillion processed by XRPL each year. This would amount to roughly $58 billion in daily transactions. If this market share were to be achieved gradually over five years, it would imply a steady increase of 2.8% annually, or approximately $4.2 trillion processed per year. Market Reactions and Price Estimates These projections have led to renewed optimism within the XRP community, especially regarding the potential for long-term value appreciation. Despite XRP trading at around $2.13 and still sitting below its all-time high set several years ago, many investors and analysts now see room for significant price increases if such utility materializes. Several valuation models have emerged in response to this outlook. One analysis projects a potential XRP price of $12 if liquidity demand rises in proportion to transaction volume. This estimate assumes the token would be used and recycled approximately 30 times per year, necessitating a liquidity base of around $700 billion to support the full $21 trillion annual volume. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other forecasts, which account for increasing institutional interest and the speculative nature of the crypto market, suggest that XRP could trade between $18 and $24 under favorable market conditions. However, some observers have called for a broader examination of the competitive landscape. If XRP were to capture 14% of SWIFT’s total volume, the question remains: which platforms or technologies will handle the remaining 86%? Projects such as Chainlink have already begun working directly with SWIFT, positioning themselves as potential players in the evolving financial infrastructure. While XRP’s capacity to handle trillions in annual payments remains speculative, Garlinghouse’s remarks and the subsequent analysis have provided concrete figures for what such a scenario might entail. The discussion now turns to whether XRP can effectively scale to meet these expectations and how it will compete in a landscape that is becoming increasingly crowded with blockchain-based solutions.

Worldcoin (WLD) is also gaining traction after crossing $1.18, helped by strong market volume. But beyond the charts, another name is turning heads for a different reason. BlockDAG (BDAG) isn’t just focused on price action—it’s building something broader. A large-scale US sponsorship is rumored to be in motion, and if confirmed, it could make BlockDAG one of the most widely recognized projects before even listing. The move would not only boost trust and visibility; it could bring BDAG into everyday conversation across countries and industries. For those eyeing the best crypto to buy in 2025, this mix of scale and timing is becoming hard to overlook. SUI Price Climbs Past $3.40 on ETF Buzz and Growing Demand The SUI price performance is seeing a solid recovery. From June 9 to June 11, SUI gained 7.9%, climbing back to $3.40. A key reason for the lift was Nasdaq’s 19b-4 filing to list a spot SUI ETF with 21Shares. That announcement helped push SUI through the $3.55 resistance line, turning it into support. Volume surged to $930 million in 24 hours, and SUI’s Total Value Locked now stands at $1.77 billion, showing strong usage in DeFi and gaming. The SUI price also broke out of a descending channel, with EMA crossovers and bullish momentum supporting targets of $4.50 and above if the trend continues. WLD Moves Past $1.18 as Breakout Signals Grow Worldcoin (WLD) posted a 5.4% rise on June 10, moving from $1.11 to $1.18. This came just as Google Cloud’s partnership with OpenAI made headlines, helping boost trader interest. Volume jumped by 38% to $208 million. Technicals also support the move. WLD has cleared its 50-period EMA and is now sitting in a breakout range between $1.05 and $1.15. The MACD is signaling strength, and RSI near 62 adds to the bullish case. Chart patterns show a rising wedge and triangle formations that point to a potential surge. If WLD clears $1.20–$1.24, targets between $1.28 and $1.60 could come into play. Support at $1.05–$1.10 remains strong, making this one of the better-positioned breakout plays at the moment. BlockDAG’s US Push Could Redefine What a Presale Can Do BlockDAG has already raised $303 million and sold 22.6 billion coins. It’s currently in Batch 29 of its presale, priced at $0.0276. Those who bought during Batch 1 have already earned a 2,660% return. But the latest twist? A special extended offer now allows users to buy at just $0.0018 for six more days. With the launch price set at $0.05, this window offers a potential ROI of 2,678%. That alone is a major draw. But it’s what’s happening outside the price chart that’s capturing attention. A rumored US-based sponsorship deal could soon take BDAG’s reach global. Widespread branding and televised exposure could turn BDAG into a name recognized even beyond the crypto world. Most projects chase attention after they launch. BlockDAG is flipping that model by building mass appeal in advance. It’s already backed by a CertiK audit, is EVM-compatible, and supports zero gas fees through its DAG-based infrastructure. Its X1 Miner app has attracted over 2 million users in more than 150 countries. Features like Buyer Battles and referral streaks make it not just easy to use, but addictive. BlockDAG isn’t just checking boxes. It’s rewriting how crypto connects with people. If the sponsorship is confirmed, BDAG won’t just launch, it’ll arrive already embedded in culture.

With an ongoing third-party audit , structured growth , and the potential to deliver massive returns , Ruvi AI has become a symbol of hope for many holders. Backed by its $1.7 million presale success , 150 million tokens sold , and an incredibly low entry price of $0.015 per token , the excitement surrounding this token is far from unwarranted.

These Are the Top Cryptos to Invest in for Short Term Participation",https://thecoinrise.com/are-you-tracking-qubetics-xrp-and-cosmos-these-are-the-top-cryptos-to-invest-in-for-short-term-participation/,"Which digital assets are showing strong short-term growth signals in today’s volatile market? As the broader crypto space navigates renewed attention and shifting capital flows, select assets are standing out not for noise, but for solid infrastructure and development momentum. Among the top cryptos to invest in for short term, Qubetics ($TICS), XRP, and Cosmos are leading discussions across the space. With Qubetics offering a truly integrated multi-chain experience through its application, and the added traction around its token presale, this project has become a critical contender for short-term upside. Meanwhile, XRP continues to demonstrate its relevance through international payment corridors and growing adoption among traditional finance institutions. At the same time, Cosmos is rapidly advancing blockchain interoperability, attracting developer interest and on-chain liquidity. These three digital assets are building strong foundations for immediate relevance in the current cycle, making them standout picks among the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Qubetics Multi‑Chain Wallet: The Future of Web3 User Experience At the center of Qubetics ‘ appeal is a breakthrough in digital asset management—the Qubetics Wallet. This product is designed as a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with support across mobile and desktop operating systems. As a key component of Qubetics’ broader ecosystem, this application empowers users to manage, transact, and interact with assets across major blockchain networks from a single interface. In a fragmented environment where most users juggle multiple wallets or custodial platforms, Qubetics offers an unprecedented level of utility. The wallet supports native $TICS tokens and is compatible with iOS, Android, and web-based systems. From small business operators handling cross-border payments in stablecoins to NFT creators selling digital collectibles across marketplaces, Qubetics provides seamless, secure access with no dependency on third parties. As digital asset adoption increases globally, the demand for self-custodial, interoperable tools will only rise. Qubetics is positioning itself at the center of that trend, building real-world use for its application, and validating its place among the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Why Qubetics Is One of the Top Cryptos to Invest in for Short Term Gains Qubetics has officially reached the final stretch of its public token sale, entering Stage 37 with strong momentum. Priced at $0.3370, the Qubetics presale has already raised over $18 million, selling more than 515 million $TICS tokens to a growing community of 27,900+ holders. With only 10 million tokens remaining at this final price, the window to secure entry before the listing is quickly narrowing. Once the presale concludes, $TICS will list at $0.40—offering a built-in 20% return to those who join now. What makes this presale even more strategic is Qubetics’ updated tokenomics: a dramatic supply cut from 4 billion to 1.36 billion and a public allocation increase to 38.55%, reinforcing both scarcity and decentralization. With this balance of financial upside and community-driven design, Qubetics is rapidly being positioned as one of the top cryptos to invest in for short term performance. Consider a $5,000 investment at the current Qubetics presale rate. At $0.3370, that amount secures around 14,837 $TICS tokens. Upon listing at $0.40, this holding immediately rises to $5,934—a gain of $934 before any post-launch appreciation. For those aiming at more aggressive returns, projections ranging between $5 to $10 per token suggest that same $5,000 could scale up to as much as $74,000–$148,000 during the next market cycle. This combination of immediate ROI and high upside potential is why Qubetics is now being recognized as the best crypto presale currently live—and why it’s dominating discussions around the top cryptos to invest in for short term growth. XRP: Expanding Institutional Utility in Global Payments XRP continues to gain relevance as a solution for institutional-grade cross-border transfers. Its utility-driven design enables near-instant settlements, low fees, and minimal counterparty risk—factors increasingly valued by banks, fintech firms, and payment processors. The XRP Ledger is also integrating smart contract capabilities, allowing tokenized assets and programmable finance to live directly on the chain without requiring external solutions. Recent developments have further solidified XRP’s case as one of the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Its presence in Asia-Pacific payment channels is expanding, and partnerships with financial platforms have increased XRP’s daily volume across regulated corridors. Regulatory clarity is also improving, providing a more favorable outlook for adoption in regions that previously held back institutional engagement. As financial platforms scale up the use of on-chain tools, XRP remains well-positioned to serve both compliance-driven needs and next-generation payment architecture. Cosmos: Redefining Blockchain Interoperability with IBC Cosmos is one of the most compelling infrastructure-layer projects making waves in today’s market, due in large part to its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Cosmos enables secure, standardized communication between independent chains, solving one of crypto’s most persistent technical challenges. The architecture allows sovereign blockchains to interact without sacrificing scalability or governance, creating a truly interoperable network of networks. Recent updates to Cosmos Hub and its expanding validator set are drawing attention from both DeFi builders and application-layer protocols. Interchain accounts, smart routing, and shared security features now allow protocols to operate across ecosystems more efficiently. As a result, protocols that once relied on Ethereum or Solana for liquidity and composability are beginning to consider Cosmos for its flexibility and development-ready environment. This unique positioning places Cosmos comfortably within the top cryptos to invest in for short term, particularly for those tracking growth in cross-chain DeFi infrastructure. Conclusion Qubetics, XRP, and Cosmos each present a unique value proposition for short-term participants seeking informed exposure. Qubetics stands out with its web3 aggregator model and a high-impact Qubetics presale, offering structured growth and compelling ROI scenarios. XRP continues to lead the institutional payment narrative through expanding real-world partnerships and regulatory momentum. Cosmos is delivering on its promise of true cross-chain operability, attracting forward-thinking protocols and community members alike. Among all available opportunities, these three digital assets earn their place on the shortlist of the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Participants seeking immediate utility and future scalability should strongly consider joining this best crypto presale while opportunity remains.

Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 76.92 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Bonk price analysis gives a highly bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has decreased to $0.00001468 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 1.42 percent of its worth today. Technical indicators favor sellers, and the price charts also continue to project a bearish market scenario. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.000125, which is approximately 691% more than its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. Today, its value decreased to $0.00001468. The overall bearish trend in the market moved Bonk’s price in a negative direction, resulting in the recent depreciation. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000020. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense selloff below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2027. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by 2028. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the meme coin, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000125 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

The ruling was issued on Wednesday by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts and stems from a long-running digital asset fraud scheme involving the fraudulent sale of a virtual currency known as My Big Coin (MBC). The court’s decision includes a $19.3 million civil monetary penalty and an additional $6.4 million in restitution for customers who were deceived by misleading claims about the coin’s value and backing. According to the CFTC’s official press release , from January 2014 to June 2017, the defendants falsely promoted MBC as a fully functional digital currency backed by gold and actively traded on established platforms. In reality, the currency lacked any such support or market presence. Over $6 million was collected from at least 28 customers under pretenses, while the funds were largely misappropriated by co-defendant Randall Crater, who was previously convicted and sentenced to more than eight years in prison for his central role in the scheme. The court’s latest order resolves the commodities regulator’s civil enforcement claims against Gillespie, Roche, and the two Nevada-based My Big Coin companies. It also imposes a permanent trading ban on the defendants, barring them from participating in any CFTC-regulated markets or registering with the agency. Crater, the primary orchestrator of the fraud, was earlier sentenced in a separate criminal case and ordered to forfeit and repay more than $7.6 million In a statement, the agency said. “The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.” The post Court Slaps My Big Coin: Founders Hit With $25.8M Penalty for Defrauding Crypto Investors appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|CFTC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-14 21:32:27

33767162,[object Object],1749938406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Can Ethereum Price Return To $4,000? Analyst Says ETH Needs To Hold Above This Support",https://bitcoinist.com/can-ethereum-price-return-to-4000-eth-this-support/,"The Ethereum price was on a tear at the start of this week, breaking above the $2,800 level for the first time since February 2025. However, the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran hurt risk assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum bearing most of the downward pressure in the crypto market. The price of Ethereum fell from above $2,800 toward the psychological $2,500 level, reflecting a significant break from the altcoin’s recent bullish progress. However, historical price data shows that the Ethereum price might be just fine so long as it stays above the $2,500 support. Is A Return To $4,000 Possible For Ethereum Price? In a recent post on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Rekt Capital explained the current setup of the Ethereum price after its latest decline and the potential implications on its future trajectory. According to the online pundit, the second-largest cryptocurrency has established the $2,500 zone as a significant support cushion. After a rough first quarter of the year, the price of Ethereum experienced an explosive start to May, rising back above the $2,000 mark. However, the altcoin had struggled to break above $2,800 before this past week, typically settling above the $2,500 support after facing rejection at this resistance level. According to Rekt Capital, the Ethereum price has shown a strong degree of stability above the $2,500 level over the past five weeks. The crypto analyst noted that if this trend continues, the altcoin’s value could witness a significant surge and return to around the $4,000 region. Rekt Capital highlighted that holding the $2,500 as support has facilitated extended Ethereum price rallies toward $4,000 in the past. As shown in the chart below, the price of ETH made a strong move to the $4,000 zone in late 2024 after hovering around $2,500 throughout August to October. The last time the price of Ethereum was at $4,000 was in mid-December 2024, preceding an almost 60% crash in early parts of the year. A return to this cycle peak for ETH could mark the beginning of a fairly anticipated altcoin season. As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,577, reflecting an almost 3% decline in the past 24 hours. Ethereum Dominance Reaches Five-Year High In a separate post on X, Rekt Capital revealed that the Ethereum Dominance has been climbing over the past few days. The latest data indicate that the altcoin has now achieved 10% market dominance for the first time since 2020, continuing its uptrend. If this positive trend continues and the altcoin’s market dominance continues to improve, investors could see the Ethereum price go on an impressive upside run. Moreover, this could also mean diminishing Bitcoin dominance and an improved likelihood of seeing an altseason this cycle.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH Price|ethereum price|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-14 22:00:06

Industry experts have highlighted how this technical upgrade could benefit digital assets like XRP and Stellar Lumens (XLM). XRP and XLM are designed to work well with modern systems. Experts say they could become a larger part of global payments and transform how money moves worldwide. Global Financial Systems Are Moving to ISO 20022 Standard ISO 20022 allows financial institutions to send payment information clearly and in a structured. It improves data quality, increases transparency, and helps systems across countries collaborate more easily. In a video shared on X, the payments company Stronghold showed how it is using ISO 20022 along with blockchain technology . A company spokesperson explained that this combination improves how money is moved and makes the process more reliable and efficient. Stronghold is already using ISO 20022 messaging in real financial projects. This shows that blockchain and traditional systems can work together, rather than compete. Notably, it was revealed that all Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) payments moved to ISO 20022 in 2022. The U.S. Federal Reserve has also announced plans to adopt the standard in July. This move will replace the outdated Fedwire Application Interface Manual (FAIM). Meanwhile, SWIFT has announced that it will fully transition to ISO 20022 by November. This global shift is poised to change how traditional and digital financial systems work together. XRP and XLM Are Built for This Change It was spotlighted that digital assets like XRP and XLM are better suited to connect with banks and payment systems. These digital currencies are fast, low-cost , and built to follow rules and standards, making them a good match for ISO 20022-based systems. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also recognises XRP and XLM as digital assets with strong potential to play key roles in future financial networks. As more banks switch to ISO 20022, they may turn to these for faster, safer, and cheaper payments. Stronghold Taps Ripple, Stellar, and Interledger for Real-World Use In a separate video clip , Stronghold’s CEO, Tammy Camp, explained that the company uses tools like Ripple, Stellar, and Interledger to link fiat money with digital systems.

The form also reveals he holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the project, giving him direct voting power over its direction.

But the number is huge. It hints that he either cashed out part of his stake or that an internal valuation put the tokens’ worth very high. Massive Fundraising Rounds Based on reports from March, World Liberty Financial raised $200 million in its first token sale. A second round pulled in $250 million. That brings total fundraising to roughly $550 million. The project kicked off in September 2024. It aims to offer DeFi services and dollar-pegged stablecoins as an alternative to banks. Big Investors Join In Tron founder Justin Sun invested $30 million in November 2024. He got 2 billion WLFI tokens at an early price of $0.015 each. Web3Port added $10 million in January 2025, and Oddiyana Ventures also came on board. They didn’t say how much that fund put in. These bids suggest major players believe the project can grow. Ethics Questions Loom Based on the ethics filing, Trump still has roles in related holding companies like CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC. But income from those is small or zero. The form carries his certification that everything is “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge.” It will be reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics.

He previously reported earnings from NFT projects such as Trump Digital Trading Cards. This time, no new NFT income shows up. Instead, all the focus is on World Liberty Financial. That venture now stands as the biggest piece of his crypto footprint. Critics will point to potential conflicts of interest. A sitting president profiting from tokens that grant voting power in a financial project raises eyebrows. Supporters might argue it’s just savvy investing. Either way, the numbers are out in the open now. And the public can see that Donald Trump made a hefty gain from a startup he helped launch—and that he still holds sway over its future.

BlockDAG, now in batch 29 of its presale, has raised more than $302 million directly from the public. There were no hedge funds, no private rounds, no seed investors—just organic momentum powered by retail users. While major chains like Ethereum and Solana depend on insider funding, BlockDAG has chosen a community-first path. This is more than a presale. It’s a full rejection of the old model. And the numbers show it’s working. This is truly the people’s crypto. No VC Funding, No Privileges — Just Genuine Demand BlockDAG stands out not just because of the amount raised, but because of how it raised it. Most big projects depend on private sales backed by Silicon Valley and hedge funds. BlockDAG opened its doors only to the public. There were no special discounts for insiders or influencers. No early unlocks for private buyers. Everyone joined on the same terms with full transparency. This removes the usual advantage held by big funds, putting community first. The public responded strongly. With over $302 million raised purely from retail support, BlockDAG reached a level of momentum that many VC-backed projects never achieve. Ethereum and Solana: Built by Few, Owned by Few To see why BlockDAG is different, consider the usual model. Ethereum’s early supply heavily favored insiders and developers, giving them large long-term gains. Solana also benefited from big VC backers like a16z and Alameda, creating wide gaps between public buyers and early insiders. This VC-driven setup shaped today’s market—powerful chains controlled by a few, with latecomers often priced out of meaningful returns. While marketed as decentralized, their token distributions tell a different story. BlockDAG changes that story. The People’s Chain: Powered by $302 Million in Public Support Currently in batch 29 at $0.0276, BlockDAG has sold over 22.6 billion coins. Its active community engages publicly on Telegram, Discord, and through the X1 mining app, which has more than 1.5 million users worldwide. The X1 app lets anyone mine BDAG coins from their smartphones, creating a peer-to-peer, scalable onboarding method without needing institutional backing. This grassroots approach is succeeding. Rather than chasing institutional interest or hype, BlockDAG grows from real user activity—no boardrooms, no private deals, just people. A New Chapter for 2025: Community Capital Over Venture Capital Crypto is shifting. Users want chains without hidden power behind “decentralization.” Many claim to be open but block access through high fees, opaque governance, or limited early entry. BlockDAG breaks this pattern. This isn’t a token promising “community” while serving VC exits. It’s a network funded by everyday users, shown in real time by presale growth and app engagement. Supporters aren’t betting on hype—they’re building the future. Ethereum’s power still rests with whales and Layer-2 intermediaries. Solana leans on ETFs and institutional interest. BlockDAG has 1.5 million phone miners spreading the word organically. Why BlockDAG Is Ahead While others depend on big partnerships and VC money, BlockDAG sticks to execution: Over $302 million raised with zero VC backing 1.5 million+ active X1 miners 22.6 billion+ coins sold Currently in batch 29 at $0.0276 Tools and apps live before exchange listings BlockDAG isn’t aiming to be another “Ethereum killer” or a meme fad. It builds user-level utility first and scales organically. Its batch presale rewards early supporters fairly, with transparent demand-driven pricing and no artificial scarcity or hidden unlocks. Final Word: Crypto Needs Users, Not Kings The market doesn’t need another Solana or Ethereum. What it truly needs is a project that reflects the people who support it, use it daily, and believe in its future. BlockDAG shows what happens when the gatekeepers are removed, allowing the public to take the lead. This approach raises more than just funds—it builds lasting trust and a genuine community. While other projects chase headlines and institutional deals, BlockDAG focuses on steady, organic growth with real users at the center. This foundation positions it strongly for long-term success and sustainability in crypto market.
