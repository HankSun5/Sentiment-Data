Park, a crypto market maker and luxury sports car collector, has been indicted for crypto fraud . Prosecutors think he issued and manipulated two so-called “scam coins,” and manipulated their prices by issuing fake news about the tokens. However, prosecutors earlier this month established a possible link between Park’s case and that of the former First Lady. Kim Keon-hee is accused of peddling influence, stock manipulation, and other corruption-related charges. Former President Yoon: Arrest Warrant Incoming? Prosecutors are investigating Kim Keon-hee along with Yoon, who failed in a bid to declare martial law in South Korea in early December last year. Yoon’s refusal to share iPhone passcode disrupts special probe https://t.co/c8NXMuUcLc — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) July 29, 2025 The former President was later impeached. He has since been charged with various corruption-related offences. But Former President Yoon has twice refused to respond to court summons requests. This has led prosecution officials to consider requesting an arrest warrant. Yonhap reported that the probe has also expanded to Yoon and Kim’s associates. The South Korean news agency wrote that the special prosecution team is believed to be investigating the former senior prosecutor Kim Sang-min. Prosecutors believe Kim Sang-min may have “received illicit money” from the chief suspect in a crypto fraud case. Media outlets assume that this is Park, who is accused of embezzling 80.9 billion won ($58.1 million) worth of investors’ money. Prosecutors think that Park gave Kim Sang-min money to pay for motor vehicle rental fees. Kim Sang-min then allegedly used this money to pay for the vehicles as he attempted to win the People Power Party nomination for the Changwon Uichang district seat ahead of the April 10 legislative election last year. Kim Sang-min was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid, and was eliminated during the primaries. But prosecution officials appear to think that Kim Keon-hee used her influence to help him run. The special counsel team investigating allegations surrounding former first lady Kim Keon Hee has requested an arrest warrant for former President Yoon Suk Yeol, the team announced Wednesday. https://t.co/c7xp77LPWD — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) July 30, 2025 Rug Pull Suspect Summoned The latest development appears to confirm reports from earlier this month . These claimed that the special prosecution team had asked to see the Park/scam coin case files. Prosecutors think that Park and a CEO surnamed Moon stole hundreds of billions of won. They think the duo issued and listed a suspected scam coin named Atube in 2021. They have also accused Park of masterminding a rug pull scam for a token named Podo Coin, also in 2021.

With XRP currently trading at approximately $3.14, the idea of a surge to $100 or $1,000 may seem speculative to many. However, market commentator Zach Rector recently offered a detailed explanation of how such price targets could technically be achieved. The Market Cap Growth In a recent video , Rector examined the mathematical reasoning behind significant price growth for XRP. He addressed a common misconception that achieving a high token price requires a proportional amount of capital to enter the market. For example, with XRP’s circulating supply at roughly 59 billion tokens, a $100 price would imply a $5.9 trillion market capitalization. At $1,000, the figure would rise to $59 trillion. Critics often assume that such valuations demand equivalent inflows of capital. Rector challenged this assumption by highlighting a key concept known as the “market cap multiplier.” This principle suggests that the relationship between net inflows and resulting market capitalization is not linear. Real-World Observations: How Multipliers Operate Drawing from his analysis of historical data and XRP’s order book activity, Rector explained how capital inflows can create outsized effects on market cap, especially during periods of high market optimism. He cited instances where, during market downturns, every dollar exiting XRP could reduce its market cap by as much as $900 to $6,700. Conversely, on days when investor sentiment was high, market cap increases of over 500 times the amount of capital inflow were observed. He referenced one such spike following a public statement from the U.S. President Donald Trump, which briefly included XRP among a list of crypto assets. Required Inflows to Reach Major Price Milestones Rector then applied these multipliers to estimate the capital needed for XRP to reach specific price levels. Under optimistic conditions with a 500x multiplier, XRP would need just $11 billion in new capital to reach $100. A more moderate 100x multiplier raises that figure to $58 billion. At a conservative 50x, the required capital climbs to approximately $116 billion. Looking further ahead to the $1,000 target, Rector calculated that $118 billion in net inflows would suffice under a 500x multiplier. A 100x multiplier would require roughly $589 billion, while the 50x estimate would place the threshold above $1 trillion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Although these calculations demonstrate a potential path to higher prices, Rector emphasized that such milestones are not likely to occur in the immediate future. He described these projections as long-term possibilities that would depend heavily on sustained capital inflows, particularly from institutional sources. Rector also pointed to predictions from financial institutions that XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could draw in significant capital. JPMorgan has projected inflows of $4 to $8 billion in the first year of XRP ETF availability. According to Rector, this supports the idea that achieving inflow targets, especially those needed to reach the $100 level, is within reach. Additionally, he referenced views from industry experts such as Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart and Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, who have expressed confidence in the demand for XRP ETFs, potentially exceeding that of Solana. Rector’s analysis provides a structured argument rooted in market mechanics and investor behavior. By breaking down the impact of capital inflows and applying realistic multipliers, he presents a scenario in which these high price points, while ambitious, are not entirely out of reach, especially with the growing interest in XRP ETFs.

Market conditions are aligning: meme coin sentiment is surging, presale tokens are closing out fast, and social momentum is accelerating across crypto communities. Throughout crypto history, early investors in presale tokens turned modest four-figure bets into millions —simply by acting before the mainstream hype. These investors recognized the patterns early : viral branding , community- first growth , and timed launches. When those elements align, the upside can be exponential. In many cases, it’s not about timing the market perfectly—it’s about being early when the risk is low and the potential is massive. If you’re aiming to catch 10x–100x plays before they explode, three tokens are standing out right now: PENGU, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and BONK. Each offers a unique angle—whether it’s NFT crossover, political meme power, or Solana-based community strength. All three show breakout potential. And with MAGACOIN FINANCE just crossing $8 million raised , the clock is ticking. PENGU: NFT-meets-retail token turning heads fast PENGU has become one of the most talked-about meme coin-NFT hybrids of the summer. Backed by the Pudgy Penguins brand—already featured in retail chains like Walmart—PENGU represents more than just a viral coin. It ties meme culture to a growing real-world product ecosystem. On-chain momentum has been building fast, with rising wallet counts and trading volume. MAGACOIN FINANCE has now surpassed $8M raised, a fresh milestone While PENGU gains traction through NFTs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the presale playbook . The project has officially surpassed $8 million raised , marking its most significant milestone yet. With politically viral branding, a scarcity-focused supply model, and aggressive referral mechanics, the token is quickly becoming the most watched presale of 2025 . Multiple stages have sold out at lightning speed, and visibility is exploding across the crypto community. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is how quickly it has achieved scale—and how much room for growth remains . As listings approach and supply tightens, analysts say this project could turn small early positions into life-changing outcomes. BONK: Solana’s community engine with staying power BONK is no longer just another meme token—it’s Solana’s most resilient community asset. As the Solana ecosystem rebounds and gasless activity increases , BONK continues to lead in transaction volume, tipping culture, and wallet count growth. BONK’s integration into mobile apps, games, and emerging Solana-native tools makes it a utility meme play with deep community roots. While it may already be known to many traders, BONK’s next leg could come from Layer 2 expansion or cross-chain integrations—both of which are rumored to be in development. Conclusion: 3 different narratives, one millionaire strategy For those looking to get ahead of August’s altcoin rotation, PENGU, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and BONK offer exposure to three powerful trends: retail NFTs, viral presales, and Layer 1 community dominance. With MAGACOIN FINANCE already surpassing $8M , and the others building momentum fast, this is one of the most dynamic setups of the year. Miss it—and you may miss the millionaire window .

This might mean that any new fund wouldn’t have to get its own clearance. According to Nate Geraci, an ETF expert, this is a very important submission. He said that if it is accepted, issuers won’t have to get separate clearance for each crypto ETF as long as they meet certain requirements. Approvals to as early as October The proposal will make it easier to stake by requiring a liquidity risk management scheme if fewer than 85% of the assets are available for rapid redemption. First, the Solana ETPs, which must be approved by October 10. They will meet the Generic Listing Standards this fall if the Commission gives its okay. However, this has to be commented on and looked over. The Comment Period will probably finish 21 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register, which is likely this week. This indicates that the rule could be on a path to finality in less than 60 days. Meanwhile, there are a handful of pending ETP applications right now, like the Solana and XRP ETPs. Before the Solana deadline of October 10 and the XRP deadline just a little later, the SEC could choose to act directly on those ETP 19b-4s or let them run out under GLS. According to Greg Xethalis, a lawyer, XRP futures would have a timetable that was a little later because they came out after SOL futures. Still, it looks quite likely that SOL and XRP ETPs will be available by the start of Q4. They will include in-kind and probably include stakes for SOL. The crypto industry makes regulatory processes easier. NYSE Arca has also filed a similar document, which shows that the whole industry is working to make regulatory processes easier. Currently, exchanges have to file a 19b-4 form for each new crypto ETF. This starts a long and sometimes complicated review process by the SEC. This filing comes shortly after the SEC approved in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs, aligning them more closely with traditional fund structures. These changes are a big step toward making crypto a part of traditional banking systems. The White House also put out fresh ideas to bring crypto rules in line with those of traditional banking. This showed that there was a coordinated effort to update the rules. The Working Group on Digital Assets, which is part of the US President Donald Trump’s administration, has put out a 168-page policy paper that calls for clearer rules for trade and fewer limits on blockchain innovation. The report also says that bureaucratic hurdles that slow down the release of new financial products should be gotten rid of. The GENIUS Act, which President Trump signed into law earlier this month, set up a wider set of rules for stablecoins. The House of Representatives also enacted the CLARITY Act and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act. These laws focus on the structure of the crypto market and place limits on central bank digital currency.Both bills are set to be reviewed by the Senate following the August recess.

He says he was ignored because “it was the more economical solution,” according to a suit filed earlier this month. A few months later, he lost his job. Markert is among the two ex employees who have sued SpaceX for wrongful termination according to TechCrunch . At the start of July, the lawsuits were transferred to federal court. Both suits argue that safety and staff welfare were sacrificed for speed and cost savings. They come whil SpaceX is pushing to prepare its Starship ultra-heavy rocket for NASA and commercial missions and to deploy satellites for its Starlink service, while its Falcon 9 rocket has has launched 87 times this year. Long hours and fatigue allegedly led to injuries of SpaceX workers Markert worked at SpaceX for 13 years before his April dismissal. His complaint states that technicians were sometimes compelled to work 15 to 20 days straight in a high-stress setting. When he raised concerns about fatigue, he says supervisors told him “the schedule comes first.” He says this grueling pace led to injuries that staff didn’t dare report.. In the lawsuit, Markert says he urged management to invest in more training and certifications, but was told “there is no time for that and the company would not spend money on it.” He added that without proper training, the risk of mistakes rises. The second lawsuit was filed by plumber David Lavalle, who joined SpaceX in 2014 and is now 60. He claims the company failed to address a series of work-related injuries, such as a foot fracture, extreme pain in the neck and wrist problems. Fearing retaliation, he did not seek workers’ compensation for all injuries. After he took leave to treat knee pain from gout, he was fired nine days later. Lavalle also alleges older staff were targeted after the company hired 28-year-old Scott Hiler as a senior manager at the end of last year. Both complaints were originally filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and later removed by the company to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. SpaceX injury rates exceed industry average Recent reporting by TechCrunch showed SpaceX outpaced other companies in worker injury rates in 2024. The analysis of Occupational Safety and Health Administration records found the Starbase complex in Texas logged 4.27 injuries per 100 workers last year, nearly triple the aerospace manufacturing average of 1.6 per 100. Markert, who lives in Los Angeles County, did not specify his work site, though his lawsuit says he worked with ship technicians. OSHA logs show SpaceX’s west coast fairing recovery operations had the highest injury rate, at 7.6 incidents per 100 workers. At the end of May 2025 Federal Aviation Administration ordered a formal accident probe into a Starship test flight, which went out of control. The rocket lifted off from Texas and flew farther than the last two tests, which both ended in fiery Atlantic crashes. At that time it made it halfway around the world before spinning out of control and breaking up over the Indian Ocean. The FAA later confirmed that there were no reported injuries or damage to the public. The first-stage booster, recycled from a previous flight, also fell apart as it came down over the Gulf of Mexico, but that was expected and approved by regulators. According to the FAA, debris from both stages fell within the pre-established hazard areas.

Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that the 15% levy is lower than the 25% tax he had threatened earlier this month. He added that American imports into South Korea would not face any duties and noted that South Korea would be “OPEN TO TRADE” and accept U.S. automobiles. Earlier this month, he had warned that South Korean imports could face a 25% levy if no agreement was reached. The move makes South Korea the latest major American trading partner to strike a deal before Trump’s Friday deadline, when he has warned he will levy steep duties on many nations. He has threatened to impose tariffs on dozens of countries if agreements are not secured by Friday. South Korea’s government has not yet issued an official statement to confirm the arrangement. Last week, the president announced a pact with Japan , and on Sunday he said he had reached terms with the 27-nation European Union. Deals still remain unresolved with the United States’ three largest individual trading partners: Canada, Mexico and China. Beyond the 15% tariff, Trump said South Korea agreed to hand over “$350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself.” He also said the country would purchase $100 million worth of liquefied natural gas or other energy products, and would “invest a large sum of money for their investment purposes.” Trade between South Korea and U.S ran deep last year The United States bought $131.5 billion in South Korean products, while South Korea imported $65.5 billion in goods from the United States. Those figures made South Korea America’s sixth-largest trading partner, not counting regional blocs like the European Union. These numbers come from Census Bureau data. South Korea managed to dodge a technical recession thanks to a better-than-expected performance in the second quarter of 2025. The Bank of Korea’s preliminary report showed the economy grew by 0.6% on a seasonally adjusted basis in the three months ending in June, up from a 0.2% drop in the first quarter. That result marked a turnaround for the world’s fourth-largest economy. Economists surveyed by Reuters had predicted growth of 0.5%, meaning the result slightly surpassed their forecasts. On a year-over-year basis, gross domestic product rose by 0.5%, compared to no growth in the first quarter when consensus estimates had been 0.4%. The turn in the second quarter kept South Korea from slipping into a second recession, which is defined as two straight quarters of negative growth. Earlier, the Bank of Korea had warned that softer global demand and rising geopolitical risks could weigh on its performance, but the latest figures added more color to the economic picture. While growth remains modest, many analysts expected South Korea to keep moving forward as strong exports, steady consumer spending and targeted government investment provide support. Experts said a mix of healthy export numbers and steady domestic demand could help the country weather global slowdowns. Final consumption expenditure rose by 0.7% in the April-to-June quarter, after falling 0.1% in the first quarter. Private consumption climbed by 0.5%, helped by higher spending on motor vehicles and on entertainment and sports. Experts said this suggested that shoppers were feeling more confident, in part thanks to tame inflation and a relatively easy job market. Exports of goods and services grew by 4.2% in that quarter, showing a clear rebound for a country tied into global supply chains and trade tensions. Semiconductors led the way, with petroleum and chemical products also making strong gains. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The Financial Times reports that the bank’s staff committee sent a letter to ECB President Christine Lagarde that addressed “widespread complaints of favoritism, high burnout rates and the vulnerability of many colleagues working under temporary contracts.” Carlos Bowles, the chair of the staff committee, penned the letter, accusing the ECB of becoming an “unaccountable legal fortress.” Bowles also criticizes Lagarde’s public support for Europe’s rule of law, accusing her of failing to promote the same standards. “We regret to see that these principles expressed outside the institution seem to be given little value inside the institution by its power structure.” In a blog post last month, Lagarde argued that the moment is ripe for the euro to gain global prominence as a fixture in foreign exchange reserves, partially due to Europe’s stability. “Admittedly, the EU is not easy to understand from the outside. But its structured and inclusive decision-making guarantees checks and balances, stability and policy certainty.

49266922,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=172998,1753920033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/49266922.jpeg,Latest XRP Price Prediction: July Edition,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/latest-xrp-price-prediction-july-edition/,"XRP has regained serious bullish momentum in recent weeks, building higher lows and holding firm above key support zones. Analysts are increasingly confident that a breakout may be on the horizon. From technical Fibonacci markers to Elliott Wave projections, the charts show XRP approaching a possible vertical move. But while XRP captures institutional and retail attention, some experts are tracking a parallel trend—a new presale token that’s growing even faster than XRP did in its early expansion. That token is MAGACOIN FINANCE, and its community acceleration is turning heads across the crypto market. XRP’s chart signals bullish continuation ahead Technical analysts point to XRP’s resilience above key Fibonacci levels as a strong signal of continued upward momentum. The token’s recent triangle formation has respected major trendlines, suggesting that a break above key resistance could set off a rapid advance. Some forecasts point to an immediate range between $3.50 and $4 , while more speculative models—such as Elliott Wave analysis—see potential for an explosive rally to $13 within 40 days. These targets depend on institutional inflows, regulatory clarity, and Ethereum ETF developments—all of which remain in motion. This project is outpacing early XRP adoption rate, experts note Amid XRP’s rally, another story is unfolding. MAGACOIN FINANCE has just reached a new milestone , with expert analysts noting its community growth now outpaces XRP’s early adoption curve. The project’s referral mechanics, politically-charged branding, and scarcity-driven tokenomics have created a viral loop effect. Telegram and X activity are surging as presale rounds sell out quickly , compressing supply and fueling early-stage momentum. Many are calling it the most aggressive community-scale growth in recent presale history . This trajectory has drawn parallels to the early days of XRP itself —where user growth was the key metric for exponential returns . As MAGACOIN FINANCE pushes toward its next pricing tier, this community-first model is shaping up to be a dominant force in the meme and macro-narrative space. Why XRP’s setup still commands serious attention Despite rising competition and rotating capital, XRP remains one of the most structurally bullish tokens among top caps. RippleNet adoption continues globally, and upcoming catalysts like institutional ETF flows could push volumes higher. Analysts note that as long as XRP holds support near critical retracement zones, the odds favor a breakout toward $4 and beyond . The real wildcard remains macro alignment—if Ethereum’s ETF approval coincides with a wave of regulatory clarity for Ripple, XRP could enter a new phase of speculative upside. Traders now weigh whether to chase the momentum—or position ahead of the next leg. Conclusion: XRP eyes $13 As XRP builds strength for a potential move to $13 , attention is split between blue-chip momentum and breakout presale energy. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s faster adoption rate than XRP’s early days is a data point no analyst is ignoring. Both tokens are riding different waves—but the combination of technical setups and viral traction makes this moment one of the most dynamic of the 2025 cycle .

49266838,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76219,1753920037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Blockchain Expert Says XRP Is About To Explode,https://timestabloid.com/blockchain-expert-says-xrp-is-about-to-explode/,"A prominent figure from Benzinga’s Crypto Advisory Board recently sparked attention in the XRP community with a brief yet bullish statement. Armando Pantoja revealed he had discussed with sources in Washington, D.C. While he did not disclose specifics, he confirmed that XRP may experience a significant move soon, hinting that anyone holding at least 1,000 XRP is well-positioned for what’s coming. D.C. Connection Highlights Imminent XRP Movement Pantoja tweeted that he had a conversation with contacts in the U.S. capital. Though he was deliberately opaque about details, his message was clear: “XRP is about to explode.” He implied the opportunity window may be limited, and holders of 1,000 XRP or more are already ahead of many other market participants. Just got off a call with my insiders in DC… I can’t say much, but $XRP is about to explode. I don't know exactly when, but soon. If you’ve got 1,000 XRP, you’re already ahead of the curve. This could be the move that changes everything. — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) July 29, 2025 This minimalistic disclosure, lacking timing or context, nevertheless triggered renewed optimism among retail and institutional investors, who interpreted the post as a signal to accumulate XRP at its current level of approximately $3. Why 1,000 XRP Is Becoming a Belief Benchmark The notion that owning 1,000 XRP sets investors “ahead of the curve” has gained traction in recent months. Jake Claver, Director at Digital Ascension Group, previously pointed out that holding roughly 3,300 XRP, worth around $9,000, places an investor among the top echelons of holders. According to on-chain data, only 10% of XRP wallets contain more than 2,438 tokens. With over 6.7 million wallets recorded, more than 5.7 million hold fewer than 1,000 XRP. This underscores why a holding of 1,000 is viewed as significantly above average globally. Within XRP-focused circles, the 1,000 token threshold is frequently cited as a meaningful target for those hoping to benefit from a potential future price spike. Some analysts have even suggested that accumulating 1,000 XRP now could provide sufficient capital to retire comfortably as early as 2029, if the asset reaches aggressive price levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Aligning Investment Amounts with Aspirational Goals Claver further clarified that holding modest amounts of XRP might align with personal financial objectives. For example, if XRP ever reached $1,000, owning approximately 6,000 tokens could yield $6 million, a sum more than adequate to sustain an upscale U.S. lifestyle with an annual income around $300,000. He emphasized that this framing helps investors match token holdings with realistic wealth benchmarks. However, some voices within the community advocate an even more aggressive approach. King Vale, for instance, recommends holding up to 50,000 XRP, which at current prices would exceed $150,000. Such positions reflect a confidence in higher long-term targets while acknowledging more moderate price projections than some ultra-bullish forecasts. Neither the Benzinga board member nor others provided a timetable, and the nature of the D.C.-based insights remains undisclosed. Furthermore, widely cited predictions, such as XRP reaching $1,000, remain speculative and assume exceptional market conditions and sustained capital inflow. Still, Pantoja’s and Claver’s perspectives illustrate a belief that early accumulation, especially at the 1,000 XRP level, could be meaningful if headlines or institutional activity accelerate demand. While not a guarantee, their analysis reinforces a broader sentiment within the community that current token owners may reap outsized benefits if XRP sees substantial upward movement.

AAVE just slipped below a key level, breaking away from its recent comfort zone. PEPE remains trapped in sideways action, even as whale activity increases. Across the board, sentiment is shifting between caution and pure speculation. The charts are no longer just consolidating. They are flashing mixed signals, and the pause in momentum now feels more like hesitation than planning. Traders are watching closely, but few are acting decisively. That is where BlockDAG (BDAG) stands apart. The return of its NO VESTING PASS and a locked $0.0016 price until August 11 has pushed its presale past $355 million. With 100% coin unlock at launch, the offer is becoming one of the most talked-about moves in the market. AAVE Slides Toward Key Level as Bearish Pressure Builds The AAVE price pattern is flashing warning signs as the token slips below short-term averages and tests its $269 support zone. After peaking near $334 on July 19, AAVE has dropped 14%, even as total value locked across the protocol hits an impressive $50 billion milestone. Momentum indicators are not offering much relief. RSI is nearing oversold territory, MACD has turned negative, and both the 7-day and 20-day SMAs have been breached. If AAVE fails to hold $269.86, the next stop could be closer to $213, and that could catch a lot of holders off guard. PEPE Whale Moves Rise as Price Stalls Near Crucial Zone The PEPE coin price is treading water near $0.0000126, following a sharp 50% retracement from recent highs. Volume has fallen by 40% over the past week, and the price has slipped another 7%, raising questions about the next move. Still, whale activity is telling a different story. Transactions between $100K and $1M have surged by 32.5%, suggesting smart money may be circling. A bullish hammer and a CMF reading of 0.08 point to underlying strength. If accumulation holds, PEPE could make a quick jump toward $0.000015, catching traders by surprise. BlockDAG’s NO VESTING PASS Extended to August 4: Buyers Rush to 100% Liquidity BlockDAG is rewriting the rules of presale participation with the return of its NO VESTING PASS. Now available until August 4, this limited-time offer gives all qualifying buyers 100% access to their BDAG coins on launch day. There are no staggered unlocks or wait times. Every coin bought during this period will be fully liquid from day one. This offer applies only to purchases made during the no-vesting window, making timing critical. Coins acquired outside of this extension will fall under the standard vesting schedule. The ability to bypass lockups and instantly control BDAG at launch is drawing major attention, especially as other presales stick to rigid distribution models. BlockDAG’s metrics back the demand. The presale has raised $355 million and sold 24.5 billion BDAG coins so far. Although Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, the GLOBAL LAUNCH release has locked in a reduced $0.0016 rate until August 11. With a confirmed listing price of $0.05, the potential upside now stands at 3,025%. The NO VESTING PASS extension is not expected to return again. With the presale entering its final stretch and momentum building fast, this is one of the few chances to enter early with full flexibility and clear ROI from the start. Market Takeaways The AAVE price pattern and PEPE coin price both reflect a market caught in limbo. One is hovering near support, the other teasing a breakout, but neither has made a decisive move. This wait-and-see behavior contrasts sharply with what is happening at BlockDAG. The return of the NO VESTING PASS has flipped the script. Buyers can now unlock 100% of their BDAG coins at launch if they purchase before August 4. As other tokens circle technical zones, BlockDAG is offering immediate access and clear upside. For those searching for the top crypto for 2025, this opportunity is standing out.

Right now, the market is buzzing with opportunities that balance utility, strong communities, and attractive tokenomics. Whether you’re into meme coins with massive engagement or practical tools that make crypto usage more rewarding, there’s plenty to keep an eye on. In this roundup, we’ll dive into Cold Wallet ($CWT) , BONK, SUI, and PEPE, each offering its own reasons to stand out in 2025. From cashback-driven wallets to meme coins fighting for dominance and Layer‑1 networks eyeing expansion, these are picks worth your attention. If you’re hunting for projects that can pay off big, this list has some of the most exciting options in the space right now. 1. Cold Wallet — Crypto That Gives Back Cold Wallet is designed for people who are tired of paying to use their crypto. It flips the usual model by giving users cashback in its native token, CWT, every time they pay gas fees, make swaps, or move funds between crypto and fiat. Instead of simply being a storage solution, it makes the activity profitable. Users keep full control of their keys, with no backdoors or centralized risks, making it a true self‑custody experience. The wallet also includes a straightforward referral system that rewards both the inviter and the invited, helping to grow its community while providing direct incentives for participation. At the heart of this model is CWT, the token that powers every reward. The presale is live with 4 billion CWT allocated out of a 10 billion total supply, currently in stage 15 at $0.00924, gradually increasing in price every stage. Holding CWT unlocks better cashback tiers, with the top tier offering up to 100% gas fee rebates, effectively creating a fee‑free experience for heavy users. Rewards are designed to scale, and there’s no staking or complex contracts, just holding CWT boosts your benefits. This creates a loop: use the wallet, earn more tokens, increase your tier, and keep maximizing your rewards. For those searching for the best crypto for higher returns, Cold Wallet combines immediate utility with long‑term token growth, making it a standout pick for 2025. 2. BONK — Solana’s Meme Powerhouse BONK has carved out its position as a major player on the Solana network, consistently ranking among the most traded meme tokens. Currently priced at around $0.000034, BONK holds a market cap of roughly $2.7 billion, maintaining significant visibility despite fierce competition. Over the past week, BONK has gained between 4–9%, showing resilience in a volatile market. It has also benefited from recent token burn campaigns aimed at tightening supply and supporting price stability. Financial asset invest analysis with volume and candle stick chart BONK’s growing community is its biggest asset. Regular airdrops, community campaigns, and partnerships have kept engagement strong, while Solana’s low transaction fees make it an attractive playground for meme coin trading. However, BONK does face competition from other Solana-based meme coins like PENGU, which are quickly gaining traction. For traders exploring the best crypto for higher returns, BONK offers short-term upside potential, but long-term performance will depend on how effectively it maintains its dominance in the Solana meme ecosystem. 3. SUI — Building a Stronger Layer‑1 SUI has been making steady moves as a Layer‑1 network with ambitious plans for scalability and ecosystem growth. At $4.30, it’s up roughly 13% in the last week, with a remarkable 62% gain in the past month, signaling growing investor confidence. Analysts have noted strong bullish patterns, with price targets extending to $5.64, $6.70, and possibly even $10 if momentum holds. Its technical indicators are strong, supported by rising trading volumes and robust support levels around $4.12. On the fundamentals side, SUI’s expanding Total Value Locked (TVL) — now over $2.2 billion — shows increasing adoption of its ecosystem. There’s also a push to integrate BTCFi infrastructure, bridging Bitcoin liquidity with the SUI network, which could drive even greater growth. For those assessing the best crypto for higher returns, SUI’s combination of strong price action, expanding on-chain activity, and clear development goals makes it an appealing pick for 2025. 4. PEPE — Meme Coin With Room to Run PEPE remains one of the most recognizable meme coins in crypto, maintaining a strong following and active trading community. It’s currently trading at around $0.00001007, with a market cap exceeding $5 billion, keeping it well within the top tier of meme projects. While it has seen a dip of around 2–3% in the past 24 hours, PEPE recently broke out of a falling‑wedge pattern, which many analysts view as a bullish signal. However, the token has struggled to hold above its 100‑day moving average, indicating selling pressure from larger holders. Despite these challenges, retail interest in PEPE remains high, driven by its cultural relevance and community-driven campaigns. Some analysts are optimistic about its potential for large returns if market sentiment improves. For investors looking for the best crypto for higher returns, PEPE carries higher risk due to its volatility, but it also offers opportunities for big moves if momentum swings back in its favor. Conclusion Choosing the best crypto for higher returns means balancing innovation, growth potential, and community strength. Cold Wallet leads this list with its unique rewards-driven model, presale opportunities, and real-world utility. BONK continues to thrive as a community-powered meme coin, SUI brings strong fundamentals and technical upside as a growing Layer‑1 network, and PEPE keeps the meme coin energy alive with its strong market presence. Whether you’re interested in cashback-based utility tokens or high-volatility meme plays, these four projects provide distinct pathways for potential gains in 2025. Always keep an eye on market trends, but these picks show why there’s still plenty of opportunity in crypto.

This move opened the token to a highly speculative investor base, resulting in a trading volume explosion of over $900 million in just 24 hours. Related Reading: XRP Holds The Line At $3—Wave 5 Could Unleash Run To $6+ In a recent tweet, Renowned trader Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) highlighted OMNI’s performance, revealing that his altcoin portfolio jumped from $35,000 to $60,000, driven by timely trades and strategic exposure to OMNI. Despite ongoing corrections in major tokens like BTC and ETH, OMNI’s rally shows how altcoins can thrive in selective pockets of market volatility. OMNI's price trends to the upside on the daily chart following a massive spike in trading volume. Source: OMNIUSDT on Tradingview Why OMNI is Gaining Attention Beyond the Hype OMNI’s breakout is fueled by a combination of factors. The Upbit listing attracted significant retail demand, while Binance Wallet’s 11% APY staking incentive encouraged long-term holding. Fewer circulating tokens created scarcity, driving the price up rapidly. Beyond speculation, OMNI’s integration with platforms like Aarna AI and PaintSwap strengthens its real-world utility in DeFi and crypto payroll solutions. These use cases provide substance to the rally, suggesting OMNI could sustain interest if development continues. Is Another OMNI Rally in the Cards? With OMNI trading at $5.40 and showing a 234% gain in July, traders are eyeing a potential continuation. However, resistance near $7.08 could be a critical level. Analysts urge caution: speculative pumps can reverse sharply. Still, the token’s performance serves as a case study in how listings, staking, and use cases can align for explosive returns. Traders seeking similar opportunities should track volume spikes, on-chain wallet activity, and BTC dominance shifts to identify the next breakout.

A significant shift is on the horizon, one that could fundamentally alter how mainstream investors access digital assets. Imagine a future where investing in a diverse basket of cryptocurrencies becomes as straightforward as buying a stock. This isn’t just a dream; it’s a rapidly approaching reality, fueled by potential SEC crypto approval for a new wave of exchange-traded products (ETPs). The Road to SEC Crypto Approval: What’s Happening? For years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has maintained a cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, citing concerns around investor protection, market manipulation, and regulatory clarity. However, the landscape is evolving. Recent developments, particularly the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, signal a softening in the SEC’s approach and a growing recognition of the crypto market’s maturity. Now, according to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, we could see a groundbreaking expansion. He recently shared insights on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that approximately a dozen major cryptocurrencies might soon receive the coveted green light for ETPs. This isn’t mere speculation; it’s based on new SEC listing standards that appear to pave the way for broader adoption. The key criterion for these potential approvals hinges on a specific condition: any token with more than six months of futures trading activity on Coinbase’s derivatives platform could qualify. This particular detail is crucial because it provides the SEC with a regulated and observable market for price discovery, addressing some of their long-standing concerns about underlying asset volatility and market integrity. While the exact timeline remains fluid, Balchunas points to September or October as the likely window for these approvals. This suggests that the regulatory gears are turning, and we might be just a few months away from a significant influx of new investment vehicles into the digital asset space. The potential for SEC crypto approval for these tokens has already fueled optimism among market participants. Which Tokens Are Eyeing SEC Crypto Approval? The specific tokens poised for this monumental step haven’t been officially confirmed by the SEC, but Eric Balchunas did share a snapshot of eligible tokens listed on Coinbase’s derivatives platform. Based on his analysis and the criteria mentioned, several well-known and emerging cryptocurrencies are strong contenders. While we await official announcements, here’s a hypothetical look at the types of tokens that might be on the list, based on market activity and Coinbase’s offerings: Ethereum (ETH): Already a major player with its own spot ETF applications pending, its inclusion would be a natural progression. Solana (SOL): A high-performance blockchain gaining significant traction in DeFi and NFTs. XRP (XRP): Despite its past regulatory hurdles, its established presence and utility could make it a candidate. Cardano (ADA): Known for its peer-reviewed research and strong development community. Chainlink (LINK): A decentralized oracle network vital for smart contracts. Polygon (MATIC): A popular Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Litecoin (LTC): Often considered “digital silver,” with a long trading history. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): A fork of Bitcoin with a focus on faster transactions. Uniswap (UNI): The governance token for the leading decentralized exchange. Avalanche (AVAX): A rapidly growing platform for decentralized applications. Dogecoin (DOGE): The prominent meme coin with significant community support. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Another popular meme coin with a large following. It’s important to remember that this list is illustrative and based on analyst speculation and market criteria, not official SEC declarations. The final roster of tokens to receive SEC crypto approval will depend on the SEC’s detailed review of each asset’s compliance with the new listing standards. Why is SEC Crypto Approval a Game-Changer? The potential approval of a dozen major tokens for ETPs represents more than just new investment products; it signifies a pivotal moment for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Here’s why this development is a true game-changer: Mainstream Accessibility: ETPs provide a familiar and regulated investment vehicle for traditional investors. They eliminate the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as setting up wallets, managing private keys, and navigating various exchanges. This ease of access can attract a flood of new capital from institutional investors, wealth managers, and retail investors who have been hesitant to enter the crypto market directly. Increased Liquidity and Price Stability: As more capital flows into these ETPs, it will likely lead to increased liquidity for the underlying assets. Higher liquidity can reduce price volatility and create more stable markets, benefiting all participants. Regulatory Clarity and Legitimacy: Each new SEC crypto approval for an ETP acts as a stamp of regulatory legitimacy for the underlying asset. This recognition can alleviate concerns about the legality and long-term viability of cryptocurrencies, fostering greater trust and confidence in the digital asset space. Enhanced Investor Protection: ETPs operate within a regulated framework, offering investors protections not typically found in unregulated crypto exchanges. This includes oversight by the SEC, transparency in pricing, and established redemption mechanisms, aligning with the SEC’s core mandate of investor protection. Broader Institutional Adoption: Financial institutions, pension funds, and endowments often have strict mandates regarding regulated investments. The availability of crypto ETPs removes a significant barrier, enabling these large capital pools to gain exposure to digital assets without venturing into uncharted regulatory territory. The cumulative effect of these benefits could be a profound shift in how cryptocurrencies are perceived and integrated into the global financial system. The potential for SEC crypto approval on this scale could truly legitimize the asset class. Navigating the Nuances: Challenges and Considerations for SEC Crypto Approval While the prospect of widespread crypto ETPs is exciting, it’s essential to acknowledge the inherent challenges and considerations that come with such a significant regulatory shift. The path to SEC crypto approval is rarely without its hurdles. Regulatory Scrutiny Remains High: Even with new listing standards, the SEC’s primary objective is investor protection. Each ETP application will undergo rigorous scrutiny. This means that while the path is clearer, approval is not guaranteed for every token. Issues like market manipulation concerns, custody solutions, and the robustness of the underlying futures market will still be thoroughly examined. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile assets. While ETPs provide a regulated wrapper, they do not insulate investors from the price swings of the underlying tokens. Investors need to be fully aware of the risks associated with these assets, even when accessed through traditional investment vehicles. Impact on Decentralization: Some in the crypto community express concerns that increased institutionalization through ETPs could centralize control or influence over certain networks. While ETPs don’t directly control the underlying blockchain, the concentration of large holdings by a few entities could shift power dynamics. Competitive Landscape: As more ETPs emerge, the competition among issuers will intensify. This could lead to fee compression, which is beneficial for investors but might challenge the profitability for some product providers. The market will need to differentiate based on features, underlying assets, and perhaps even innovative structures. Evolving Regulatory Framework: The SEC’s approach to crypto is still evolving. Future rules or interpretations could impact existing or pending ETPs. Staying abreast of these regulatory shifts will be crucial for both issuers and investors. The journey towards full SEC crypto approval for a broad range of assets is ongoing. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Market? For investors, the potential greenlighting of a dozen major tokens offers new avenues for portfolio diversification and exposure to the high-growth digital asset sector. Here are some actionable insights: Diversification Opportunities: Instead of being limited to Bitcoin or Ethereum, investors could soon gain exposure to a broader range of altcoins through regulated products, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk while capturing growth from various segments of the crypto market. Easier Access for Traditional Investors: If you’ve been on the sidelines due to the complexities of direct crypto investing, ETPs offer a simplified entry point. You can invest through your existing brokerage account, similar to stocks or traditional ETFs. Due Diligence is Key: While ETPs are regulated, the underlying assets are still cryptocurrencies. Understand the specific risks, use cases, and market dynamics of each token before investing. Don’t just follow the hype. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on official SEC announcements and news from reputable financial analysts like Eric Balchunas. Regulatory clarity is a significant driver of market sentiment. Consider Long-Term Strategy: The introduction of ETPs facilitates long-term, strategic allocations to crypto. This isn’t just about short-term trading; it’s about integrating digital assets into a diversified investment strategy. For the broader crypto market, this development signals a powerful endorsement and could trigger the next wave of institutional and retail adoption. The increased legitimacy and accessibility brought by widespread SEC crypto approval for ETPs could lead to significant capital inflows, driving innovation and further solidifying crypto’s place in the global financial landscape. In essence, the prospect of the SEC greenlighting a dozen or more major tokens for ETPs by fall marks a watershed moment. It reflects a growing understanding and acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance. While challenges remain, the clear trajectory is towards greater integration and accessibility. This isn’t just about new products; it’s about validating an entire asset class and opening doors to unprecedented growth and innovation. The coming months promise to be pivotal, potentially reshaping the future of finance as we know it, all driven by the increasing likelihood of widespread SEC crypto approval . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) in the context of cryptocurrencies? A1: Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) are types of securities that track the price of an underlying asset, like a cryptocurrency, and trade on traditional stock exchanges. They allow investors to gain exposure to an asset’s price movements without directly owning the asset. For cryptocurrencies, this means you can invest in an ETP that holds or tracks the price of a specific token, rather than buying and storing the token yourself. Q2: Why is the SEC’s approval of these ETPs so significant? A2: The SEC’s approval is significant because it provides a stamp of regulatory legitimacy and opens the door for traditional institutional investors, wealth managers, and retail investors to access cryptocurrencies through familiar, regulated investment vehicles. This increases market liquidity, enhances investor protection, and can lead to broader adoption and mainstream acceptance of digital assets, moving beyond the niche crypto markets. Q3: What criteria are these tokens expected to meet for SEC crypto approval? A3: According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, a key criterion for eligibility under new SEC listing standards is that the token must have more than six months of futures trading activity on Coinbase’s derivatives platform. This provides the SEC with a regulated and observable market for price discovery, addressing some of their concerns about market integrity and manipulation. Q4: When can we expect these approvals to happen? A4: While the exact timing is uncertain, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has indicated that September or October is the likely window for these potential approvals. This suggests that the regulatory process is well underway, and we could see new crypto ETPs launching in the coming months. Q5: Will these ETPs make crypto investing completely risk-free? A5: No, while ETPs offer regulatory oversight and investor protections not found in unregulated crypto exchanges, they do not eliminate the inherent volatility and risks associated with the underlying cryptocurrency assets. Investors should still conduct thorough due diligence and understand the risks of digital assets before investing in any crypto ETP. Q6: How will these approvals impact the price of the approved tokens? A6: Historically, regulatory approvals for crypto products, like spot Bitcoin ETFs, have often led to increased investor confidence and capital inflows, which can positively impact the price of the underlying asset. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the increased accessibility and legitimacy from SEC crypto approval for these tokens could certainly lead to heightened demand and potential price appreciation.

It’s a story repeated far too often. While the crypto world throws curveballs daily, savvy investors keep an eye out for the next big player before it makes headlines. Today, FLOKI has stormed past a $136 million daily volume, and Non-Playable Coin (NPC) is turning heads with steady momentum. But none of this compares to the wildfire momentum Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is generating as its presale skyrockets past $3.13 million. With each passing hour, the chance to enter at just $0.00062 gets slimmer. Time’s not on your side—miss this, and you may regret it for years. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, FLOKI, and Non-Playable Coin (NPC). Earn While You Share: Arctic Pablo’s Viral Referral Engine What if spreading the word about a meme coin could make you rich? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) isn’t just another presale—it’s a gamified earning machine. Through its referral incentives program, users are rewarded with tokens or even cash for every successful recommendation they make. Think of it as turning your social media clout or crypto group chat into a literal revenue stream. The more traction Arctic Pablo Coin gets, the more your influence pays off. It’s a self-feeding ecosystem—each referral fuels growth, which, in turn, multiplies the rewards for early backers. Could this be the meme coin that redefines viral marketing in crypto? With incentives baked into its very DNA, Arctic Pablo is one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now —especially if you like earning while you sleep. Why wait for listings when you can profit before launch? Stage 34? Clock’s Ticking—ROI Shoots Beyond 16,000% Potential Here’s a hypothetical: What would you do if a $1,500 investment could turn into nearly $20,000 in weeks? Arctic Pablo’s meme coin presale has reached Stage 34, known as Chilly Citadel , and the current price sits at $0.00062. With a confirmed listing price of $0.008, investors entering now could enjoy a 1,190.32% return. But that’s just the floor. Analysts forecast a potential climb to $0.1, which translates to a staggering 16,029.03% ROI. Early birds? They’ve already locked in 4,033.33% returns from prior stages. With over $3.13 million already raised, the momentum is relentless. Investors who act now receive 2,419,350 APC tokens for just $1,500—an investment that could soon balloon to $19,354.80 when APC hits the listing price. Can you afford to let this train pass you by again? Arctic Pablo is one of the Top New Meme Coins to invest in now, and it’s no longer an insider secret. Opportunities like this don’t knock twice—act before the door slams shut. Massive Moves for a Mighty Meme—FLOKI’s Momentum Roars Back FLOKI has always flirted with greatness, and this week, it’s starting to deliver. With a live price of $0.000117 and a 24-hour trading volume surpassing $136 million, the Viking-themed meme coin is proving it still commands the seas. These numbers suggest renewed interest from both retail and institutional investors who had temporarily looked elsewhere. Backed by community-driven hype and several ecosystem upgrades, FLOKI seems to be staging a comeback many didn’t see coming. Could this be the spark before a full-blown rally? Those waiting for a “perfect moment” may find the ship has already sailed. Don’t let this one slip through your fingers—it’s do-or-die time. Non-Playable Coin Quietly Climbs as Volume Nears $6M While loud hype often dominates the meme coin scene, Non-Playable Coin (NPC) has taken a different route—and it’s paying off. Priced at $0.02668 and boasting a 24-hour volume of $5.76 million, NPC is quietly gaining traction among collectors and gamers alike. Its appeal lies in the unique blend of meme culture and NFT compatibility, making it a niche favorite for those tired of cookie-cutter tokens. As newer investors dig deeper into NPC’s potential use cases, price movement could soon reflect its growing support base. Wait too long, and you might be left watching from the sidelines as NPC levels up. Bottom Line: The Meme Coin Matchup You Can’t Ignore From FLOKI’s jaw-dropping trading surge to NPC’s strategic rise, July 2025 has been generous to meme coin chasers. But one name towers above the rest— Arctic Pablo Coin . With its incentivized referral ecosystem, a Stage 34 presale price of just $0.00062, and potential returns of up to 16,000%, it’s hard not to see the writing on the wall. Arctic Pablo is one of the Top New Meme Coins to invest in now, not just because of its numbers, but because it’s building a community-led empire before even hitting exchanges. For anyone watching from the sidelines—this is your green light. Get in before the next price hike or prepare to watch others celebrate from the winner’s circle.

From exhilarating highs to stomach-churning lows, investor sentiment plays a monumental role in shaping market dynamics. But how do you quantify something as elusive as collective emotion? Enter the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a fascinating barometer that attempts to distill the market’s mood into a single, digestible number. As of July 31st, this crucial indicator, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a reading of 72, a slight dip from the previous day but still firmly rooted in the ‘Greed’ zone. What does this number truly signify, and how can understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index empower your investment decisions? Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Measure? At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool designed to gauge the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, it paints a vivid picture: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are highly anxious, often selling off assets, which can lead to capitulation. This might signal a buying opportunity for contrarian investors. 25-49: Fear – Sentiment is still cautious, but not at panic levels. Uncertainty dominates. 50-74: Greed – The market is becoming optimistic and confident. Prices are likely rising, and investors are eager to buy, often driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria takes over. Investors might be overextending themselves, leading to inflated prices and a potential bubble. This could signal an impending correction. The index’s current standing at 72 places it squarely in the ‘Greed’ territory. This suggests that despite a minor two-point drop, the collective sentiment remains optimistic, with many market participants feeling confident about upward price movements. The Six Pillars of Sentiment: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The brilliance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach, consolidating various data points to form a holistic view. It’s not just a gut feeling; it’s a sophisticated algorithm weighing six key factors, each contributing to the final score: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility, especially on the downside, indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market often signals greed. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for specific hashtags and keywords related to cryptocurrency. A surge in positive, excited mentions can indicate growing greed. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) Historically, this involved polling investors directly to gather their sentiment. The pause means the index is currently operating with a slightly adjusted weighting for the other factors, or this component is simply not contributing. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s dominance refers to its market capitalization share compared to the entire crypto market. A rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate a shift of funds from altcoins to Bitcoin, often seen as a safer haven during uncertain times (fear), or a strong belief in Bitcoin’s continued leadership (greed). The interpretation depends on context. Google Trends (10%): This component analyzes search query data for Bitcoin-related terms on Google. A surge in searches for “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin crash” might indicate fear, while searches for “how to buy Bitcoin” or “Bitcoin rally” could suggest growing greed. Navigating the Greed Zone: What Does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index of 72 Imply for Investors? A reading of 72 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index places the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone. For many, this might sound like good news – after all, who doesn’t want a greedy market when they’re holding assets? However, it’s crucial to understand the nuanced implications: Increased Optimism: Investors are generally feeling positive and confident. This can fuel further price increases as more capital flows into the market. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): As prices rise, those on the sidelines might feel pressured to enter, fearing they’ll miss out on potential gains. This can lead to impulsive buying. Potential for Correction: Historically, periods of extreme greed often precede market corrections. When everyone is optimistic, there are fewer buyers left, and a small trigger can lead to profit-taking and a rapid price decline. It’s a reminder that what goes up can also come down, and rapidly. Reduced Caution: In a greedy market, investors might overlook fundamental analysis, chase speculative assets, or take on excessive risk. Due diligence can sometimes be replaced by hype. While the current reading doesn’t scream ‘extreme euphoria’ (which would be 75+), it certainly signals a market where caution should be exercised. It’s a time to be vigilant, not complacent, and to ensure your investment decisions are rooted in strategy, not just emotion. Learning from History: How the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Behaves in Different Cycles Understanding the current state of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index becomes even more powerful when viewed through a historical lens. This index isn’t just a snapshot; it’s a dynamic indicator that has reflected market cycles with remarkable consistency: Bear Markets and Extreme Fear: During prolonged downtrends, the index often plummets into the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone (0-24). This is when capitulation events occur, and many retail investors sell their holdings at a loss. Paradoxically, these periods often represent the best long-term buying opportunities for seasoned investors who can stomach the volatility. Bull Markets and Extreme Greed: Conversely, as prices surge in a bull market, the index steadily climbs into ‘Greed’ and ‘Extreme Greed.’ This is when the mainstream media catches on, and new money floods in, often at the peak. These periods are typically followed by significant corrections as the market cools down. The index serves as a powerful reminder of the cyclical nature of markets and the human emotions that drive them. It reinforces the adage: ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.’ Actionable Insights: Leveraging the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Smarter Decisions So, how can you practically apply the insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to your own crypto journey? It’s not a crystal ball, but it’s a valuable tool in your analytical arsenal: Contrarian Thinking: When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear,’ consider if it’s a potential buying opportunity. When it’s in ‘Extreme Greed,’ it might be time to take some profits or at least reassess your risk exposure. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ reading should prompt you to tighten stop-losses, reduce leverage, or even scale out of positions. A low ‘Fear’ reading might suggest it’s a good time to dollar-cost average into your preferred assets. Emotional Check: Use the index as a mirror. If the index is in ‘Extreme Greed’ and you find yourself feeling euphoric and wanting to buy everything, it’s a sign to step back and re-evaluate your emotional state versus market reality. Diversification: Regardless of the index, maintain a diversified portfolio. Don’t let a single metric dictate your entire strategy. Combine with Other Metrics: The index is most effective when used in conjunction with fundamental analysis (project utility, team, roadmap) and technical analysis (chart patterns, support/resistance levels). Remember, the index reflects collective sentiment, not a guarantee of future price action. It’s a guide, not a dictator. Beyond the Numbers: Challenges and Nuances of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index While incredibly insightful, it’s important to acknowledge that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t without its limitations. No single metric can perfectly capture the complexities of the crypto market: Bitcoin-Centric: A significant portion of the index’s calculation relies on Bitcoin data (volatility, dominance, Google Trends). While Bitcoin often leads the market, altcoin sentiment can sometimes diverge. Lagging Indicator: The index reflects current sentiment based on past data. Market shifts can be rapid, and the index might not always capture instantaneous changes. Interpretation is Key: A high ‘Greed’ score doesn’t automatically mean a crash is imminent, nor does ‘Extreme Fear’ guarantee a bounce. It provides context for investor behavior, but external events (regulations, macroeconomic news) can always override sentiment. Surveys Paused: The absence of the survey component means a direct measure of investor opinion is currently missing, potentially reducing a small part of its direct human sentiment capture. For these reasons, the index should be treated as a valuable piece of a larger puzzle, complementing a comprehensive investment strategy rather than being the sole determinant. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains an indispensable tool for anyone navigating the volatile yet exhilarating world of cryptocurrencies. Its recent reading of 72, firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone, serves as a crucial reminder of the prevailing optimism in the market. While this sentiment can propel prices higher, it also signals a time for heightened awareness and strategic caution. By understanding how this index is calculated, what its different levels imply, and how it has historically reflected market cycles, investors can gain invaluable insights into collective market psychology. It empowers you to make more informed decisions, helping you to potentially buy when others are fearful and consider taking profits when euphoria reigns. Ultimately, mastering your emotions and leveraging tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index are vital steps toward building a resilient and profitable crypto portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a high Crypto Fear & Greed Index score mean? A high score, typically above 70, indicates that the market is in a state of ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed.’ This suggests investors are optimistic, prices are likely rising, and there’s a strong desire to buy, often driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO). Historically, extreme greed can precede market corrections. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment. Some platforms might offer more frequent updates, but a daily refresh is standard. Q3: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index solely based on Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s data significantly influences the index due to its market dominance (contributing to volatility, momentum, and Google Trends), the index also considers broader market factors like social media sentiment and overall market volume, making it a general indicator for the crypto market. Q4: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as my only investment strategy? No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index should not be your sole investment strategy. It’s a valuable tool for gauging market sentiment and understanding collective psychology, but it should be used in conjunction with fundamental analysis (evaluating a project’s utility, team, and technology) and technical analysis (chart patterns, price action) for a comprehensive approach. Q5: What happens when the ‘Surveys’ component of the index is paused? When the ‘Surveys’ component is paused, the index relies on the remaining five factors to calculate the score. The weighting of the other components might be slightly adjusted to compensate, or that specific portion of the data simply isn’t included, meaning the index still provides a valid, albeit slightly different, measure of sentiment based on the available data points.

Fueled by on-chain thresholds and institutional momentum, the current setup resembles classic continuation patterns seen in prior bull runs. Traders such as Titan of Crypto and Merlijn The Trader point to a bull pennant formation—a structure often followed by explosive upside . If confirmed, this could signal Bitcoin’s next major rally phase. Amid this setup, retail attention is also shifting rapidly toward emerging narratives, with MAGACOIN FINANCE now catching mass attention alongside Dogecoin-like viral momentum. Technical alignment supports bullish case Cointribune reports that Bitcoin’s short-term holder (STH) cost basis sits around $117,000—a level now acting as both a psychological and technical inflection point. Analysts suggest that a strong daily close above this line could provide the launchpad for a move to $130,000 or more. Glassnode data reinforces this threshold, while FXLeaders notes that Bitcoin is stabilizing above $119,000, a key foundation for further upside. As long as price remains within this tight range, traders remain confident that the next directional push will be to the upside. Viral presale matches Dogecoin’s breakout intensity As Bitcoin builds toward a potential breakout, attention in altcoin markets is turning toward high-momentum presales with retail-first narratives. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now matching Dogecoin’s viral growth trajectory, with Telegram activity surging and referral participation reaching new records. Analysts tracking adoption speed note that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s user base has grown faster than most meme coins in their early stages, and its no-vesting structure continues to appeal to short-term traders. Batch sales are closing out in record time, with social metrics outpacing projections by over 220% in July alone. The project’s blend of viral branding and community-driven distribution is positioning it as one of the most compelling presale opportunities of the cycle. Institutional flows and macro drivers remain key Data from AInvest shows that $82 billion in institutional inflows have contributed to a narrowing wedge pattern on the BTC chart. This tightening structure further validates the breakout thesis, especially as ETF allocations gain traction. Citi analysts note that Bitcoin’s near-term price action is now more correlated to institutional factors—such as fund inflows—than legacy indicators like stock-to-flow. If the breakout materializes, the upside target range of $136,000 to $140,000 could be reached within weeks, provided price remains above $119,000 and decisively clears $122,000. Conclusion: breakout thesis builds as altcoin frenzy grows With on-chain and technical indicators pointing toward a high-probability breakout, Bitcoin appears ready to make a historic move. But as the market eyes $130,000+ targets, meme-driven narratives are also evolving. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s viral rise now mirrors Dogecoin’s early explosion, offering traders a rare chance to ride a presale wave while Bitcoin consolidates. As the market enters a new momentum phase, early-stage altcoins could deliver outperformance before BTC even reaches its next milestone.

A recent, groundbreaking study by Mysten Labs, the innovative developer behind the Sui blockchain, sheds critical light on this very issue, suggesting that some blockchains are inherently better positioned to withstand these impending quantum threats . Understanding the Quantum Threat to Blockchain Security Our modern digital security, including the integrity of blockchain networks, relies heavily on complex mathematical problems that are currently impossible for even the most powerful traditional computers to solve within a reasonable timeframe. This is the bedrock of public-key cryptography, where you have a public key (like a blockchain address) and a private key (your secret password). The security comes from the computational difficulty of deriving the private key from the public one. Enter quantum computers. These aren’t just faster versions of current computers; they operate on fundamentally different principles, leveraging quantum mechanics to solve certain types of problems exponentially faster. The primary concern for blockchain security stems from a specific algorithm: Shor’s Algorithm . Developed by Peter Shor, this classical method, when run on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, can efficiently factor large integers. Why is this problematic for crypto? Because many of the cryptographic algorithms used today, including the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) prevalent in older blockchains, rely on the difficulty of precisely these mathematical problems. If Shor’s Algorithm can quickly factor the numbers underpinning your public key, it could potentially allow an attacker to derive your private key from publicly available blockchain data, effectively compromising your funds. While practical quantum computers capable of this scale are still years away, the potential impact is so profound that proactive preparation is not just prudent, but essential. Older vs. Newer Blockchains: The ECDSA and EdDSA Divide The heart of the quantum vulnerability discussion lies in the digital signature algorithms employed by different blockchain networks. Digital signatures are crucial for verifying transactions and ensuring their authenticity on a blockchain. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) : This algorithm has been the workhorse for many pioneering blockchains. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, and Ethereum, introduced in 2015, both rely on ECDSA for securing transactions. It’s a robust and efficient algorithm for classical computing, providing strong security guarantees. However, its mathematical underpinnings, based on elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems, are precisely what Shor’s Algorithm targets. This means that for blockchains heavily reliant on ECDSA, transitioning to quantum-resistant security presents significant technical and operational hurdles. Imagine changing the fundamental lock on a global vault while billions of dollars are constantly moving in and out – it’s a monumental task. Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) : In contrast, newer blockchains have had the advantage of learning from their predecessors and incorporating more modern cryptographic primitives. EdDSA is a more recent digital signature scheme that offers several advantages over ECDSA, including simpler implementation, better performance, and often, enhanced security properties against certain types of attacks even in a classical computing context. Crucially, as highlighted by Mysten Labs, these characteristics also make them potentially better positioned for a smoother transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards. Networks like Sui, Solana, and Near are examples of blockchains that have adopted EdDSA, giving them a potential edge in the race against quantum threats . Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature ECDSA (Older Blockchains) EdDSA (Newer Blockchains) Algorithm Basis Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem Edwards Curve Cryptography Quantum Vulnerability (Shor’s) Directly targeted; steeper transition hurdles Also vulnerable, but easier to adapt to PQC Implementation Complexity More complex, higher risk of side-channel attacks Simpler, more resistant to common attacks Performance Good, but can be less efficient than EdDSA Generally faster and more efficient Examples Bitcoin, Ethereum Sui, Solana, Near Why Mysten Labs’ Study Offers a Glimmer of Hope The findings from Mysten Labs, a prominent research and development company in the blockchain space, are not meant to induce panic but rather to provide a clear-eyed assessment and a path forward. Their study underscores that blockchains utilizing EdDSA are indeed “better positioned” to manage future quantum threats . This isn’t because EdDSA is inherently “quantum-proof” – no currently deployed public-key cryptographic algorithm is – but rather because its design facilitates a more straightforward migration to quantum-resistant algorithms. Kostas Chalkias, co-founder and Chief Cryptographer at Mysten Labs, articulated this challenge by noting the “steeper technical and operational hurdles” faced by older networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Upgrading a foundational cryptographic primitive in a network as vast and decentralized as Bitcoin or Ethereum would require immense coordination, potentially involving contentious hard forks, and could introduce new vectors for bugs or vulnerabilities. For newer chains, which often have more modular designs and have benefited from later cryptographic research, the path to integrating post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) standards is comparatively less arduous. This proactive research and disclosure from entities like Mysten Labs are crucial for the long-term health and security of the entire blockchain ecosystem as it navigates the complex landscape of quantum threats . The Urgent Need for Quantum-Resistant Cryptography The urgency surrounding quantum threats isn’t just theoretical; it’s driven by real-world timelines and the increasing integration of blockchain technology into critical financial infrastructure. Governments and national security agencies worldwide are already making concrete plans to transition away from classical cryptographic algorithms like ECDSA and Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) within the next decade. Kostas Chalkias specifically warned that these classical algorithms are slated for phase-out by 2030 or 2035. This impending deadline is particularly significant for networks that are anticipated to handle, or already handle, high-value, sensitive assets. Imagine the implications for: Sovereign Assets: National reserves or digital forms of national currencies. National Treasuries: Government-held funds or bonds tokenized on a blockchain. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Especially those tracking cryptocurrencies, which are now becoming mainstream investment vehicles. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Digital versions of fiat currency issued by central banks, which demand the highest levels of security and trust. For these critical applications, the expectation will soon shift towards mandatory implementation of post-quantum cryptographic standards. Failure to adopt these standards could severely erode long-term trust, hinder widespread adoption, and potentially expose national or institutional assets to unprecedented risks from quantum attacks. The foresight to address these quantum threats now is paramount for any blockchain aspiring to play a significant role in the global financial future. Navigating the Transition: Challenges and Opportunities The journey to a quantum-resistant blockchain ecosystem is fraught with both significant challenges and exciting opportunities. Challenges for Older Blockchains: Massive Coordination: Upgrading core cryptographic algorithms in decentralized networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum requires agreement from thousands of nodes, miners, and developers globally. This often necessitates “hard forks,” which can be contentious and lead to network splits. Legacy Codebase: These networks have years of accumulated code, making fundamental changes complex and prone to unforeseen issues. User Migration: Users would need to update their wallets and potentially generate new, quantum-resistant addresses, a massive undertaking with significant user education requirements. Performance Overhead: Many current post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are larger and slower than their classical counterparts, potentially impacting transaction throughput and network efficiency. Opportunities for Newer Blockchains: Built-in Agility: Many newer chains are designed with modularity in mind, making it easier to swap out cryptographic primitives without requiring a complete overhaul. Attracting Innovation: Projects and developers seeking to build on future-proof infrastructure may gravitate towards chains already considering quantum threats resistance. First-Mover Advantage: Being among the first to successfully implement robust post-quantum solutions could solidify their position as leaders in secure blockchain technology. The field of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is actively researching and standardizing new algorithms that can withstand quantum attacks. NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in the U.S. is leading efforts to select and standardize such algorithms. The blockchain industry will likely adopt these standards as they mature, but the ease of integration will vary significantly between networks. What Does This Mean for You, the Crypto Enthusiast?

One such event recently sent ripples through the digital asset community: a monumental USDT transfer . Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported the movement of a staggering 237,817,487 USDT from an undisclosed wallet to Ceffu, an institutional-grade custody solution. This transaction, valued at approximately $238 million, is not just a large sum; it’s a peek into the intricate dance of significant capital within the crypto ecosystem. What does such a colossal movement signify? Let’s dive deeper into the implications of this intriguing event. Understanding the Colossal USDT Transfer To truly grasp the magnitude of this event, it’s essential to understand the key players involved: USDT and Ceffu. USDT, or Tether, is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Its stability makes it a preferred medium for large-scale transactions, trading, and preserving capital during volatile market conditions. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, USDT aims to maintain a constant value, making it a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. On the other side of this transaction is Ceffu. If the name sounds familiar, it’s because Ceffu is the institutional custody arm of Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Ceffu provides secure, compliant, and enterprise-grade custody solutions for institutional clients, ensuring the safe storage of large digital asset holdings. When a significant amount of USDT moves into a platform like Ceffu, it often suggests institutional activity, rather than individual retail speculation. This particular USDT transfer therefore points towards a high-level, possibly strategic, maneuver. The Mystery of the Unknown Wallet: Who Are These Whales? The term ‘whale’ in crypto refers to an individual or entity holding a vast amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. When a transaction originates from an ‘unknown wallet,’ it adds a layer of intrigue and speculation. While blockchain transactions are transparent in terms of addresses and amounts, the identity behind these addresses often remains anonymous. This anonymity, coupled with the sheer size of the USDT transfer , fuels numerous theories: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals often execute large trades off-exchange through OTC desks to avoid market slippage and price impact. Moving funds to a custody solution like Ceffu could be part of settling such a deal. Institutional Rebalancing: Large funds or corporate treasuries might be rebalancing their portfolios, moving stablecoins to a secure custodian in preparation for future investments or to manage liquidity. Exchange Internal Transfers: While less likely for an ‘unknown wallet’ to Ceffu, sometimes exchanges move funds between their own cold storage wallets and hot wallets, or between different custodial solutions. However, the ‘unknown wallet’ tag usually implies a non-exchange controlled address initially. Preparation for Large Buys/Sells: The funds could be positioned at Ceffu for a significant upcoming purchase of other cryptocurrencies or as a secure holding place after a large sale. Why This USDT Transfer Matters: Implications for the Market A transaction of this magnitude is rarely isolated and can have several ripple effects across the crypto market. Here’s why this particular USDT transfer is significant: Aspect Potential Implication Market Sentiment Large stablecoin movements can indicate a shift in institutional confidence. Inflows to custody might signal accumulation interest. Liquidity & Stability A large sum of USDT moving to custody suggests a preference for secure, long-term holding rather than immediate trading, which can contribute to market stability. Institutional Adoption The use of Ceffu highlights the increasing reliance of institutions on professional-grade custody solutions, underscoring growing institutional adoption. Future Market Moves Such a large stablecoin holding could precede significant buying or selling activity in other cryptocurrencies, potentially influencing price action. Challenges and Actionable Insights for Tracking Whale Movements While services like Whale Alert provide valuable transparency, understanding the full context of large transactions presents challenges. The anonymity of ‘unknown wallets’ makes it difficult to ascertain the true intent or identity of the transacting parties. Moreover, a single large USDT transfer doesn’t always paint a complete picture; it’s often one piece of a larger, more complex strategy. For everyday crypto enthusiasts and investors, tracking these whale movements offers valuable insights. Here are some actionable tips: Follow Blockchain Trackers: Services like Whale Alert provide real-time updates on significant transactions. Context is Key: Don’t react to every large transfer. Instead, look for patterns, the destination of funds (e.g., exchanges, custody solutions, DeFi protocols), and the broader market context. Observe Stablecoin Flows: Large inflows of stablecoins to exchanges can signal potential buying pressure, while outflows might suggest investors are taking profits or moving funds to cold storage. Institutional News: Combine on-chain data with news about institutional partnerships, fund launches, or regulatory developments to get a holistic view. A Glimpse into the Future: What Could This Mean? The movement of such a substantial amount of USDT into Ceffu reinforces the growing professionalization of the crypto space. As institutional players increasingly enter the market, the demand for secure, compliant, and scalable infrastructure like Ceffu’s will only grow. This particular USDT transfer could be a harbinger of more institutional activity, whether it’s preparing for large-scale investments in Bitcoin or Ethereum, managing treasury assets, or facilitating large private transactions. While the immediate impact on market prices might not be apparent, the underlying message is clear: big money is moving within the crypto ecosystem, and it’s seeking secure, institutional-grade solutions for its holdings. This indicates a maturing market where sophisticated players are not just dabbling but actively integrating digital assets into their financial strategies. The recent USDT transfer of over $237 million to Ceffu, as reported by Whale Alert, is more than just a large number; it’s a compelling narrative of institutional confidence and strategic maneuvering in the cryptocurrency market. It highlights the critical role of stablecoins like USDT in facilitating large transactions and the increasing importance of robust custody solutions for institutional participants. While the identity behind the ‘unknown wallet’ remains a mystery, the destination—Ceffu—speaks volumes about the growing professionalization and institutionalization of digital asset management. This transaction serves as a powerful reminder that the crypto market is continuously evolving, with significant players making moves that shape its future trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDT and why is it used for such large transfers?

49268716,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=776627,1753922667,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49268716.jpeg,Public companies’ crypto holdings soar to $160b,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/public-firms-crypto-holdings-soar-to-160b/,"The cumulative market capitalization of public companies that own crypto is now at $160 billion, up from roughly $90 billion to start the year — a new trend in which investors are hungry to get crypto exposure via US equities. This expansion over the last six months reflects a larger trend in corporate treasury strategies , where firms are beginning to look at digital assets and their role as a balance sheet asset on a more mainstream basis. Some of these firms have seen their share price rise by double-digits following the news of their crypto treasury, with markets reacting to this trend that is just taking off. mNAV and token-to-equity swaps offer whales strategic exit routes The mNAV (multiple of Net Asset Value) is key to understanding these treasury operators. It is calculated by multiplying the NAV of the token by a multiple of currency, which is derived by dividing the enterprise value by the NAV of the token. Although many of these treasury companies are trading above a premium mNAV, it’s not an automatic leveraged trade being put on, as speculative buying may force the price higher. The premium represents a market opinion on professional crypto management and institutional solidity, rather than simply asset backing. Treasury firms further give large holders of tokens the opportunity for an elegant exit, even when that can avoid liquidity constraints of the traditional market. Instead of dumping directly on exchanges and potentially damaging the value, whales start moving their holding onto treasury vehicles in return for equity shares. They can then sell these equity positions on traditional financial markets, and enjoy better liquidity and stable pricing of their equity, while remaining “ diversified treasury ” rather than simply having dumped tokens. This development tackles core liquidity problems in token markets while also inventing new ways to access and invest in the traditional financial world, combined with crypto markets. The durability of these valuations may hinge on thoughtful execution and the uncorrelated tailwinds from underlying crypto assets. Strategy’s $2.5B STRC raise signals a new era of yield-bearing Bitcoin instruments Strategy, one of Wall Street’s most prominent corporate holders of Bitcoin, has reinforced its position as a de facto Bitcoin proxy with the launch of a landmark capital raise. The company closed a $2.5 billion offering on Tuesday, making it the largest crypto-linked equity raise of the year. The deal was executed through a newly created class of perpetual preferred stock called STRC, which pays a floating monthly dividend beginning at 9%. According to the company’s statement, the proceeds from the STRC issuance were used to purchase 21,021 BTC at an average price of $117,256 per coin. This brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to an astounding 628,791 BTC, valued at over $74 billion at current market prices. STRC is expected to debut on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. Once listed, it will become the first US exchange-listed perpetual preferred security issued by a Bitcoin treasury company that offers monthly dividend payments, the company said. The STRC raise also marks Strategy’s largest capital raise to date, eclipsing its $800 million convertible note offering from June 2024. It follows the launch of STRF in March, which Strategy’s executive chairman, Michael Saylor, once described as the firm’s “crown jewel.” The STRF product was backed by a $2.1 billion at-the-market equity program. However, unlike STRF—which was primarily targeted at institutional investors—the new STRC product is designed with retail income investors in mind. Its floating monthly payouts and lack of maturity make it appealing to those seeking stable yield exposure linked to Bitcoin, without the risk of spot market volatility. “Yield products such as this offer exposure without direct spot market volatility,” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, said. “It represents meaningful progress in structured capital flows that deepen Bitcoin liquidity without pressuring the order book.” The innovative structure of STRC underscores a broader trend among corporate Bitcoin holders who are seeking to monetize their BTC reserves and attract new classes of investors.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is now trading at an astonishing $118,017.54 on the Binance USDT market. This monumental leap in Bitcoin price is not just a number; it represents a significant milestone in the ongoing journey of digital finance, sparking excitement and renewed interest across the global financial landscape. What factors are fueling this incredible ascent, and what does it signify for the future of the crypto ecosystem? What Propelled the Bitcoin Price to Unprecedented Heights? The extraordinary surge in Bitcoin price is fueled by a confluence of key drivers, including technological advancements, macroeconomic shifts, and growing mainstream acceptance. Institutional Adoption Accelerates: A primary catalyst for the recent surge in Bitcoin price is the increasing involvement of institutional players. Major financial institutions, hedge funds, and public companies are allocating portfolios to Bitcoin, recognizing it as a legitimate store of value and inflation hedge. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has opened regulated avenues for traditional investors, significantly boosting demand. The Echo of Halving Events: Bitcoin halving events, occurring approximately every four years, reduce the reward for mining new blocks by half. This cuts the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation. With a finite supply of 21 million Bitcoin, reduced new supply against increasing demand naturally puts upward pressure on the Bitcoin price over time, contributing to sustained bull runs. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: Global economic uncertainties, rising inflation, and fiat currency devaluations have driven investors towards alternative assets. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ is increasingly seen as a safe haven. As central banks continue quantitative easing, the appeal of a decentralized, deflationary asset like Bitcoin grows stronger, attracting capital from traditional markets. Technological Advancements and Network Growth: Beyond price, the Bitcoin network continues to evolve. Improvements in scalability solutions like the Lightning Network, enhanced security protocols, and broader integration into payment systems make Bitcoin more usable. Increased utility and a growing number of network participants reinforce Bitcoin’s fundamental strength, contributing to positive sentiment and its Bitcoin price . A Glimpse into Bitcoin’s Illustrious Journey: How Far Has the Bitcoin Price Come? To truly appreciate Bitcoin’s current valuation, it’s vital to reflect on its incredible journey. From its humble beginnings as a niche digital currency, Bitcoin has defied countless skeptics and market cycles to establish itself as a global financial force. Its path has been marked by extreme volatility, breathtaking rallies, and challenging corrections, yet the overall trajectory of the Bitcoin price has been one of remarkable growth. Consider these historical milestones: 2010: The Pizza Transaction: Famously, 10,000 BTC were used to buy two pizzas, valuing Bitcoin at a fraction of a cent. 2013: Breaking $1,000: Bitcoin first crossed the $1,000 mark, drawing significant attention. 2017: The ICO Boom & Mainstream Awareness: Bitcoin reached nearly $20,000, becoming a household name. 2021: New All-Time Highs: Bitcoin surged past $60,000, fueled by institutional interest and broader adoption. Each milestone, including this latest ascent past $118,000, tells a story of increasing maturity, growing network effects, and a gradual shift in global perception. The journey of the Bitcoin price is a testament to the power of decentralized technology. Navigating the Currents: Understanding the Dynamics Behind the Bitcoin Price The cryptocurrency market, and particularly Bitcoin, operates on unique dynamics that differ significantly from traditional financial markets. Understanding these forces is crucial for anyone trying to make sense of Bitcoin price movements. Supply and Demand Fundamentals: Like any asset, Bitcoin’s value is largely determined by supply and demand. With a fixed maximum supply and diminishing new coin creation, increased demand from retail investors, institutions, and corporations inevitably drives the Bitcoin price upwards. Whale Activity and Market Influence: ‘Whales’ (large holders of Bitcoin) can significantly impact market sentiment and price with their buying or selling activities. Their large transactions are monitored as indicators of potential shifts in the Bitcoin price trend. Market Sentiment and News Cycles: The crypto market is highly sensitive to news, social media trends, and overall sentiment. Positive news can trigger buying frenzies, while negative news can lead to sharp sell-offs. This emotional component plays a substantial role in short-term Bitcoin price fluctuations. Global Macroeconomic Factors: Broader macroeconomic factors, such as interest rate decisions, inflation reports, geopolitical events, and the performance of traditional assets, increasingly influence the Bitcoin price . As Bitcoin integrates into the global financial system, its correlation with traditional markets fluctuates. What Does This Monumental Bitcoin Price Mean for You, the Investor? An explosive rise in Bitcoin price to $118,000 naturally brings different implications for various types of investors. Understanding these scenarios is crucial for making informed decisions. For Long-Term Holders (HODLers): Validation of Conviction: Reaching $118,000 powerfully validates their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s potential. Increased Portfolio Value: The primary benefit is a significant increase in the value of their holdings. Potential for Profit Taking: Some may choose to take partial profits, diversifying gains or securing initial investment. For Active Traders: Enhanced Volatility and Opportunities: High prices often come with increased volatility, presenting opportunities for day and swing traders. Risk Management is Key: Effective risk management strategies, including stop-losses, become even more critical. Technical Analysis Focus: Traders closely watch technical indicators for entry and exit points. For New Entrants: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): A rapid surge in Bitcoin price can trigger FOMO; approach with caution. Importance of Research: New investors should prioritize thorough research, understanding technology, risks, and market dynamics. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, can be a prudent way to enter the market. Are There Storm Clouds on the Horizon? Addressing Risks to the Bitcoin Price While the current surge in Bitcoin price is exhilarating, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective and acknowledge the inherent risks. No investment is without its challenges, and Bitcoin is no exception. Market Volatility: Bitcoin is renowned for its price swings. A rapid ascent can often be followed by a sharp correction. Investors must be prepared for significant drawdowns. Regulatory Scrutiny: As Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance, regulatory bodies are increasingly focusing on governance. Overly restrictive regulations can dampen investor sentiment and negatively impact the Bitcoin price . Security Risks: Despite Bitcoin’s robust technology, investors face risks related to custodial solutions, exchange hacks, phishing scams, and losing private keys. Proper security practices are paramount. Competition and Technological Obsolescence: While Bitcoin is dominant, the crypto space is dynamic. New technologies and altcoins are constantly emerging. Macroeconomic Headwinds: A sudden shift in global economic conditions, such as a severe recession or a drastic change in monetary policy, could lead to a broader market downturn, affecting the Bitcoin price . Responsible investing in Bitcoin means being fully aware of these risks and having a strategy to mitigate them. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price? With Bitcoin now firmly established above $118,000, the natural question arises: what comes next for the Bitcoin price ? While no one can predict the future with certainty, several factors suggest continued evolution and potential for further growth, albeit with inevitable fluctuations. The increasing integration of Bitcoin into traditional finance is a trend likely to continue. As more institutional capital flows in and regulatory frameworks mature, Bitcoin’s volatility might gradually decrease. Innovations in the underlying technology will further enhance its utility and appeal. The narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a store of value is gaining stronger traction globally. As governments continue to print money and economic uncertainties persist, Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized, scarce asset could continue to grow. However, potential future market corrections are always a possibility, and investors should be prepared for pullbacks. The long-term outlook for Bitcoin price remains optimistic for many analysts who foresee Bitcoin continuing its trajectory as a foundational digital asset in a rapidly evolving global economy. Its journey is far from over, and the $118,000 milestone is likely just another chapter in its compelling story. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s ascent above $118,000 is a testament to its enduring strength, growing adoption, and the powerful forces driving the digital asset revolution. From institutional influx to macroeconomic shifts, various elements have converged to propel the Bitcoin price to this impressive height. While the journey has been remarkable, investors must remain vigilant, understanding both the immense opportunities and the inherent risks. As Bitcoin continues to carve its path in the global financial landscape, its story serves as a compelling reminder of innovation’s power and the evolving nature of money. The future of Bitcoin, though uncertain in its short-term movements, appears poised for continued relevance and potentially further growth, solidifying its position as a transformative asset of the 21st century. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the significance of Bitcoin reaching $118,000? Reaching $118,000 signifies a major milestone for Bitcoin, demonstrating increased institutional adoption, growing investor confidence, and its strengthening position as a legitimate global asset. It reflects a substantial increase in its market capitalization and validates its role as a significant player in the financial world. What factors primarily influence the Bitcoin price? The Bitcoin price is influenced by a combination of factors including supply and demand dynamics, halving events that reduce new supply, institutional investment, macroeconomic conditions (like inflation and interest rates), regulatory developments, technological advancements within the Bitcoin network, and overall market sentiment driven by news and social media. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin? Whether it’s ‘too late’ to invest in Bitcoin is a subjective question with no definitive answer. While Bitcoin has seen significant appreciation, many analysts believe it still has long-term growth potential. However, it’s crucial for new investors to conduct thorough research, understand the risks, and consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility. How does institutional adoption impact Bitcoin price? Institutional adoption significantly impacts the Bitcoin price by bringing in substantial capital, increasing market liquidity, and enhancing its legitimacy. When large financial institutions and corporations invest, it signals confidence to other investors, potentially leading to broader acceptance and increased demand, thus pushing the price higher. What are the main risks associated with investing in Bitcoin? The main risks include extreme price volatility, potential regulatory changes that could impact its use or value, security risks such as exchange hacks or loss of private keys, and the general uncertainty inherent in a relatively new asset class. Investors should only invest what they can afford to lose. Where can I monitor the current Bitcoin price?

The ruling, expected this Friday, follows an October decision by the Court of Appeal that triggered a wave of compensation claims from car buyers who said they were misled by undisclosed commissions paid by banks to dealerships. The case has since become a flashpoint for the UK financial sector, with billions of pounds potentially at stake. Supreme Court ruling could sharply cut bank compensation liabilities However, analysts now believe the Supreme Court could limit the scope of the earlier judgment, reducing the estimated financial hit to banks and likely curtailing the ruling’s ripple effects across other commission-based industries. “There has been a shift downwards in consensus estimates of redress costs for banks by about 20 per cent,” said Benjamin Toms, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. He added that growing sentiment among legal experts suggests the top court may partially reverse the Court of Appeal’s position. Toms recently revised his estimates, lowering the projected industry-wide compensation cost — spanning banks and non-banks — by 30%, down to £11 billion. That figure, he noted, remains “well below consensus expectations.” Jefferies banking analyst Jonathan Pierce also expects a more favourable outcome for lenders. He believes the potential liability for Lloyds Banking Group, the UK’s largest car finance provider through its Black Horse arm, could fall from £4 billion to no more than £2 billion. Pierce, who attended the April Supreme Court hearings, pointed out that judges appeared to scrutinize key issues like fiduciary duty and dishonest assistance — suggesting a narrower interpretation could emerge. HSBC had previously estimated the scandal could cost lenders up to £44 billion, including £10 billion in administrative costs. However, the bank returned that projection after the analyst responsible for the figure departed the firm. Simon Crown, financial regulation partner at Clifford Chance, echoed the market’s cautious optimism: “Most likely the Court of Appeal decision won’t be fully upheld, but the judgment will be somewhere in between.” Regulators target misleading legal claims amid surge in ‘no-win, no-fee’ offers Meanwhile, millions of UK consumers are being targeted by “no-win, no-fee” legal services offering to pursue compensation claims. The rise in such offers has sparked concern from regulators, who worry some firms may be exploiting claimants. On Thursday, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a joint warning about “poor practices.” The agencies noted that consumers could face fees as high as 30% of their redress. The SRA is currently investigating 73 law firms over possible breaches of high-volume claims protocols. “Where we find cases where firms are not acting in the best interest of their clients, we will investigate and take action,” said SRA chief executive Paul Philip. The FCA also revealed that 224 misleading car loan redress advertisements had been amended or removed over the past year. Should the Supreme Court ruling favor claimants, the FCA is considering a formal redress scheme offering free access to compensation claims to protect consumers. The watchdog urged firms to inform clients of this potential option and disclose any exit fees. Some consumers involved in no-win, no-fee cases have been warned they could be charged up to £175 an hour if they withdraw. “Any fee must be reasonable and reflect the work actually undertaken,” said the regulator. Experts warn of broader legal risks if ruling sets wide precedent Even if the banks win the legal battle, they still face billions in compensation claims over discretionary commissions, encouraging dealers to arrange loans with inflated interest rates. There are also lingering concerns that the Court of Appeal’s earlier ruling could pave the way for similar lawsuits across sectors such as insurance, consumer credit, and price comparison services — all of which use commission structures. However, legal experts anticipate that the Supreme Court will set limits. Julius Grower, a commercial law professor at the University of Oxford, believes the judges will clarify the scope of fiduciary duties and narrow the potential for future litigation. “The problem with the Court of Appeal judgment, as far as the banks were concerned, was that it held there was a fiduciary duty in every relationship between a car dealership and consumer,” Grower said. “And that, simply by paying a commission, the bank was deliberately dishonest in suborning that.

Are we in a period where Bitcoin reigns supreme, or are altcoins poised for explosive growth? The answer often lies within key metrics, and one of the most insightful is the Altcoin Season Index . As of July 31, 00:30 UTC, this crucial indicator, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered a score of 36, a two-point dip from the previous day. This figure isn’t just a number; it’s a clear signal: the crypto market is currently entrenched in ‘Bitcoin Season’. But what exactly does this mean for your digital assets, and how should you navigate these waters? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index : Your Market Compass The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a simple statistic; it’s a sophisticated tool designed to provide clarity on the prevailing market sentiment and capital flow. Developed and tracked by the reputable cryptocurrency price data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC), this index offers a snapshot of how the broader altcoin market is performing relative to Bitcoin over a specific period. Here’s a breakdown of how this vital metric works: Scope of Measurement: The index specifically compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap. Exclusions: To ensure an accurate representation of speculative altcoin performance, stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) are deliberately excluded from the calculation. This prevents their price stability or direct pegging from skewing the results. Timeframe: The comparison is made over a 90-day rolling period. This extended window helps smooth out short-term volatility and provides a more reliable trend indication. The Score Range: The index scores range from 1 to 100, with each number reflecting a different market state. To put it simply, the index helps us define two distinct market phases: Defining Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season The threshold for declaring a specific ‘season’ is quite clear: Altcoin Season: For the market to be officially in Altcoin Season, at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) must have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. This indicates a broad, sustained surge in altcoin values relative to BTC. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day period. This signifies that capital is primarily flowing into Bitcoin, and altcoins are generally lagging behind. Neither: If the index falls between 26 and 74, the market is considered to be in a ‘Neither’ phase, indicating mixed performance or a period of transition where neither altcoins nor Bitcoin are showing overwhelming dominance. Here’s a quick reference table: Altcoin Season Index Score Market State Condition (Top 100 Altcoins vs. BTC over 90 Days) 75 or higher Altcoin Season At least 75% outperform Bitcoin 25 or lower Bitcoin Season 25% or fewer outperform Bitcoin 26 – 74 Neither Mixed performance With the Altcoin Season Index currently at 36, it unequivocally points to a Bitcoin Season, meaning Bitcoin is currently the dominant force in the market, drawing in more capital and outperforming the vast majority of altcoins. Why the Crucial Shift to Bitcoin Dominance? The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 36 isn’t arbitrary; it reflects a confluence of factors that have bolstered Bitcoin’s position in the market. Understanding these drivers is key to grasping the broader cryptocurrency landscape: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability or inflation concerns, investors often seek out perceived safe-haven assets. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and fixed supply, has increasingly been viewed as a form of ‘digital gold.’ This narrative attracts institutional and retail capital looking to hedge against traditional market volatility, pushing its price up relative to more speculative assets. Institutional Adoption and Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and launch of Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have been a game-changer. These ETFs provide a regulated and accessible pathway for large institutions and traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This influx of institutional capital has significantly increased demand for BTC, leading to its outperformance. The Bitcoin Halving Narrative: Bitcoin undergoes a ‘halving’ event approximately every four years, which cuts the supply of new Bitcoin entering circulation by half. Historically, these events have been precursors to significant bull runs for Bitcoin. As the next halving approaches, anticipation builds, leading to increased accumulation of BTC in expectation of future price appreciation. This narrative often pulls capital away from altcoins. Capital Rotation: The crypto market often sees capital rotating between different asset classes. During periods of high confidence or specific catalysts for Bitcoin, investors tend to consolidate their holdings into BTC, viewing it as a less volatile and more secure bet. This rotation means that funds that might otherwise flow into altcoins are instead directed towards Bitcoin, contributing to its dominance. Altcoin Over-speculation and Risk Aversion: Following periods of significant altcoin pumps, some investors may become more risk-averse, moving profits from altcoins back into Bitcoin, which is generally perceived as having a lower risk profile among cryptocurrencies. This profit-taking and re-allocation further strengthens Bitcoin’s position. These factors collectively explain why the Altcoin Season Index is currently signaling a strong Bitcoin Season, making it imperative for investors to adjust their strategies accordingly. Implications of Bitcoin Season: How Does It Affect Your Crypto Portfolio? When the Altcoin Season Index points firmly to Bitcoin Season, it carries significant implications for your cryptocurrency investments. This isn’t just a statistical observation; it’s a direct indicator of where market momentum lies and how your portfolio might be performing. Altcoin Underperformance: The most immediate effect is that the vast majority of altcoins will likely underperform Bitcoin. While some individual altcoins might experience temporary pumps due to specific news or developments, the broader trend will see Bitcoin gaining value at a faster rate, or losing value at a slower rate, than most altcoins. Shift in Focus: Investor attention and media narratives tend to shift predominantly to Bitcoin’s price action. Major news outlets and crypto analysts will focus on BTC’s movements, often sidelining discussions about altcoins. Potential for Altcoin Accumulation: For strategic investors, Bitcoin Season can present an opportune time to accumulate quality altcoins at potentially lower prices. As capital flows out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, the prices of many promising projects may become more attractive for long-term holding. Increased Volatility for Speculative Altcoins: While Bitcoin tends to be more stable during its dominant phases, highly speculative or low-cap altcoins might experience increased volatility, including sharper declines, as liquidity shifts away from them. Importance of Diversification (Even Within Crypto): This period underscores the importance of a balanced portfolio. While altcoins offer higher potential returns, Bitcoin provides a foundational stability that can help weather market downturns. Understanding these implications is the first step towards formulating an effective investment strategy during a Bitcoin-dominated market. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Actionable Strategies for Investors Given the current Altcoin Season Index reading, how can savvy investors best navigate this Bitcoin-dominated market? Here are some actionable strategies to consider: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, continuing to invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price fluctuations, can be an effective strategy. This mitigates the risk of trying to time the market and allows you to accumulate more Bitcoin during periods of lower prices. Research and Accumulate Quality Altcoins: Bitcoin Season isn’t a signal to abandon altcoins entirely. Instead, it’s an excellent time for in-depth research. Identify altcoin projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, active development teams, and robust communities. These projects are more likely to rebound strongly when altcoin season eventually returns. Consider accumulating them strategically at discounted prices. Rebalance Your Portfolio: Assess your current portfolio allocation. If your altcoin holdings significantly outweigh your Bitcoin exposure, this might be a good time to rebalance. Consider taking some profits from any altcoins that have performed well or reducing exposure to highly speculative assets, and reallocating a portion to Bitcoin. Focus on Risk Management: During Bitcoin Season, the risk associated with altcoins can be higher. Avoid over-leveraging or investing more than you can afford to lose, especially in smaller, unproven altcoins. Set clear stop-loss orders for more volatile assets. Stay Informed and Patient: Market cycles are natural. While Bitcoin is currently dominating, conditions can shift. Continuously monitor the Altcoin Season Index and broader market news. Patience is crucial; don’t chase pumps or make impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements. By adopting these strategies, you can position your portfolio to not only weather the current Bitcoin Season but also potentially capitalize on future market shifts. When Will Altcoin Season Return? Key Indicators to Watch While the Altcoin Season Index clearly points to Bitcoin’s current dominance, the crypto market is cyclical. Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever, and understanding the potential triggers for a shift back to altcoin outperformance is crucial for strategic planning. Here are some key indicators to watch for: Bitcoin Price Stabilization or Consolidation: Often, after a significant run-up, Bitcoin’s price will enter a period of consolidation or sideways movement. This allows capital to potentially flow out of BTC and seek higher returns in altcoins. Increased Retail Interest: Altcoin seasons are frequently fueled by renewed retail investor interest. Look for signs like increased social media mentions of altcoins, rising search trends for specific projects, and a general resurgence of excitement beyond just Bitcoin. Breakthroughs in Specific Altcoin Sectors: Innovation drives the crypto market. Major developments or adoption within specific altcoin sectors – be it Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Layer 2 scaling solutions, or new blockchain technologies – can ignite interest and capital flow into those areas. Significant Decrease in Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), a separate metric showing Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market, is a critical indicator. A sustained decrease in BTC.D, especially if accompanied by rising altcoin prices, signals a potential shift. The Altcoin Season Index Begins to Rise: The most direct indicator, of course, will be the Altcoin Season Index itself. A consistent upward trend, particularly breaking above the ‘Neither’ zone and heading towards the 75 mark, would be a strong signal of altcoin resurgence. Monitoring these signals can help investors anticipate the return of altcoin season and position themselves to capitalize on the next wave of growth. Challenges and Opportunities in a Bitcoin-Dominated Market Operating in a Bitcoin Season, as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index , presents both unique challenges and significant opportunities for crypto investors. Challenges: Lower Returns on Altcoins: The primary challenge is the general underperformance of altcoins, which can be frustrating for those heavily invested in them. It requires patience and a long-term perspective. Increased Volatility for Some Alts: Smaller, less established altcoins may experience sharper price declines as capital flows out, increasing investment risk. Temptation to Chase Pumps: In a slower altcoin market, there’s a temptation to chase the few altcoins that do pump, often leading to losses if not done with careful research and risk management. Opportunities: Accumulation Phases for Quality Altcoins: Bitcoin Season can be an ideal time to accumulate fundamentally strong altcoins at discounted prices, setting the stage for significant gains when altcoin season eventually returns. Learning and Research: This period offers a valuable opportunity to deepen your understanding of market cycles, fundamental analysis, and risk management without the pressure of a rapidly moving bull market. Strengthening Core Bitcoin Holdings: For many, Bitcoin is the foundational asset. This period allows investors to strengthen their core BTC holdings, which often act as a safer anchor in volatile times. Reduced Noise: With less widespread altcoin euphoria, it can be easier to conduct objective research and identify genuinely promising projects rather than getting caught up in hype. Embracing a balanced perspective during Bitcoin Season can lead to more informed decisions and potentially stronger long-term portfolio growth. Conclusion: Navigating the Market with the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index at 36 is a clear indicator: we are firmly in Bitcoin Season. This means Bitcoin is currently outperforming the vast majority of altcoins, drawing in significant capital due to macroeconomic factors, institutional interest, and its unique market narratives. While this period might present challenges for altcoin-heavy portfolios, it also offers invaluable opportunities for strategic accumulation, portfolio rebalancing, and in-depth research into fundamentally strong projects. By understanding what the Altcoin Season Index signals and adopting a disciplined approach, investors can navigate these market cycles effectively, positioning themselves for future success regardless of whether Bitcoin or altcoins are leading the charge. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Altcoin Season Index ? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC) that compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It provides a score from 1 to 100 to indicate whether the market is in Altcoin Season, Bitcoin Season, or a neutral phase. 2. How is Altcoin Season defined by the index? Altcoin Season is defined when the Altcoin Season Index reaches 75 or higher. This means that at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. 3. What does it mean if the Altcoin Season Index is at 36? An Altcoin Season Index reading of 36 indicates that the market is currently in Bitcoin Season. This means 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days, signifying Bitcoin’s dominance in market performance. 4. Should I sell all my altcoins during Bitcoin Season? Not necessarily. While altcoins generally underperform during Bitcoin Season, it can be an opportune time to research and accumulate quality altcoin projects with strong fundamentals at potentially lower prices. It’s crucial to manage risk and consider rebalancing your portfolio, but a complete sell-off might mean missing future opportunities. 5. What are some signs that Altcoin Season might be returning? Key indicators include Bitcoin’s price stabilizing or consolidating after a strong run, a significant decrease in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), renewed retail interest in altcoins, major technological breakthroughs in specific altcoin sectors, and, most directly, a consistent rise in the Altcoin Season Index itself. 6.

Recently, a significant event has sent ripples across the market: an Ethereum whale , identified by its address, has embarked on an extraordinary buying spree, accumulating hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ETH in a remarkably short period. This massive acquisition raises critical questions about market sentiment, future price movements, and the underlying conviction of major players in the Ethereum ecosystem. Understanding such moves is crucial for anyone navigating the complex waters of digital assets. Who is this Mysterious Ethereum Whale? On-chain data has brought to light the impressive purchasing power of a specific Ethereum whale . This address, beginning with 0x286 , has been meticulously tracked by on-chain analysts, including @EmberCN on X, revealing a consistent and substantial accumulation strategy. The recent activity shows a particularly aggressive phase: Latest Purchase: Approximately one hour ago, this whale acquired 32,855 Ethereum (ETH) valued at an astounding $124 million through the institutional trading platform, FalconX. Six-Day Spree: This latest acquisition is part of a larger trend. Since July 25, the same address has purchased a staggering total of 113,029 ETH. Total Value: The cumulative value of these purchases over six days stands at an impressive $420 million. Average Price: The average acquisition price for this massive haul comes in at approximately $3,720 per ETH. This level of concentrated buying activity from a single entity is rare and signals a profound belief in Ethereum’s future trajectory. The use of platforms like FalconX, which cater to institutional and high-net-worth clients, further suggests that this might not be a retail investor but rather a sophisticated entity or a collective fund. Why Does an Ethereum Whale’s Actions Matter? The movements of an Ethereum whale are not just interesting anecdotes; they are significant indicators that can influence market sentiment and price action. Here’s why such large-scale accumulations are closely watched: Market Confidence: A substantial purchase by a whale often signals strong conviction in the asset’s long-term value. It can be interpreted as a bullish signal, suggesting that informed, large-scale investors see significant upside potential. Liquidity Impact: When a whale accumulates, it effectively removes a large amount of supply from the open market, potentially reducing liquidity. If this trend continues, it can create upward pressure on prices due to decreased sell-side availability. Sentiment Shift: News of major whale activity can inspire confidence among smaller investors, potentially leading to a ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) effect, which can further drive demand and price appreciation. Potential for Volatility: While accumulation is often bullish, the sheer size of a whale’s holdings also means they have the power to cause significant price fluctuations if they decide to sell a portion of their holdings. This particular Ethereum whale ‘s sustained buying indicates a strategic move, rather than a speculative short-term trade, which could be a positive sign for the broader ETH market. Decoding the Strategy of an Ethereum Whale What drives an entity to commit $420 million to a single cryptocurrency in such a short timeframe? While the exact motivations of the 0x286 address remain speculative, several factors could be at play when an Ethereum whale engages in such a strategy: Long-Term Conviction: The most straightforward explanation is a deep belief in Ethereum’s fundamental value and its role in the future of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3. This whale might be accumulating at what they perceive to be a favorable price point for future gains. Institutional Mandate: The purchases could be part of an institutional investment strategy, where a fund or corporation is building a significant position in ETH as part of a diversified portfolio or a specific investment thesis. FalconX’s involvement supports this theory. Market Timing: The whale might believe that Ethereum is currently undervalued or poised for a significant rally, potentially ahead of major network upgrades or broader market shifts. Arbitrage or OTC Deals: While less likely for such consistent accumulation on a single platform, some whale activity can be linked to arbitrage opportunities or over-the-counter (OTC) deals that don’t directly impact exchange order books but still represent significant asset transfers. The consistency of these purchases over six days suggests a well-planned, methodical approach rather than impulsive trading, hinting at a strategic vision for their Ethereum whale holdings. Navigating the Waters: What This Means for ETH Holders For existing or prospective ETH holders, the actions of this prominent Ethereum whale offer both insights and considerations. It’s essential to interpret such news with a balanced perspective: Reinforced Confidence: The sheer volume of this accumulation can serve as a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem. It might reassure investors who are concerned about market volatility or short-term price dips. Not a Guarantee: While significant, whale activity is not a foolproof predictor of future price movements. The crypto market remains inherently volatile, and external factors can always influence prices. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: This accumulation appears to be a long-term play. Short-term traders should still rely on their own technical analysis and risk management strategies. On-Chain Monitoring: For those interested, continuing to monitor the 0x286 address and other large whale movements can provide valuable context, though direct imitation of their trades is rarely advisable without extensive research. Ultimately, this whale’s actions highlight the ongoing institutional and large-scale interest in Ethereum, reinforcing its position as a cornerstone of the decentralized economy. Challenges and Opportunities in Tracking Ethereum Whales Tracking an Ethereum whale offers both significant opportunities for market insight and inherent challenges. The transparency of blockchain technology allows anyone to view transactions, but interpreting them correctly requires expertise: Opportunities: Early Indicators: Large accumulations or distributions can sometimes precede significant price movements, offering early signals to observant analysts. Market Sentiment Gauge: Whale activity can serve as a real-time barometer of confidence among major players. Understanding Market Structure: Analyzing whale movements helps in understanding the concentration of wealth and influence within a cryptocurrency’s ecosystem. Challenges: Identity Obscurity: While addresses are public, the true identity behind them is often unknown, making it difficult to ascertain motives or strategies with certainty. Complex Strategies: Whales often employ sophisticated strategies, including using multiple addresses or OTC desks, making comprehensive tracking difficult. Misinterpretation Risk: A large transfer might not be a buy or sell but simply an internal transfer between wallets, which can be misinterpreted by casual observers. Lag in Reporting: On-chain data needs to be processed and analyzed, leading to a slight lag between the actual transaction and its reported interpretation. Despite these challenges, the work of on-chain analysts like @EmberCN provides invaluable insights into the opaque world of large crypto holdings, helping the broader community understand market dynamics. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal from the Deep The recent monumental accumulation of $420 million worth of ETH by a single Ethereum whale is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful testament to the enduring appeal and perceived value of Ethereum. This strategic, sustained buying spree by the 0x286 address, facilitated by institutional platforms like FalconX, underscores a significant vote of confidence from a major market participant. While the crypto market is inherently unpredictable, such substantial investments from well-resourced entities often precede periods of growth or stability, signaling a strong bullish sentiment from the deep pockets of the crypto world. For the Ethereum community, this whale’s actions serve as a compelling reminder of the asset’s foundational strength and its potential for continued evolution and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a ‘crypto whale’? A crypto whale refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their holdings are so significant that their buy or sell orders can notably influence market prices and liquidity. In the context of Ethereum, an Ethereum whale holds a substantial amount of ETH. Q2: How do analysts track Ethereum whale activity? Analysts track Ethereum whale activity using on-chain data, which is publicly available on the Ethereum blockchain. They use specialized tools and platforms to monitor large transactions, wallet addresses with significant holdings, and movements of funds between exchanges or private wallets. This allows them to identify patterns of accumulation or distribution. Q3: Does whale accumulation always lead to price increases? While whale accumulation is often seen as a bullish indicator, it does not guarantee a price increase. Many factors influence cryptocurrency prices, including broader market trends, regulatory news, technological developments, and macroeconomic conditions. However, sustained accumulation by a major Ethereum whale can contribute to positive market sentiment and reduced selling pressure. Q4: Is the identity of the Ethereum whale known? The exact identity of the entity behind the 0x286 address is not publicly known. Blockchain transactions are pseudonymous, meaning the wallet address is visible, but the real-world identity of its owner remains private. While platforms like FalconX facilitate institutional trades, they typically maintain client confidentiality. Q5: What is FalconX and why would a whale use it? FalconX is a cryptocurrency prime broker that offers institutional-grade trading, credit, and clearing services. Whales or institutional investors might use FalconX because it provides deep liquidity, competitive pricing, and over-the-counter (OTC) trading options that allow for large orders to be filled without significantly impacting public exchange order books. This helps facilitate large-scale, strategic acquisitions like that of this Ethereum whale . If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

What Investors Must Know Today,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-panic-selling-trigger-another-bitcoin-crash-what-investors-must-know-today/,"Bitcoin’s recent volatility has sparked renewed fears of a deeper correction. Amid global macro tension, ETF rebalancing, and unexpected regulatory actions in key markets, traders are once again asking the big question: Is another Bitcoin crash on the horizon? Although the top crypto asset continues to attract long-term institutional inflows, short-term panic selling is creating whiplash conditions . For retail investors, the challenge now is timing—navigating whether this is a dip worth buying, or the beginning of a larger breakdown. But while Bitcoin sentiment swings, capital is rotating into early-stage plays . One token, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is now gaining attention for a very different reason: its presale just triggered a 31x projection as investor participation surges. And for those seeking upside in a fearful market, this is becoming a standout narrative. 31x multiplier highlighted as investor participation surges In the shadow of Bitcoin’s uncertainty, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most talked-about new presales of the year. Analysts are now projecting a 31x ROI multiplier , citing its aggressive community growth, token burn mechanics, and rapid sellouts across multiple stages. The project blends politically charged energy with scarcity-driven tokenomics, resulting in viral traction across social platforms as X and Telegram. What’s driving the hype? Unlike typical other coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE has structured its rollout to reward early adopters , and its referral program is bringing exponential exposure. Some market watchers are calling it one of the top presales of 2025. And in a market where fear dominates, MAGACOIN FINANCE is giving bold traders a fresh window for major upside. Bitcoin’s breakdown or bounce? Key signals to watch Back to Bitcoin—analysts remain split. On one hand, sell pressure has increased across major exchanges, and on-chain data shows long-term holders beginning to distribute . This behavior is typical during inflection points, especially when macro indicators (like rate decisions or ETF flows) introduce short-term instability. Some traders worry that cascading liquidations could reignite the fear seen in previous cycle drawdowns. On the other hand, funding rates remain neutral, institutional wallet activity is net positive, and Bitcoin’s long-term structure has not decisively broken. Historically, similar periods of panic have led to rebounds —especially when retail exits and smart money accumulates. In this light, short-term volatility may actually be a setup for a Q4 recovery rally. Key macro trends are reinforcing Bitcoin’s fragile state Beyond crypto-native triggers, macroeconomic pressures are fueling uncertainty across markets. Expectations of delayed rate cuts in the U.S., rising bond yields, and continued dollar strength have created a risk-off atmosphere. Crypto, as a high-beta asset class, often takes the brunt of that sentiment. Bitcoin’s correlation with tech stocks has ticked upward again, making it vulnerable to broader equity sell-offs. At the same time, capital outflows from Asian markets are pressuring liquidity across global exchanges. This cocktail of stressors has heightened volatility—yet some contrarian investors see it as an accumulation window. Conclusion: fear fuels exits—but bold entries may define 2025 Whether Bitcoin crashes or rebounds will depend on key macro and on-chain factors over the coming weeks. But in the meantime, new narratives are forming outside of Bitcoin entirely. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 31x potential , now backed by rising investor participation, offers an asymmetric bet while larger assets remain indecisive. If history is any guide, real wealth in crypto is often made during uncertain times—by those who shift before sentiment turns.

Solana (SOL) Price Analysis: Can It Push Past $200? The latest Solana (SOL) price analysis shows the token trading around $186–187, up over 30% this month as bulls keep testing key resistance between $185–190. Technical indicators highlight strong upward momentum, with patterns like an ascending triangle and inverse head-and-shoulders suggesting targets around $223 if Solana clears the $200 mark. Analysts are also eyeing medium-term goals near $250–260, supported by institutional accumulation and ongoing network upgrades. The recent 20% boost in block capacity has improved throughput, signaling Solana’s focus on scaling for heavier usage. Short-term forecasts put SOL in the $175–190 range, with longer-term projections as high as $336 by year’s end if buying pressure continues. Institutional interest, growing DeFi adoption, and smart-money rotations from other assets are driving sentiment. Overall, Solana (SOL) price analysis points to a cautiously bullish outlook, provided support at $180–185 holds. Clearing $200 could open the path for a significant rally, giving traders plenty to watch in the weeks ahead. BONK Market Sentiment: Is the Rally Just Getting Started? The current BONK market sentiment reflects a shift from bearishness in late June to cautious optimism through July. After breaking below $0.0000145 in late June, BONK rebounded strongly, surging about 150% from its lows and crossing resistance near $0.000029. Technical indicators now lean bullish, with a positive MACD crossover and an RSI around 61, suggesting there’s room for further upside. Analysts are watching key levels around $0.000015 on the downside and a potential breakout beyond $0.00005 if momentum continues. Fee-driven buybacks, where 58% of token fees are used to repurchase BONK, are also supporting price stability and improving sentiment. Community-led burns, institutional interest, and growing integration in the Solana ecosystem are strengthening BONK’s position. Even so, competition from newer meme tokens like Little Pepe has been challenging its narrative, pushing BONK to innovate further to keep attention. Overall, BONK market sentiment shows that while risks remain, there’s renewed confidence that BONK can build on its rebound and hold these gains if broader market conditions stay supportive. Summing Up The latest Solana (SOL) price analysis shows strong momentum, with SOL holding above $185 and eyeing a push toward $200 and beyond. Similarly, BONK market sentiment has shifted from bearish to optimistic, fueled by token buybacks, burns, and a sharp rebound from late‑June lows.

Binance Data Points to Big Shift Ahead,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoins-calm-before-the-storm-binance-data-points-to-big-shift-ahead/,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade within a narrow price range, showing limited upward movement over the past week. At the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is priced around $117,719, representing a 1% decline in the past 24 hours and a 4.2% drop from its recent all-time high above $123,000. Amid this price performance, a recent analysis shared on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform by contributor BorisVest sheds light on possible underlying market dynamics influencing Bitcoin’s current state. According to the analyst, data from Binance futures suggests that despite muted volatility, certain trading patterns could be shaping BTC’s near-term direction. These observations have prompted discussions about whether market makers are deliberately maintaining a controlled range before a significant price move occurs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Drops Among US Investors—Is a Price Correction Coming? Binance Data Suggests Strategic Positioning BorisVest highlighted that Open Interest on Binance has remained steady between $13 billion and $14 billion over the past 20 days. This stability indicates that while new positions are not rapidly increasing, existing trades are being actively maintained. “Such behavior in a range environment often signals silent accumulation or strategic stalling,” the analyst wrote, suggesting that larger players may be carefully managing exposure during this consolidation phase. The Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, currently at 0.9, points to increased selling pressure from market takers. However, Bitcoin’s price has not experienced a sharp decline despite this activity, indicating that passive buyers are absorbing the sell orders. BorisVest added that the Funding Rate, hovering around 0.01, reflects a lack of aggressive leverage from either long or short positions. This could mean that institutional or high-volume traders are building positions gradually, avoiding extremes that typically lead to rapid price swings. Bitcoin Possible Downside Shakeout Before a Breakout The analysis also examined Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) data on Binance, which shows persistent selling in futures markets. Yet, despite ongoing sell-side activity, Bitcoin continues to resist significant downward movement. According to BorisVest, this could set the stage for a potential liquidity-driven shakeout. He suggested that BTC might temporarily dip toward $110,000 to clear out weak long positions and attract additional short interest. This could pave the way for a stronger, more sustainable breakout in the future.

These days, people are looking for real products, active user bases, and technology that is built to last. Plenty of projects make big promises, but very few follow through with real delivery. That is why real-world adoption and sustainable utility now matter more than ever. The market is watching for more than just price action. It is worth watching to see who is building, who is shipping, and who is getting people to engage. As the conversation around the top crypto for 2025 builds, coins like BlockDAG (BDAG) , Aave, Pi Network, and Chainlink are rising to the top. Each project offers a distinct utility that is already in motion, giving them a clear edge in a crowded space. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Demo Puts Real-Time Mining on Display with X1 and X10 BlockDAG just proved that crypto mining can be easy, efficient, and fully operational. Its recent live demo showed the X1 mobile app paired with the X10 hardware miner in action. Users watched live as BDAG earnings flowed into the app, showcasing exactly how the system performs. The X10 multiplies output by up to ten times, all without bulky equipment or complicated setup. This was not a concept or a teaser. It was a working product delivering results in real time. The response has been immediate, with miner sales increasing and interest in the project accelerating fast. When a project shows results instead of promising them, people take notice. With over $355 million raised and 24.5 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is now offering a limited-time $0.0016 price ahead of its August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. At a $0.05 listing price, the projected return hits 3,025 percent. Between working tech, active users, and real-world momentum, BlockDAG is firmly positioned as a top crypto for 2025. 2. Aave (AAVE): Brings Smart Lending to the Forefront Aave is changing how lending works by cutting out the middleman. Built on Ethereum, it uses smart contracts to let people lend or borrow crypto directly from one another. The platform supports 17 assets and offers unique tools like flash loans, which let users borrow funds with zero collateral as long as the loan is repaid in the same transaction. The AAVE token adds utility across the platform, offering benefits like fee reductions, governance voting, and rewards through its safety module. With a fixed supply and deflationary structure, AAVE’s value potential grows alongside platform usage. As DeFi expands, Aave remains a strong contender for anyone exploring the top crypto for 2025. 3. Pi Network (PI): Simplifies Mining for Everyone Pi Network is making crypto mining something anyone can do. Created by Stanford graduates, it uses a mobile app that lets users mine Pi coins with a single tap. There is no need for expensive hardware or high electricity costs. Instead, Pi relies on the Stellar Consensus Protocol and a web of trust circles to secure its network. Users earn more by checking in daily and referring others, creating viral growth. The project is gearing up for its full launch, with plans to remove current app restrictions. For accessibility, ease of use, and long-term vision, Pi Network is often mentioned among the top crypto for 2025. 4. Chainlink (LINK): Powers Smart Contracts with Real Data Chainlink brings real-world data into blockchain environments. Through its decentralized oracle network, it feeds critical info like stock prices, weather updates, and sports results into smart contracts. These oracles verify data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy and reliability before it reaches the blockchain. The LINK token keeps the network running by compensating data providers and enabling staking. Chainlink’s role in delivering trusted external data gives it staying power in a growing decentralized app market. As demand for real-time, off-chain data increases, Chainlink continues to earn a place among the top crypto for 2025. Looking Forward Real-world utility is becoming the true measure of crypto projects. Chainlink delivers external data to smart contracts, Pi Network reimagines mining for mobile users, and Aave replaces traditional lending systems with transparent code. Each brings value in its way and plays a role in shaping the next phase of digital finance. BlockDAG takes that momentum further. Its live demo featured working devices, actual earnings, and tech already up and running. With $355 million raised and a presale price still at $0.0016, BlockDAG is proving it is more than talk. When a project delivers early, the market pays attention, and BlockDAG is now leading the conversation as the top crypto for 2025.

This action places Kiwoom Securities alongside other major financial institutions in the country, all exploring the immense potential of stable digital assets. What’s Driving Kiwoom Securities’ Interest in a South Korea Stablecoin? The news, initially reported by Digital Asset, highlights Kiwoom Securities’ proactive steps into the stablecoin arena. Data from the Korean Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (KIPRIS) confirms the firm’s applications for intriguing names such as “KiwoonKRW” and “KRWKW.” These names strongly suggest an intention to launch a stablecoin pegged to the Korean Won (KRW), offering a digital representation of the national fiat currency. But why are established financial giants like Kiwoom Securities venturing into this relatively new territory? The motivations are multi-faceted: Efficiency and Cost Reduction: Stablecoins can facilitate faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions, especially for cross-border payments, compared to traditional banking rails. New Revenue Streams: Developing and managing stablecoins can open up new business models, including transaction fees, liquidity provision, and innovative financial products built on stablecoin infrastructure.

Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a significant transaction involving a wallet linked to the embattled FTX/Alameda Research. This entity, currently navigating complex bankruptcy proceedings, made a strategic move by depositing a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH) into the network’s proof-of-stake (PoS) system. This action, specifically a Ethereum staking event of 20,736 ETH valued at approximately $78.96 million, signals a potentially crucial shift in how distressed crypto assets are managed and leveraged. Unpacking the FTX/Alameda Ethereum Staking Event The crypto world was recently captivated by a precise on-chain alert: a wallet associated with FTX/Alameda Research initiated a significant Ethereum staking deposit. This move, totaling 20,736 ETH, instantly valued at nearly $79 million, was confirmed by on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X. For those tracking the complex unraveling of FTX and Alameda, this isn’t just another transaction; it’s a strategic deployment of assets that warrants closer inspection. What exactly does ‘staking’ mean in this context? At its core, Ethereum staking involves locking up ETH to support the network’s operations, security, and integrity. Since its transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with ‘The Merge,’ Ethereum relies on validators who stake their ETH to process transactions and create new blocks. In return for their participation and commitment, these validators earn rewards, essentially passive income generated by the network. For a large holder like FTX/Alameda, this presents a compelling opportunity to generate yield on otherwise dormant assets. Key details of this specific transaction include: Amount Staked: 20,736 ETH Approximate Value: $78.96 million (at the time of deposit) Source: Wallet linked to FTX/Alameda Research Action: Deposit into Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking contract Verification: Confirmed by on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X This move isn’t merely a transfer of funds; it’s a deliberate decision to engage with the Ethereum network’s economic model, signaling a sophisticated approach to asset management, even amidst insolvency proceedings. It highlights a proactive effort to maximize the value of their holdings, potentially for the benefit of creditors. Why This Massive Ethereum Staking Matters The decision by FTX/Alameda to engage in such a substantial Ethereum staking operation carries multifaceted implications, extending beyond just the immediate financial yield. It speaks volumes about the evolving strategies for managing large crypto treasuries, especially those under distressed conditions. What Does This Mean for FTX/Alameda’s Recovery Efforts? For FTX and Alameda Research, this move is a pragmatic step towards asset recovery and creditor repayment. Holding a significant amount of ETH without utilizing it would mean missing out on potential yield. By staking, they are actively generating returns on their dormant assets, which can then contribute to the pool of funds available for distribution to creditors. This demonstrates a commitment to responsible asset management and maximizing the value of the estate’s holdings. It’s a clear signal that the administrators are exploring all avenues to recoup losses and fulfill obligations, turning what could be static assets into income-generating ones. How Does Large-Scale Ethereum Staking Impact the Network? The injection of nearly $79 million worth of ETH into the staking pool further strengthens the Ethereum network’s security and decentralization. The more ETH that is staked, the more robust and secure the network becomes against potential attacks. Each staked ETH acts as collateral, incentivizing honest behavior from validators. While FTX/Alameda represents a centralized entity, their participation, alongside many other validators, contributes to the overall health and stability of the network. This also potentially reduces the circulating supply of ETH, as staked tokens are locked, which can have subtle positive effects on market dynamics. What Are the Broader Market Implications of Such a Move? This large-scale Ethereum staking by a prominent, albeit distressed, entity can influence broader market sentiment. It suggests a level of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability and the stability of its PoS mechanism. For institutional investors and other large holders, it might serve as a precedent or a validation of staking as a legitimate and profitable strategy for managing substantial crypto portfolios. It also highlights the increasing sophistication of crypto asset management, even in challenging circumstances, underscoring the growing maturity of the digital asset ecosystem. Navigating the Nuances of Ethereum Staking: Risks and Rewards While Ethereum staking offers compelling benefits, it also comes with its own set of risks. Understanding this balance is crucial, especially for an entity like FTX/Alameda managing assets under scrutiny. The Rewards of Staking Passive Income: The primary benefit is earning rewards in ETH, effectively growing the staked principal over time. This yield can be a significant source of revenue for FTX/Alameda’s estate. Network Participation: By staking, they contribute directly to the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network, participating in its governance and evolution. Long-Term Alignment: Staking demonstrates a long-term belief in Ethereum’s ecosystem and its future potential, which can be beneficial for the optics of a recovering entity. The Risks Involved in Staking Slashing Penalties: Validators can face penalties, known as ‘slashing,’ if they act maliciously or are consistently offline. While rare for reputable operators, it’s a risk of capital loss. FTX/Alameda would likely use professional staking services to mitigate this. Illiquidity: Staked ETH is locked and cannot be easily accessed. While withdrawals are now enabled on Ethereum, there can be queues or delays depending on network activity. This means the funds are not immediately available for other purposes, which could be a concern for an estate needing to distribute funds. Smart Contract Risk: Staking involves interacting with smart contracts, which, despite rigorous auditing, always carry a theoretical risk of vulnerabilities or bugs. Price Volatility: The value of the staked ETH itself is subject to market fluctuations. While staking earns more ETH, the USD value of that ETH can decrease. Given these factors, FTX/Alameda’s decision suggests a calculated risk assessment, weighing the potential for yield generation against the inherent risks of locking up such a significant sum. Their choice implies a belief that the benefits of yield generation outweigh the immediate need for liquidity or the risks associated with staking. The Broader Landscape: What’s Next for Ethereum and Institutional Staking? The FTX/Alameda Ethereum staking event is not an isolated incident but rather a symptom of a larger trend: the increasing institutional adoption and professionalization of crypto asset management. As the crypto market matures, entities, whether traditional funds or distressed estates, are seeking ways to optimize their digital asset holdings. We are likely to see more large-scale staking activities as institutions become more comfortable with the underlying technology and the regulatory landscape becomes clearer. This trend could lead to: Increased Network Security: More staked ETH means a more secure network, benefiting all users. Enhanced Decentralization (with caveats): While large entities staking can concentrate power, the overall increase in validator participation can still contribute to a more distributed network over time, provided there are diverse staking providers. Market Maturation: Professional asset management, even in bankruptcy, lends credibility to the crypto space, signaling its evolution beyond speculative trading to a more fundamental value proposition. Innovation in Staking Solutions: The demand from large holders will likely spur further innovation in liquid staking derivatives, institutional-grade staking services, and more flexible solutions for unlocking staked assets. Ethereum’s ongoing development, including future upgrades aimed at scalability and efficiency, will further solidify its position as a foundational blockchain. The ability to generate passive income through staking makes it an attractive asset for long-term holders and institutional players, cementing its role in the future of finance. Conclusion: A Strategic Maneuver in the Crypto Recovery The decision by a wallet linked to FTX/Alameda Research to stake nearly $79 million in ETH is a significant development, highlighting the strategic asset management underway during the bankruptcy proceedings. This massive Ethereum staking move is not merely a technical transaction but a calculated financial maneuver aimed at generating yield for creditors while simultaneously bolstering the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. It underscores the growing importance of Proof-of-Stake mechanisms in the crypto economy and showcases how even distressed entities are leveraging blockchain technology to maximize asset value. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, such actions by major players, even those in recovery, provide valuable insights into the maturation of digital asset management and the long-term confidence in foundational blockchains like Ethereum. This event serves as a powerful reminder that in the world of crypto, every on-chain move can carry profound implications for market dynamics, network health, and the future of digital finance.

The critical business unit recorded an operating profit of just 400 billion won ($288 million), far below analysts’ consensus estimate of 2.73 trillion won. The shortfall was largely attributed to mounting losses at its foundry division and tightening US export controls on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. South Korea’s tech giant, which had issued a downbeat profit and revenue guidance earlier in July, reported net income of 4.93 trillion won—missing the 6.37 trillion won expected by analysts. Samsung’s foundry losses deepen as US export controls bite The profit slump stemmed partly from a one-time inventory write-down at Samsung’s foundry business, which was impacted by weak demand from China and delayed chip shipments due to export restrictions. Declining utilization rates also weighed on earnings. The company said this came despite sustained demand for premium memory chips used in servers. Samsung Electronics reported a more than 15-fold surge in operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, buoyed by a rebound in semiconductor prices fueled by strong demand from the artificial intelligence sector. The world’s leading maker of memory chips, smartphones, and TVs estimated its operating profit reached 10.4 trillion won ($7.54 billion) for the three months ending June 30, up sharply from just 670 billion won ($482 million) in the same period last year. The result surpassed the 8.8 trillion won SmartEstimate compiled by LSEG, which prioritizes forecasts from historically accurate analysts. It also marked Samsung’s most profitable quarter since Q3 2022. Analysts noted that, beyond rising chip prices, the strong performance was likely aided by the reversal of previous inventory write-downs, as the accounting value of Samsung’s chip stock recovered. For now, the tech firm anticipates that foundry losses will narrow in the second half of 2025, buoyed by a gradual rebound in demand. Samsung rallies on Tesla chip deal as AI ambitions intensify The lackluster quarterly results arrived just days after Samsung secured a $16.5 billion contract to manufacture AI chips for Tesla Inc. at its upcoming Taylor, Texas, facility. The deal has boosted investor sentiment, sending the company’s shares up 10% since Monday and over 20% for July—marking its strongest monthly performance in over four years. To regain ground in the booming AI memory space, Samsung is ramping up investments in research and expanding front-end capacity. The company is also intensifying efforts to land contracts with major clients like Tesla to revive its struggling foundry operations. If the multi-year Tesla agreement proceeds successfully, it could open doors to more high-profile clients and serve as validation for Samsung’s next-gen 2-nanometer process technology. Struggles in AI memory market highlight SK Hynix’s growing lead Investors are also watching closely to see if Samsung will benefit from Nvidia’s resumption of H20 AI chip sales to China. Samsung’s HBM3 memory has previously been paired with Nvidia’s H20 model, although it trails behind in performance compared to SK Hynix’s HBM3E. Construction of Samsung’s Taylor plant has faced delays, with production now slated to begin in 2026. The company continues to face stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), which is expanding US production at its Arizona facility. Samsung’s position in the advanced HBM chip segment remains tenuous. It has struggled to secure Nvidia’s certification for its latest offerings, allowing rival SK Hynix to establish a dominant lead in the rapidly expanding AI memory market.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Artificial Intelligence (AI) majors are slightly down despite blockbuster earnings by tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta, which cited their respective AI efforts as a catalyst for beating earnings. Microsoft’s cloud revenue jumped 27% to $46.7 billion, with Azure crossing $75 billion annually as demand for AI workloads pushed datacenter capacity past two gigawatts. Meta, meanwhile, reported a 22% year-over-year revenue increase to $47.5 billion, with a 43% operating margin, as AI-powered ad models lifted conversions by up to 5% and engagement on Facebook and Instagram surged. CoinGecko's AI token category, which includes majors like TAO, NEAR, ICP, and RENDER is down 1.4%. In contrast, the CoinDesk 20 , a measure of the performance of the world's largest digital assets, is flat and trading below 4,000. Typically, AI tokens move in sync with earnings from big tech. Nvidia's record-breaking rally in 2024 helped the category push beyond a $10 billion market cap , but bitcoin's rising dominance in the first half of 2025 pulled some air out of the category — and other types of altcoins — pushing it down to below $5 billion. Traders across the crypto world today also took a breather, given the Fed's recent messaging , which perhaps explains AI tokens' muted reception to MSFT and Meta's success. ""While policy remained unchanged, Powell’s remark that tariff-driven inflation may only be beginning added a layer of uncertainty that pressured risk assets across the board,"" market maker Enflux wrote in a note to CoinDesk. ""With risk appetite fading and macro messaging turning less predictable, markets may remain in a holding pattern until participants gain clarity on inflation direction and policy response for the next few days or weeks,"" Enflux continued. Nvidia is set to report its earnings towards the end of August. Time will tell if the GPU giant's expected solid results will serve as a catalyst for AI token growth. Market Movements: BTC: Crypto markets turned volatile on Wednesday as hawkish remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell triggered over $200 million in liquidations, with bitcoin briefly falling below $116,000. ETH: Ether (ETH) is holding above $3,800, up 1.47%, as corporate treasuries, like SharpLink Gaming continue to bid on the asset for their balance sheet. Gold: Gold fell 1.17% to $3,288.02 on Wednesday as strong U.S. economic data reduced safe-haven demand and reinforced expectations that the Fed will keep rates steady. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Thursday as investors weighed new U.S. tariffs on South Korean imports and awaited the Bank of Japan’s expected decision to hold rates steady. S&P 500: The S&P 500 slipped 0.12% to 6,362.90 after Fed Chair Powell signaled no imminent rate cuts amid tariff-driven inflation concerns.

Imagine a hidden giant quietly making its move in the digital realm, acquiring a staggering sum of one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies. This is precisely what unfolded recently, as a fresh wallet made a monumental institutional ETH purchase , sparking widespread speculation and curiosity across the crypto landscape. What’s the Buzz About This Institutional ETH Purchase? At the heart of this unfolding mystery is a transaction of epic proportions. According to meticulous blockchain data unearthed by Arkham, and subsequently shared by the astute on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X (formerly Twitter), a newly established wallet has taken possession of an astounding 39,652 ETH. For context, at the time of the transfer, this colossal sum was valued at approximately $152 million. This significant acquisition didn’t come from just anywhere; it originated from Galaxy Digital, a prominent name in the institutional crypto space. The sheer volume of this transaction immediately raises questions. Who is behind this new wallet? Is it a fresh institutional player making a grand entrance into the market, signaling growing confidence in Ethereum’s future? Or, is it merely a newly generated address for an entity already deeply entrenched in the crypto ecosystem, perhaps an existing whale like SharpLink Gaming, simply reorganizing its holdings? The ambiguity surrounding the buyer is precisely what makes this particular institutional ETH purchase so captivating. Why Does an Institutional ETH Purchase Matter? When an institution, rather than an individual retail investor, makes such a substantial move, it sends ripples through the market. Institutional participation is often seen as a sign of maturity and legitimacy for the cryptocurrency space. Here’s why such a large-scale acquisition is significant: Market Validation: Large institutional investments lend credibility to the asset class, signaling to other traditional finance players that crypto is a viable and increasingly attractive investment avenue. Increased Liquidity: While this particular transaction involved a transfer from one institutional entity (Galaxy Digital) to another (or a new address), sustained institutional interest typically brings more capital into the market, enhancing liquidity. Potential Price Impact: While a single transaction might not cause an immediate price surge, a pattern of large institutional purchases can create sustained buying pressure, contributing to long-term price appreciation for assets like Ethereum. Long-Term Confidence: Institutions often have longer investment horizons compared to retail investors. Their large-scale entries suggest a belief in the fundamental value and future growth of the underlying technology and ecosystem. Who is Galaxy Digital, Anyway? To fully appreciate the context of this transaction, it’s crucial to understand the role of Galaxy Digital. Founded by Michael Novogratz, a former hedge fund manager, Galaxy Digital is a diversified financial services and investment management company dedicated to the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. They operate across various segments, including: Trading: Providing liquidity and executing trades for institutional clients. Asset Management: Offering a range of funds and structured products for institutional investors. Investment Banking: Providing advisory services for mergers, acquisitions, and capital raises in the crypto space. Principal Investments: Investing their own capital into promising blockchain companies and projects. Their involvement as the seller in this institutional ETH purchase indicates that they are actively managing their portfolio, potentially rebalancing or facilitating a client’s large acquisition. This highlights their central role in bridging traditional finance with the burgeoning digital asset market. Unmasking the Mystery: New Player or Old Whale? The most intriguing aspect of this $152 million ETH transfer is the identity of the recipient wallet. On-chain analysts are working diligently to connect the dots, but definitive answers remain elusive. Let’s explore the two primary theories: A New Institutional Buyer: This is the more exciting possibility for many. A brand-new institution entering the crypto market with such a significant initial outlay would be a powerful bullish signal. It suggests growing mainstream adoption and a broadening investor base beyond the early adopters. This could be a traditional financial institution, a large corporate treasury, or even a sovereign wealth fund dipping its toes into digital assets. Potential Benefit Potential Challenge Strong market validation Initial volatility as new players learn the ropes Signals broader adoption trend Could be a one-off move, not sustained interest Injects fresh capital into the ecosystem Identity remains anonymous, leading to speculation An Existing Player (e.g., SharpLink Gaming): The analyst @EmberCN specifically mentioned SharpLink Gaming as a possibility. This scenario suggests that an entity already active in the crypto space, perhaps a large investment firm, a hedge fund, or even a public company with crypto holdings, is simply moving assets to a new address. This could be for various reasons: security enhancements, internal accounting, portfolio rebalancing, or even preparing for a strategic move like staking or DeFi participation. While less dramatic than a new entrant, it still signifies continued confidence from existing large holders. Without further on-chain activity or official statements, pinpointing the exact nature of this wallet remains a puzzle. However, the very act of a large institutional ETH purchase from a known entity like Galaxy Digital ensures it stays under the spotlight. The Power of On-Chain Analytics in Tracking an Institutional ETH Purchase This entire story is brought to light thanks to the incredible advancements in blockchain analytics. Platforms like Arkham Intelligence allow researchers and analysts to peer into the otherwise opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. They track addresses, identify clusters of activity, and sometimes even link addresses to known entities. This provides a level of transparency unparalleled in traditional finance, allowing the public to observe significant capital movements in real-time. Tools used by analysts include: Address Tagging: Identifying and labeling addresses belonging to exchanges, institutions, or known individuals.

As the crypto community watches closely, the eventual unveiling of this wallet’s identity could provide even deeper insights into the future trajectory of Ethereum and institutional adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is an institutional ETH purchase? An institutional ETH purchase refers to a large-scale acquisition of Ethereum (ETH) by a financial institution, corporation, hedge fund, or other large organizational entity, as opposed to an individual retail investor. These purchases are typically significant in value and often indicate a long-term investment strategy or a strategic move within the institution’s portfolio. Q2: Who is Galaxy Digital and what is their role in the crypto market? Galaxy Digital is a prominent diversified financial services and investment management company focused on the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. Founded by Michael Novogratz, they provide services such as trading, asset management, investment banking, and principal investments, acting as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. Q3: How do blockchain analytics platforms like Arkham track such large transactions? Blockchain analytics platforms like Arkham use sophisticated techniques to monitor and analyze public blockchain data. They identify wallet addresses, trace the flow of funds, cluster related addresses belonging to the same entity, and often tag known entities (like exchanges or institutions) to provide transparency into large transactions and market movements. Q4: What impact can a large institutional ETH purchase have on the market? A large institutional ETH purchase can have several impacts: it can signal growing institutional confidence and validation for the asset, potentially increase liquidity, contribute to positive market sentiment, and, if part of a sustained trend, exert upward pressure on prices. It also highlights the increasing maturity and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. Q5: Is this a sign of a bull run for Ethereum? While a large institutional ETH purchase is a positive indicator of demand and confidence, a single transaction does not definitively signal the start of a bull run. Bull runs are typically driven by a confluence of factors, including broader market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and sustained buying pressure from various investor types. However, such purchases certainly contribute to a bullish narrative. Q6: How can I monitor similar large cryptocurrency transactions?

According to the analysis, this outlook could even be “conservative,” with an extended move—based on a “cup and handle” pattern—possibly stretching to $77 or even $100. This mirrors XRP’s explosive 2017 pattern but on a much larger scale. The current price of XRP stands at $3.12, meaning even the most cautious scenario from Sistine implies a 10x return . As this outlook gains traction, major players are starting to shift their capital into altcoins with similar upside potential. One of the top contenders catching attention right now is MAGACOIN FINANCE—a rising star that’s quietly building momentum before broader market discovery. Why Whales Are Rushing Toward MAGACOIN FINANCE While XRP garners headlines, savvy investors are moving quickly into MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project’s latest presale phase is seeing unprecedented speed, with token allocations being snapped up faster than anticipated. With limited access remaining and demand surging, analysts have great expectations, citing the same kind of viral traction and speculative upside from some of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the market right now. $250 could turn into over $20,000 for early investors if MAGACOIN FINANCE achieves a similar post-listing explosion . And with the current trajectory of its ecosystem development, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being named in multiple “ top altcoin ” forecasts for the coming year. XRP Bull Case Grows Stronger Back to XRP—Sistine Research’s prediction isn’t the only one fueling hype. With ongoing legal clarity surrounding Ripple Labs and a potential spot XRP ETF in the pipeline, institutional interest is expected to ramp up. This could give XRP the kind of sustained momentum it hasn’t seen since its last bull market peak. Also worth noting is XRP’s growing use case in cross-border payments, where adoption continues among banks and fintech firms across Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. If price patterns continue aligning with 2017’s structure, $33 might just be the beginning. Conclusion XRP could be preparing for one of the biggest breakouts of the decade—especially if Sistine Research’s bold targets materialize. But while the world watches XRP, early movers are quietly positioning themselves in MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for explosive gains is narrowing fast.

Some analysts now predict that BTC’s next top could approach $150,000. Bitcoin’s Current Overheating Phase Short-Lived According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crypto Dan, Bitcoin is currently entering a cooling-off period after a short-term overheating phase. The warning signs are most evident in the cohort of BTC held for one day to one week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flow Pulse Breaks From 2017, 2021 Patterns – What It Means For The Rally Crypto Dan shared the following chart showing that this short-term holding cohort is now recording successively lower spikes, suggesting that overheated market conditions are easing. The analyst compared the current environment to previous overheating phases seen between March-October 2024 and January-April 2025. In both instances, the overheating lasted longer and was more intense (shown in red boxes). In contrast, the current overheating conditions (shown in yellow box) show shorter extent and duration compared to the aforementioned two instances. The analyst added: Also, since the recent price increase was relatively modest, we may see a milder and shorter correction in the short term. However, it’s important to remain patient and look forward to a potential uptrend in the second half of 2025. The increase in BTC’s price during the latest rally saw the digital asset surge from around $108,000 on July 1 to a new all-time high (ATH) of $123,128 on July 13, before stabilizing around the $117,500 mark at the time of writing. Is BTC Preparing For Its Next Big Move? As Bitcoin consolidates, several analysts suggest the top cryptocurrency may be gearing up for a major move – likely to the upside. Veteran crypto analyst Titan of Crypto noted that Bitcoin is currently “in a pressure cooker.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Defend This Key Support For $180,000 Year-End Target, Analyst Says Titan of Crypto shared the following chart, highlighting that Bollinger Bands are tightening while volatility is shrinking. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is compressing – often a precursor to a breakout. Fellow analyst Ali Martinez added that BTC’s next top could reach $149,679, based on the Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVD) metric. For context, the CVD metric measures whether buyers or sellers are dominating trading volume over time. That said, some warning signs linger. Recently, Bitcoin exchange reserves reached a one-month high, suggesting that some holders may be preparing to sell – potentially putting pressure on the current bullish trend. At press time, BTC trades at $117,546, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours.

The rules will tightly govern the issuance of stablecoins linked to the Hong Kong dollar and their associated marketing and distribution activities. Additionally, strict rules have been established for issuing a stablecoin license. According to these rules, firms dealing with Stablecoins must present their application before a September 30 deadline. After following this step, it is anticipated that the central bank will release the first approvals at the beginning of next year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said. Hong Kong develops strict stablecoins rules in support of the crypto ecosystem Following Trump’s pro-crypto stance, he recently introduced a stablecoin law and signed it on July 18. This was a significant move for the US president, as he believes that this law will enable the US to achieve its goal of becoming the global leader of the crypto space and finance as a whole. While not all, several stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar. Concerning the recent stablecoin regulations in Hong Kong, it is worth mentioning that it is viewed as a place to conduct regulatory tests in China. This was observed after it was revealed that China now supports cryptocurrencies linked to the yuan, after years of forbidding them. Robin Xing, a managing director at Morgan Stanley, weighed in on the topic of discussion. He explained that China intends to be independent of the US dollar as a payment method using stablecoins. Based on Robin Xing’s argument, this digital currency can be useful in broader cross-border payments as it is reliable and can lower the transaction cost. The managing director said that since Hong Kong’s stablecoin market is still under development, it will take some time to fully effect the changes. Ideally, stablecoins users have adopted a strategy to back their digital assets with a mixture of monetary assets. This is because they can easily manage the value of monetary assets and maintain their worth near the currency they stand for. Another significant requirement to obtain a license is to have a capital of around 25 million Hong Kong dollars or an equal sum in another currency that can be exchanged. The stablecoin rules aim to reduce cryptocurrency risks and prevent anti-money laundering activities. 50 businesses in Hong Kong apply for a stablecoins license Following Hong Kong’s stablecoin rules, analysis from sources reveals that around 50 businesses are expected to apply for the permits. However, the HKMA stated that they will have “a high bar” for licensing and only “a few licences” will be issued at the outset. These applicants include Jack Ma, backed by Ant Group Co.’s international unit and an online retailer, JD.com’s subsidiary. RD InnoTech Ltd, a firm backed by former HKMA chief Norman Chan, also intends to apply. The HKMA, Ant Group, and JD. Com declined to comment on the applications. In an email, a spokesperson from RD InnoTech stated their intentions: they want to start with a stablecoin tied to the Hong Kong dollar, targeting business-to-business cross-border payments. According to the representative, the new regulations and infrastructure could help set the stage for tokenizing the Renminbi offshore, referring to the official name of the Chinese yuan. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority says it will introduce a six-month transitional period for existing stablecoin issuers as the city’s new Stablecoin Ordinance takes effect on August 1, 2025. This initiative supports Hong Kong’s goal of becoming a regulated digital asset hub, while strengthening oversight of firms issuing fiat-backed cryptocurrencies. During this transition, the HKMA will grant temporary licenses to applicants with a clear plan for achieving full regulatory compliance. Companies must submit formal license applications within three months or face potential shutdown within the subsequent four months.

The recent announcement from The Ether Machine, an Ethereum (ETH) yield and infrastructure firm, has certainly captured the market’s attention. This newly launched crypto venture, backed by industry giants Kraken and Blockchain.com, has made remarkable strides toward its ambitious goal of accumulating up to $1.5 billion worth of ETH. Their latest acquisition of nearly 15,000 ETH underscores a powerful commitment to their long-term ETH accumulation strategy, bringing their total holdings to an impressive 334,757 ETH. This move is not just about numbers; it reflects a growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s future and its pivotal role in the digital economy. Understanding The Ether Machine’s Vision for ETH Accumulation So, what exactly is The Ether Machine, and why is its ETH accumulation strategy so significant? This firm positions itself at the forefront of Ethereum infrastructure and yield generation. It’s designed to be a substantial player in the Ethereum ecosystem, aiming to not only hold a vast amount of ETH but also to contribute to its underlying network stability and growth through various yield-generating activities. Chaired by Andrew Keys, a prominent Wall Street venture capitalist with a deep understanding of both traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto space, The Ether Machine brings a unique blend of institutional rigor and blockchain innovation to the table. The firm’s strategic intent is clear: to establish a dominant position in the Ethereum market through systematic accumulation. Their publicly stated goal of reaching $1.5 billion in ETH holdings is a testament to their long-term vision and belief in Ethereum’s enduring value. This kind of large-scale, deliberate investment from an entity backed by reputable names like Kraken and Blockchain.com sends a strong signal across the entire cryptocurrency landscape, suggesting a maturation of the market and increasing institutional comfort with digital assets. The Latest Milestone: A Deep Dive into the 15K ETH Acquisition The recent acquisition of nearly 15,000 ETH is a critical step in The Ether Machine’s journey toward its $1.5 billion target. Announced via X (formerly Twitter), this addition brings their total committed holdings to a staggering 334,757 ETH. To put this into perspective, such a substantial holding makes The Ether Machine one of the most significant institutional holders of Ethereum, outside of major exchanges or development foundations. This systematic approach to ETH accumulation is a hallmark of sophisticated investment strategies. Rather than making sporadic, opportunistic buys, The Ether Machine appears to be executing a well-planned, continuous acquisition program. This method helps mitigate risks associated with market volatility and allows them to build a robust position over time. The firm’s transparency about its holdings and goals also contributes to market confidence, providing a clearer picture of institutional interest in Ethereum. Key figures related to their ETH accumulation strategy: Latest Acquisition: Nearly 15,000 ETH Total Committed Holdings: 334,757 ETH Accumulation Goal: Up to $1.5 billion worth of ETH Backing: Kraken, Blockchain.com Chair: Andrew Keys Why Ethereum? Understanding the Asset’s Enduring Appeal The question naturally arises: why Ethereum? What makes ETH such an attractive asset for an ambitious venture like The Ether Machine to pursue such aggressive ETH accumulation ? The answer lies in Ethereum’s fundamental strengths and its pivotal role in the evolution of Web3. Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s a decentralized computing platform that powers thousands of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and the vast majority of the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) ecosystems. Its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with the Merge and subsequent upgrades has significantly enhanced its scalability, security, and energy efficiency. This transition also introduced staking, allowing ETH holders to earn yield by contributing to the network’s security, which aligns perfectly with The Ether Machine’s focus on yield generation. Furthermore, Ethereum boasts a robust developer community, unparalleled network effects, and a clear roadmap for future improvements (e.g., sharding for even greater scalability). These factors combine to make ETH a compelling long-term investment, viewed by many as digital oil fueling the next generation of the internet. Institutional investors are increasingly recognizing Ethereum’s potential as a foundational technology, driving strategic initiatives like The Ether Machine’s focused ETH accumulation . Market Implications: What Does This Massive ETH Accumulation Mean? The large-scale ETH accumulation by The Ether Machine carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market and, specifically, for Ethereum. Such substantial buying pressure from an institutional entity can have several effects: Supply Dynamics: By taking a significant amount of ETH off the open market and holding it for the long term, The Ether Machine reduces the available circulating supply. In a market driven by supply and demand, a reduced supply, especially when coupled with increasing demand, can exert upward pressure on prices. Institutional Validation: The involvement of well-known venture capitalists and backing from established crypto firms like Kraken and Blockchain.com lends considerable credibility to Ethereum as an asset class. This can encourage other institutional players, who might have been hesitant, to consider their own ETH accumulation strategies. Long-Term Bullish Sentiment: A firm committing to a $1.5 billion accumulation goal signals a strong long-term bullish outlook for Ethereum. This can reinforce positive sentiment among retail and institutional investors alike, fostering greater confidence in ETH’s future price trajectory. Ecosystem Development: As an infrastructure firm, The Ether Machine’s holdings are likely to be used not just for passive holding but potentially for staking, contributing to network security, and participating in decentralized governance. This active participation further strengthens the Ethereum ecosystem. This level of institutional engagement moves Ethereum beyond being merely a speculative asset and solidifies its position as a legitimate, investable digital commodity with real-world utility. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Considerations for ETH Accumulation While the prospect of massive ETH accumulation is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent challenges and considerations in the cryptocurrency space. Even for well-funded entities like The Ether Machine, the journey is not without its hurdles: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, are known for their price volatility. While long-term strategies aim to weather these fluctuations, managing such large portfolios requires sophisticated risk management. Regulatory Landscape: The global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations regarding digital assets, staking, or institutional holdings could impact strategies and operations. Security Risks: Holding hundreds of thousands of ETH necessitates robust security measures against hacks, phishing, and other digital threats. Institutional-grade security protocols are paramount. Competition: As Ethereum’s prominence grows, so does the competition from other Layer 1 blockchains. While Ethereum holds a dominant position, continuous innovation is key to maintaining its lead. The Ether Machine’s strategic planning undoubtedly accounts for these factors, highlighting the professional and calculated approach taken by serious institutional players in the crypto market. Looking Ahead: The Future of The Ether Machine and Ethereum The ongoing ETH accumulation by The Ether Machine represents a significant trend: the increasing integration of traditional financial principles and capital into the decentralized world. As they advance toward their $1.5 billion goal, their activities will likely serve as a blueprint for other institutional investors looking to gain exposure to Ethereum and the broader Web3 economy. For Ethereum itself, such dedicated institutional support reinforces its status as a foundational blockchain. It signals that beyond the hype cycles, there are serious players building long-term value and infrastructure around the network. This commitment can foster greater stability, liquidity, and ultimately, widespread adoption for Ethereum. The Ether Machine’s journey is one to watch closely. Their success in achieving their accumulation goals and generating yield could pave the way for a new era of institutional participation, further legitimizing and strengthening the entire crypto market. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor For individuals and smaller investors, the strategic ETH accumulation by firms like The Ether Machine offers valuable insights: Long-Term Perspective: Institutional moves often emphasize long-term value rather than short-term gains. Consider adopting a similar patient approach to your crypto investments. Fundamental Analysis: Understand the underlying technology and utility of assets like Ethereum. The Ether Machine isn’t just buying ETH; they’re investing in the network’s future. Diversification and Risk Management: While institutions make large bets, individual investors should always prioritize diversification and manage risk according to their personal financial situation. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on institutional trends and announcements. These can provide valuable signals about market sentiment and future directions. The actions of major players often foreshadow broader market movements, making it crucial to stay abreast of developments in the institutional crypto space. Conclusion: The Ether Machine’s continued progress in its ambitious ETH accumulation strategy marks a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. With nearly 335,000 ETH already secured and a $1.5 billion target in sight, this firm, backed by industry stalwarts and led by a seasoned Wall Street veteran, is setting a new standard for institutional engagement in digital assets. Their strategic investments not only bolster Ethereum’s market position but also signal a growing confidence in its long-term potential as the backbone of the decentralized internet. As The Ether Machine continues its journey, it underscores the increasing maturity and institutionalization of the crypto landscape, paving the way for a future where digital assets play an even more central role in global finance.

With some major altcoins down double digits this week, entry points are becoming more attractive—especially with upcoming catalysts that could drive a rapid reversal. One lesser-known project catching early attention during this pullback is MAGACOIN FINANCE, currently in a high-demand presale phase. XRP Whales Make Their Move XRP has dipped 12.46% over the past seven days, now trading at $3.07. While some see this as a bearish sign, on-chain data suggests otherwise. Large wallets—those holding tens of millions of tokens—have been accumulating steadily, reducing selling pressure and potentially forming a price floor. The ongoing ETF speculation continues to fuel interest, with many expecting a breakout once regulatory clarity improves. XRP’s strong volume, now at $6.86 billion daily, shows it’s still a favorite among institutional and retail investors alike. MAGACOIN FINANCE Sparks Early Buzz As XRP consolidates and the broader market cools off, MAGACOIN FINANCE is defying the trend. The project is drawing rapid interest from politically-driven investor circles, with its presale nearing full capacity. What’s turning heads is the projected upside: some projections point to a potential 31x surge , driven by its energized community, viral appeal, and speculative positioning. Insiders say its momentum is building faster than many of the classic meme tokens of the past cycle—this time with purpose-built utility and strategic growth milestones that have triggered FOMO among early-stage investors. Cardano Builds Toward a Bullish August Cardano (ADA), like XRP, is down around 12% this week and currently trades at $0.7763. But bullish sentiment remains, thanks in part to the upcoming Midnight airdrop, which is expected to increase both user activity and network attention. Some analysts predict ADA could climb toward $1.10 in August if broader market conditions stabilize. Despite the drop, daily trading volume has remained strong at over $1 billion, signaling sustained interest. Why This Trio Matters XRP offers institutional strength and ETF potential. Cardano has a dedicated community and upcoming network events. MAGACOIN FINANCE brings speculative energy and early-stage access , with rapid momentum not seen in months. Together, they represent three distinct yet powerful narratives—making them a trio worth watching closely as the next rally unfolds.

Charged with serious offenses including money laundering and sanctions evasion, Storm’s case has become a focal point, setting a potential precedent for decentralized finance (DeFi) and the future of digital privacy. The final arguments have been made, and now, the fate of a key figure in the crypto privacy space rests in the hands of a jury. If convicted, Storm faces the staggering possibility of up to 40 years in prison, a sentence that underscores the gravity of the charges and the intense scrutiny regulators are placing on the crypto industry. Understanding the Tornado Cash Trial: The Core Allegations At the heart of the matter lies Tornado Cash, a decentralized mixing service designed to obscure the origins and destinations of cryptocurrency transactions, thereby enhancing user privacy. While proponents argue its necessity for financial anonymity in a transparent blockchain world, authorities view such tools with suspicion, particularly when they are allegedly used for illicit activities. Roman Storm, alongside fellow co-founder Roman Semenov, was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice in August 2023, following the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioning of Tornado Cash in August 2022. Money Laundering Conspiracy: Prosecutors allege that Storm and his co-conspirators facilitated over $1 billion in illicit transactions through Tornado Cash, including hundreds of millions of dollars laundered by the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization. Sanctions Evasion Conspiracy: The charges also include a conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by allegedly helping sanctioned entities evade U.S. sanctions. Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business: The indictment claims that Tornado Cash operated as an unregistered money transmitting business, failing to implement proper anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) programs. The prosecution’s argument hinges on the assertion that Storm and his team had knowledge of Tornado Cash’s use by criminals and failed to implement adequate controls to prevent such misuse. They point to communications and the design of the protocol as evidence of intent or at least reckless disregard. Why is the Tornado Cash Trial So Significant for DeFi and Privacy? The outcome of this Tornado Cash trial extends far beyond Roman Storm himself. It represents a pivotal moment for the entire decentralized finance ecosystem and the ongoing debate between financial privacy and regulatory oversight. Here’s why: The Debate Over Developer Liability One of the most contentious aspects of the case is the question of developer liability. Can developers be held criminally responsible for how their open-source code is used by third parties? The defense argues that Storm merely wrote and deployed code, akin to a software developer creating an operating system that could be used for both legal and illegal purposes. They maintain that the decentralized nature of Tornado Cash meant Storm and his team had no control over its operation once deployed, and therefore, no ability to prevent illicit use. The prosecution, however, contends that Storm’s involvement went beyond mere code development, asserting he played an active role in promoting and maintaining a service he knew was being exploited by criminals. This legal battle could set a dangerous precedent, potentially chilling innovation in the open-source and DeFi space if developers fear prosecution for the unintended or malicious uses of their creations. The Future of Crypto Privacy Tools Privacy tools like Tornado Cash are fundamental to many in the crypto community who believe in financial anonymity as a core tenet of digital freedom. If the verdict leans towards conviction, it could signal a severe crackdown on all forms of privacy-enhancing technologies within the crypto space, forcing developers to implement more stringent KYC/AML measures, or face similar legal challenges. This would fundamentally alter the landscape of DeFi, potentially pushing privacy-focused projects underground or out of jurisdictions with strict regulations. Navigating the Regulatory Labyrinth The Tornado Cash trial highlights the growing tension between rapidly evolving blockchain technology and traditional legal frameworks. Regulators globally are grappling with how to apply existing laws, designed for centralized financial systems, to decentralized protocols. This case could provide a blueprint for future prosecutions and regulatory actions against other DeFi projects, especially those offering privacy-enhancing features. It underscores the urgent need for clearer regulatory guidelines that balance innovation with consumer protection and national security. The Legal Battle: Prosecution vs. Defense During the trial, both sides presented compelling, albeit contrasting, narratives: The Prosecution’s Stance: Intent and Facilitation The prosecution focused on demonstrating Storm’s alleged knowledge and intent. They presented evidence such as: Public Warnings: Arguing that Storm was aware of public warnings and reports linking Tornado Cash to illicit activities, yet continued to operate it. Control Mechanisms: Suggesting that despite claims of decentralization, Storm and his co-founders retained sufficient control to implement compliance measures, but chose not to. Financial Gain: Highlighting the financial benefits derived by the founders from the operation of Tornado Cash. They emphasized the direct link between the service and major hacks, particularly those carried out by the Lazarus Group, portraying Tornado Cash as a critical tool for global cybercrime. The Defense’s Argument: Open Source and Lack of Control Storm’s defense team built their case around the principles of open-source software development and the inherent decentralization of Tornado Cash. Their key arguments included: Code as Speech: Asserting that writing and deploying open-source code is a form of protected speech, and developers should not be held liable for its misuse. Decentralization: Emphasizing that once the smart contracts were deployed, they operated autonomously, removing any central control from the developers. They argued that Storm could not “stop” Tornado Cash even if he wanted to. Legitimate Use Cases: Highlighting that Tornado Cash had legitimate privacy-preserving uses for individuals and organizations who wished to protect their financial anonymity. The defense also argued that the government’s interpretation of “money transmitting business” is overly broad and misapplies traditional financial regulations to a novel technological paradigm. What Happens Next? The Jury’s Deliberation With the prosecution and defense having concluded their final arguments, the stage is set for the jury’s deliberation. This critical phase involves the jury reviewing all the evidence presented during the trial, considering the arguments from both sides, and applying the legal instructions provided by the judge. The process can be lengthy, depending on the complexity of the case and the consensus-building among jurors. The possible outcomes are: Guilty Verdict: If the jury finds Roman Storm guilty on one or more counts, he would face sentencing, potentially including a significant prison term and hefty fines. This would send a strong message to the DeFi community about regulatory enforcement. Not Guilty Verdict: A “not guilty” verdict would be a major win for privacy advocates and the open-source community, potentially emboldening developers of similar tools. It would also challenge the government’s approach to regulating decentralized protocols. Hung Jury: If the jury cannot reach a unanimous decision, it results in a hung jury. In such a scenario, the prosecution would have to decide whether to retry the case, which is a common outcome in complex, high-profile trials. The crypto world watches intently, as the jury’s decision will undoubtedly shape the regulatory landscape for years to come. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto and Privacy The Tornado Cash trial of Roman Storm is more than just a legal battle; it’s a crucible for the core principles of decentralization, privacy, and regulatory oversight in the digital age. The verdict will not only determine the fate of an individual but also cast a long shadow over the future development and adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies and the broader DeFi ecosystem. Regardless of the outcome, this case has undeniably highlighted the urgent need for clearer legal frameworks that can adapt to the rapid pace of technological innovation while safeguarding both individual liberties and national security interests. The crypto community must continue to engage in this crucial dialogue, advocating for responsible innovation and a balanced regulatory approach.

This decision, reported by Herald Business on July 30, means Park (whose real surname is Park, with ‘Jonbur Kim’ being a nickname roughly translating to ‘HODL Kim’) will remain in custody as his trial proceeds. It’s a stark reminder of the serious legal repercussions awaiting those accused of defrauding investors in the volatile digital asset space. Understanding the Alleged Crypto Scam: The PODO and Artube Sagas Park’s legal troubles began with an initial indictment for allegedly orchestrating a classic pump-and-dump scheme involving a token called PODO. The modus operandi was straightforward yet devastatingly effective for the perpetrator: inflate the token’s price through artificial means, then cash out entirely, leaving unsuspecting investors holding worthless bags. This alleged PODO crypto scam reportedly netted him a whopping 80.9 billion won, equivalent to approximately $58.2 million. What makes this case particularly alarming is what transpired next. After being released on bail for the PODO allegations, Park was hit with a second, even more substantial indictment. He was re-arrested and taken back into custody for allegedly issuing another fraudulent token, Artube (ATT). Through this second alleged crypto scam, he is accused of defrauding investors out of an additional 260 billion won, or about $187 million. The sheer scale of these alleged frauds underscores the significant risks present in unregulated corners of the crypto market. To put the alleged scale of these operations into perspective, consider the combined total: PODO Token Scam: 80.9 billion won (approx. $58.2 million) Artube (ATT) Token Scam: 260 billion won (approx. $187 million) Total Alleged Fraud: 340.9 billion won (approx. $245.2 million) These figures highlight the urgent need for heightened investor awareness and robust regulatory frameworks to combat such large-scale crypto scam activities. The Legal Labyrinth: Why Was Bail Denied in This Crypto Scam Case? The decision to deny bail, especially after a previous release, is not taken lightly by judicial systems. In South Korea, as in many jurisdictions, bail is typically granted unless there’s a significant risk that the defendant might: Flee: A flight risk, particularly with substantial alleged illicit gains, is a major concern. Obstruct Justice: There’s a fear they might tamper with evidence or intimidate witnesses. Commit Further Crimes: The most pertinent factor in Park’s case. Being accused of a second, larger crypto scam while out on bail for the first is a strong indicator of potential re-offending. The re-indictment for the Artube token fraud, following his initial bail, would have heavily weighed on the court’s decision. It signals a perceived pattern of behavior and a significant risk to the public and the integrity of the legal process. For courts, protecting the public and ensuring the defendant appears for trial are paramount. The alleged scale of the financial damages and the nature of the alleged repeat offenses make ‘Jonbur Kim’s’ case a textbook example of why bail might be denied in complex financial crime cases, particularly those involving a persistent crypto scam pattern. Protecting Yourself from Crypto Scam Pitfalls: Lessons from the ‘Jonbur Kim’ Case The ‘Jonbur Kim’ saga serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of vigilance in the crypto space. While the potential for innovation and financial growth is immense, so too are the opportunities for fraudsters. How can you protect yourself from falling victim to a crypto scam? Here are some actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Never invest based on hype alone. Research the project team, read the whitepaper carefully, understand the technology, and verify their claims. Look for experienced, transparent teams with a clear roadmap. Beware of Unrealistic Returns: If an investment promises guaranteed, sky-high returns with little to no risk, it’s a massive red flag. Pump-and-dump schemes, like the alleged PODO and Artube incidents, often lure investors with the promise of quick riches. Scrutinize Social Media and Community Claims: While community engagement is good, be wary of overly enthusiastic or aggressive marketing that dismisses skepticism. Look for genuine, organic discussion rather than coordinated shilling. Verify Smart Contract Audits: For new tokens, check if their smart contracts have been audited by reputable third-party security firms. This can help identify vulnerabilities or malicious code designed to exploit investors. Understand Liquidity and Lock-ups: Investigate how much liquidity is provided to decentralized exchanges and if it’s locked. Low liquidity or unlocked liquidity can make it easy for developers to pull funds, leading to a ‘rug pull’ – a common type of crypto scam. Consult Multiple Sources: Don’t rely on a single source of information. Cross-reference news, reviews, and technical analyses from independent, reputable crypto media outlets and analysts. Start Small and Diversify: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversifying your crypto portfolio can mitigate risk, but it’s not a shield against outright fraud. The ‘Jonbur Kim’ case highlights that even seemingly established figures can be accused of perpetrating massive frauds. Investor education is the strongest defense against the evolving tactics of a crypto scam. Beyond the Headlines: The Broader Implications for the Crypto Landscape High-profile cases like the alleged ‘Jonbur Kim’ crypto scam have significant ripple effects across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. They inevitably draw increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide, pushing for stricter oversight and more robust consumer protection laws. South Korea, in particular, has been proactive in its efforts to regulate the crypto market, driven by its high adoption rates and past incidents of fraud. These incidents also impact public perception, potentially eroding trust in legitimate crypto projects and hindering broader adoption. The challenge for the industry remains to balance innovation with accountability, fostering an environment where legitimate projects can thrive while bad actors are swiftly brought to justice. International cooperation will also become increasingly vital, as crypto scams often transcend national borders, making prosecution complex. The denial of bail for ‘Jonbur Kim’ sends a clear message: alleged crypto scam artists will face severe consequences. As the trial unfolds, it will undoubtedly shed more light on the intricate web of deceit involved in these multi-million dollar frauds. For investors, this serves as a critical wake-up call to exercise extreme caution and diligence. The path to a safer, more transparent crypto future depends on both robust enforcement and informed participation from every market participant. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is ‘Jonbur Kim’ and what is his real name? A1: ‘Jonbur Kim’ is a South Korean crypto figure whose real surname is Park. His nickname ‘Jonbur Kim’ roughly translates to ‘HODL Kim,’ reflecting the popular crypto term ‘HODL’ (hold on for dear life). Q2: What tokens are involved in the alleged crypto scam? A2: Park is accused of launching two fraudulent tokens: PODO, through which he allegedly netted $58.2 million, and Artube (ATT), from which he is accused of defrauding investors out of an additional $187 million. Q3: Why was ‘Jonbur Kim’ denied bail? A3: He was denied bail primarily because he was indicted for allegedly issuing a second fraudulent token (Artube) while already out on bail for the first alleged crypto scam (PODO). This suggests a high risk of re-offending and potentially obstructing justice. Q4: What is a ‘pump-and-dump’ scheme in crypto? A4: A pump-and-dump scheme involves artificially inflating the price of a cryptocurrency (the ‘pump’) through misleading positive statements, then selling off the accumulated coins at the inflated price (the ‘dump’), leaving other investors with devalued assets. Q5: How can investors protect themselves from similar crypto scams? A5: Investors should conduct thorough due diligence, research project teams, verify smart contract audits, be wary of unrealistic returns, scrutinize community claims, and diversify their portfolios. Never invest based solely on hype. Q6: What are the potential implications of this case for the crypto market? A6: This high-profile case is likely to increase regulatory scrutiny on the crypto market in South Korea and globally, pushing for stronger investor protection laws and more stringent enforcement against fraudulent activities.

If so, there’s an important announcement from Binance that requires your immediate attention. The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange has confirmed a temporary suspension of Injective INJ deposits and withdrawals, a crucial step taken to support the upcoming network upgrade and hard fork. Understanding the implications of this pause is vital for all users. Let’s dive into what this means for your Injective INJ holdings and how you can prepare. Understanding the Injective INJ Suspension Details Binance, through its official channels, has communicated that the temporary suspension of Injective (INJ) deposits and withdrawals is scheduled for July 31 at 13:00 UTC . This isn’t an arbitrary decision; it’s a proactive measure to ensure the smooth execution of a significant upgrade to the Injective network. During this specific window, any attempts to deposit or withdraw INJ tokens on Binance will not be processed. This is a standard procedure that major exchanges undertake to safeguard user assets and maintain the integrity of the blockchain during critical updates. It’s important to mark this date and time in your calendar, especially if you plan to move your Injective INJ tokens around that period. The suspension is not a cause for alarm but rather a necessary step in the continuous evolution of the Injective blockchain. Think of it as scheduled maintenance for a highly complex digital system – essential for long-term health and performance. Why is This Injective INJ Upgrade Necessary? You might be wondering, why do blockchain networks like Injective need upgrades and hard forks? In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology, continuous improvement is key. An ‘upgrade’ or ‘hard fork’ in blockchain terms refers to a significant change to the network’s protocol that is not backward-compatible. This means that nodes running the old software will not be able to interact with nodes running the new software, necessitating a complete shift for the entire network. The Injective network’s upcoming upgrade is designed to bring a host of enhancements, potentially including: Improved Performance and Scalability: Enhancing transaction speeds and network capacity to handle more users and applications. Enhanced Security Features: Implementing new cryptographic techniques or consensus mechanism improvements to make the network more robust against attacks. New Protocol Features: Introducing novel functionalities, such as advanced trading tools, new DeFi primitives, or better interoperability with other blockchains. Bug Fixes and Optimizations: Addressing any existing vulnerabilities or inefficiencies within the current protocol. These upgrades are vital for the longevity and competitiveness of any blockchain. For Injective INJ, this hard fork signals a commitment to innovation and a stronger foundation for its decentralized applications and ecosystem. Navigating the Injective INJ Suspension: What Users Need to Know As an Injective INJ holder, knowing how to navigate this temporary suspension is crucial. Here are some actionable insights to ensure you’re prepared: Plan Ahead: If you anticipate needing to deposit or withdraw Injective INJ tokens around July 31, ensure you complete these transactions well in advance of the 13:00 UTC cutoff time. This proactive approach will prevent any potential inconvenience or delays. Avoid Transfers During Suspension: Do not attempt to send or receive INJ tokens to or from Binance during the specified suspension period. Such transactions could be lost or significantly delayed, causing unnecessary stress. Binance will provide clear communication once services resume. Monitor Official Announcements: Stay vigilant by regularly checking Binance’s official announcement page, their social media channels, and the Injective Protocol’s official channels. These are the primary sources for updates regarding the upgrade’s progress and the resumption of services. Your Funds are Safe: Rest assured that your Injective INJ tokens held on Binance are safe. The exchange is merely pausing transfers to facilitate the upgrade, not impacting the security of your assets within your Binance account. Being informed and prepared is your best defense against any potential issues during such network events. Your proactive steps will ensure a seamless experience as the Injective network evolves. Potential Impact on Injective INJ Holders and the Broader Market While a temporary suspension of services can sometimes cause minor market jitters, for planned and communicated events like the Injective INJ upgrade, the impact is typically minimal and short-lived. In the immediate term, there might be a slight decrease in trading volume for INJ on Binance, but this is usually a temporary effect. From a long-term perspective, such upgrades are overwhelmingly positive. They signify a healthy and active development team dedicated to improving the blockchain. A more robust, secure, and feature-rich Injective network can attract more developers, users, and capital, ultimately benefiting the value and utility of the Injective INJ token. This commitment to continuous improvement reinforces the project’s credibility and its potential for sustained growth in the competitive DeFi landscape. Exploring the Injective Protocol: Beyond the Upgrade The Injective Protocol is more than just its upcoming upgrade; it’s a powerful layer-1 blockchain built specifically for next-generation decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. It offers a fully decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant platform for building various DeFi products, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), derivatives, perpetuals, and lending protocols. Key aspects of the Injective Protocol that make it stand out include: Custom-Built for DeFi: Unlike general-purpose blockchains, Injective is optimized for financial applications, offering specialized modules and functionalities. Orderbook Model: It uniquely features a decentralized on-chain orderbook, providing a familiar trading experience akin to centralized exchanges but with the benefits of decentralization. Cross-Chain Compatibility: Injective supports seamless interoperability with various other blockchains, including Ethereum, Cosmos, and Solana, expanding its reach and liquidity. INJ Token Utility: The native INJ token plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, used for governance, staking, securing the network, and value accrual from dApp fees. This commitment to building a robust and innovative DeFi ecosystem is why network upgrades are so critical.

Cooling Futures Market Hints at Possible Breakout,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoins-next-big-move-cooling-futures-market-hints-at-possible-breakout/,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains within a tight trading range following a recent pullback from its all-time high. At the time of writing, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is priced at $118,570, reflecting a 0.3% increase over the past 24 hours. Recent analysis shared on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform by market contributor ShayanMarkets highlights a noticeable change in Bitcoin’s futures market activity. According to the analyst, while previous price surges in the $70,000–$90,000 range were marked by significant speculative pressure and leverage buildup, the current trend shows signs of cooling despite elevated price levels. This shift could play a key role in determining Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin’s Final Leg Is Near – Time To Be ‘Cautiously Optimistic’? Bitcoin Futures Market Shows Signs of Normalization ShayanMarkets explained that during past rallies, the futures market displayed what he called “heating and overheating phases,” often visible in red clusters on the volume bubble map. These periods typically led to corrections or temporary price consolidations as leveraged positions unwound. However, the current data reflects a different setup. Despite Bitcoin remaining near record highs, futures market activity has transitioned to neutral and cooling phases, shown by grey and green bubbles on the chart. The analyst noted that this cooling phase could be a sign of de-risking among traders, as speculative activity eases while spot demand supports the price. In a statement on QuickTake, ShayanMarkets said: This reset in leverage, despite BTC staying above $100K, signals healthier market conditions as demand shifts toward organic buying rather than high-risk speculative bets. The analyst added that if the reduced speculative pressure continues, it could provide the foundation for another significant price increase, potentially setting Bitcoin up to break past its previous all-time high above $123K. Long-Term Whales Take Profits Amid Price Stability Meanwhile, another analysis from CryptoQuant contributor CoinCare revealed selling activity from long-term Bitcoin holders, often referred to as “whales,” who have maintained their positions for over a decade. According to CoinCare, some of these holders, including those who first accumulated Bitcoin around 2013, have started to liquidate a portion of their holdings. This selling activity aligns with the historical timeline of Bitcoin’s sharp rise from under $100 to roughly $1,000 during that period, representing a potential 117,900% return for early adopters. Such profit-taking from early investors is not unusual during periods of elevated prices and does not necessarily indicate a shift in long-term market sentiment.

Every week brings new names into the spotlight, each promising big things. But with all this buzz, it’s hard to know which ones actually stand out for more than just a moment. This list highlights the top-performing cryptos of July that are gaining momentum for good reasons. From fresh tech to real-world tools and meme hype, BlockDAG, PENGU, SUI, and Ethena are on fire right now. Let’s break down what makes each of them worth watching. 1. BlockDAG’s 30x Potential Has Everyone Clicking Fast BlockDAG is one of the top-performing cryptos thanks to strong tech and real usability. It runs on a custom DAG-based Layer 1 that handles up to 15,000 transactions per second without slowing down. That alone makes it stand out from older chains. But what really grabs attention is the X1 Miner app. Anyone with a smartphone can use it to earn BDAG daily. No special tools or coding needed. Just tap, mine, and start stacking BDAG. With more than 2.5 million users mining every day, the word is clearly out. This combo of power and ease is paying off. BlockDAG’s presale has already brought in $355 million with 24.4 billion coins sold. The price stays locked at $0.0016 until its GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. And it’s not just one or two exchanges. Twenty platforms including MEXC, LBank, BitMart, Coinstore, and XT.com are confirmed for launch. With a starting price of $0.05, that’s a 3,025% ROI for those grabbing BDAG now. While others get caught in hype, BlockDAG (BDAG) is building something fast, useful, and ready for everyone. 2. PENGU’s Price Jump Shows Meme Power Is Still Hot PENGU is turning heads as one of the top performing cryptos right now, with a sharp 40% gain in just seven days. It’s currently priced at $0.0342, powered by a $2.63 billion market cap and a huge $1.43 billion in daily volume. These numbers show that PENGU is not just hype, it’s holding serious attention in today’s fast-moving market. A big part of this surge is thanks to the rising appeal of Pudgy Penguins, especially after striking major retail deals with names like Walmart. As NFTs stay relevant and meme coins keep pulling crowds, PENGU’s mix of real-world brand presence and strong trading action makes it one of the top performing cryptos right now. 3. SUI’s Breakout Sends Signals Across Crypto SUI is gaining fast, climbing 14% in a single day to reach $1.52. With a growing market cap near $14.74 billion and $2.28 billion in daily volume, momentum is clearly building. The surge comes from bullish ETF buzz and a solid breakout on the charts, sending strong signals to traders. This fast, low-cost Layer-1 is also getting attention from DeFi and gaming developers. The project brings real utility into the spotlight, and its recent move past resistance lines shows strong demand. Between retail interest and bigger players watching closely, SUI has secured its spot among July’s top performing cryptos. 4. ENA Climbs Quietly but Steadily With USDe Push Ethena (ENA) wraps up this list of top performing cryptos, showing quiet strength with big numbers. ENA is now trading at $0.92, jumping 34.8% over the past week and moving $1.92 billion in daily trading volume. The drive behind this is growing demand for Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, which is gaining traction across DeFi protocols. Its focus on stable yield and reliability has helped it stand out in a space filled with wild swings. ENA’s rise is backed by deep liquidity and a clear use case. As more users seek safer options with strong returns, ENA is earning its place among the month’s biggest performers. One Best Crypto Stands Out for Bigger Returns PENGU is grabbing attention with its strong meme game and support from big names like Walmart. SUI is showing real speed and growth in DeFi and gaming. ENA is delivering quiet gains with solid stability and yield from its USDe. But none of them match BlockDAG when it comes to return potential. The price is still frozen at $0.0016 in Batch 29, and with a launch value of $0.05 on August 11’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release, that’s a 3,025% ROI waiting to happen. With the X1 mining app making BDAG accessible to anyone, the chance to earn daily with no extra tools or effort is drawing in millions. The presale is flying, and Batch 29 is almost gone. If you want to get into the best crypto at its lowest price, now’s the moment to act.

Recently, the world of digital assets witnessed a truly compelling milestone: U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded their 19th consecutive day of net inflows, accumulating an impressive $6.22 million on July 30 alone. This sustained interest not only ties a previous record set between May 16 and June 12 but also underscores a growing appetite among institutional investors for exposure to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. What does this remarkable streak mean for the future of crypto, and why are these financial vehicles capturing so much attention? What’s Driving the Surge in Spot Ethereum ETFs ? The consistent flow of capital into Spot Ethereum ETFs is not a random occurrence; it is indicative of several underlying factors that are making Ethereum an increasingly attractive asset class for traditional finance. Unlike futures ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts, spot ETFs hold the actual underlying asset, offering direct exposure to Ethereum’s price movements. This direct exposure is often preferred by institutional investors seeking pure play on the asset. Growing Institutional Comfort: Following the successful launch and performance of Bitcoin spot ETFs, institutional investors are becoming more comfortable with regulated crypto investment vehicles. This familiarity paves the way for greater adoption of Ethereum-based products. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Strength: Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s a foundational blockchain powering decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Its utility and robust development community make it a compelling long-term investment. Regulatory Progress: While the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains dynamic, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs set a precedent. Investors are hopeful for continued regulatory clarity and a more defined framework for digital assets, which de-risks their participation. Yield Potential and Staking: The transition to Ethereum 2.0 (the Merge) introduced staking, offering potential yields to holders. While direct staking through ETFs might have regulatory complexities, the underlying asset’s ability to generate yield adds to its appeal for sophisticated investors looking for diversified income streams. Breaking Down the Numbers: Who’s Leading the Spot Ethereum ETF Race? The $6.22 million net inflow on July 30 was a culmination of varied performances from the different U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs . Understanding the individual contributions provides a clearer picture of the market dynamics. Data shared by Trader T on X highlighted the key players: ETF July 30 Inflow/Outflow Significance BlackRock’s ETHA +$20.72 million Led the charge, indicating strong institutional confidence in BlackRock’s offering and their ability to attract significant capital. Grayscale’s ETHE +$7.77 million Continued positive movement for Grayscale’s converted trust, suggesting ongoing demand and successful transition from a closed-end fund. Fidelity’s FETH -$22.27 million Experienced a notable outflow, possibly due to rebalancing by investors, profit-taking, or strategic reallocation within diversified portfolios. Remaining ETFs No Change Held steady, implying stable holdings or minimal trading activity for the day. BlackRock’s significant lead with over $20 million in inflows underscores its powerful position in the traditional finance world and its growing influence in the crypto investment space. Their brand recognition and distribution networks are proving to be major catalysts for attracting large-scale investments into their Spot Ethereum ETFs . Grayscale’s positive flow is also important, as it represents a continued vote of confidence in their product, which has undergone a significant transformation from a trust to an ETF. The Significance of a 19-Day Inflow Streak for Spot Ethereum ETFs A streak of 19 consecutive days of net inflows is more than just a statistical anomaly; it is a powerful signal that resonates throughout the financial markets. This sustained demand for Spot Ethereum ETFs indicates: Sustained Institutional Demand: It shows that the interest is not fleeting but rather a consistent strategy by large investors to gain exposure to Ethereum. This suggests a long-term bullish outlook from significant market players. Increasing Market Maturity: The ability of the market to absorb continuous inflows into regulated products without major price disruptions points to growing maturity and liquidity within the Ethereum ecosystem. Validation of Ethereum as an Asset Class: Each dollar flowing into these ETFs reinforces Ethereum’s position as a legitimate and investable asset, moving it further away from speculative narratives towards a recognized part of diversified portfolios. Potential for Price Stability and Growth: While short-term price movements are influenced by many factors, sustained institutional buying pressure through ETFs can contribute to greater price stability and provide a strong foundation for future growth. It represents consistent demand that can absorb selling pressure. Challenges and Opportunities for Spot Ethereum ETFs While the current inflow streak paints a positive picture, the journey for Spot Ethereum ETFs is not without its challenges, nor is it devoid of exciting future opportunities. Challenges: Regulatory Headwinds: Despite recent approvals, the broader regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains complex and subject to change. Future policies from the SEC or other global regulators could impact the market. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, are inherently volatile assets. While ETFs aim to provide a regulated pathway, they are still exposed to the underlying asset’s price fluctuations, which can deter some conservative investors. Competition: The landscape of crypto investment products is evolving rapidly. Competition from other ETF providers, direct crypto purchases, or alternative investment strategies could affect future inflows. Opportunities: Broader Investor Access: ETFs democratize access to Ethereum for traditional investors who might be hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies due to security concerns or technical complexities. This opens up a vast new pool of capital. Increased Liquidity: As more capital flows into Spot Ethereum ETFs , it contributes to the overall liquidity of the Ethereum market, making it easier for large trades to occur without significant price impact. Product Innovation: The success of spot ETFs could pave the way for more sophisticated Ethereum-linked financial products, such as options, futures, or even leveraged ETFs, catering to a wider range of investment strategies. Actionable Insights for Investors in Spot Ethereum ETFs For both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors looking to dip their toes into the digital asset world, the rise of Spot Ethereum ETFs offers several actionable insights: Monitor ETF Flow Data: Keep an eye on daily inflow and outflow data for various crypto ETFs. Consistent inflows signal bullish sentiment, while significant outflows could indicate a shift in investor appetite. Understand the Underlying Asset: While ETFs simplify access, it is crucial to understand Ethereum’s technology, use cases, and development roadmap. This knowledge empowers informed investment decisions. Consider Diversification: Even with strong performance, diversification remains key. Do not put all your investment capital into a single asset or ETF. Balance your portfolio with other asset classes. Stay Informed on Regulations: Regulatory developments can significantly impact the crypto market. Following news from regulatory bodies like the SEC can help anticipate potential market shifts. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional adoption via ETFs often signals a long-term investment horizon. For those considering these products, adopting a similar long-term view might align better with the underlying market trends. Conclusion The sustained influx of capital into U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs , culminating in a remarkable 19-day net inflow streak, marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. It is a testament to Ethereum’s growing appeal as a legitimate, utility-rich asset and signals a significant step towards its broader integration into traditional finance. While challenges persist, the opportunities presented by increased institutional participation and regulatory clarity are immense. This trend not only validates Ethereum’s position but also sets a promising precedent for the future of digital asset investments, offering a regulated and accessible pathway for a new wave of investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Spot Ethereum ETF? A Spot Ethereum ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without having to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. It trades on traditional stock exchanges, making it accessible through standard brokerage accounts. 2. Why are institutional inflows important for Ethereum? Institutional inflows are crucial because they represent large sums of capital from major financial entities like asset managers, hedge funds, and pension funds. Their participation signifies growing confidence, increased market liquidity, and broader acceptance of Ethereum as a legitimate asset class, potentially leading to greater price stability and long-term growth. 3. How do Spot Ethereum ETFs differ from Ethereum futures ETFs? Spot Ethereum ETFs hold actual Ethereum, offering direct price exposure. Ethereum futures ETFs, on the other hand, invest in futures contracts that speculate on Ethereum’s future price. Futures ETFs can be subject to contango and backwardation, which might lead to tracking errors compared to the spot price, whereas spot ETFs aim to track the immediate price of the asset more closely. 4. What does the 19-day inflow streak signify for Spot Ethereum ETFs ? The 19-day consecutive net inflow streak signifies sustained and consistent institutional demand for Ethereum exposure through regulated products. It indicates that the interest is not a one-off event but a strategic, ongoing allocation of capital, reinforcing Ethereum’s growing maturity and acceptance among traditional investors. 5. Will these inflows directly impact Ethereum’s price? While direct and immediate price impacts can be complex and influenced by many factors, sustained inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs generally contribute to positive buying pressure. This consistent demand can help absorb selling pressure, potentially leading to greater price stability and a stronger foundation for long-term price appreciation for Ethereum. 6. What role does BlackRock play in the Spot Ethereum ETF market? BlackRock, as one of the world’s largest asset managers, plays a significant role due to its immense financial clout, brand recognition, and extensive distribution network. Their substantial inflows into their ETHA ETF demonstrate their ability to attract considerable institutional capital, validating the product and the underlying asset for a broad range of investors.

Other ETFs: While IBIT and BITB dominated the inflows for the day, it’s worth noting that other spot Bitcoin ETF s reported no change in holdings, suggesting that the positive momentum is concentrated among the top performers, drawing capital efficiently. This concentrated inflow into leading funds like IBIT and BITB highlights investor preference for established names and liquid products within the nascent spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. The Power of Consecutive Positive Flows for Bitcoin ETF Why is a five-day streak of positive inflows so significant for the Bitcoin ETF market? It’s more than just numbers; it’s a strong signal of: Sustained Investor Confidence: A single day of inflows could be an anomaly, but five consecutive days suggest a deeper, more entrenched belief among investors in the long-term value and stability of Bitcoin as an asset class, particularly when accessed via regulated ETF structures. Growing Institutional Adoption: Large inflows often come from institutional investors – hedge funds, wealth managers, and corporations. Their participation is crucial for the maturation of the crypto market, bringing substantial capital and professional oversight. Market Validation: The consistent demand for spot Bitcoin ETF s validates the regulatory approval of these products earlier this year. It demonstrates that there was indeed significant pent-up demand for a regulated, accessible way to invest in Bitcoin. Potential for Price Stability: While Bitcoin is known for its volatility, sustained inflows into ETFs can contribute to greater price stability over time by absorbing selling pressure and providing a consistent source of demand. This consistent accumulation through ETFs acts as a powerful demand driver, potentially influencing Bitcoin’s price trajectory and overall market sentiment positively. Navigating the Landscape: Benefits and Challenges of Bitcoin ETF Investment For many, the spot Bitcoin ETF represents a bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. But like any investment, it comes with its own set of advantages and considerations. Benefits of Investing in a Bitcoin ETF: Accessibility: You can buy and sell shares of a Bitcoin ETF through traditional brokerage accounts, just like stocks or mutual funds. This eliminates the need for setting up crypto wallets, understanding complex exchanges, or managing private keys. Liquidity: ETFs are generally highly liquid, meaning you can easily buy or sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices. This offers flexibility that might not always be present in direct crypto purchases on certain exchanges. Regulatory Oversight: Spot Bitcoin ETF s are regulated by financial authorities like the SEC in the U.S., offering a layer of investor protection and transparency that might appeal to those wary of unregulated crypto markets. Diversification (within crypto): For a traditional portfolio, a Bitcoin ETF can offer exposure to the digital asset space without needing to pick individual cryptocurrencies. Challenges and Considerations: Fees: ETFs typically charge management fees (expense ratios), which can eat into your returns over time. While often low, they are still a cost to consider compared to holding Bitcoin directly. Market Volatility: While the ETF structure provides a regulated wrapper, the underlying asset (Bitcoin) remains highly volatile. The value of your Bitcoin ETF investment will fluctuate with Bitcoin’s price swings. Custody Risk (Indirect): While you don’t directly hold Bitcoin, the ETF provider does. You are trusting the ETF issuer with the secure custody of the underlying assets. Regulatory Evolution: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and ETFs is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the performance or even the existence of certain funds. Understanding these aspects is crucial for making informed investment decisions. A Bitcoin ETF is a powerful tool, but it requires the same due diligence as any other investment. Actionable Insights for Aspiring Bitcoin ETF Investors Given the exciting developments in the Bitcoin ETF space, how can you approach this opportunity wisely? Here are some actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Don’t just jump in because of positive headlines. Understand the specific Bitcoin ETF you’re considering – its fees, its issuer, its historical performance, and its custody arrangements. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is a volatile asset. Be honest about how much risk you’re comfortable taking. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly). This strategy, known as dollar-cost averaging, can help mitigate the impact of market volatility by averaging out your purchase price over time. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves fast. Keep up with news, regulatory changes, and market analysis related to Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETF s. Consult a Financial Advisor: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals, consider speaking with a qualified financial advisor. These steps can help you navigate the promising yet complex world of Bitcoin ETF investments with greater confidence. A Compelling Future for Bitcoin ETF The consistent net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF s, particularly the five-day streak culminating in $47.39 million on July 30, is more than just a fleeting trend. It represents a significant milestone in the broader acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial markets. With major players like BlackRock leading the charge, these ETFs are providing an accessible, regulated, and increasingly trusted pathway for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. As these products mature and attract more capital, they are poised to play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s future price discovery, enhancing market liquidity, and solidifying its position as a legitimate asset class. The continued positive momentum suggests a bright outlook, indicating that the journey of the Bitcoin ETF is just beginning to unfold its full potential. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Bitcoin ETFs Q1: What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin as its underlying asset. This means that when you buy shares of the ETF, you are indirectly investing in Bitcoin, with the fund responsible for securely holding the actual cryptocurrency. Q2: How do spot Bitcoin ETFs differ from Bitcoin futures ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETF s hold actual Bitcoin, aiming to track its price directly. Bitcoin futures ETFs, on the other hand, invest in Bitcoin futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price on a future date. Futures ETFs do not directly hold Bitcoin and their performance can sometimes deviate from the spot price. Q3: Why are inflows into Bitcoin ETFs considered important? Consistent inflows indicate strong demand and growing investor confidence, particularly from institutional players. This signals increased mainstream adoption, provides market validation, and can contribute to price stability and liquidity for Bitcoin. Q4: Are Bitcoin ETFs a safer investment than buying Bitcoin directly? While Bitcoin ETF s offer regulatory oversight and eliminate the need for personal custody of Bitcoin (reducing certain technical risks like losing private keys), they are still subject to Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility. They offer a different risk profile, not necessarily a ‘safer’ one in terms of market fluctuations, but a more regulated and accessible one. Q5: Who are the major players in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market? Currently, major players include BlackRock (IBIT), Fidelity (FBTC), Bitwise (BITB), Ark Invest/21Shares (ARKB), and Grayscale (GBTC, which converted from a trust to an ETF). These firms collectively manage a significant portion of the assets under management in the spot Bitcoin ETF space.

One term that frequently sends shivers down the spine of even seasoned traders is ‘liquidation.’ Specifically, crypto perpetual futures liquidation represents a critical moment where leveraged positions are forcefully closed, often leading to substantial losses for traders. These events are not merely financial footnotes; they are powerful indicators of market sentiment, volatility, and the inherent risks associated with high-leverage trading. Let’s dive deep into the recent 24-hour breakdown of these liquidations, unraveling what happened, why it matters, and how you can better navigate these treacherous waters. What Exactly Are Crypto Perpetual Futures, and Why Do They Matter? Before we dissect the recent crypto liquidations, it’s essential to grasp the instrument at play: perpetual futures. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures do not. They are derivative products that allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning the underlying asset. They are immensely popular due to several key features: No Expiry Date: Traders can hold their positions indefinitely, as long as they maintain sufficient margin. Leverage: Perpetual futures enable traders to open positions much larger than their initial capital, amplifying potential profits – and losses. This high leverage is a double-edged sword, directly tied to the risk of liquidation. Funding Rates: A unique mechanism that ensures the perpetual futures price stays close to the spot market price. Traders either pay or receive small fees, depending on the difference between the perpetual and spot prices. The ability to use significant leverage is what makes perpetual futures so attractive to traders seeking amplified returns. However, it’s also the primary catalyst for rapid and often painful crypto liquidations when the market moves unexpectedly against a trader’s position. Understanding Liquidation: The Trader’s Ultimate Foe So, what exactly happens during a liquidation? In simple terms, liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin (the collateral deposited to open and maintain a leveraged position) falls below a certain threshold required by the exchange. This usually happens when the market price moves significantly against their leveraged position. To protect themselves from further losses, exchanges automatically close the trader’s position, often resulting in the loss of their entire margin or a substantial portion of it. Think of it like this: you borrow money to buy a house, but if the house’s value drops too much, the bank might force you to sell it to cover their loan. In crypto, it’s much faster and automated. The higher the leverage used, the smaller the price movement required to trigger a liquidation. This inherent mechanism is why understanding crypto liquidations is not just academic, but absolutely crucial for risk management in leveraged trading. The 24-Hour Crypto Liquidations Breakdown: A Snapshot of Market Pain The past 24 hours have offered a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the crypto market, particularly for those engaged in perpetual futures trading. Here’s a detailed look at the significant crypto liquidations that occurred across major assets: Asset Total Liquidation Amount Position Type Liquidated Percentage of Total Ethereum (ETH) $101.96 million Long 65.92% Bitcoin (BTC) $73.09 million Long 81.54% Solana (SOL) $32.30 million Long 86.00% As the data clearly indicates, a staggering amount of capital was wiped out in just 24 hours, primarily from ‘Long’ positions. This signifies that the market experienced a significant downturn or unexpected bearish pressure, catching many traders who were betting on price increases off guard. The dominance of long liquidations across major assets like ETH, BTC, and SOL underscores a broad market correction or a rapid cascade effect where initial price drops trigger further liquidations, leading to more selling pressure. Why Do Crypto Liquidations Happen So Rapidly? The speed and scale of crypto liquidations can be bewildering. Several factors contribute to this rapid succession of events: Extreme Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their dramatic price swings. A small percentage drop in price can translate into a significant percentage loss for highly leveraged positions, quickly hitting liquidation thresholds. Over-Leveraging: Many traders, especially newcomers, use excessively high leverage (e.g., 50x, 100x) in pursuit of quick profits. While tempting, this drastically reduces the margin for error. Cascading Effect: When one large liquidation occurs, the forced selling of that position adds selling pressure to the market, pushing prices down further. This can then trigger more liquidations, creating a domino effect that accelerates price declines. Sudden Market News/Events: Unexpected regulatory announcements, major hacks, or even a prominent whale’s large sell-off can trigger rapid price movements that catch leveraged positions off guard. The Impact of Mass Liquidations on the Crypto Market Mass crypto liquidations are more than just individual losses; they have a ripple effect across the entire market. When millions of dollars in positions are forcefully closed, it creates significant selling pressure, which can exacerbate price downturns. This leads to increased fear and uncertainty among traders, potentially driving more investors to sell their holdings, further contributing to a bearish sentiment. Moreover, these events can highlight systemic risks within the market, particularly concerning the stability of exchanges and their liquidation engines. While liquidations are a necessary mechanism to maintain market stability and prevent insolvencies, their sheer volume can be a painful reminder of the market’s inherent fragility and the dangers of unmanaged risk in perpetual futures trading. Navigating the Volatile Waters: How Can Traders Avoid Crypto Liquidations? While liquidations are an inherent part of leveraged trading, there are robust strategies traders can employ to minimize their risk and potentially avoid becoming another statistic in the next wave of crypto liquidations: Prudent Leverage: The golden rule. Avoid using maximum leverage, especially if you are new to futures trading. Start with low leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) to give your positions more breathing room against price fluctuations. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: This is your primary defense mechanism. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position if the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses before liquidation is triggered. Effective Position Sizing: Never allocate too much of your portfolio to a single trade, especially a leveraged one. Diversify your risk. Monitor Margin Levels: Keep a close eye on your margin ratio. If it starts to dip, consider adding more collateral to your position (margin call) or reducing your position size. Understand Market Sentiment: Stay informed about market news, trends, and technical analysis. Trading against strong market trends with high leverage is a recipe for disaster. Remember, the goal isn’t just to make profits, but to preserve capital. A disciplined approach to risk management is far more valuable than chasing quick gains through excessive leverage. Long vs. Short Liquidations: What Do They Tell Us? The breakdown revealed a significant majority of long liquidations. This distinction is crucial for understanding market dynamics: Long Positions: Traders who ‘go long’ are betting that the price of an asset will increase. If the price falls significantly, their long positions are at risk of liquidation. Short Positions: Traders who ‘go short’ are betting that the price of an asset will decrease. If the price rises significantly, their short positions are at risk of liquidation. The recent data clearly indicates a market downturn or a sharp correction, as traders expecting prices to rise were caught out. Conversely, during a strong bull run, you would typically see a higher proportion of short crypto liquidations as the market surges against bearish bets. Analyzing these ratios can provide insights into prevailing market sentiment and potential turning points. Actionable Insights for Aspiring Perpetual Futures Traders For those looking to venture into perpetual futures, or even current traders seeking to refine their approach, here are some actionable insights drawn from recent crypto liquidations: Education is Key: Thoroughly understand how perpetual futures work, the mechanics of leverage, and the nuances of liquidation before placing a single trade. Start Small: Begin with a minimal amount of capital and low leverage to gain experience without risking significant funds. Practice Risk Management Relentlessly: This cannot be stressed enough. Treat every trade as a risk management exercise first, and a profit opportunity second. Control Emotions: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) are powerful emotions that can lead to impulsive and costly decisions. Stick to your trading plan. Stay Updated: The crypto market is influenced by a myriad of factors, from macroeconomic news to specific project developments. Staying informed helps anticipate market shifts. Conclusion: Mastering the Art of Risk in Perpetual Futures The recent 24-hour crypto perpetual futures liquidation breakdown serves as a powerful testament to the inherent risks and rewards of leveraged crypto trading. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the reality of swift and substantial losses due to liquidation is ever-present. Understanding the mechanics of perpetual futures, the triggers for liquidation, and crucially, implementing robust risk management strategies are not optional – they are absolutely essential for survival and success in this dynamic market. By learning from these events, adopting disciplined trading practices, and prioritizing capital preservation, traders can transform potential pitfalls into valuable learning experiences. The crypto market offers incredible opportunities, but only to those who approach it with knowledge, caution, and a deep respect for its volatility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Crypto Liquidations 1. What are crypto perpetual futures?

Today, the focus turns to Tokyo, as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) makes a pivotal announcement regarding Japan interest rates . The central bank’s decision to maintain its benchmark interest rate at 0.5% marks a period of unwavering stability, a move widely anticipated by analysts and economists alike. This is the fourth consecutive meeting where the BoJ has kept rates unchanged, following a significant 25 basis-point hike earlier in January. For those navigating the often-volatile crypto markets, understanding these macroeconomic currents is crucial. Traditional financial stability, or the lack thereof, can influence investor sentiment, capital flows, and ultimately, the broader appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Let’s delve deeper into what this decision means for Japan, the global economy, and the intricate web of financial markets. Understanding Japan Interest Rates: What Does ‘Unchanged’ Mean? When we talk about Japan interest rates , specifically the Bank of Japan’s policy rate, we are referring to the short-term interest rate that the central bank charges commercial banks for loans. For years, Japan was an outlier among major global economies, maintaining a negative interest rate policy to combat deflation and stimulate economic growth. This made borrowing extremely cheap, encouraging investment and spending. However, earlier this year, the BoJ made a historic shift, exiting its negative interest rate policy and raising rates for the first time in 17 years. The current 0.5% rate, while still remarkably low compared to the Federal Reserve’s or European Central Bank’s rates, signifies a cautious step towards monetary policy normalization. The decision to hold steady at 0.5% means: Continuity: The BoJ is signaling that it is comfortable with the current economic trajectory and does not see an immediate need for further tightening or easing. Assessment Period: It allows the central bank time to assess the impact of the previous rate hike and observe how inflation and wage growth evolve. Predictability: For businesses and consumers, a stable rate environment offers a degree of predictability, which can foster confidence in planning and investment. This steady hand contrasts sharply with the aggressive rate hikes seen in other parts of the world over the past couple of years, highlighting Japan’s unique economic challenges and policy approach. Why Did the Bank of Japan Hold Steady? Analyzing the Decision The decision to keep Japan interest rates unchanged was, as Jin10 reported, widely anticipated. But what factors underpinned this consensus among economists and within the BoJ itself? Several key considerations likely played a role: 1. Inflationary Trends and Targets The BoJ’s primary objective is to achieve a stable 2% inflation target. While Japan has seen a recent pickup in inflation, largely driven by imported costs and a weaker yen, the central bank wants to ensure that this inflation is sustainable and demand-driven, rather than just cost-push. They are particularly focused on the ‘virtuous cycle’ of wages and prices. 2. Wage Growth Robust wage growth is considered essential for achieving sustainable inflation. The BoJ is closely monitoring the results of annual spring wage negotiations (Shunto). While initial reports have shown significant wage increases, the central bank likely wants to see these translate into broader consumer spending and domestic demand before making further moves. 3. Global Economic Uncertainties The global economic outlook remains fraught with uncertainties, including geopolitical tensions, persistent inflation in some major economies, and the potential for a slowdown in global trade. Maintaining stable Japan interest rates provides a buffer against external shocks and allows the BoJ to observe global developments before committing to a new policy direction. 4. Yen’s Volatility The Japanese Yen has been under significant depreciation pressure against major currencies like the US dollar. While a weaker yen can boost exports, it also increases the cost of imports, putting pressure on household budgets. The BoJ needs to balance these effects, and a sudden rate hike could exacerbate yen strength, potentially harming export-driven growth. In essence, the BoJ is exercising caution, preferring to observe the unfolding economic data rather than rushing into another policy adjustment. This ‘wait and see’ approach is characteristic of a central bank navigating complex economic conditions post-pandemic and post-deflation. What Are the Broader Implications of Stable Japan Interest Rates? The BoJ’s decision has far-reaching implications, not just for Japan, but for global financial markets. Understanding these impacts can provide valuable context for investors across all asset classes, including digital assets. Impact on the Yen and Foreign Exchange Markets A stable interest rate differential between Japan and other major economies (especially the US) means the yen is likely to remain under pressure against currencies with higher yields. This can make yen-funded carry trades attractive, where investors borrow in yen at low rates and invest in higher-yielding assets abroad. This dynamic indirectly affects global liquidity and capital flows. Influence on Global Bond Markets Japan is a massive bond market, and the BoJ’s yield curve control (YCC) policy, though adjusted, still influences global bond yields. If Japan interest rates remain low, it can exert downward pressure on global bond yields, as investors seek higher returns elsewhere. This can make riskier assets, like stocks or even cryptocurrencies, relatively more appealing. Effects on Equity Markets Japanese equities have performed strongly recently, partly due to corporate reforms and a weaker yen boosting exporter profits. Stable interest rates generally support equity markets by keeping borrowing costs low for companies and making fixed-income investments less attractive by comparison. For global investors, Japan remains an interesting market to watch. Indirect Impact on Cryptocurrency Markets While not directly tied to crypto, the BoJ’s stability contributes to the overall global macroeconomic environment. A predictable monetary policy in a major economy like Japan can reduce overall market volatility, potentially fostering a more stable backdrop for risk assets. Conversely, if Japan were to face unexpected economic shocks, the ripples could extend to all markets, including crypto. Investors often look for stability in traditional finance to confidently allocate capital to nascent markets. Challenges and Future Outlook: Navigating Japan’s Economic Landscape Despite the current stability in Japan interest rates , the path ahead for the Bank of Japan is not without its challenges. The central bank faces a delicate balancing act: Sustaining Inflation: Ensuring that inflation remains consistently at or above the 2% target, driven by strong domestic demand and wage growth, is paramount. Global Headwinds: Navigating potential global economic slowdowns, trade tensions, and commodity price fluctuations. Fiscal Health: Addressing Japan’s substantial public debt, which limits the government’s fiscal flexibility and puts more pressure on monetary policy. Demographic Pressures: Japan’s aging and shrinking population presents long-term challenges to economic growth and productivity. What can we expect next? The BoJ has emphasized a data-dependent approach. Future policy decisions will hinge on key indicators such as inflation readings, wage growth figures, and the broader global economic landscape. While some analysts anticipate another rate hike later in the year, the timing and magnitude will depend on whether the BoJ sees sufficient evidence of a self-sustaining inflationary cycle. The BoJ’s communication will be key, as any hint of future moves could significantly impact market expectations. Conclusion: A Steady Hand in Uncertain Times The Bank of Japan’s decision to hold Japan interest rates steady at 0.5% underscores a cautious yet deliberate approach to monetary policy. After years of unconventional measures, the central bank is carefully navigating its return to normalcy, prioritizing sustainable economic growth and stable inflation. This period of unwavering stability provides a crucial window for the BoJ to assess the impact of its recent policy shifts and gather more data before charting its next course. For global markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Japan’s steady hand offers a degree of predictability in an otherwise volatile landscape. While direct impacts may be subtle, the stability in one of the world’s largest economies contributes to the overall health of the financial ecosystem, indirectly influencing investor confidence and capital allocation across all asset classes. As the BoJ continues its watchful vigil, market participants worldwide will be keenly observing Japan’s economic pulse, understanding that even the most subtle tremors can send ripples far and wide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the current Japan interest rate? The current benchmark interest rate set by the Bank of Japan is 0.5%, maintained for the fourth consecutive meeting. 2. Why did the Bank of Japan keep rates unchanged? The Bank of Japan kept Japan interest rates unchanged to assess the impact of its previous rate hike, monitor sustainable inflation and wage growth, and observe global economic uncertainties before making further policy adjustments. 3. How do Japan interest rates affect the global economy? Low Japan interest rates can influence global capital flows, affecting currency valuations (like the yen) and potentially making higher-yielding assets elsewhere more attractive. This can indirectly impact global liquidity and investment patterns. 4. What is the significance of the 0.5% rate? The 0.5% rate signifies Japan’s cautious step away from its long-standing negative interest rate policy, aiming for a more normalized monetary environment while ensuring sustainable economic recovery and inflation. 5. When was the last time the Bank of Japan hiked rates? The Bank of Japan last hiked its interest rate by 25 basis points in January of this year, marking the first rate increase in 17 years. 6. Will the Bank of Japan raise rates again soon? The Bank of Japan has stated its policy will remain data-dependent. Future rate hikes will depend on whether inflation reaches its 2% target sustainably, supported by strong wage growth and domestic demand.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, so too do the sophisticated tactics of fraudsters. This is why the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) of South Korea has launched an urgent public awareness campaign to combat various financial crimes, including the pervasive threat of South Korea crypto scams . Imagine enjoying your summer vacation, only to find yourself targeted by a deceptive scheme. This initiative aims to protect citizens, especially during peak travel seasons, ensuring that public spaces like major tourist destinations and airports become hubs of vital information rather than vulnerable points for scams. Why is South Korea Taking Such Strong Action Against South Korea Crypto Scams? South Korea has long been at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. Its tech-savvy population and high internet penetration have made it a fertile ground for digital assets. However, with this rapid growth comes an unfortunate side effect: an increase in financial fraud. The FSS, the nation’s primary financial watchdog, has observed a concerning rise in incidents ranging from illegal private lending and sophisticated voice phishing to complex crypto investment scams. According to The Asia Business Daily, these threats are particularly potent during the summer travel season when more people are out and about, potentially less vigilant, and more susceptible to scams. The proactive stance of the FSS underscores a critical need for robust public education. Unlike traditional financial crimes, crypto scams often leverage the perceived complexity and anonymity of blockchain technology, making them harder for the average person to identify. The sheer volume of reported cases and the significant financial losses incurred by victims have necessitated a nationwide intervention. By launching this campaign, the FSS aims not just to react to incidents but to prevent them, fostering a safer financial environment for all citizens. Understanding the FSS’s Summer Campaign Against South Korea Crypto Scams The FSS’s public awareness campaign is strategically designed to maximize its reach and impact. Here’s a closer look at its key components: Strategic Locations: The campaign is being rolled out at major tourist destinations and airports across South Korea. These high-traffic areas are chosen precisely because they attract a diverse range of people, including locals and international visitors, who might be more relaxed and less cautious while on holiday. Peak Season Timing: Launching during the summer travel season is a deliberate move. Fraudsters often capitalize on periods when people are distracted or in a holiday mood, making them easier targets for schemes that promise quick returns or exploit emotional vulnerabilities. Multi-Faceted Approach: The initiative isn’t just about posters. It involves a comprehensive approach to educating the public about various financial crimes, with a strong emphasis on South Korea crypto scams . This includes: Distributing informational materials. Setting up public information booths. Leveraging media partnerships to disseminate warnings. Potentially engaging with travelers directly to offer advice. Targeted Warnings: While the campaign covers illegal private lending and voice phishing, crypto investment scams are a significant focus due to their growing prevalence and the substantial amounts of money involved. The FSS is working to demystify these scams, making it easier for the public to recognize red flags. The benefits of such a campaign are clear: increased public awareness leads to fewer victims. By empowering individuals with knowledge, the FSS hopes to build a collective defense against financial criminals, making South Korea a more secure place for engaging with both traditional and digital finance. Common Crypto Scams Targeting South Korean Investors (and Beyond) To effectively protect yourself, it’s crucial to understand the common types of South Korea crypto scams that are currently circulating. While tactics evolve, the underlying psychological manipulation often remains the same. Here are some prevalent examples: Fake Investment Platforms/Rug Pulls: Scammers create elaborate websites or apps that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or investment platforms. They promise incredibly high, guaranteed returns. Once a significant amount of money is invested, the scammers disappear, taking all the funds (a ‘rug pull’). Phishing Scams: These involve deceptive communications (emails, SMS, social media messages) designed to trick you into revealing sensitive information like wallet private keys, exchange login credentials, or seed phrases. They often impersonate legitimate companies or individuals. Romance Scams (‘Pig Butchering’): Perpetrators build emotional relationships with victims over time, often through dating apps or social media. Once trust is established, they introduce the idea of a lucrative crypto investment opportunity, guiding the victim to a fake platform where their funds are eventually stolen. Impersonation Scams: Scammers pretend to be government officials (like the FSS itself), law enforcement, or even celebrities, demanding crypto payments for fabricated fines, taxes, or exclusive investment opportunities. Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes: These schemes promise high returns to early investors, paid for by the funds of new investors. They collapse when the influx of new money stops, leaving most participants with losses. Cryptocurrencies are often used to facilitate these schemes, making them harder to trace. Giveaway Scams: Often seen on social media, these scams promise to multiply your crypto if you send a small amount to a specific address. They typically feature fake celebrity endorsements or official-looking branding. These scams often exploit a victim’s desire for financial gain, fear of missing out (FOMO), or even genuine trust. Recognizing the patterns is the first step towards protection. How to Protect Yourself from South Korea Crypto Scams: Actionable Insights While the FSS is doing its part, individual vigilance is your strongest defense against South Korea crypto scams . Here are actionable steps you can take to safeguard your investments and personal information: Verify, Verify, Verify Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing in any crypto project or platform, thoroughly research it. Look for official websites, whitepapers, team transparency, and community sentiment. Be skeptical of projects with anonymous teams or vague roadmaps. Check Official Sources: Always verify information through official channels. If you receive an unsolicited offer claiming to be from a government agency or a well-known company, contact them directly using their publicly listed contact information, not the details provided in the suspicious message. Be Wary of Unsolicited Offers: High-pressure sales tactics, guaranteed returns, or offers that seem ‘too good to be true’ are almost always red flags. Legitimate investments carry risks and rarely promise instant riches. Secure Your Digital Assets Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Use 2FA on all your crypto exchanges, wallets, and email accounts. This adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for unauthorized users to access your accounts even if they have your password. Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Never reuse passwords. Use a password manager to create and store complex, unique passwords for each of your online accounts. Protect Your Private Keys/Seed Phrases: Your private key or seed phrase is the ultimate control over your crypto. Never share it with anyone, store it offline, and be extremely cautious about where you write it down. Recognize Red Flags Here’s a quick comparison to help you distinguish between legitimate opportunities and potential scams: Feature Legitimate Investment Offer Suspicious Investment Offer Returns Realistic, varying, tied to market conditions Guaranteed high returns, “too good to be true” Pressure No pressure, time to research High-pressure sales tactics, “act now or miss out” Transparency Clear whitepapers, team info, audited financials Vague details, anonymous team, no verifiable track record Communication Professional, through official channels Unsolicited DMs, personal accounts, poor grammar Funding Via official platforms, clear payment methods Direct transfers to personal accounts, unusual payment asks Regulation Compliant with financial regulations, licensed Claims to be “unregulated” or “off-shore” for “freedom” What to Do If You Suspect a Scam Stop All Communication: Immediately cease contact with the suspected scammer. Report It: Contact the FSS or local law enforcement. In South Korea, you can report financial fraud to the FSS’s Financial Crime Information Center. Secure Your Accounts: Change passwords, enable 2FA, and move any remaining funds to a secure, new wallet if compromised. The Broader Impact of Combating South Korea Crypto Scams The FSS’s campaign against South Korea crypto scams extends beyond just protecting individual citizens; it has a significant broader impact on the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem and the nation’s financial integrity. By actively combating fraud, South Korea is contributing to: Restoring Investor Confidence: A safer environment encourages more legitimate participation in the crypto market, attracting both retail and institutional investors who might otherwise be deterred by the risks of scams. Promoting a Healthier Ecosystem: By weeding out malicious actors, the FSS helps foster a more trustworthy and sustainable crypto landscape, where innovation can thrive without being overshadowed by illicit activities. Setting a Global Precedent: South Korea’s proactive approach can serve as a model for other nations grappling with similar challenges. Sharing best practices in public awareness and regulatory enforcement is crucial for global financial security. Strengthening Regulatory Frameworks: The campaign also highlights the ongoing need for robust and adaptive regulatory frameworks that can keep pace with the rapidly evolving digital asset space. This initiative is a testament to South Korea’s commitment to creating a secure and transparent financial future for its citizens, encompassing both traditional finance and emerging digital economies. Conclusion: Vigilance is Key in the Fight Against Crypto Fraud The launch of the FSS’s public awareness campaign is a critical step in the ongoing battle against financial crimes, particularly the pervasive threat of South Korea crypto scams . While the summer travel season provides a timely backdrop for this initiative, the lessons and warnings it imparts are evergreen. In a world where digital interactions are increasingly central to our financial lives, vigilance, education, and a healthy dose of skepticism are your most powerful tools. By staying informed, verifying information, and recognizing the tell-tale signs of fraud, you can play an active role in protecting yourself and contributing to a safer, more secure digital financial landscape. Remember, if an offer sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of South Korea’s FSS campaign against crypto scams?

It could be revolutionary in emerging economies with limited access to stable long-term financing. Could fixed-rate lending protocols empower people to take control of their finances? The lending dilemma in developing countries Worldwide, major markets move in sync. When interest rates spike in one market, the whole world feels the ripple effect, even among markets of dramatically different sizes. Every move the United States makes compounds the issue due to the dominance of the US Dollar and the influence of the US Treasury Market, which is the benchmark for global interest rates. The effect goes both ways. Low and lower-middle-income countries are home to approximately four billion people , so their economic malaise – a state of economic stagnation or downturn characterized by persistent inflation or lackluster growth – will inevitably spill over. Their economic development is already below average relative to other nations, heightening tensions. Major lenders are often reluctant to service people living in developing countries because of high perceived risk. These locations are susceptible to economic instability, which impacts long-term mortgage financing and increases loan defaults. The lack of a stable local currency, standardized underwriting practice or credit bureaus complicates the conventional approach. Emerging economies are in a transitional phase of economic development. Relatively high economic growth leads them toward becoming developed nations. Even under these circumstances, mortgage lending remains poorly understood and inaccessible. DeFi poses a solution – fixed-rate lending protocols. How DeFi fixes fixed-rate mortgages Risk-averse centralized institutions with rigid standards dominate traditional lending systems, leaving people in developing countries without access to the funds to purchase a home. Historically, they have been the only option, e ven though their processes tend to be outdated, inefficient and exclusionary. DeFi can potentially democratize homeownership and stimulate the economy by providing an alternative financing solution less susceptible to local market volatility, supporting developing nations and their inhabitants. Blockchain technology simplifies, secures and streamlines financial transactions, benefiting underbanked and unbanked individuals. Research shows it directly correlates to improved economic empowerment, financial inclusion, user satisfaction and trust in financial institutions because it enables better access to financial services. DeFi protocols leverage blockchain technology Conventional mortgage document verification requires time-consuming cross-validation. The title management process is similarly inefficient and prone to human error and fraud. Since property transactions and loan servicing involve multiple parties and extensive paperwork, borrowers are often confused about their loan term, interest rate or outstanding balance. If the lender’s practice is not streamlined, going through conventional channels can take days or weeks. The time-consuming mortgage underwriting process can take weeks, depending on how busy the lender is and whether the underwriter needs more information. In comparison, it takes mere minutes to secure a DeFi loan. DeFi protocols leverage blockchain technology for transparent, accessible and affordable fixed-rate loans, bypassing the inefficiencies and high costs associated with conventional banking. They store all relevant property, payment and personal details in a tamper-resistant ledger to ensure accuracy and fairness. Smart contracts facilitate and automate mortgage contracts. This technology improves verification speed, reduces disputes and eliminates redundancies, enabling institutions to quickly verify documents and offer mortgages. The process is more transparent, enhancing trust among those in developing nations. The benefits of DeFi fixed-rate lending protocols DeFi enables new forms of home ownership and property investment, which are ideal for those in emerging economies. In peer-to-peer lending, for instance, they could earn a 15% annual percentage yield by lending stablecoins through crypto savings accounts or liquidity pools. They could use smart contracts to enforce the payback period, reducing counterparty risk. Asset tokenization enables fractional ownership of loan portfolios, allowing investors to own portions of real estate instead of purchasing it in full. Communities can collect their funds in liquidity pools to help individuals take out mortgages they wouldn’t have been able to get alone. Blockchain technology streamlines and lowers the cost of the mortgage process by making most intermediaries redundant. Traditionally, lenders charge for originating the loan and may also require recipients to pay third-party closing costs for services like appraisals and title insurance. DeFi has low overhead expenses, making the process more cost-effective. The future of fixed-rate DeFi lending Since the blockchain provides an immutable digital ledger, it provides a secure, transparent platform for lenders, borrowers and intermediaries. Leveraging this technology for fixed-rate lending protocols helps reduce confusion and improve reliability, even in uncertain market conditions. It could challenge the traditional mortgage process, reshaping the financial future. Devin Partida is the editor-in-chief of ReHack and is especially interested in writing about fintech.

The DeFi-native Ethereum is steadily stealing the spotlight; only time will tell if the momentum will keep going, albeit there are currently no signs of a slowdown. The Newcomer ETH Strategy, Ethereum’s first autonomous treasury protocol to reimagine Saylor’s MSTR in a DeFi-native context, announced a milestone on X, having raised 12,342 ETH ($46.5M) to date. It only started to accrue the asset this summer. This marked the end of the company’s pre-sale launch, and its on-chain protocol is expected to launch in phases soon. The total capital raised came from 3 sources: private sale, public sale, and puttable warrants. Warrants offer investors the right to sell the company shares back to them at a specific price at a future date. The private sale raised 6,900 ETH, the public one garnered 1,242 Ether, and the warrants accounted for 4,200 of the asset. The tokens will be locked for the next 4-6 months following the token generation event (TGE). The funds will be split into two categories: 11,817 ETH (~$44.6 million) will be allocated towards staking and liquidity, and the remaining 525 ETH (~$1.9 million) will be used for protocol growth and development. According to data collected at the time of writing, ETH Strategy is ranked 21st on StrategicEthReserve. From Bitcoin to Ethereum BTCS Inc. was the first cryptocurrency company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange (formerly AMEX, now NYSE MKT) in 2010 and subsequently went live on the NASDAQ in 2014. It initially operated as a BTC mining firm, and its transition to an ETH treasury began earlier this year. According to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, the company plans to sell shares worth up to $2 billion to fund further cryptocurrency purchases, including ETH. The S-3 statement further notes that the company is authorized to issue 975 million shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 20M shares of preferred stock, each with a nominal value of $0.001. “We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities by us to provide additional funds for purchasing digital assets, working capital, and other general corporate purposes.” BTCS’ prospectus also reads that 5 million common stock shares are to be resold, which are from previously issued convertible notes and warrants. Currently, BTCS Inc. is ranked number 10 on the leaderboard on StrategicEthReserve.

Related Reading: XRP Traders Pull Back $2.4B—Brace For Impact Or Buy The Dip? Crypto analyst Armando Pantoja, a member of the Benzinga Crypto Advisory Board, said he just got off a call with contacts in Washington, D.C. and hinted that XRP is “about to explode.” He couldn’t give details, but he left a clear sign that something big might be on the way. His words “Big Move Incoming” and the tip that holders of at least 1,000 XRP are already ahead of the curve have pushed traders to watch the token more closely. How 1,000 XRP Stands Out According to data from the XRP Rich List, there are about 6.8 million XRP wallets in existence. Close to 6 million of those are retail wallets holding fewer than 1,000 XRP. Only 10% of wallets hold more than 2,438 XRP. Those numbers suggest that owning at least 1,000 coins puts you well above the average holder. Based on analysis, even 3,300 XRP—worth around $9,000 at today’s prices—could place an investor among the top tier of XRP owners. Just got off a call with my insiders in DC… I can’t say much, but $XRP is about to explode. I don’t know exactly when, but soon. If you’ve got 1,000 XRP, you’re already ahead of the curve. This could be the move that changes everything. — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) July 29, 2025 Insider Teases Big Move According to Pantoja’s tweet, the timing of the coming news might be tight. He didn’t spell out when his contacts expect the “explode” moment. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at about $3.14. That makes a 1,000‑token stack cost near $3,000. If Pantoja’s hint proves accurate, early buyers could see strong gains. But the lack of specifics means it’s hard to know whether he’s talking about new rules from US regulators, an institutional deal, or just fueling excitement. Varied Expert Price Targets Some believe XRP could rally more than 300x to exceed $1,000 per token. And some analysts even suggested that price could hit that level as early as next year. For instance, analyst Jake Claver of Digital Ascension Group estimated that 6,000 XRP would generate $300,000 in annual income at a $1,000 price, enough for a comfortable US lifestyle in many areas. If you own any XRP, I believe you’re already ahead of a whole lot of people. The key is defining what “rich” means to you. Here’s a clip from my last stream with @digitaloutlook3 For some, it’s freedom from a 9–5. For others, it’s funding a dream lifestyle with passive income.… pic.twitter.com/zBzWJcKi76 — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) July 22, 2025 On the other hand, other market observers have urged investors to aim for 40,000 or 50k XRP—currently worth over $150,000—while planning for more moderate price goals. Those forecasts differ widely, reflecting both hope and caution in the community. What’s Next For XRP? In the end, Pantoja’s tip and the on‑chain figures give retail holders reason to pay attention. But without clear details from his D.C. contacts, it’s hard to say if this is a signal to buy more or simply another wave of hype.

But in 2025, player behavior is telling a new story. Gamblers are increasingly migrating toward mid-tier platforms that prioritize performance over scale. They’re seeking faster payouts, better odds, and platforms that don’t hide fees or force token conversions. Spartans is quickly gaining traction as one of the smaller casinos attracting this wave of users. The shift suggests that today’s crypto gamblers are less interested in brand size and more focused on streamlined experience and transparent value, a growing trend across the online gambling market. Stake.com: Still Big, But Feeling Slower Stake.com remains a force in the online gambling market. With millions of users and aggressive global campaigns, it’s hard to miss. However, many users are starting to feel the drawbacks of betting at scale. Odds aren’t always the best in class, and during peak traffic periods, site speed and withdrawal times have noticeably slowed. Some users have also expressed frustration over token conversions, where deposits or bets are automatically swapped into Stake’s preferred tokens, resulting in unexpected value loss. While Stake still offers variety and high-roller features, casual and mid-level players are beginning to explore alternatives that offer a smoother experience without platform-imposed friction. The Rise of Mid-Tier Crypto Casinos Across the online gambling market, there’s a growing interest in platforms that don’t dominate the headlines but offer better utility. These smaller platforms are typically more agile, meaning faster processing times, cleaner interfaces, and fewer operational slowdowns. Players are no longer loyal to size; they’re loyal to efficiency. Mid-tier casinos can adjust to user feedback quickly and often implement improvements without long development cycles. In this context, platforms like Spartans have started to win over players who once defaulted to bigger names. With fewer layers of complexity and a user-first design, these platforms are reshaping how players define “value” in crypto betting. Why Spartans Is Leading the Smaller Platform Shift Spartans has positioned itself as a no-nonsense platform designed for real users, not just marketing metrics. One of its most appreciated features is its clean user interface, which avoids the flashy clutter found on many bigger sites. Players can move from game selection to payout in a matter of clicks, without encountering ad walls, token switches, or complex bonus conditions. Unlike some platforms in the online gambling market that route deposits through multiple conversions, Spartans allows players to bet in the tokens they deposit, avoiding hidden spreads or fees. Withdrawal requests are also processed quickly, often in hours, not days, which contributes to its rising popularity among active players. Transparency and Control Are Winning Priorities In 2025, crypto gamblers are more informed and cautious than ever. They value platforms that provide full visibility into transactions, odds structures, and bonuses. Spartans reflects this new priority by offering fixed house edges, real-time balance updates, and clearly stated payout terms. This level of transparency is becoming increasingly rare on larger platforms where promotions often come with dense terms or shifting token policies. In an online gambling market where trust is everything, platforms that reduce ambiguity are thriving. Players don’t want to decode a new system every time they play; they want clarity from the first deposit to the final withdrawal. The New Metric: Payout Speed Over Platform Size Stake.com may have the largest user base, but many of its users are now prioritizing payout speed as a core requirement. Spartans is benefiting directly from this shift. The platform’s streamlined wallet integration and fast transaction confirmations make it ideal for users who want quick access to their winnings. Unlike larger platforms that may delay withdrawals to conduct additional checks or bundle transfers, Spartans processes payouts without unnecessary bottlenecks. This shift from volume-driven platforms to agile services is becoming a key dynamic in the online gambling market. Performance, not hype, is what keeps players returning in 2025. Conclusion The online gambling market in 2025 is evolving, and players are no longer impressed by sheer size or flashy promotions. They want platforms that work quickly, communicate clearly, and respect their time. Stake.com still holds its position as a market giant, but cracks in user satisfaction are opening opportunities for mid-sized platforms to grow, especially ones like Spartans that prioritize function over flash. As players become more selective, this trend of shifting from brand-first to performance-first casinos is only expected to continue. Spartans reflects what the modern player values: speed, clarity, and control. In a market defined by user behavior, that focus makes all the difference.

Cardano’s price target is back in the spotlight after a golden cross reset expectations, putting the $1 level firmly back in play. Uniswap is also showing strength, with its price target now reaching toward $14 after a clean breakout from a long-term bottom pattern. Both coins are building strong technical cases, but the real shift is happening elsewhere. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is leading the charge. Its X1 and X10 miner demo has gone viral, driving 2.5 million app users and pushing presale totals beyond $355 million. This is more than just a trend. It is traction. Uniswap Sets Sight on $14 as Volume Surges Uniswap (UNI) is gaining traction after breaking out of a rounding bottom formation, pushing past former resistance at $9.20. Now trading around $10.24, UNI has flipped that level into strong support. The uptick in trading volume during the breakout suggests rising interest, which adds confidence to the new bullish setup. If current momentum holds, the next resistance area between $12.00 and $14.00 comes into focus. However, a slip below $9.00 would invalidate this bullish outlook. For now, the Uniswap price target remains positive, supported by market sentiment and steady volume strength. Cardano Golden Cross Builds Case for $1 Rally Cardano (ADA) is showing bullish potential after a golden cross formed on its daily chart. The short-term moving averages have crossed above the 200-day line, helping push ADA to a four-month high of $0.94. It is now consolidating near $0.80, which marks a critical support zone. If ADA maintains this level, a push toward the $1.00 to $1.10 range becomes more realistic. The MACD has begun to flatten while the RSI holds at 63, indicating some cooling in momentum. However, with open interest still climbing, the Cardano price target remains optimistic if buyers defend the current range. BlockDAG’s Viral Miner Demo Sparks 2.5M User Surge and $355M Milestone BlockDAG is proving that early traction does not need an exchange listing to be real. Following the highly anticipated demo of its X1 mobile miner and X10 hardware device, adoption numbers have soared across the board. This pairing allows users to amplify their mining output from 10 BDAG to 200 BDAG coins daily, a leap that captured widespread attention and pushed ecosystem engagement to new highs. The impact was immediate. The X1 miner app has now surpassed 2.5 million global users, placing it among the most downloaded crypto tools of 2025. Hardware sales have also climbed fast, with over 18,650 X10 units sold and $7.6 million generated in revenue. This wave of user adoption highlights that BlockDAG is not just trending; it is being used. That momentum carries over into presale performance. The project has now raised $355 million and sold more than 24.4 billion BDAG coins across 29 batches. With real-world usage already visible, BlockDAG is securing a lead that most presales never reach. What continues to fuel this surge is the GLOBAL LAUNCH release price of $0.0016, which remains active until August 11. This rate is significantly lower than the $0.0276 batch price and confirmed $0.05 listing price, offering a 3,025% upside that is driving serious market attention. Closing Remarks The Uniswap and Cardano price targets show promise, but technical patterns alone have not been enough to create real conviction in this market. While these projects wait for stronger momentum, BlockDAG continues to gain ground with real adoption that most coins only see after listings. Its miner ecosystem has exploded following the X1 and X10 demo, with over 2.5 million daily users now active. The presale has already pulled in more than $355 million, and the special $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release price remains live until August 11. With a 3,025% ROI window still open, BlockDAG is setting the new standard.

Many are no longer chasing hype, they’re focusing on which networks have real activity, reliable mechanics, and a strong upside. That’s where picks like Cold Wallet, XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana start to shine. These aren’t just known names. They’re coins with strong metrics, user bases, and movement. If you’re filtering through the noise for the top crypto coins 2025, you need coins that give back value and aren’t just speculative assets. Whether it’s cashback, utility, or strong DeFi activity, these coins tick boxes that others don’t. Let’s break down what makes each of these worth watching, especially Cold Wallet, which flips the wallet experience on its head. 1. Cold Wallet – Cashback-First Utility Built for Active Users Cold Wallet is breaking the mold by flipping the idea of what wallets should do. Most wallets charge you fees to use crypto. Cold Wallet gives them back. Every time you swap, send, or ramp in or out of fiat, you get rewarded in CWT tokens. And at the top tier, users can get up to 100% of gas fees returned in CWT, without needing to stake or lock up tokens. Just use the wallet and get rewarded. It’s a powerful incentive if you’re done with watching ETH disappear on every transaction. The presale is now live at $0.00924, with 150 dynamic pricing tiers. Early buyers get cheaper entry, and 4 billion tokens are set aside for public sale. What really sets it apart though is product design, it’s made for everyday users, not just speculators. That means smooth UX, real-time rewards, and a clean bridge between using your funds and earning from them. If you’re scouting the top crypto coins 2025, this is a no-brainer. With 25% of tokens dedicated to cashback, Cold Wallet is built to sustain its reward model long-term. It’s not about locking funds or mining, it’s about real usage. And in 2025, usage is king. 2. XRP – Big Transfers, Bigger Rebounds XRP was under pressure late July after a whale transferred $175 million to an exchange. But instead of collapsing, it held the line. After dipping to $3.14 on July 25, it started climbing, hitting $3.27 by July 28. What this shows is simple: demand is there. XRP’s rebound wasn’t random. It was backed by high-volume trading across multiple exchanges. In fact, volume topped $500 million on the 28th, and buyers stepped in right near the support zone. There’s also the broader context. XRP is one of the few coins with both institutional adoption and fast, low-cost transfers. That’s why it’s still relevant. And with strong defense around the $3.10–$3.15 mark, there’s upside potential as confidence returns. The structure is there, so is the user base. If you’re narrowing down your picks for top crypto coins 2025, XRP earns a spot based on activity and bounce-back strength. 3. Dogecoin – Range Holding and Volume Spikes Dogecoin isn’t just surviving, it’s holding a tight and active range. From July 25 to 28, it traded between $0.231 and $0.243, showing support near $0.237 and resistance close to $0.244. It may seem like small movement, but the important part is consistency. Volume has surged during intraday moves, crossing 718 million in trade volume. That kind of activity signals real interest, especially at this price level. DOGE has always relied on community and volume over fundamentals. But it’s doing more now. It’s behaving like a range-bound asset that traders are actually playing. That means smart positioning, not just blind pumps. And with price targets for August pushing up to $0.281, there’s a strong setup if breakout confirmation lands. Among the top crypto coins 2025, Dogecoin deserves a mention for staying liquid, relevant, and technical enough to matter this late in the cycle. 4. Solana – Strength Above $180, Ready for $200 Solana is regaining momentum after consolidating for weeks. Between July 25 and 28, SOL moved from around $182.68 to $192.41, backed by daily volumes ranging from $4 to $8 billion depending on the exchange. That kind of liquidity keeps Solana in the game for big buyers and institutional interest. And it’s not just about volume. Price action is forming a steady grind upward, with some traders eyeing a return to $200–$210 soon. Solana’s long-term growth case hasn’t changed, it still leads on high-speed, low-fee transactions. What’s changed is the consistency in performance. With a strong community, DeFi ecosystem, and NFT pipelines, SOL has use cases that matter in 2025. Add the fact that it’s bouncing cleanly off technical levels, and it’s clear why this coin belongs in any discussion of the top crypto coins 2025. If sentiment holds, it could punch above $200 and keep going. The Final Take Every coin in this list brings something to the table. XRP is holding strong above $3. Dogecoin is packing in volume and tight-range moves. Solana is climbing steadily with real volume backing it up. But only one flips the entire system, Cold Wallet. It doesn’t just store your crypto. It gives you up to 100% back on gas fees, just for using it. With a live presale price of $0.00924 and a full reward engine already planned out, CWT is built for daily usage, not just speculation. And that’s the point. In 2025, the top crypto coins 2025 won’t just be tokens that promise things, they’ll be the ones already delivering. Cold Wallet is one of the few doing that right now. From its clean interface to its real-time cashback model, it’s giving crypto users exactly what they’ve wanted for years. For anyone scanning the market for the best reward-driven coin, this should be your first stop.

ETH is now rising and might soon aim for a move toward the $4,000 zone. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,740 and $3,800 levels. The price is trading above $3,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it remains supported above the $3,800 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Fresh Gains Ethereum price started a downside correction from the $3,940 level, like Bitcoin . ETH price declined below the $3,900 and $3,800 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,515 swing low to the $3,940 high. Finally, the price spiked below $3,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It tested the $3,680 support zone . The bulls protected the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,515 swing low to the $3,940 high. The price is again rising above the $3,750 level. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $3,880 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,920 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,940 level. A clear move above the $3,940 resistance might send the price toward the $3,980 resistance. An upside break above the $3,980 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,050 resistance zone or even $4,120 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,880 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,800 level. The first major support sits near the $3,720 zone. A clear move below the $3,720 support might push the price toward the $3,680 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,565 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,500. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

But while BNB remains a top performer, smart money is turning toward two under-the-radar altcoins, Remittix and Sui. Both projects offer real-world utility and early-stage upside, with analysts forecasting possible 5–10x returns. As the market shifts, these tokens are emerging as serious contenders for 2025. BNB Price Prediction: Binance Coin Breaks Higher With Momentum Building Binance Coin (BNB) just tapped $851.98 before pulling back slightly to $843.57, still riding 7% higher on the day and up 12% over the week. Despite being near its all-time high, the rally feels steady, not a short-term pump. Volume spiked 260%, and open interest is up 33%, with whales cutting stablecoin reserves to re-enter the market. Quiet but strong, this looks like accumulation. BNB’s technicals back it up: RSI sits at 72.42, and it’s holding above all major moving averages. On-chain data and the Chaikin Oscillator suggest inflows remain solid. Analysts now say BNB price prediction could hit $1,000 this quarter, with some long-term calls placing BNB Price above $1,200 by year’s end. Still, for investors chasing bigger multiples, tokens like Remittix and Sui (SUI) are catching eyes. With strong narratives and product rollouts ahead, they could outpace BNB’s growth and deliver the next 100x crypto gains this cycle. Analysts Predict 5x Returns for Sui Price After Pullback Sui (SUI) is currently trading at $3.95 after dipping 8.1% in the last 24 hours. Trading volume is also down nearly 17%. Despite the drop, the token still posted a modest 7-day gain of 2.51%, offering a glimpse of underlying strength. Analysts say Sui’s recent rejection at $4.25 signals a key resistance, but breaking that level could unlock a larger move. CryptoPulse flagged the failed breakout attempt as critical, while GemXBT noted bearish pressure below the 20-day moving average. Momentum indicators remain mixed—RSI nears oversold, yet MACD lags behind. Key support now sits at $4.00, with a slip below likely dragging the price toward $3.60. That said, many still view Sui price prediction as a sleeper hit in the making. If it rebounds, analysts believe it could outperform BNB Price action and mirror the same kind of surge Remittix is now preparing for. Remittix Targets XRP’s Legacy With a Cleaner Path While Binance Coin (BNB) shows steady growth potential, analysts believe the real breakout potential lies with Remittix, a PayFi altcoin built for global money movement. Unlike meme coins or AI projects that have lost billions this year, Remittix focuses on solving real problems—fast, affordable international payments. The platform already raised $17.8 million from over 575 million token sales at $0.0876, showing investor demand for function over fluff. Remittix’s upcoming wallet beta on September 15th is expected to push adoption even further. Analysts say it mirrors the early utility that sent XRP soaring, but with none of the regulatory baggage. Strategic partnerships and financial integrations are already taking shape, giving Remittix a solid foundation for 5–10x growth. Remittix Wallet enters beta on September 15 Over $17.8M raised from real utility-focused investors Solves a $19T global payment problem with crypto Targets markets where XRP and Litecoin face adoption hurdles The $250,000 Remittix Giveaway continues to draw attention as more investors shift toward long-term utility.

The price is now attempting a recovery and might aim for a move above the $3.1650 level. XRP price is attempting to start a fresh increase from the $3.00 zone. The price is now trading below $3.180 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3.150 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

The mention gained traction after crypto researcher SMQKE shared a screenshot of the document on X, drawing attention to Ripple’s presence. Ripple was listed in a timeline featured in the “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” report, tracking the evolution of cryptocurrency and digital asset adoption. The mention appears in a multi-phase chart mapping the industry’s development from 2008 to the present, with projections extending beyond 2025. Ripple mentioned in the White House Crypto Report. pic.twitter.com/Kuin6nto2l — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 30, 2025 The timeline validates what many in the XRP community have long argued. They believe Ripple is one of the foundational players in the history of cryptocurrency. Positioned under the “First Trading” segment spanning 2011 to 2013, Ripple is listed alongside other prominent early platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp. This period marks what the report calls “the early years,” when Bitcoin began its ascent and altcoins started to emerge. Early Recognition and Market Foundations Ripple’s appearance during this foundational phase is not incidental. According to the report, the 2011 to 2013 era was defined by the emergence of trading infrastructure, increased miner activity, and the introduction of early altcoin ecosystems. Ripple, which was founded in 2012, fits squarely into that context. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The company introduced XRP to the public , and many investors flocked to it because of its numerous advantages over Bitcoin. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) introduced a consensus mechanism distinct from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work. It focuses on enabling fast and cheap transactions. Some in the crypto community also believe XRP’s code was written before Bitcoin , potentially giving the asset a more foundational role in the market. Since then, Ripple and XRP have grown significantly. They are both playing prominent roles in the crypto sector and the global cross-border payments market. 2025 and Beyond More revealing is the projection segment labeled “2025 & Beyond,” which outlines expected developments in the crypto sector’s future. Here, the focus shifts to stability, regulation, and increased institutional integration, leading to broader adoption and the rise of tokenization and stablecoins. Ripple and XRP can play major roles here, as XRP is an attractive asset to institutional investors and a big name in the tokenization space . XRP also has regulatory clarity, as the court ruling in July 2023, which determined it is not a security, sets it apart from other assets. Ripple has become a major player in the stablecoin space through RLUSD , and this recognition could indicate that XRP’s role in the financial digital future is no longer in question.

Over 655 million tokens have found homes with 14,600 holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding a wave of demand, promising early buyers a shot at life-changing returns by 2026. Mutuum Finance presale nears tipping point Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is underway and selling out fast. The current price sits at $0.035, but that window is shrinking. Soon, phase 7 will launch, pushing the price up 14.3% to $0.04. At launch, the token will hit $0.06, locking in a 71% return for today’s buyers. This steady climb reflects growing trust in the project. Moreover, the team has rolled out a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders. Those who hold their spots will snag bonus tokens, adding extra incentive. The project’s dual lending system is drawing serious attention. It blends Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models for flexibility. A fully collateralized stablecoin on Ethereum is also in the works. This mix of utility and security is fueling the presale’s momentum. Investors are rushing to grab tokens before prices climb higher. Security and utility drive Mutuum Finance forward The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has finalized a CertiK audit with flying colors. The audit delivered a 95.00 security score, signaling rock-solid protection. No flaws turned up in the smart contracts. Zero security incidents have occurred in the past 90 days. To keep it tight, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. It offers $50,000 in USDT rewards, split across four tiers based on severity. This move shows the team’s focus on safety. Beyond security, utility shines through. The Peer-to-Contract model uses smart contracts for automated lending. Dynamic interest rates keep things stable. The Peer-to-Peer setup lets users lend directly, perfect for volatile assets. A $100,000 MUTM giveaway is also heating up excitement. Ten winners will each score $10,000 in tokens. Entry requires a $50 presale investment and completing simple steps like submitting a wallet address. Price targets signal massive gains by 2026 Analysts are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for a breakout. The token’s launch price of $0.06 already promises a 71% ROI from $0.035. Post-launch, the outlook gets wilder. A $3 target by 2026 would deliver an 8,471% return from today’s price. This isn’t just guesswork; it’s grounded in the project’s robust lending and stablecoin plans. Compare that to Cardano (ADA) in 2020-2021. ADA dipped to $0.017 in March 2020, then rocketed to $3.10 by September 2021. That’s a 17,135% surge in 18 months. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has sharper tools than ADA did back then. Its lending models tackle real DeFi needs. Security outclasses many peers. If it mirrors even half of ADA’s run, early investors could see retirement-worthy gains. The crypto market favors projects with substance, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits that mold. Consequently, its $3 target by 2026 looks within reach. Retire early with Mutuum Finance gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining steam as phase 6 races toward a sellout. The $0.035 altcoin offers a clear path to profit with a $0.06 launch price. Its lending systems and stablecoin plans signal long-term value. Security measures like the CertiK audit add trust. The $3 price target by 2026 could turn small stakes into big wins. Investors keen on the crypto market’s next gem should explore the presale now. Joining takes just a wallet address and a $50 minimum buy. Don’t wait—phase 7 looms with higher prices.

Investors are weighing whether Dogecoin can hit $0.5 soon or if Mutuum Finance will outshine it with its DeFi innovations. Both tokens are sparking interest, but their paths differ sharply. Dogecoin nears key levels amid uptick Dogecoin is climbing steadily, trading at $0.239 with a 5% rise in 24 hours. Analysts note its rebound from $0.22 support, targeting $0.30 resistance. Crypto expert Ali pointed out that surpassing $0.25 could propel it further. Little sell pressure exists between $0.25 and $0.36, per data analysis. If support holds at $0.26, a move to $0.46 might follow. Moreover, technical signals back this outlook. The RSI sits at 60.96, showing room to grow. The MACD reflects positive momentum with a green histogram. Yet, Dogecoin faces hurdles. Breaking $0.30 has proven tough historically. A failure to clear $0.25 could see it retreat to $0.22. Reaching $0.5 soon seems ambitious given past resistance. Consequently, its trajectory hinges on sustained buyer interest. For now, Dogecoin offers a familiar option in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance presale accelerates in Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing rapidly through its presale, now in Phase 6 of 11. The current price stands at $0.035, up 250% from the $0.01 starting point. Phase 6 is selling out fast, signaling high demand. Once completed, Phase 7 will raise the price 14.3% to $0.04. At launch, MUTM will list at $0.06, securing buyers a 71% return from today’s rate. Separately, $13,700,000 has been raised since the presale began, with over 655 million tokens sold and 14,600 holders joining. The project’s lending model sets it apart. It blends Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer systems for flexibility. Users retain full asset ownership, a draw for DeFi enthusiasts. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score. No vulnerabilities surfaced in the smart contract review. A $50,000 USDT bug bounty program with CertiK reinforces this focus. The team also launched a dashboard, rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens. Mutuum Finance unveils broader vision Beyond lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is crafting a robust ecosystem. A fully collateralized stablecoin is in development, pegged to USD on Ethereum. This will stabilize lending and staking activities. Additionally, Layer 2 solutions are being built to cut gas fees and boost scalability. The mtToken system lets users earn interest on deposits, tradable within the platform. Token buybacks will reward stakers, cycling revenue back to holders. Further, a $100,000 MUTM giveaway is underway, splitting the prize among 10 winners. Entry requires a $50 presale investment. Post-launch, MUTM could reach $3 in 2025, per tokenomics projections. This offers a hefty return from the $0.06 listing price. Such potential outpaces Dogecoin’s near-term prospects, appealing to crypto investment seekers. Weighing crypto predictions for gains Investors are pondering if Dogecoin (DOGE) can break $0.5 soon or if Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will steal the spotlight as the next crypto to explode. Dogecoin’s climb is notable, yet resistance looms large. Conversely, Mutuum Finance offers immediate returns and long-term utility. Phase 6’s $0.035 price won’t last, making it a top crypto to buy now. Join the presale and tap into DeFi’s rising tide.

The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with groundbreaking news: asset management titan BlackRock has significantly expanded its Ethereum (ETH) holdings, solidifying its position as a major player in the digital asset space. This isn’t just another investment; it’s a monumental endorsement from one of the world’s largest financial institutions, signaling a pivotal shift in how traditional finance views decentralized assets. The implications of BlackRock’s ETH acquisition reverberate across the entire crypto ecosystem, from market sentiment to future institutional adoption. What Does BlackRock’s Massive ETH Stake Truly Mean? According to detailed insights from Arkham Intelligence, shared widely across platforms like X, BlackRock recently made a substantial purchase of $375 million worth of ETH this week alone. This latest acquisition dramatically boosts their total Ethereum portfolio, bringing their cumulative holdings to an astonishing 2.46% of the entire Ethereum supply. To put that into perspective, this translates to an estimated $11.32 billion in ETH under BlackRock’s management. This staggering figure underscores not just the scale of their investment, but also their conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Such a significant stake by a firm of BlackRock’s caliber sends a clear message: Ethereum is no longer a fringe asset but a legitimate, strategic component of a diversified investment portfolio. This move by BlackRock into ETH further cements the institutional embrace of digital assets. How Does BlackRock’s ETH Investment Validate the Crypto Space? BlackRock’s deep dive into Ethereum serves as a powerful beacon of institutional validation for the broader cryptocurrency market. For years, crypto assets struggled to shed their ‘wild west’ image, often dismissed by traditional finance due to volatility and perceived lack of regulation. However, when an institution with over $10 trillion in assets under management, like BlackRock, makes such a decisive move, it fundamentally alters this narrative. Enhanced Legitimacy: BlackRock’s involvement lends immense credibility to Ethereum and the crypto space. It signals to other institutional investors, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds that digital assets are becoming a viable, even attractive, investment class. Capital Inflow: The sheer volume of BlackRock’s investment highlights the potential for massive capital inflows from traditional finance. This influx can provide greater liquidity and stability to the market, reducing the dramatic price swings often associated with cryptocurrencies. Reduced Volatility: As more institutional money enters the market, the overall market capitalization grows, potentially leading to more mature and less volatile price action for assets like ETH. Wider Adoption: BlackRock’s move paves the way for increased retail and institutional adoption, as their stamp of approval can alleviate concerns for more cautious investors. This scenario mirrors the transformative impact seen with the approval and success of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, many of which BlackRock also manages. The entry of such a financial giant suggests a growing comfort level with the regulatory and operational complexities of managing digital assets, setting a precedent for others to follow, particularly concerning BlackRock ETH holdings. Beyond Bitcoin: Why is Ethereum Attracting BlackRock’s Gaze? While Bitcoin often captures headlines as ‘digital gold,’ Ethereum offers a fundamentally different, yet equally compelling, value proposition that clearly resonates with institutions like BlackRock. Ethereum is not merely a cryptocurrency; it is the foundational layer for an entire ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), often referred to as Web3. Smart Contract Powerhouse: Ethereum pioneered smart contracts, self-executing agreements whose terms are directly written into code. This innovation underpins decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless other blockchain-based applications, creating a vibrant and growing economy. DeFi and NFTs: The explosion of DeFi, which aims to replicate traditional financial services without intermediaries, and the booming NFT market, which enables digital ownership, largely runs on Ethereum. These sectors represent significant growth opportunities that traditional investors are keen to tap into. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Transition: Ethereum’s successful transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with ‘The Merge’ significantly reduced its energy consumption, making it a more environmentally friendly asset. This aligns with increasing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) mandates for institutional investors. PoS also offers staking yields, providing a potential passive income stream for large holders like BlackRock. Scalability Roadmap: While Ethereum has faced scalability challenges, its ongoing development roadmap, including sharding and the proliferation of Layer 2 solutions, promises enhanced transaction speeds and lower fees, addressing key concerns for enterprise-level adoption. BlackRock’s decision to accumulate such a substantial amount of ETH indicates a strategic belief in Ethereum’s long-term utility, its technological superiority for decentralized applications, and its potential to reshape global financial infrastructure. This strategic accumulation of BlackRock ETH is a testament to Ethereum’s potential. Are There Any Hurdles with BlackRock’s ETH Dominance? While BlackRock’s significant ETH stake is largely positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations that arise with such concentrated institutional ownership. Centralization Concerns: When a single entity holds a substantial portion of an asset’s supply, it can raise concerns about centralization. While Ethereum’s network is decentralized, a large holder could theoretically influence governance proposals or market dynamics. However, BlackRock’s role is primarily as an asset manager, acting on behalf of clients, which mitigates some of these concerns. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional involvement inevitably attracts more attention from regulators worldwide. While this can lead to clearer guidelines, it also means greater scrutiny on how these assets are managed, reported, and taxed. BlackRock, being a highly regulated entity, navigates these waters carefully, which could set standards for others. Market Impact and Transparency: While large institutional buys can stabilize the market, they can also cause short-term price volatility if trades are not executed carefully. The transparency offered by blockchain analytics firms like Arkham Intelligence helps shed light on these movements, but the sheer size of these holdings warrants ongoing observation. Custody and Security: Managing billions of dollars in digital assets requires sophisticated custody solutions and robust security protocols to prevent hacks or loss. BlackRock’s choice of custodians and security measures will be critical benchmarks for the industry. These challenges are not insurmountable and are often part of the maturation process for any emerging asset class. BlackRock’s participation, with its inherent regulatory compliance and operational rigor, can actually help address some of these issues by setting best practices for managing BlackRock ETH and other digital assets. What’s Next for BlackRock ETH and the Crypto Market? BlackRock’s substantial ETH acquisition is more than just a headline; it’s a potential harbinger of a new era for institutional engagement with Ethereum and the broader crypto market. What can we expect moving forward? Accelerated Institutional Adoption: BlackRock’s move is likely to inspire other major asset managers, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries to seriously consider adding ETH to their portfolios. The ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) combined with the comfort of seeing a giant like BlackRock lead the way could unlock unprecedented capital flows. Spot Ethereum ETF Potential: The growing institutional interest, spearheaded by BlackRock, significantly increases the likelihood of a Spot Ethereum ETF being approved by regulators like the SEC. A successful Bitcoin Spot ETF paved the way, and ETH’s strong fundamentals and institutional backing make it a prime candidate. An ETH ETF would provide an even more accessible and regulated avenue for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum. Impact on ETH Price and Ecosystem: Continued institutional accumulation could lead to a significant long-term appreciation in ETH’s price, driven by increased demand and reduced circulating supply in the open market. Furthermore, this influx of capital and legitimacy could fuel further development within the Ethereum ecosystem, leading to more innovative dApps, improved infrastructure, and greater network utility. Actionable Insights for Investors: For individual investors, BlackRock’s move underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of Ethereum. While it’s tempting to follow big players, always remember to conduct your own thorough research (DYOR). Consider ETH as a long-term investment, understanding its role as the backbone of Web3. Diversification remains key, and staying informed about regulatory developments and technological advancements within the Ethereum network is crucial. The continued growth of BlackRock ETH holdings will be a key indicator for future market trends. BlackRock’s strategic accumulation of 2.46% of the total Ethereum supply marks a truly monumental moment for the cryptocurrency industry. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a profound vote of confidence from one of the world’s most influential financial institutions, signaling Ethereum’s undeniable rise as a mainstream asset. This significant BlackRock ETH stake validates the crypto space, paves the way for further institutional adoption, and underscores Ethereum’s unique position as the backbone of decentralized finance and Web3. While challenges exist, the overall trajectory points towards a future where digital assets play an increasingly vital role in global portfolios. The era of institutional crypto is not just arriving; it’s here, and BlackRock is leading the charge with Ethereum. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does BlackRock’s 2.46% ETH holding mean?

Both assets present unique opportunities, yet Mutuum Finance’s innovative DeFi framework contrasts with XRP’s established payment focus. This article explores their potential for investors. Mutuum Finance presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing swiftly through its presale, now in phase 6 at $0.035 per token. This stage, selling out rapidly, marks a 250% price surge from the initial $0.01 in phase 1. Investors purchasing now secure a guaranteed 71% return at the $0.06 launch price, with phase 7 set to increase 14.3% to $0.04. Analysts project a post-launch value of $2.50, offering a potential 7000% return. The project has raised $13,700,000, with over 655 million tokens sold to 14,600 holders. This robust demand underscores Mutuum Finance’s appeal in the crypto investment space. Furthermore, its utility-driven model sets it apart. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi innovation A dual-lending model that combines peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer systems is being pioneered by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The peer-to-contract architecture ensures user stability by automating lending with dynamic interest rates via the use of smart contracts. On the other hand, direct, adaptable financing is made possible by the peer-to-peer model, which is perfect for assets that fluctuate. Compared to centralized solutions, this flexibility improves user control and transparency. To lower depegging risks, Mutuum Finance is also creating a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. This stablecoin will increase ecosystem liquidity and facilitate transactions. As a result, Mutuum Finance provides a useful DeFi solution that appeals to investors looking for trustworthy cryptocurrency investments. Mutuum Finance’s security and rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. No security incidents occurred in the past 90 days, reinforcing trust. The team launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, rewarding critical, major, minor, and low-severity findings. Additionally, a $100,000 MUTM giveaway splits prizes among 10 winners, requiring a $50 presale investment to enter. A new dashboard also tracks the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. These initiatives highlight Mutuum Finance’s commitment to security and community engagement, strengthening its position in crypto investing. Ripple’s market volatility Ripple (XRP) recently experienced a sharp correction, dropping 14% from $3.65 to $3.09 after a rally past its 2018 peak. A massive sell-off on Upbit, involving 75 million XRP, triggered $90 million in liquidations, clearing 30% of leveraged positions. The $3.00 level now serves as critical support, with trading volume indicating buyer interest. Technical indicators, like the Dragonfly Doji, suggest potential bullish momentum if XRP holds above $2.80. However, failure to maintain this could see prices test lower supports at $2.57. This volatility underscores the risks in XRP’s crypto investment profile compared to Mutuum Finance’s structured growth. Weighing future potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a top crypto to buy now, blending innovative lending, a secure stablecoin, and strong investor incentives. Its presale’s rapid progress and guaranteed 71% launch return make it a compelling choice. Ripple (XRP), while established, faces challenges from market volatility and leverage-driven corrections. Investors eyeing crypto investments should consider Mutuum Finance’s phase 6 opportunity before prices rise.

Certain key metrics like trading volume, platform assets, and user accounts all saw double-digit growth, as Kraken expanded its product suite to include US equities, FX perpetual futures, and tokenized blue-chip stocks through its new xStocks initiative. Meanwhile, Robinhood's crypto revenue soared 98% to $160 million, boosted by its aggressive push into real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. CEO Vlad Tenev explained more about the firm's ambition to lead the RWA space, and pointed to Robinhood’s massive user base and infrastructure as competitive advantages. Robinhood recently launched its Robinhood Chain in Europe and began issuing equity-like tokens for private companies, though regulatory scrutiny has already emerged. Despite challenges, both firms are betting big on the convergence of traditional and digital finance. Kraken Earnings Slide Kraken reported $411.6 million in revenue for the second quarter of 2025, which was an 18% increase compared to the same period last year. Despite the revenue growth, the exchange saw a 7% decline in adjusted earnings, which fell to $79.7 million from $85.5 million in Q2 2024. The company attributed this dip in adjusted earnings partly to broader macroeconomic uncertainties, including the impact of US tariffs. However, Kraken also explained that it is currently in “Build mode,” and is prioritizing long-term growth over short-term profitability. Kraken Q2 highlights (Source: Kraken ) The crypto exchange posted impressive gains across several operational metrics. Trading volume climbed 19% year-over-year to $186.8 billion, while assets held on the platform surged 47% to $43.2 billion. Funded accounts also rose by 37%, reaching 4.4 million. Kraken’s share of the stablecoin-to-fiat market grew quite a bit, and raised from 43% to 68%. Kraken’s second-quarter report was shared as the company seeks to raise $500 million at a $15 billion valuation ahead of a potential public listing in 2026. Additionally, the firm introduced a series of new products to diversify beyond crypto trading. This includes the rollout of US equities trading for most US-based users via its app, enabling integrated management of both stocks and digital assets. Kraken also launched 24/7 FX perpetual futures in April and unveiled xStocks in June—which is a collection of tokenized blue-chip equities and ETFs. Announcement from Kraken The company’s foray into tokenized equities is part of a trend that forms part of the growing convergence between traditional finance and the crypto sector. Kraken is not alone in this pursuit. Bybit recently announced partnerships for similar offerings, and Coinbase is actively seeking SEC approval to list tokenized stocks, Traditional brokers are also getting involved. eToro revealed plans to tokenize the 100 most popular US-listed stocks and ETFs as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. Robinhood Crypto Revenue Surges Meanwhile, Robinhood’s crypto revenue surged 98% year-over-year to $160 million in the second quarter of 2025, driven by a sharp rise in trading activity and the company’s growing focus on real-world asset tokenization. Total net revenue increased 45% to $989 million, while net income more than doubled to $386 million. Despite the strong performance, shares of the trading platform retraced slightly in after-hours trading. Crypto trading volumes rose 32% to $28 billion as the crypto market cap climbed to $3.36 trillion. Robinhood Q2 2025 financial results (Source: Robinhood ) CEO Vlad Tenev shared some details about the company’s long-term commitment to tokenizing real-world assets, and called it the most important innovation in the industry over the past decade. He said that Robinhood aims to unlock access to hard-to-reach assets like private shares, venture capital funds, and real estate—sectors that are traditionally out of reach for retail investors due to regulatory and liquidity barriers. This vision is central to Robinhood’s strategy after its recent $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, which is expected to play a key role in the rollout of its tokenization platform. The company also recently launched Robinhood Chain, a layer-2 blockchain focused on stock tokenization in Europe, and has already begun issuing private equity tokens resembling shares in companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. Since unveiling the platform in Cannes, France, Tenev said there’s been a surge of interest from developers eager to tokenize their own assets or participate in the broader RWA movement. However, this rapid expansion raised some important regulatory questions. Authorities in Lithuania reportedly launched an inquiry into the tokenized products, and OpenAI publicly distanced itself from the equity-like tokens circulating under its name. Despite the scrutiny, Tenev argued that Robinhood is uniquely positioned to lead the tokenization market, especially due to its 25 million US users and $1 trillion in assets under custody. He pointed out that no other firm—either in traditional finance or the crypto-native world—matched Robinhood’s reach or ambition in this space. While competitors focus on building chains for speculative trading, Tenev believes the opportunity in tokenizing real-world assets is largely untapped. Although Ethereum currently dominates the RWA landscape with close to $7 billion in tokenized assets, and ZKsync Era trails behind with $2.4 billion, Tenev sees Robinhood’s user base and regulated infrastructure as key differentiators that could help it outscale public blockchain platforms.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-31 05:30:00

This $0.0085 Token Is Turning Heads Fast,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/top-sui-and-solana-alternative-this-july-this-0-0085-token-is-turning-heads-fast/,"While SUI and Solana remain top assets in the crypto space, they may not be the only ones worth watching this July. Traders seeking high-upside alternatives quickly turn to Unilabs Finance , a rising DeFi project gaining serious momentum. With over $30 million in Assets Under Management (AUM), this $0.0085 crypto is being tipped as the next big breakout token. SUI Network Gains Traction as DeFi Growth Accelerates Momentum is building around the SUI network as its DeFi ecosystem records a new milestone. Total value locked recorded a high of $2.22 billion on July 28. This rapid growth marks a significant step forward for the ecosystem and reflects rising developer and investor activity. The token has also seen solid gains, climbing over 35% in the past month. With on-chain data remaining healthy and interest continuing to grow, the outlook for SUI remains positive. Many see this as a sign of increasing adoption and possibly leading up to further price growth. Source: CoinCodex Backing this sentiment, Mill City Ventures has revealed a $450 million private placement dedicated to acquiring SUI tokens. The company plans to allocate 98% of the funds to token purchases via market and foundation-backed deals. This makes it the first publicly listed firm to hold the asset as a core treasury asset. While SUI and Solana continue to attract headlines, some investors are exploring newer projects. Unilabs Finance is gaining attention for its advanced tools and potential to deliver fast returns. Solana Slips as SEC Delay Shakes Market Confidence Solana’s impressive 22% rally last month has started to cool off. The token has slipped 10% in the past week, currently trading around $177, a notable drop from its recent high. Source: CoinCodex This slowdown is primarily tied to the SEC’s latest delay in deciding on Grayscale’s Solana Trust. The watchdog has postponed the decision to October 10 alongside several other ETF decisions, dampening short-term sentiment. Still, market analysts remain optimistic, placing about 82% odds on eventual approval. Meanwhile, the REX-Osprey SOL ETF has already seen over $100 million in net inflows, showing that institutional appetite for SOL is real. If Grayscale’s Solana Trust gets the green light, a significant wave of interest could follow. But for now, with Solana cooling and SUI seeing sideways action, traders are turning to faster-growing opportunities like Unilabs Finance making waves this July. Unilabs Finance Gains Fast: Could It Be the Next Big Token? Unilabs Finance is quietly becoming one of the fast-rising platforms in the crypto space. The project stands out as the first dedicated asset management platform powered by AI. It aims to help investors access high potential assets without needing technical jargon. Moreover, Unilabs Finance already holds over $30 million in Assets Under Management (AUM). This rapid growth shows that many investors trust the platform’s AI-driven tools to guide their crypto decisions. One of the platform’s standout features is its Early Access Scoring System. This tool can rank new crypto projects based on key factors making it easier for users to access early-stage tokens with big upside potential. For those who prefer safer, more predictable returns, Unilabs offers a Stablecoin Savings Account. This feature would allow users to deposit stablecoins like USDT into secure, fiat-pegged pools. In return, users can earn interest without dealing with the price swings of most crypto assets. It’s ideal for investors looking to protect their capital while earning passively. So far, the project has raised over $7.2 million in its ongoing presale. Currently in stage 5, each UNIL token is available at just $0.0081. Many experts believe Unilabs Finance could deliver significant gains this July, with some saying it could even outperform high-profile tokens like SUI and Solana. Conclusion SUI continues to surge with strong on-chain growth and institutional support. Despite short-term setbacks, Solana remains in the spotlight as ETF decisions loom. But as attention shifts to faster-moving opportunities, Unilabs Finance is quickly becoming a standout contender. Selling at just $0.0085, Unilabs is quickly emerging as a top pick this July. Investors seeking returns should secure the UNIL tokens now before the window of opportunity closes.

These bold moves often signal a shift in corporate financial strategies, embracing the potential of decentralized currencies. A prime example of this evolving landscape comes from South Korea, where Bitmax, a company listed on the KOSDAQ exchange, has recently made headlines by substantially increasing its Bitcoin holdings . This isn’t just a simple purchase; it’s a calculated decision that reflects a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its role in modern corporate treasuries. Bitmax’s Strategic Leap: Bolstering Bitcoin Holdings According to reports from the Seoul Economic Daily, Bitmax has executed a noteworthy acquisition, adding an impressive 56.04 BTC to its existing portfolio. This latest purchase is not merely an incremental increase; it pushes the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to a substantial 500.1 BTC. For a KOSDAQ-listed entity, this level of commitment to a volatile asset like Bitcoin speaks volumes about their long-term vision and belief in its potential. This strategic move has also had a tangible impact on Bitmax’s standing in the global corporate arena. The company proudly announced that this acquisition has elevated its position in the global rankings of publicly listed firms holding Bitcoin, moving up one spot from 50th to 49th place. While a single spot might seem minor, it represents consistent growth and a deliberate effort to establish itself among the pioneering companies embracing digital assets. Such incremental advancements contribute to a company’s profile as an innovator and a forward-thinking entity in the investment community. Key Figures of Bitmax’s Bitcoin Holdings: Latest Acquisition: 56.04 BTC Total Bitcoin Holdings: 500.1 BTC Global Ranking Improvement: From 50th to 49th place Exchange Listing: KOSDAQ (South Korea) Why Are Companies Increasing Their Bitcoin Holdings? The Strategic Imperative Bitmax’s decision to expand its Bitcoin holdings is not an isolated incident but rather part of a broader, global phenomenon. More and more companies, from tech giants to traditional finance firms, are exploring or actively integrating Bitcoin into their balance sheets. But what drives this seemingly unconventional strategy? Several compelling factors contribute to this trend: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, many corporations view Bitcoin as a potent hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative to traditional assets that may be susceptible to inflationary pressures. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin is increasingly seen as ‘digital gold’ – a store of value that can preserve wealth over the long term. Companies are recognizing its potential to appreciate in value, offering a new avenue for capital growth beyond conventional investments. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Holding a diversified portfolio is a cornerstone of sound financial management. By adding Bitcoin to their treasury, companies can reduce their reliance on traditional cash reserves and fixed-income assets, potentially enhancing overall portfolio resilience. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Leadership: Investing in Bitcoin signals a company’s willingness to embrace technological innovation and adapt to the evolving financial landscape. This can enhance brand perception, attract new talent, and appeal to a growing segment of investors who are bullish on digital assets. Enhanced Investor Appeal: For many investors, a company’s exposure to Bitcoin can be a positive indicator of its future-readiness and growth potential. Companies with significant Bitcoin holdings often attract a new class of investors interested in the crypto space. The Broader Landscape of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: A Global Trend Bitmax joins a growing list of publicly traded companies that have strategically integrated Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. While MicroStrategy is perhaps the most well-known pioneer in this space, with its massive and ongoing acquisitions, other notable names include Tesla, Block (formerly Square), and Marathon Digital Holdings. Each of these companies, in their own way, has validated Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate balance sheets. The cumulative effect of these corporate acquisitions is significant. It not only removes a substantial amount of Bitcoin from the circulating supply, potentially contributing to price appreciation, but also lends an air of legitimacy and institutional acceptance to the entire cryptocurrency market. As more companies disclose their Bitcoin holdings , it encourages others to consider similar strategies, creating a positive feedback loop that strengthens Bitcoin’s position in the global financial system. Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Opportunities in Corporate Bitcoin Holdings While the benefits of holding Bitcoin can be substantial, companies venturing into this space must also be acutely aware of the challenges. It’s not a decision to be taken lightly, and it requires careful consideration of various factors. Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, with significant price swings that can impact a company’s balance sheet. Quarterly earnings reports, for instance, might show considerable fluctuations due to the mark-to-market accounting of crypto assets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies must navigate a patchwork of regulations, tax implications, and potential future legislative changes that could affect their Bitcoin holdings . Security Risks: Storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Custody solutions, whether internal or external, need to be ironclad. Accounting and Reporting: The accounting treatment for cryptocurrencies can be complex, often requiring companies to treat them as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which can lead to impairment charges if the price drops. Public Perception and Investor Reaction: While some investors applaud crypto adoption, others might view it as too risky, potentially leading to scrutiny or negative sentiment. Opportunities: Significant Capital Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has shown a long-term upward trend, offering the potential for substantial returns that can boost a company’s financial strength. Pioneering Advantage: Early adopters gain a first-mover advantage, establishing themselves as leaders in digital asset integration and potentially attracting talent and partnerships within the blockchain ecosystem. Enhanced Liquidity: As Bitcoin’s market capitalization grows, so does its liquidity, making it easier for companies to buy and sell large quantities without significant price impact. Future Financial Innovation: Holding Bitcoin can open doors to new financial services, decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities, or even blockchain-based business models. What’s Next for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings and the Market? Bitmax’s latest move serves as a compelling indicator of where corporate finance might be heading. As the digital economy matures, we can expect more companies to follow suit, driven by the same strategic imperatives that motivated Bitmax. This trend could lead to several significant developments: Increased Institutional Adoption: The continued accumulation of Bitcoin holdings by public companies will likely encourage more institutional investors and traditional corporations to enter the market, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a mainstream asset. Market Maturation: As more large entities hold Bitcoin, it could contribute to greater market stability and reduce some of the extreme volatility currently observed. Development of New Financial Products: The growing demand for corporate crypto solutions will spur the development of more sophisticated custody services, hedging instruments, and accounting frameworks tailored for digital assets. Regulatory Clarity: As corporate adoption grows, regulators will be compelled to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks, which could reduce uncertainty and foster even wider adoption. Conclusion: A Bold Statement in the Digital Age Bitmax’s strategic decision to significantly boost its Bitcoin holdings is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving nature of corporate finance and the increasing relevance of digital assets. As a KOSDAQ-listed company, its actions resonate not only within South Korea but also across the global financial landscape, signaling a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset for corporate treasuries. This move underscores a broader trend where forward-thinking companies are proactively seeking new avenues for growth, diversification, and inflation protection in an unpredictable economic climate. Bitmax’s climb in the global rankings is a testament to the fact that embracing innovation, even in the form of volatile digital assets, can yield strategic advantages and position a company for future success. As the digital revolution continues, the story of corporate Bitcoin holdings , spearheaded by companies like Bitmax, will undoubtedly be a defining chapter in the financial narrative of the 21st century. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Bitmax and why is its Bitcoin acquisition significant? Bitmax is a company listed on South Korea’s KOSDAQ exchange. Its acquisition of an additional 56.04 BTC, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 500.1 BTC, is significant because it demonstrates a growing trend of publicly traded companies integrating digital assets into their corporate treasuries, validating Bitcoin’s role as a strategic investment. 2.

What are the main challenges for companies holding Bitcoin? The main challenges include Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility, which can impact balance sheet reporting; the evolving and often uncertain regulatory landscape; the critical need for robust security measures to protect digital assets; and the complexities associated with accounting and tax treatment of cryptocurrencies. 4.

Overall revenue climbed to $989 million, with profit hitting $386 million. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is pushing to tokenize private equity and real estate to broaden investor access. Still, the stock edged lower in after-hours trading. Robinhood earns more from crypto as trading and users increase Robinhood’s crypto revenue rose 98% year-over-year to $160 million in the second quarter of 2025 due to a 32% increase in crypto trading activity. The total crypto trading volume reached $28 billion, while the total market capitalization increased by 21.7% to reach $3.36 trillion during the same period. The company earned more from its digital asset operations than ever, thanks to its ability to attract more users and expand its services. Robinhood added $7 billion in institutional trading volume to its books in just one month by acquiring one of the world’s oldest and most widely licensed crypto exchanges, Bitstamp, in June. Robinhood also received an immediate path to expanding its crypto services worldwide as the exchange brought with it over 50 regulatory licenses across major global markets. The deal strengthened the company’s position with regulators and paved the way for more cross-border products that previously would have taken years to launch on their own. It also allowed Robinhood to fast-track new offerings such as crypto staking in the US and tokenized stock trading for European users. Robinhood’s strong crypto performance climbed to $989 million for the quarter (45% jump in total net revenue), while the net income more than doubled to $386 million. However, despite its impressive earnings, the company’s stock dipped slightly in after-hours trading. Such market reactions are common when investors have already priced in high expectations. The company also showed both asset growth and increased user deposits as its total platform assets nearly doubled to $279 billion. The number of funded customer accounts shows more people are joining and actively using the platform because it registered a 10% year-over-year increase by reaching 26.5 million. The company’s business model is evolving beyond simple stock trades as its premium offering, Robinhood Gold, also hit a record 3.48 million subscribers during the quarter. CEO Tenev expands tokenization to make private assets easier to invest in Tenev has placed tokenization at the center of the company’s long-term strategy . He called it “the biggest innovation our industry has seen in the past decade,” and believes the shift will make real-world assets available to everyday investors. To implement his plan, Tenev launched Robinhood Chain (a layer-2 blockchain designed to support tokenizing stocks and other real-world assets). The chain is active in Europe, enabling users in 30 countries to trade tokenized versions of US stocks. Robinhood works closely with regulators to bring similar offerings to the US market. The company also wants to expose investors to big firms’ success without buying traditional shares. It has begun offering private equity tokens in Europe, modeled after well-known companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. OpenAI quickly warned that the tokens don’t represent real ownership in the company. Lithuania’s financial regulator also raised questions about whether the tokens comply with securities laws in the region by launching a legal inquiry into the nature of Robinhood’s offerings. Robinhood plans to expand its technology stack and serve more users across North America by acquiring WonderFi (a Canadian crypto and DeFi platform). It will also likely announce new partnerships, products, and strategic updates during its second annual HOOD Summit in September. Get seen where it counts.

Despite that, markets powered forward on the back of strong tech earnings, a steady hand from the Federal Reserve, and signs that traders weren’t rattled by the latest White House decision. According to data from CNBC, S&P 500 futures jumped 0.94%, Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 1.34%, and contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 132 points, or 0.3%, in early morning trading. The sharp moves came right after Microsoft and Meta Platforms both posted better-than-expected earnings after the close Wednesday. Shares of Microsoft surged 8%, while Meta climbed 11% in extended trading. Microsoft told investors that annual revenue from its Azure cloud unit crossed $75 billion, while Meta offered a third-quarter forecast that exceeded analysts’ projections. Both are members of the so-called Magnificent Seven, a label used to track the group of top-performing tech giants. Trump’s tariffs hit India and South Korea while Asia pulls back Markets in Asia-Pacific traded mostly lower Thursday as investors processed Trump’s fresh round of tariffs and a steady policy decision from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). The Japanese central bank left its short-term interest rate unchanged at 0.5%, its fourth straight meeting without a change. That call had been widely expected, but the reaction across asset classes was mixed. The Japanese yen appreciated 0.49% against the US dollar, trading at 148.77, while yields on Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) rose slightly across maturities. The 10-year yield increased by 1 basis point to 1.571%, the 5-year rose 1.6 basis points to 1.091%, the 20-year yield ticked up to 2.550%, and the 30-year yield rose just over 1 basis point to 3.096%. Trump’s new tariff structure includes a 15% blanket rate on imports from South Korea and 25% duties on goods from India, alongside an extra, undefined “penalty”. That triggered a quick reaction from both stock and currency markets. India’s Nifty 50 index dropped 0.56%, while the BSE Sensex slid 0.97% by 9:25 a.m. in Mumbai. In South Korea, auto stocks were hit hard, even as Samsung Electronics saw its shares rise, despite second-quarter profits coming in below expectations. Meanwhile, Nissan Motor, based in Japan, posted a $530 million operating loss for the first quarter of its fiscal year. Still, its stock rose, a reaction analysts tied to improving forward guidance. Europe steadies as investors await more earnings In Europe, indexes showed signs of early optimism. Futures data from IG pointed to a mild gain at the open. London’s FTSE 100 was seen up 0.1%, Germany’s DAX projected a 0.2% gain, and Italy’s FTSE MIB aimed for a 0.3% rise. France’s CAC 40 was expected to open flat. This came a day after European markets closed mixed on Wednesday. With second-quarter earnings season heating up across the region, investors were moving sector by sector. A heavy schedule of corporate results is lined up for Thursday, including Unilever, Shell, BMW, Sanofi, Renault, SocGen, Anglo American, Credit Agricole, and ArcelorMittal. Other names expected to report include London Stock Exchange Group, Euronext, AF-KLM, and Anheuser-Busch InBev. While markets braced for those earnings, investors were also watching the Federal Reserve closely. At its meeting yesterday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, but it wasn’t a unanimous call. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and Governor Christopher Waller both voted against the hold, preferring a more aggressive stance. When asked during a press conference whether the Fed was considering another rate move in September, Chair Jerome Powell said plainly, “We’ve made no decisions.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Specifically, Dogecoin whales , those colossal holders of vast amounts of the popular meme coin, have made a significant splash. This isn’t just a ripple; it’s a wave: these influential entities collectively acquired a staggering 310 million DOGE in a mere 24-hour window. This massive accumulation, highlighted by prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez on X, sends a powerful signal across the market. But what exactly does such a large-scale purchase by Dogecoin whales signify? Is it a precursor to a price surge, a strategic consolidation, or something else entirely? Understanding the motivations and potential ramifications of these colossal transactions is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile yet exciting waters of cryptocurrency. Who Are These Dogecoin Whales and Why Do Their Movements Matter So Much? In the vast, dynamic ocean of cryptocurrencies, “whales” are the colossal figures – individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of a particular digital asset. For Dogecoin, these are often defined as addresses possessing over a billion DOGE. Their sheer volume of holdings grants them an undeniable capacity to influence market dynamics, acting as gravitational forces within the ecosystem. When Dogecoin whales make significant moves, such as the recent acquisition of hundreds of millions of coins, it immediately captures the attention of the entire market. Why? Because their actions are often interpreted as a strong signal, a glimpse into the minds of those with the deepest pockets and, arguably, the most sophisticated market insights. Here’s why their movements are so closely watched: Market Impact: Their large trades, whether buying or selling, can directly affect the delicate balance of supply and demand, potentially leading to noticeable price fluctuations. A large buy can absorb significant sell pressure, while a large sell can flood the market. Sentiment Indicators: Whale activity is frequently viewed as a powerful barometer for overall market sentiment. Substantial purchases often suggest a robust confidence in future price appreciation, while significant sell-offs could indicate a waning belief in the asset’s short-term prospects. Liquidity Provision: Whales play a crucial role in providing liquidity to the market, enabling larger trades to occur without causing drastic and immediate price swings. Their presence can make a market more robust. Strategic Insights (Speculative): While highly speculative, some analysts attempt to infer strategic moves or even ‘insider’ knowledge from patterns in whale behavior. This adds a layer of intrigue and urgency to tracking their activities. Narrative Influence: In the world of meme coins like Dogecoin, narratives are powerful. Whale movements can feed into existing narratives or even create new ones, influencing broader investor perception. Unpacking the Staggering 310 Million DOGE Acquisition: What Prompted This Buying Frenzy? The recent report from Ali Martinez, a prominent and respected voice in the crypto analysis community, specifically highlighted that addresses holding more than 1 billion Dogecoin collectively added an astounding 310 million DOGE to their portfolios within a single 24-hour period. This isn’t just a casual purchase; it represents a substantial sum, translating into tens of millions of dollars at current market valuations, signifying a serious capital allocation by these mega-holders. So, what could be the underlying motivations driving such an aggressive accumulation of DOGE by these influential whales? Several factors, often intertwined, might be at play: Anticipation of Future Catalysts: Whales might be strategically positioning themselves ahead of anticipated positive news or significant developments. This could include potential integrations of Dogecoin into major payment platforms (like the rumored expansion of payment features on X), or broader market-wide rallies that tend to lift all boats, including Dogecoin. Perceived Undervaluation: Despite its past rallies, whales might perceive Dogecoin as currently undervalued relative to its long-term potential or its previous highs. They could be viewing recent price levels as an opportune entry point to accumulate more at a discount, aiming for substantial gains in the future. “Buy the Dip” Strategy: During periods of market consolidation, slight price corrections, or broader bearish sentiment, whales often employ a “buy the dip” strategy. This involves increasing their holdings at lower average costs, a classic accumulation tactic. Bet on Community Strength and Hype: Dogecoin, despite its meme coin origins, boasts one of the most vibrant, passionate, and loyal communities in the entire cryptocurrency space. This strong community, often fueled by figures like Elon Musk, contributes significantly to its resilience and cultural relevance. Whales might be betting on this sustained community support and its potential to drive future adoption, utility, and ultimately, value. Strategic Partnerships or Utility Developments: While often kept under wraps until official announcements, there could be whispers or early indications of new developments, technological upgrades, or strategic partnerships involving Dogecoin that are known to these large holders. These could be related to actual utility, such as payment processing or decentralized applications. This aggressive buying suggests a strong conviction among these large holders regarding Dogecoin’s immediate or long-term prospects. What Does This Massive Dogecoin Accumulation Signal for the Market? When Dogecoin whales make such a decisive move, the ripple effects can be felt across the entire market. While no single event guarantees future price action, such significant accumulation often suggests a bullish outlook from those with the deepest pockets and, arguably, the most sophisticated market insights. Here’s a breakdown of potential signals and their implications: Potential Positive Signals Potential Considerations/Challenges Increased Confidence: Large buys indicate whales believe in Dogecoin’s future potential. Market Manipulation: Whales can sometimes buy to inflate prices, then sell, leading to volatility. Demand Pressure: Increased buying reduces available supply, which can push prices up. Short-Term vs. Long-Term: Whale moves might be short-term plays, not indicative of sustained growth. Market Stability: Large holders can act as anchors during downturns, buying dips. Centralization Concerns: Large holdings by a few entities can raise questions about decentralization. Catalyst for Retail: Whale activity often inspires smaller investors to follow suit, creating momentum. “Pump and Dump” Risk: While not always the case, significant buys can precede coordinated dumps. This surge in buying activity could be interpreted as a strong vote of confidence, potentially laying the groundwork for increased price stability or even an upward trend for Dogecoin . However, it’s crucial to approach such signals with a balanced perspective. Navigating the Waters: Actionable Insights for DOGE Holders For current DOGE holders and prospective investors, the actions of Dogecoin whales provide undeniably valuable data points, offering a glimpse into significant capital movements. However, it is paramount to understand that these movements should never be the sole or primary basis for your personal investment decisions. Whales operate with different capital, risk tolerance, and often, different objectives. Here are some actionable insights and best practices to consider when evaluating such news: Do Your Own Research (DYOR) Diligently: While whale movements are intriguing and can spark market interest, always conduct thorough, independent research. Dive deep into Dogecoin’s underlying fundamentals, its ongoing development roadmap, the strength and activity of its community, and broader market trends. Understand its use cases, even if primarily as a payment coin. Implement Robust Risk Management: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile and unpredictable. It is crucial to never invest more capital than you are genuinely prepared to lose. Consider employing risk mitigation strategies such as setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downsides, and always diversify your investment portfolio across different assets to spread risk. Resist FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): The temptation to blindly jump into a trade simply because whales are buying can be overwhelming. However, resist this urge. Their financial capacity and strategic objectives are vastly different from those of most individual retail investors. What works for a whale might not work for you. Monitor Broader Market Trends: Dogecoin’s price action is not isolated. It is heavily influenced by the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, particularly the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as prevailing macroeconomic factors like inflation rates, interest rate decisions, and global economic stability. Define Your Investment Horizon: Clearly articulate whether you are a long-term holder with a multi-year outlook or a short-term trader looking for quick gains. Your investment strategy should be meticulously aligned with your personal financial goals, risk appetite, and time horizon, rather than being swayed by immediate whale activity. Stay Informed from Reputable Sources: Beyond social media whispers, rely on credible news outlets, reputable crypto analysts, and official project channels for information. Cross-reference data and be wary of sensationalized headlines. By adopting these principles, you can make more informed and resilient investment decisions in the dynamic crypto landscape. While the recent whale activity for Dogecoin is undoubtedly exciting and indicative of strong institutional or large-holder interest, it’s essential to acknowledge the inherent challenges and complexities of the crypto market. Whale movements, while often interpreted as bullish signals, do not guarantee future performance or a sustained upward trend. The market is susceptible to various external factors: Unpredictable Whale Behavior: Whales can be unpredictable. They might accumulate for a period and then offload their holdings, potentially causing sharp price corrections, sometimes referred to as “whale dumps.” Market Manipulation Concerns: The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few large holders can raise concerns about potential market manipulation. While not always the case, it’s a risk factor in less regulated markets. Broader Market Volatility: Dogecoin’s price is highly correlated with the overall crypto market. A significant downturn in Bitcoin or the broader economy can pull Dogecoin down, irrespective of individual whale actions. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving regulations in different jurisdictions can introduce uncertainty and impact investor sentiment, potentially overriding positive signals from whale activity. Technological Developments: While Dogecoin has a stable network, the broader crypto space is constantly innovating. New technologies or competing meme coins could shift investor interest. Therefore, investors should remain vigilant, adaptable, and prioritize a comprehensive understanding of the market over single data points. The recent acquisition of a staggering 310 million DOGE by Dogecoin whales is undeniably a significant event, sending ripples of discussion and speculation across the entire cryptocurrency community. It powerfully highlights the continued, substantial interest and potential strategic positioning by some of the largest players within the Dogecoin ecosystem. While this aggressive buying activity might be interpreted as a strong bullish signal, suggesting confidence from those with considerable influence, it simultaneously underscores the paramount importance of informed, independent decision-making for every investor. As the fascinating and often unpredictable Dogecoin journey continues, keeping a watchful eye on the movements of these powerful entities, while rigorously conducting your own diligent research and adhering to sound risk management principles, will be absolutely key to navigating its dynamic market successfully. The whales have made their move; now it’s up to individual investors to interpret and react wisely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Dogecoin whale? A1: In the cryptocurrency world, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. For Dogecoin, this often means an address holding over a billion DOGE, giving them significant influence over market dynamics. Q2: Why did Dogecoin whales buy 310 million DOGE in 24 hours? A2: While their exact motivations are private, potential reasons include anticipating future positive news (like new integrations or partnerships), believing Dogecoin is undervalued, employing a “buy the dip” strategy during market consolidation, or betting on the sustained strength of Dogecoin’s community and potential utility. Q3: Does this whale activity guarantee Dogecoin’s price will rise? A3: No, significant whale activity does not guarantee a price increase. While it often signals confidence from large holders and can create demand pressure, the crypto market is influenced by many factors including broader market trends, regulatory changes, and overall investor sentiment. Whale moves can also be short-term strategies. Q4: How can I track Dogecoin whale movements? A4: You can track large transactions by monitoring blockchain explorers for Dogecoin, or by following crypto analytics platforms and reputable analysts on social media (like Ali Martinez mentioned in the article) who specialize in on-chain data analysis. However, interpreting this data requires expertise. Q5: Is Dogecoin a good investment after this whale activity? A5: The decision to invest in Dogecoin, or any cryptocurrency, should be based on your own thorough research (DYOR), understanding of the risks involved, and alignment with your personal financial goals. While whale activity can be a positive signal, it should be just one of many factors you consider, not the sole reason for investment. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Have you ever wondered who truly holds the reins in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency? While retail investors make headlines, the quiet movements of significant players often dictate the market’s pulse. Recent data reveals a fascinating trend: Bitcoin whales , those colossal holders of digital wealth, have been on an extraordinary accumulation spree. This isn’t just a minor blip; it’s a strategic maneuver that could reshape the market’s trajectory. Let’s dive deep into what this means for Bitcoin and its future. The Unprecedented Surge: How Much Are Bitcoin Whales Accumulating? According to insights from Santiment, a leading on-chain analytics firm, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoin (BTC) have collectively amassed a staggering 218,570 BTC since late March. To put that into perspective, this represents a significant chunk of the total Bitcoin supply being scooped up by a relatively small group of entities. These large holders now command an impressive 68.44% of the entire circulating Bitcoin supply. Magnitude of Accumulation: Over 218,000 BTC acquired in a short span. Dominance: These wallets now control nearly 70% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Timeframe: The accumulation phase began in late March, suggesting a strategic entry point. This substantial accumulation by Bitcoin whales is more than just a statistic; it’s a powerful indicator of confidence. When entities with such deep pockets decide to increase their holdings, it often signals a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, potentially hinting at an impending price surge or a perceived market bottom. Why Do Bitcoin Whales Accumulate? Decoding Their Strategic Moves Understanding the motivations behind the actions of Bitcoin whales is crucial for any market participant. These aren’t impulsive decisions; they are calculated plays based on extensive research, market analysis, and a long-term vision. Several factors could be driving this current accumulation: 1. Long-Term Conviction and Halving Anticipation Many Bitcoin whales are long-term holders, often referred to as ‘HODLers’ (Hold On for Dear Life). They view Bitcoin as digital gold and a hedge against inflation. The recent accumulation could be a pre-halving strategy, anticipating the supply shock and potential price appreciation that historically follows Bitcoin’s halving events. 2. Institutional Inflows and ETF Impact The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various regions have opened the floodgates for institutional capital. Large corporations, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds are now able to gain exposure to Bitcoin more easily. Some of these institutional players could be contributing to the whale accumulation, either directly or through their custodians. 3. Macroeconomic Uncertainty and Risk Aversion In times of global economic instability, rising inflation, and geopolitical tensions, traditional assets might seem less appealing. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and limited supply, is increasingly seen as a safe haven asset by sophisticated investors. Bitcoin whales might be accumulating to de-risk their portfolios from traditional financial systems. 4. Anticipation of Future Innovation and Adoption Beyond price, whales often invest in the underlying technology and ecosystem. They might be anticipating significant advancements in Bitcoin’s scalability (e.g., Lightning Network), increased utility, or broader global adoption, positioning themselves to benefit from future growth. The Ripple Effect: How Do Bitcoin Whales Influence Market Dynamics? The movements of Bitcoin whales have a profound impact on the broader cryptocurrency market. Their actions can create significant ripple effects, influencing price, liquidity, and overall market sentiment. Price Volatility and Liquidity When whales accumulate, they remove significant amounts of Bitcoin from exchanges, reducing the available supply and potentially driving up prices if demand remains constant or increases. Conversely, if a large whale decides to sell, it can flood the market with supply, leading to sharp price drops. This creates volatility, which can be both an opportunity and a risk for smaller investors. Market Sentiment and Confidence The accumulation trend by Bitcoin whales often acts as a bullish signal for the market. When retail investors see large players buying, it instills confidence and can encourage more buying activity, creating a positive feedback loop. This collective sentiment can push prices higher, demonstrating the psychological impact of whale movements. Understanding Market Cycles Whales often buy during periods of market fear or consolidation, when prices are relatively low, and sell during periods of euphoria when prices are high. This contrarian approach allows them to maximize profits. Their current accumulation suggests they might perceive the current market conditions as an opportune buying window, indicating a potential shift from a bearish or neutral phase to a bullish one. Are There Challenges or Risks Associated with Bitcoin Whale Activity? While whale accumulation can be a bullish sign, it’s important to acknowledge the potential challenges and risks associated with such concentrated ownership: 1. Centralization Concerns Although Bitcoin is decentralized by nature, the concentration of a large portion of its supply in the hands of a few entities raises questions about potential centralization of influence. A small number of wallets holding a significant percentage could theoretically exert considerable control over market direction. 2. Market Manipulation Potential While direct market manipulation is illegal and difficult to prove, the sheer volume of assets held by Bitcoin whales means their buy or sell orders can significantly impact price. A coordinated move by a few whales could create artificial price swings, potentially disadvantaging smaller, less informed investors. 3. Sudden Dumps and Liquidation Events The risk of a large whale suddenly liquidating a significant portion of their holdings always looms. Such an event, often triggered by unforeseen circumstances or a strategic shift, could lead to a sharp and rapid decline in Bitcoin’s price, causing widespread panic and losses for other investors. Actionable Insights for the Average Investor: Navigating the Whale Waters So, what does this accumulation by Bitcoin whales mean for you, the everyday crypto enthusiast or investor? Here are some actionable insights: Long-Term Perspective: Whales typically operate with a long-term horizon. Emulating this patience and focusing on Bitcoin’s fundamentals rather than short-term fluctuations can be beneficial. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider a DCA strategy. Invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, to average out your purchase price over time. This mitigates the risk of buying at a peak. Don’t Panic Sell: Resist the urge to sell during market dips. If whales are accumulating, they often see dips as buying opportunities, not reasons to exit. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is a cornerstone, a diversified portfolio across various cryptocurrencies and asset classes can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain metrics and analyses from reputable sources like Santiment. Understanding whale movements can provide valuable context for your own investment decisions. Conclusion: A Resounding Vote of Confidence in Bitcoin’s Future The recent, significant accumulation of over 218,000 BTC by Bitcoin whales is a compelling narrative playing out in the cryptocurrency markets. It underscores a powerful belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value and future potential, particularly as institutional adoption grows and macroeconomic uncertainties persist. While their movements can introduce volatility and concentration risks, the overall message from these dominant players appears to be one of profound confidence. For the discerning investor, understanding these whale behaviors offers a unique lens through which to view the market, reinforcing the idea that patience, strategic thinking, and a long-term outlook remain paramount in the ever-evolving world of digital assets. This ongoing accumulation could very well be a precursor to Bitcoin’s next major upward trajectory, making it an exciting time to be observing the market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a ‘Bitcoin whale’? A Bitcoin whale refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin. While there’s no universally agreed-upon threshold, it typically refers to wallets holding 1,000 BTC or more, though in this article, Santiment’s definition of 10-10,000 BTC is used for this specific accumulation. Q2: Why is Bitcoin whale accumulation considered important? Whale accumulation is important because it signifies strong confidence in Bitcoin’s future price and utility from large, often sophisticated investors. Their buying power can significantly reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially leading to price increases due to basic supply and demand economics. Q3: Does whale accumulation guarantee a price increase for Bitcoin? No, whale accumulation does not guarantee a price increase. While it is often a bullish signal and can precede upward price movements, market dynamics are complex and influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic events, regulatory changes, and broader market sentiment. It’s an indicator, not a guarantee. Q4: How can I track Bitcoin whale movements? You can track Bitcoin whale movements using on-chain analytics platforms like Santiment, Glassnode, CryptoQuant, or Whale Alert. These platforms provide data and insights into large transactions and wallet balances, helping you understand significant movements in the market. Q5: Should I invest based solely on Bitcoin whale activity? While whale activity provides valuable insights, it should not be the sole basis for your investment decisions. It’s crucial to conduct your own research, understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, consider your own financial goals and risk tolerance, and potentially consult with a financial advisor.

Validity, a name synonymous with robust blockchain solutions, has just made an exciting announcement that could redefine how decentralized exchanges (DEXs) operate. They are gearing up to launch their latest product, Cryptoswap , a decentralized exchange with a groundbreaking twist: all revenue generated from swap fees will be funneled directly back into buying VAL, Validity’s native token, from the open market. This isn’t just another DEX; it’s a strategic move designed to create a sustainable, value-accruing ecosystem for the VAL token. What is Cryptoswap and Why Does it Matter? At its core, Cryptoswap is a decentralized exchange, meaning it allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without the need for an intermediary like a centralized exchange. This offers a higher degree of security, privacy, and control over your assets. But what sets Validity’s Cryptoswap apart from the myriad of DEXs already in existence? The key differentiator lies in its unique tokenomics model. Most DEXs generate revenue from trading fees, which often go to the platform’s treasury or liquidity providers. Validity is taking a different approach, committing 100% of these swap fees to a buyback program for its VAL token. This mechanism is designed to: Create Constant Buying Pressure: As long as trades occur on Cryptoswap , there will be a continuous demand for VAL tokens. Reduce Circulating Supply: Bought-back tokens can be burned or held in a treasury, effectively reducing the number of tokens available in the market. Enhance Token Value: With increased demand and potentially reduced supply, the VAL token’s value is expected to be positively impacted over time. Align Incentives: This model directly aligns the success of the Cryptoswap platform with the value proposition for VAL token holders. This innovative approach could set a new standard for sustainable tokenomics in the DeFi landscape, offering a compelling reason for traders and investors alike to engage with the platform. How Does the VAL Token Buyback Mechanism Work on Cryptoswap? The concept is elegantly simple yet powerfully effective. When you execute a trade on Cryptoswap , a small fee is typically incurred. Instead of this fee going into Validity’s operational budget or being distributed elsewhere, it will be automatically routed to a smart contract designed to purchase VAL tokens directly from the market. This process is transparent and automated, ensuring that the stated commitment is always fulfilled. Imagine a perpetual motion machine for token value. Every transaction, every swap, every bit of activity on Cryptoswap directly contributes to strengthening the VAL token’s position. This creates a virtuous cycle: Users trade on Cryptoswap , generating fees. Fees are used to buy VAL tokens from the market. Buying pressure increases, potentially driving up VAL’s price. A higher VAL price attracts more users and liquidity to Cryptoswap . More activity leads to more fees, restarting the cycle. This model is a strong signal of Validity’s commitment to its community and the long-term viability of the VAL ecosystem. It’s a clear demonstration of a project putting its token holders first, fostering a sense of shared success. Why is a Buyback Strategy So Powerful for Crypto Projects? Token buybacks are a well-known strategy in traditional finance, often used by companies to boost shareholder value. In the crypto world, this mechanism can be even more impactful due to the often-volatile and speculative nature of digital assets. A consistent buyback program, especially one funded by direct platform revenue, offers several powerful advantages: Demonstrates Confidence: It signals that the project team believes their token is undervalued and is willing to invest in its future. Reduces Supply Pressure: By removing tokens from circulation, it can counteract inflation and reduce selling pressure. Increases Scarcity: Over time, a continuous buyback can make the token scarcer, which historically tends to increase value, assuming demand remains stable or grows. Boosts Investor Morale: Knowing that a project is actively working to enhance token value can build strong community support and investor confidence. Sustainable Growth Model: Unlike one-off events, a revenue-funded buyback creates a self-sustaining economic loop that grows with the platform’s adoption. For the VAL token, this means that every successful trade on Cryptoswap is a direct investment back into the token’s ecosystem, creating a powerful incentive for both users and long-term holders. What are the Potential Challenges and How Might Cryptoswap Address Them? While the buyback model is incredibly promising, no venture in the crypto space is without its potential hurdles. Understanding these challenges is crucial for a balanced perspective: Liquidity: A DEX’s success heavily relies on sufficient liquidity. Attracting and maintaining deep liquidity pools for various trading pairs on Cryptoswap will be vital. Validity will need robust incentives for liquidity providers. Competition: The DEX market is highly competitive, with established players like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and SushiSwap. Cryptoswap will need to differentiate itself not just through its tokenomics but also through user experience, security, and unique features. Market Volatility: The crypto market is notoriously volatile. While buybacks can create upward pressure, they might not entirely negate broader market downturns. However, they can provide a buffer during such times. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for DeFi and DEXs could pose challenges. Validity will need to remain agile and compliant with emerging regulations. Validity’s reputation for building secure and reliable blockchain infrastructure could be a significant advantage in overcoming these challenges. Their focus on a strong value proposition for the VAL token, combined with a user-friendly interface and robust security measures, will be key to Cryptoswap ‘s long-term success. Looking Ahead: The Future Impact of Cryptoswap on DeFi The launch of Cryptoswap represents more than just a new product for Validity; it signifies a potential shift in how decentralized exchanges are designed to benefit their native tokens and communities. By directly linking platform revenue to token value appreciation, Validity is setting a precedent that other projects may seek to emulate. This move reinforces the idea that sustainable tokenomics are not just about burning tokens or distributing fees, but about creating a self-reinforcing economic engine that grows in tandem with platform utility. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to mature, models like Cryptoswap ‘s VAL token buyback strategy will become increasingly important for fostering long-term value and stability. For investors and users, this means a more direct and transparent pathway to participating in the success of a decentralized platform. For the broader crypto market, it offers a fresh perspective on how value can be captured and returned to a project’s foundational asset. In conclusion, Validity’s upcoming launch of Cryptoswap , with its innovative VAL token buyback mechanism funded by 100% of swap fees, is a significant development in the DeFi space. It’s a bold move that prioritizes long-term value creation for its native token, promising a more robust and sustainable ecosystem. As the decentralized exchange prepares for its debut, the crypto community will be watching closely to see how this revolutionary approach reshapes the future of tokenomics and decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is Validity’s Cryptoswap?

The buyback mechanism creates continuous buying pressure for VAL, potentially reducing its circulating supply and increasing its scarcity. This can lead to a positive impact on the VAL token’s market value over time, aligning the success of the Cryptoswap platform directly with the interests of VAL token holders. Is Cryptoswap truly decentralized? Yes, as a decentralized exchange, Cryptoswap operates on blockchain technology, enabling peer-to-peer trading without central control. This enhances security, privacy, and user autonomy, adhering to the core principles of decentralization. When is Cryptoswap expected to launch? Validity announced on X that they are preparing to launch Cryptoswap soon. Specific launch dates are typically communicated through their official channels, so it’s advisable to follow Validity’s announcements for the latest updates. How will Cryptoswap compete with existing DEXs?

Additionally, Validity’s established reputation for secure blockchain solutions and a focus on user experience will be key competitive advantages. Will the buyback guarantee an increase in VAL token price? While the buyback mechanism is designed to create upward price pressure and enhance token value by reducing supply and increasing demand, it does not guarantee a price increase. Cryptocurrency prices are influenced by many factors, including overall market sentiment, adoption, and broader economic conditions. However, it provides a strong fundamental support for the VAL token. If you found this article insightful, please consider sharing it with your network on social media!

The U.S. President went on Truth Social on Thursday and torched India’s growing relationship with Russia. “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” Trump posted . This came just one day after he told Americans he was placing a 25% tariff on Indian imports, starting Friday. Trump said India has always leaned on Russia for its weapons and fuel, and called that a bad move. According to Reuters , he also said that the U.S. does almost no business with Russia, and very little with India. It was a direct shot at both countries, not just for how they trade, but for who they trade with. India reacts to tariffs, says it will protect farmers and small businesses Within hours of Trump’s tariff announcement, New Delhi made its position public. The Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry said it had “taken note” of the announcement and was “studying its implications.” The statement also said India would “take all steps necessary to secure our national interest,” especially the interests of local farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs. The government didn’t pretend this came out of nowhere. It said talks with Washington have been going on for months. “India and the U.S. have been engaged in negotiations to conclude a fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement over the last few months. We remain committed to that objective,” the ministry said. New Delhi also brought up its recent Free Trade Agreement with the UK as proof it’s not against foreign partnerships, just not at the cost of its domestic economy. The statement made it clear that while India is open to deals, it isn’t going to roll over when it comes to protecting its own people. Trump also pressures Putin, criticizes Medvedev, shortens peace deadline Trump’s criticism didn’t stop with India. He also called out Russia’s former President Dmitry Medvedev, who is now Deputy Chairman of the country’s Security Council. Medvedev had posted on X (formerly Twitter) that Trump was playing an “ultimatum game” with Moscow, warning that “each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with (Trump’s) own country.” Trump fired back by expressing disappointment that Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn’t ended the war in Ukraine. He said the original deadline for a peace agreement was 50 days, but he’s now reducing that to “10 or 12.” There was no ambiguity. Trump believes Moscow has wasted time, and he’s not waiting around. India, meanwhile, continues buying oil from Russia despite criticism from the West. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has defended the decision, saying the country is just trying to get the best price for its people. He also pointed to what he called hypocrisy from Europe, saying, “Europe’s problems are the world’s problems, but the world’s problems are not Europe’s problems.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|TRADING|MARKET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-31 05:50:07

For the Cratos token (CRTS), developed by Pharos Labs, a recent announcement has sent ripples of excitement across the digital asset landscape, especially within the highly regulated Japanese market. This isn’t just another listing; it’s a testament to rigorous compliance and a significant step towards mainstream adoption, promising new horizons for this innovative digital asset. Cratos Token’s Landmark Achievement: Clearing Japan’s Strict Regulatory Hurdles In a move that underscores its commitment to regulatory adherence and long-term viability, Pharos Labs, the innovative force behind the mobile app-based voting platform Cratos, has announced a pivotal achievement: its Cratos token (CRTS) has successfully navigated the stringent whitelist screening process by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA). This news, initially reported by South Korean outlet Digital Today, marks a critical milestone for CRTS, positioning it for a highly anticipated debut on the Japanese crypto exchange BitTrade. But what exactly does clearing the JVCEA whitelist entail, and why is it such a significant hurdle for any cryptocurrency aspiring to enter the Japanese market? Japan is globally recognized for its meticulous and robust regulatory framework concerning digital assets. The JVCEA, a self-regulatory body overseen by the Financial Services Agency (FSA), plays a crucial role in ensuring investor protection and market integrity. For a token to be whitelisted, it undergoes an exhaustive review that scrutinizes: Technical Security: Ensuring the blockchain and token smart contracts are robust and resistant to vulnerabilities, protecting user assets and data. Financial Stability: Assessing the project’s economic viability and sustainability, guaranteeing it has the resources for long-term operations. Legal Compliance: Verifying strict adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, preventing illicit activities. Project Transparency: Evaluating the clarity of the project’s whitepaper, team, and development roadmap, ensuring investors have full information. User Protection Measures: Confirming robust mechanisms are in place to safeguard user assets, privacy, and provide fair dispute resolution. The successful completion of this rigorous screening, coupled with the official registration with Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), provides an unparalleled stamp of legitimacy for the Cratos token . It signifies that CRTS meets Japan’s high standards for digital assets, a benchmark many global projects strive for but few achieve. This dual clearance paves a clear and secure path for CRTS to be officially listed on BitTrade, one of Japan’s reputable and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, in the near future, opening doors to a new wave of adoption. What is the Cratos Token and Why Does it Matter for Digital Democracy? At its core, Cratos is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s the native utility token of a pioneering mobile application designed to democratize opinion sharing and decision-making. The Cratos app provides a platform where users can create and participate in various voting polls on diverse topics, ranging from social issues to entertainment and current affairs. In an era where collective opinions hold significant sway, Cratos empowers individuals to voice their thoughts and contribute to a broader consensus, all while leveraging blockchain’s transparency. The Cratos token (CRTS) serves multiple vital functions within this ecosystem, making it integral to the platform’s operation and user engagement: Participation Rewards: Users earn CRTS tokens for actively participating in polls, creating new polls, and engaging with the community. This incentivizes broad participation and diverse viewpoints, fostering a vibrant ecosystem. Governance: As a utility token, CRTS can potentially grant holders voting rights on platform developments, future features, or even significant policy changes within the Cratos ecosystem, embodying a decentralized governance model where users have a say. Transaction Fees: While the primary use is engagement and rewards, CRTS may also be used for certain in-app purchases or premium features, enhancing its utility and creating demand within the platform. The vision behind Cratos is to build a global, decentralized voting platform that leverages blockchain technology for transparency, immutability, and fair participation. By fostering a community where every voice can be heard and rewarded, Cratos aims to become a leading platform for collective intelligence, providing a unique blend of social interaction and digital asset utility. How Will the BitTrade Debut Impact the Cratos Token and Its Ecosystem? The impending listing of the Cratos token on BitTrade is not merely a procedural step; it’s a strategic move with profound implications for the project’s growth and global reach. Japan represents one of the most mature and discerning cryptocurrency markets in the world, characterized by a high degree of institutional and retail investor sophistication, coupled with a strong emphasis on regulatory compliance. This listing opens several new avenues, promising a significant boost for CRTS: Enhanced Liquidity: Access to the Japanese market will significantly increase the trading volume and liquidity of CRTS. Greater liquidity makes it easier for users and investors to buy and sell the token, reducing price volatility and improving market efficiency for the Cratos token . Broader Investor Base: The listing on a regulated Japanese exchange introduces CRTS to a new pool of investors, including institutional players and retail traders who prioritize compliant assets. This expanded reach can lead to increased demand and potentially a more stable market capitalization. Increased Legitimacy and Trust: Being listed in Japan, particularly after JVCEA and FSA clearance, acts as a powerful endorsement. It signals to the global crypto community that Cratos is a legitimate and well-vetted project, fostering greater trust and confidence among potential partners and users worldwide. Global Expansion Footprint: Japan serves as a crucial gateway to the broader Asian market. A successful launch and sustained presence in Japan can pave the way for further expansion into other regulated jurisdictions, solidifying Cratos’s position as a global player in the digital asset space. This debut is a clear indicator that Pharos Labs is not just building a product but is also strategically navigating the complex global regulatory landscape, aiming for long-term sustainability and widespread adoption for the Cratos token , cementing its place in the competitive crypto market. Navigating the Japanese Crypto Landscape: What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for the Cratos Token? While the prospect of a BitTrade debut is exciting, operating within the Japanese crypto market comes with its unique set of challenges and opportunities. Japan’s regulatory environment, while stringent, also provides a degree of certainty and protection that is often lacking in less regulated markets. This stability can attract serious long-term investors and foster innovation within defined boundaries, making it a desirable, albeit challenging, market for the Cratos token . Opportunities: Investor Confidence: Japanese investors are known for their meticulous approach and preference for regulated assets.

Stable Market: Compared to some other volatile markets, Japan’s regulated environment tends to offer a more stable and predictable trading environment, which can be beneficial for the long-term growth and price stability of the Cratos token . Challenges: Intense Competition: The Japanese market is home to numerous established crypto exchanges and a growing number of digital assets. Cratos will need to effectively differentiate itself to capture market share and attract users. Strict Compliance Burden: Maintaining compliance with Japan’s evolving regulations will require continuous effort and resources from Pharos Labs, necessitating ongoing vigilance and adaptation. Cultural Nuances: Understanding and adapting to the specific cultural and consumer preferences of the Japanese market will be key to successful user acquisition and engagement, requiring tailored marketing and communication strategies. Despite these challenges, the opportunity to tap into one of the world’s most sophisticated and regulated crypto markets far outweighs the difficulties. It positions the Cratos token for sustained growth and validates Pharos Labs’ commitment to operating within established legal frameworks, setting a precedent for future global expansion.

South Korean crypto giant Bithumb has just announced a monumental leap forward for SWELL tokens , promising to unlock unprecedented flexibility and accessibility for users. This isn’t just another listing; it’s a strategic move that could redefine how we interact with decentralized liquid staking protocols. What Does Multichain Support for SWELL Tokens Mean? In a significant development, Bithumb, one of South Korea’s premier cryptocurrency exchanges, has confirmed its upcoming support for deposits and withdrawals of Swell Network (SWELL) tokens across multiple blockchain networks. Starting precisely at 06:30 UTC on July 31, users will be able to transact with their SWELL tokens not only on the Ethereum network but also on Swell’s innovative Swellchain. But what exactly does ‘multichain support’ entail, and why is it such a big deal? Enhanced Flexibility: Traditionally, crypto tokens are confined to their native blockchain. Multichain support breaks these barriers, allowing tokens to move seamlessly between different networks. For SWELL tokens , this means users aren’t limited to Ethereum’s ecosystem, opening up new possibilities. Reduced Costs: Different blockchains have varying transaction fees. By offering access to Swellchain, which is designed for efficiency, users might experience lower gas fees compared to the often-high costs on the Ethereum network, especially during peak times. Greater Accessibility: It broadens the reach of SWELL tokens to a wider audience, including those who prefer or operate primarily on Swellchain, fostering a more inclusive and interconnected DeFi environment. Why is Bithumb’s Integration of SWELL Tokens So Important? Bithumb’s decision to integrate multichain support for SWELL tokens is far from a minor update. As a major player in the South Korean crypto market, Bithumb holds significant influence. Its actions often set precedents and signal growing maturity within the digital asset space. Here’s why this integration is particularly impactful: Firstly, it lends substantial credibility to Swell Network. When a top-tier exchange like Bithumb, known for its rigorous due diligence, embraces a project with such comprehensive support, it signals confidence in the project’s technology, security, and long-term vision. This endorsement can attract more institutional and retail investors to the SWELL tokens ecosystem. Secondly, it significantly improves liquidity. By facilitating easier movement of SWELL tokens between chains, Bithumb helps consolidate liquidity, making it simpler for users to buy, sell, and trade their assets. This increased liquidity is vital for market stability and efficient price discovery. Finally, it aligns with the broader industry trend towards interoperability. The future of blockchain is increasingly seen as multichain, where different networks can communicate and interact seamlessly. Bithumb’s move positions them at the forefront of this evolution, offering their users a more versatile and future-proof trading experience. How Does This Benefit Current and Future Holders of SWELL Tokens ? For anyone holding or considering investing in SWELL tokens , this announcement from Bithumb is unequivocally good news. The benefits span across several key areas, enhancing the user experience and potentially boosting the token’s utility and value: Increased Utility and Use Cases With SWELL tokens accessible on multiple chains, their utility expands beyond just liquid staking on Ethereum. Developers and users can now explore new DeFi protocols and applications built on Swellchain, potentially unlocking innovative use cases for the token that were previously impractical due to network limitations or costs. This cross-chain functionality allows SWELL tokens to participate in a broader array of decentralized applications, from lending and borrowing to yield farming on different platforms. Improved User Experience and Accessibility The ability to choose between the Ethereum network and Swellchain for deposits and withdrawals offers unparalleled convenience. Users can select the network that best suits their needs at a given time, whether it’s prioritizing lower transaction fees on Swellchain or leveraging Ethereum’s robust security and vast ecosystem. This flexibility simplifies the process of managing SWELL tokens , making it more appealing to both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers. Potential for Enhanced Liquidity and Price Stability As more exchanges and platforms support multichain transactions for SWELL tokens , the overall market liquidity for the asset is likely to increase. Higher liquidity generally leads to more stable prices, as there are deeper pools of buyers and sellers, reducing volatility. This makes SWELL tokens a more attractive asset for traders and long-term holders alike, as it becomes easier to enter and exit positions without significant price slippage. This strategic move by Bithumb underscores a commitment to providing its users with cutting-edge services and solidifies its position as a forward-thinking exchange in the global crypto landscape. For Swell Network, it marks a pivotal moment in its journey towards broader adoption and integration within the decentralized finance ecosystem. Are There Any Challenges or Considerations with Multichain SWELL Tokens ? While the benefits of multichain support are significant, it’s also important to consider potential challenges and implications. Understanding these can help users navigate the new landscape more effectively: User Education: With multiple chains, comes increased complexity. Users need to be aware of which network they are using for deposits and withdrawals to avoid sending funds to the wrong address, which can lead to irreversible losses. Bithumb and Swell Network will likely need to provide clear guidelines and educational resources. Bridging Mechanisms: The underlying technology enabling multichain functionality, often involving ‘bridges,’ can be complex and has historically been a target for exploits. While reputable projects and exchanges implement robust security measures, users should always be mindful of the inherent risks associated with cross-chain transfers. Network Congestion: While Swellchain aims for efficiency, the Ethereum network can still experience high gas fees and congestion, impacting transaction times and costs for users opting for that chain. Users should monitor network conditions. What’s Next for Swell Network and SWELL Tokens ? This integration with Bithumb is a clear signal of Swell Network’s ambitious roadmap. By expanding its reach and enhancing interoperability for SWELL tokens , Swell is positioning itself as a key player in the liquid staking and broader DeFi space. We can anticipate: Increased Developer Activity: More developers might be incentivized to build on Swellchain, leveraging its efficiencies and the growing liquidity of SWELL tokens . New Partnerships: The enhanced multichain capability could lead to collaborations with other DeFi protocols and platforms looking to integrate liquid staking solutions. Greater Adoption: As accessibility improves, so too does the potential for widespread adoption of Swell Network’s liquid staking solutions, driving demand for SWELL tokens . Conclusion: A New Era for SWELL Tokens Bithumb’s decision to enable multichain support for SWELL tokens is more than just a technical upgrade; it’s a strategic move that significantly enhances the utility, accessibility, and credibility of the Swell Network. By bridging Ethereum and Swellchain, Bithumb is not only catering to the evolving needs of its users but also contributing to the broader vision of a more interconnected and efficient decentralized finance ecosystem. This groundbreaking integration marks a new era for SWELL tokens , promising a future of greater flexibility, reduced costs, and expanded opportunities for investors and users worldwide.

We will make the United States a global superpower in digital assets,” Hines said. Hines argued that the cryptocurrency sector has been “suppressed” over the past fifteen years, especially under the Biden administration, saying, “This sector has been devastated. But now, by removing bureaucratic hurdles, we are moving into a new construction process.” Stating that the new period will progress in three main stages, Hines listed them as follows: Disruption – Dismantling Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and ending financial access restrictions. Construction – Implementation of stablecoin regulation with the new law called the “Genius Act.” Implementation – Implementation of new market structure regulations, including tax reforms and consumer protection policies. Hines also addressed widespread concerns about cryptocurrencies being used for illicit activities. “Blockchain provides transparency,” he said. “Using blockchain to perpetrate crime is foolish because all transactions can be traced.” Related News: BREAKING: Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Makes Statement Following Interest Rate Decision - LIVE Hines stated that the prepared report will guide the “Clarity Act” and other market structure laws currently being debated in Congress, and that these documents are expected to reach President Trump's desk by October. Contributors to the report included former SEC member Paul Atkins, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bassett, and technology consultant David Sacks. Bassett wrote in an article for the Washington Post that President Trump's “blockchain-friendly approach” would transform the US into a crypto superpower. The Trump administration views crypto assets not just as financial instruments but as symbols of American innovation. “The US is on its way to becoming a leader in Bitcoin and digital financial technologies,” Hines said. *This is not investment advice.

While many are selling off their assets, a few deep-pocketed players are quietly amassing specific altcoins. This strategic hoarding hints at potential future gains for these digital tokens. Discover which four lesser-known cryptocurrencies are being stockpiled and why they might be poised for growth. Fartcoin Faces Bearish Trends with Clear Support and Resistance Levels Fartcoin experienced a significant weekly decline of approximately 35% and a monthly decrease of nearly 6%. Over the past six months, the performance softened with about a 4% drop. This volatility highlights a week marked by sell-offs, contrasted against a backdrop of gradual consolidation in the longer term. Momentum indicators remain low, suggesting that Fartcoin's price behavior has faced recent pressure. No strong trends have emerged, leaving traders cautious in this tumultuous market environment. Currently, Fartcoin trades between $0.78 and $1.53, with resistance at $1.91 and support near $0.41. A secondary barrier at $2.66 adds caution for bullish traders. Indicators show a bearish sentiment, with momentum and oscillators generating weak signals. The relative strength index sits around 40. Traders might consider short positions or scalp profits at resistance levels, employing tight stop-loss orders to protect against further drops as the market navigates its defined price limits, keeping the overall trend ambiguous. JasmyCoin Market Trends and Analysis JasmyCoin exhibited contrasting dynamics recently, with a notable recovery of 16.23% over the past month after earlier dips. However, the coin has faced a significant decline of 49.13% across the last six months, emphasizing its volatility. Weekly data highlights a sharp 19.8% drop, indicating a struggle for stability. Price movements remained within a narrow range from $0.01 to $0.02, with consistent local support near $0.01 and resistance near $0.02. These fluctuations captured moments of surging investor interest, typically followed by swift reversals, as overall market sentiment remained cautious amid a continuing tension between risk and reward. Currently, the coin trades within a tight range of $0.01 to $0.02, with traders focusing on these key levels. Support at $0.01 and resistance at $0.02 establish a clear channel for price action. Technical indicators reflect mixed market sentiment, with the Awesome Oscillator at 0.00164 and a slightly negative Momentum Indicator at -0.00305. The RSI stands at 49.29, just below the neutral midpoint, suggesting indecisiveness among traders. Recent volatility indicates that bears may hold some control, but the prior monthly recovery hints at buyer resilience. No definitive trend has emerged, presenting range trading opportunities. Traders might consider buying near $0.01 and selling at $0.02 if bearish pressure intensifies, emphasizing the importance of closely monitoring these levels for potential market movements. Worldcoin Price Analysis: Range Bound Trading Signal Recent price activity reflects noticeable fluctuations in Worldcoin . Over the past month, prices climbed by roughly 15% while a six-month period saw a drop nearing 39%. A one-week decline of about 23% highlights sudden shifts that have punctuated the coin’s performance. The historical movements show a mix of short-term recoveries and longer-term setbacks, indicating that Worldcoin has experienced both upward spurts and significant retracements. The coin currently trades between $0.70 and $1.18, with the closest resistance found at $1.45 and a further hurdle at $1.93. Support is established near $0.50, with a second level as low as $0.02. The Awesome Oscillator sits at 0.100, and an RSI reading around 48.6 suggests conditions that are neither strongly overbought nor oversold. A momentum indicator at -0.141 reinforces the cautious tone prevailing in the market. Despite a recent sharp decline, the month-long rally hints at underlying buying interest. There is no clear trend at present, and price movements remain balanced between bulls and bears. Traders might look to buy near support and consider selling as prices approach resistance. GALA's Volatile Path: Past Gains and Recent Setbacks GALA experienced a monthly surge of 16.28% while undergoing a six-month pullback of 46.03%. Price activity fluctuated between $0.011 and $0.019, highlighting moments of strong upward movement and significant declines. Average volumes and price swings marked the coin's history with bursts of optimism followed by notable corrections, reflecting a market sensitive to shifts in trader sentiment. The current trading scene shows GALA working within a defined price band. With immediate support around $0.007 and resistance near $0.022, traders have clear levels to watch. A break above $0.022 could push prices toward $0.030, while a dip below $0.007 might signal further downward action. Short-term behavior appears weighted by bearish pressures, emphasized by a one-week drop of 18.71%. Caution is advised given the volatility and mixed signals, with opportunities for tactical entries against potential bounce-backs from support. Conclusion The recent market selloff has seen significant accumulation of FARTCOIN , JASMY , WLD , and GALA by large holders. This activity signals a strong interest in these altcoins despite the current downturn. The accumulation trend suggests confidence in their potential for growth. Such behavior by major players often hints at strategic moves in anticipation of future value increases. This focused hoarding during a broader market decline points to a promising outlook for these specific coins. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

An employee was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the fraud. Per local reports , hackers exploited login credentials of a CoinDCX tech employee to siphon $44 million in crypto. The employee, Rahul Agarwal, works as a software engineer for the exchange. The arrest comes after CoinDCX’s parent firm, Neblio Technologies, lodged a formal complaint over hackers exploiting Agarwal’s login credentials. CoinDCX suffered a major security breach on July 19 that compromised an internal account used to provide liquidity to customers. Indian crypto exchange @CoinDCX has confirmed a major security breach that resulted in the loss of $44 million. #India #Hack https://t.co/89JyvTXlxk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 20, 2025 As reported earlier , cybersecurity experts from Cyvers found that the exploit is linked to the infamous North Korean Lazarus Group. They said that the hack pattern mirrors another Indian crypto exchange WazirX’s $234 million crypto hack last year. CoinDCX Employee Received Call From Germany, Worked Part-Time According to Hardeep Singh, Neblio vice-president for public policy, Agarwal was a permanent employee of the company. Further, he was found using the company laptop for freelance jobs. “He came under the scanner after the company found out that an unknown person had hacked into the system at 2.37 am on July 19 and transferred 1 USDT to a wallet,” a police statement said, quoting Hardeep Singh. “Around 9.40 am, the hacker siphoned off $44 million and transferred it to six wallets.” The company’s internal investigations later revealed that Agarwal’s laptop was compromised, allowing the hacker to access CoinDCX’s server. Further, during police interrogation, the employee admitted to moonlighting, taking up private jobs using the company laptop. Agarwal also noted that he received a WhatsApp call from Germany stating that a few files had been sent to him for completion. “He said one of the files could have been a bait and the hacker could have entered into his official system,” police said in a statement. “He maintained he was not aware of the theft till his company summoned him.” A case has been registered under various sections of the Indian Information Technology Act. Hackers Transferred $17K to Techie Additionally, per investigations, the techie had received around $17,131 into his bank account from an unknown source, raising questions. The police First Information Report (FIR) stated that Agarwal claimed to have received the amount through his part-time job over the past year. The news arrives a day after rumors erupted over US crypto exchange giant Coinbase acquiring CoinDCX . A local report revealed that the deal would appraise CoinDCX at below $900 million. Later, CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta called the Coinbase acquisition “rumours,” adding that CoinDCX is “super focused” on building for India’s crypto story and not up for sale.

Remittix (RTX) continues to trend and grab investors’ interest and attention. What does the smart money see in this project? Can it truly attain $1 before DOGE? Dogecoin Price Prediction: Why DOGE Price May Fall Under $0.20 If DOGE price fails to reclaim $0.20 decisively, the upside toward $0.25–$0.30 may never happen. Many analysts believe DOGE will definitely correct back to the $0.19 to $0.18 range before a possible breakout. However, if the market momentum is bullish, it should influence the Dogecoin price. However, if the broader market is bearish or indecisive, all bullish Dogecoin price predictions are invalidated. While things look unclear from the chart, the fundamentals state otherwise.

With ETH now at $3,774.74, down 0.79%, investors are already speculating if the price will fall back into the $3,000 mark. In the backdrop, some Ethereum whales seem to be deploying capital into fresh tokens — led by one stealth project, Remittix (RTX) , which is gaining momentum within the DeFi space. ETH Meets Resistance: Is $3K On The Horizon? Ethereum is still a leading decentralized finance contender, but the current trend of the market shows a probable temporary withdrawal. Despite ETH holding a market cap of $455.24 billion and over $33.54 billion in trading volumes, bear pressure and reduced momentum have some experts eyeing a possible fall to the $3,000 support barrier. Increased selling pressures and risk-averse investor sentiment led to a rotation into the emerging tokens.

Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin’s Final Leg Is Near – Time To Be ‘Cautiously Optimistic’? Ethereum Hits 10-Year Milestone Ethereum and the crypto community are celebrating the blockchain’s 10th anniversary by highlighting some of the ecosystem’s key events since 2015, like the ICO craze, the non-fungible tokensFT boom, The Merge, and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In an X post, Unchained host Laura Shin listed some of Ethereum’s milestones, including its first spot in client diversity, Total Value Locked (TVL), and the number of ecosystem developers. Shin also emphasized the network’s 100% uptime rate during the last 10 years. One of Ethereum’s developers, Lefteris Karapetsas, commemorated the anniversary by sharing some pictures from July 30, 2015, stating, “We were a small team of hackers in an office in Kreuzberg in Berlin and we had just launched the Ethereum network. The rest is history. Looking back at the last 10 years, I am excited about the next 10 years, the next 25, the next 100.” Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong revealed how the US immigration system technically “contributed” to Ethereum’s creation: Fun fact: I met @vitalikbuterin in 2013 at the San Jose Bitcoin conference when he was writing for Bitcoin Magazine (his writing was great). A few months later I invited him to come by Coinbase’s first office in San Francisco for a visit and he showed us some cool stuff on his laptop. Armstrong explained that he tried to hire Vitalik Buterin in 2013, but due to a series of circumstances, including problems obtaining a US work Visa, Buterin was forced to return to Canada. “While he was stuck in Canada, he created Ethereum,” the CEO detailed, “So, in a way, the sub-optimal immigration system in the U.S. contributed to the creation of Ethereum.” Bankless co-founder David Hoffman jokingly replied that “Coinbase almost prevented Ethereum from ever happening.” ETH’s Birthday Fun Delayed? On its birthday, ETH started the day trying to reclaim the $3,800 mark, which some analysts consider the “last major resistance” before new highs. The King of Altcoins has been attempting to successfully break out from this level for over a week, with two failed attempts during this timeframe. At the start of the week, the cryptocurrency briefly surged above this level, hitting a seven-month high of $3,941 on Monday. However, the recent market pullback sent Ethereum back inside its local range. During the Wednesday celebrations, ETH’s price suffered 4% drop to the $3,680 area, fueled by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announcement of its decision to leave interest rates unchanged. Nonetheless, it quickly recovered from the initial market reaction, which saw liquidations worth $212 million in just 60 minutes.

The plea agreement, entered Wednesday, spares the pair from a more serious money laundering charge that carried a potential 20-year sentence. Court documents show that William Lonergan Hill and Keonne Rodriguez, who had previously pleaded not guilty, changed their pleas in the Southern District of New York. Under the agreement, the US Department of Justice dropped the money laundering count, leaving only the charge of running an unlicensed money-transmitting business , which carries a maximum sentence of five years. @SamouraiWallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill are set to reverse their plea to “guilty” in a high-profile crypto privacy case, according to New York court filings. #SamouraiWallet #CryptoMixers https://t.co/8aHVgJKESf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 30, 2025 Samourai Founders Accused of Marketing Platform as Money Laundering Tool The DoJ and FBI shut down Samourai Wallet in 2024. They also arrested the two founders. Authorities alleged that the service knowingly enabled criminals to hide illicit funds. Moreover, prosecutors said the platform laundered over $100m. They added that it was actively marketed as a tool for large-scale money laundering and sanctions evasion. Samourai Wallet was a popular coin mixing app that allowed users to obscure the flow of their crypto transactions. These services combine multiple transactions together, making it harder to trace funds on a public blockchain. While privacy advocates view mixers as vital tools for financial anonymity, US authorities have long linked them to cybercrime and stolen funds. The conviction marks a significant outcome for federal prosecutors, who have increasingly targeted developers of privacy-focused crypto tools. Update: Samourai Wallet's Rodriguez Money Judgment just filed – yes, judgment of $237 million (shared with Hill) – $6.4 million due on or before November 6 sentencing date. (Hill to be sentenced November 7).

The trial of Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm, a case closely watched by the crypto industry, is set to conclude this week. US authorities banned Americans from using Tornado Cash in 2022, saying the Ethereum-based protocol had been used to launder billions in illicit funds. Samourai Wallet’s founders also face steep financial penalties. The plea agreement includes the forfeiture of $237m and a $400,000 fine. Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 6, and federal guidelines call for up to 60 months in prison. The case has sparked a broader debate about the future of privacy tools in cryptocurrency. Prosecutors argue that criminals often abuse these services. However, advocates counter that they are essential for protecting user confidentiality on transparent public ledgers. Further, the guilty pleas could also influence other pending cases. The DOJ has already brought similar charges against developers of other mixers, such as Bitcoin Fog. As a result, the Samourai outcome may embolden prosecutors to continue pursuing such actions. For now, Hill and Rodriguez await sentencing as the industry weighs the wider impact of the case.

Yet, a remarkable shift is underway in Latin America. In a move that has sent ripples across the global financial landscape, Bolivia’s central bank has reportedly declared cryptocurrency a reliable alternative to traditional fiat currencies. This isn’t just a casual statement; it signifies a monumental change in perspective, particularly for a nation that has previously expressed skepticism towards digital assets. This unexpected embrace, coupled with a strategic partnership with El Salvador, the trailblazing nation that made Bitcoin legal tender, sets the stage for a fascinating chapter in Bolivia crypto adoption . Bolivia’s Pivotal Shift: Embracing a Digital Future For years, central banks worldwide have approached cryptocurrencies with caution, often citing concerns about volatility and illicit activities. Bolivia was no exception, having previously issued warnings against their use. This makes the recent declaration from Bolivia’s central bank all the more significant. By calling crypto a “reliable alternative,” they are not just acknowledging its existence but recognizing its potential utility and stability in the financial ecosystem. What could be behind this dramatic change of heart? Nations globally are grappling with economic pressures, inflation, and the need for more efficient cross-border transactions. Cryptocurrencies offer a decentralized, borderless, and often deflationary alternative to traditional systems. For a country like Bolivia, exploring such alternatives could be a strategic move to: Enhance Financial Inclusion: Provide access to modern financial services for unbanked populations. Mitigate Inflationary Pressures: Offer citizens a hedge against potential local currency depreciation. Streamline Remittances: Reduce costs and speed up international money transfers. Attract Investment: Position the country as forward-thinking, potentially drawing in foreign capital. This declaration lays the groundwork for practical implementation and integration of digital assets into Bolivia’s financial fabric, signaling a willingness to learn, adapt, and potentially pioneer new economic models within the region. The El Salvador Connection: A Blueprint for Bolivia Crypto Adoption Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Bolivia’s announcement is its direct link to El Salvador. According to Cointelegraph, Bolivia’s central bank signed an agreement with El Salvador to jointly promote crypto adoption and develop related policies. This partnership is a game-changer. El Salvador made history in September 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Its journey, while not without its challenges, has provided invaluable real-world data and experience regarding national-level cryptocurrency integration. El Salvador’s experience offers a unique blueprint. They have: Developed a National Wallet: Facilitated Bitcoin transactions for citizens. Invested in Bitcoin Mining: Utilizing geothermal energy for sustainable crypto practices. Created a Legal Framework: Established laws governing Bitcoin as legal tender. Promoted Education: Initiated programs to educate citizens on cryptocurrency use. For Bolivia, collaborating with El Salvador means gaining direct access to this pioneering experience. Instead of starting from scratch, Bolivia can leverage El Salvador’s insights, learn from its successes and failures, and tailor policies that best suit its unique economic and social landscape. This collaboration could manifest in joint research, shared expertise in regulatory frameworks, and coordinated public education efforts. This alliance underscores a growing regional interest in exploring digital assets, not as speculative tools, but as fundamental components of future economies. The synergy between a nation embracing a “reliable alternative” and another that has already implemented it as legal tender creates a powerful force for Bolivia crypto adoption . Why Nations Are Seriously Looking at Crypto: Beyond the Hype The shift in Bolivia’s stance, mirroring a broader trend, prompts a deeper look into why sovereign nations are increasingly considering cryptocurrencies. It’s no longer just about individual investors; it’s about macroeconomic stability and strategic advantage. Here’s a comparative overview: Feature Traditional Fiat Currencies Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin) Issuance & Control Centralized control by governments Decentralized network; no single entity Inflation Risk Prone to inflation due to money printing Often deflationary/fixed supply; resistant to inflation Transaction Speed & Cost Slow and costly for international transfers Faster and potentially cheaper, especially cross-border Accessibility Requires bank accounts; limited for unbanked Accessible with internet/smartphone; promotes inclusion Transparency Transactions often private, system can be opaque Public ledger (blockchain) provides transparency Bordered Nature Bound by national borders Global and borderless For countries facing high inflation, capital flight, or a desire to reduce reliance on dominant foreign currencies, cryptocurrencies present a compelling alternative. They offer a pathway to greater financial autonomy and resilience, while blockchain technology can enhance transparency and improve public service efficiency. Challenges and Considerations for Successful Bolivia Crypto Adoption While the prospect of widespread Bolivia crypto adoption is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges. The path forward is not without hurdles, and careful planning will be paramount. Key considerations include: Regulatory Frameworks: Developing clear, comprehensive regulations that protect consumers, prevent illicit activities, and foster innovation. El Salvador’s experience will be invaluable here. Public Education and Awareness: Many citizens may lack understanding of cryptocurrencies. Extensive educational campaigns will be necessary to build trust and facilitate widespread adoption. Technological Infrastructure: Ensuring robust internet connectivity and access to devices for transactions, especially in remote areas. Energy Consumption Concerns: If Bolivia considers Bitcoin mining, addressing the energy demands and environmental impact will be critical, perhaps by exploring renewable sources. Volatility Management: Cryptocurrencies can be volatile. Strategies to manage this volatility and protect citizens from sharp price swings will be essential. Addressing these challenges proactively will determine the success and sustainability of Bolivia’s crypto initiatives, balancing innovation with stability for the general populace. The Road Ahead for Bolivia Crypto Adoption: A Regional Catalyst? Bolivia’s move, supported by El Salvador, could serve as a powerful catalyst for broader crypto adoption across Latin America. The region has historically been fertile ground for cryptocurrency due to economic instability, high remittance costs, and a significant unbanked population. If Bolivia successfully navigates this path, it could inspire other nations to follow suit, leading to a domino effect of digital asset integration throughout the continent. The implications for citizens are profound. Imagine a future where remittances are instant and nearly free, where savings are protected from inflation, and where financial services are accessible to everyone. This vision, while ambitious, is precisely what nations like Bolivia and El Salvador are striving to achieve through strategic Bolivia crypto adoption initiatives. This development is a testament to the growing recognition of cryptocurrency’s potential to reshape global finance. It highlights a shift from outright rejection to cautious, yet determined, exploration and integration. The world will be watching closely as Bolivia and El Salvador embark on this collaborative journey, potentially forging a new economic paradigm for the 21st century. In conclusion, Bolivia’s central bank embracing cryptocurrency as a “reliable alternative” and its strategic partnership with El Salvador mark a significant milestone in the global narrative of digital assets. This move transcends mere speculation, signaling a serious commitment to leveraging blockchain technology for national economic benefit. While challenges remain, the collaborative approach with an experienced pioneer like El Salvador positions Bolivia to navigate these hurdles effectively. This alliance could well be a harbinger of a new era of digital finance, not just for Latin America, but for nations worldwide seeking innovative solutions to traditional economic dilemmas. The future of Bolivia crypto adoption looks increasingly promising, potentially setting a precedent for how countries can responsibly integrate digital currencies into their financial systems. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why is Bolivia’s central bank now supporting cryptocurrency? Bolivia’s central bank, after previous skepticism, now views cryptocurrency as a “reliable alternative” potentially due to growing global economic pressures, the need for enhanced financial inclusion, mitigation of inflation, and streamlining of remittances. Their partnership with El Salvador indicates a strategic shift towards exploring digital assets for national benefit. 2. What is the significance of El Salvador’s partnership with Bolivia? El Salvador was the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender, gaining invaluable real-world experience in national-level crypto integration. Their partnership provides Bolivia with direct access to this expertise, allowing them to learn from El Salvador’s successes and challenges, and develop tailored crypto policies without starting from scratch. 3. How can cryptocurrency be a “reliable alternative” to fiat currency? Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer a decentralized, borderless, and often deflationary alternative to traditional fiat systems. They can provide a hedge against inflation, offer faster and cheaper international transactions (remittances), and enhance financial accessibility for unbanked populations, making them a potentially reliable tool for economic stability. 4. What are the main challenges Bolivia might face in crypto adoption? Key challenges for Bolivia include developing robust regulatory frameworks, educating the public about cryptocurrency use and risks, ensuring adequate technological infrastructure (internet and devices), addressing energy consumption concerns if mining is considered, and managing the inherent volatility of digital assets to protect citizens. 5. Will this lead to Bitcoin becoming legal tender in Bolivia? While Bolivia’s central bank calls crypto a “reliable alternative” and is partnering with El Salvador (which made Bitcoin legal tender), the current announcement focuses on promoting adoption and policy development. It does not explicitly state an intention to make Bitcoin legal tender. The path forward will likely involve careful consideration and gradual integration, learning from El Salvador’s experience.

The London-based bank made the announcement on Thursday, saying the repurchase is part of a larger plan to return at least $8 billion to shareholders between 2024 and 2026. The bank had already launched a $1.5 billion buyback earlier this year in February, making this the second major repurchase within six months. The second-quarter results showed an adjusted pretax profit of $2.4 billion for the three months ending June 30, topping the $1.9 billion estimate tracked by Bloomberg. Standard Chartered also said its stock had traded at about £13.70 in London by Thursday, showing a gain of over 30% this year, despite taking a hit earlier in April when U.S. President Donald Trump announced new global tariffs under what he called “Liberation Day.” Clients bring in $16 billion as bank slashes costs While the profits were up, Standard Chartered also revealed that its wealth division brought in $16 billion in new client assets during the quarter, an all-time high. This cash helped push pre-tax profits up by 44%, compared to the same time last year. In total, the bank posted $2.3 billion in quarterly profit, higher than both the $1.6 billion it earned last year and the $1.7 billion analysts had predicted. The bank’s key profitability metric, return on tangible equity, also jumped to 17.9%, beating expectations of 11.7%, and improving from 10.4% in the same quarter a year ago. At the same time, Standard Chartered is still neck-deep in a $1.5 billion cost-cutting program called “Fit for Growth.” That initiative is focused on making the bank leaner by trimming unnecessary expenses and dumping underperforming operations. These cost reductions range in size from small fixes worth a few hundred thousand dollars to major moves costing tens of millions. Around half of the total expected cuts are set to hit this year, with additional charges to follow as the bank continues to shut down non-core businesses, scale down infrastructure, and reduce property costs. CEO Bill Winters, who just marked his 10-year anniversary running the bank last month, has been driving most of these changes. His tenure hasn’t been quiet. Over the past decade, Bill has overseen multiple shakeups, rolled out a series of reorganizations, and cut thousands of jobs as part of a broader strategy to reduce risk and get the bank back on track. He’s also been steering the bank through tricky markets in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, where Standard Chartered has its deepest roots. “We’re performing well, while keeping a tight grip on costs, credit risk and capital,” Bill said in Thursday’s earnings statement. “Our strong first-half performance reflects continued successful execution of our strategy, through our focus on cross-border and affluent banking.” He added, “Through our unique network across Asia, Africa and the Middle East, we offer our clients the means to navigate volatile external conditions.” While the broader banking sector wrestles with rising political risk and the fallout from Trump’s trade war, Standard Chartered is betting that tightening operations and returning cash to investors is the right path forward. For now, it’s staying aggressive on both fronts, by cutting costs and buying back shares, as the environment grows more unpredictable. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Conversely, Japanese stocks gained ground following the Bank of Japan's expected decision to hold interest rates steady. Market participants, however, maintained a watchful stance due to the looming August 1st U.S. tariff deadline. Caution was also building ahead of key US economic data, such as jobs figures and PCE inflation. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that the U.S. will impose a 15% tariff on imports from South Korea as part of a new trade deal that avoids steeper levies. Gold rose above $3,290 per ounce on Thursday, rebounding from a more than 1% drop to a four-week low in the previous session. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.06% to above 40,800 while the broader Topix Index gained 0.3% to 2,930 on Thursday. The Japanese yen rose past 149 per dollar on Thursday, recovering from the previous session’s losses after the Bank of Japan left interest rates unchanged in a unanimous decision, as widely expected. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) unanimously decided to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate at 0.5% in its July meeting. This move, widely anticipated by the market, maintains borrowing costs at their highest level since 2008 and reflects the central bank's cautious stance on normalizing policy. Retail sales in Japan climbed by 2.0% year-on-year in June 2025, accelerating slightly from a downwardly revised 1.9% rise in the previous month and exceeding market expectations of 1.8% growth. Japan’s industrial production rose 1.7% month-over-month in June 2025, sharply beating market expectations of a 0.6% decline and bouncing back from a 0.1% fall in the previous month, flash data showed. Separate data showed, Japan’s housing starts fell 15.6% year-on-year in June 2025, slightly better than market expectations of a 15.8% drop and easing from May’s sharp 34.4% plunge—the steepest since September 2009. Japan’s consumer confidence index declined to 33.7 in July 2025, down from June’s four-month high of 34.5, and below market forecasts of 35.1. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.90% to below 3,600 while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.5% to 11,145 on Thursday, and the offshore yuan rose to around 7.19 per dollar on Thursday, snapping a five-session losing streak, even as investors weighed disappointing PMI data against cautious optimism from the latest Politburo meeting. Official data pointed to a loss of economic momentum in July, with the composite PMI dropping to a three-month low of 50.2 from June’s 50.7. Manufacturing activity remained in contraction, falling to 49.3 from 49.7, while the services PMI declined to 50.1 — its weakest reading in eight months — from 50.5. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.39% to 24,955 in early trade on Thursday, slipping for the third session following China’s weak PMI figures in July. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority kept its base rate unchanged at 4.75% on July 31, aligning with the U.S. Fed’s move to maintain its target range at 5.25%–5.5%. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.71% to 80,954, halting gains from the previous two sessions, while the Nifty also fell 0.6% to around 24,700 after US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian imports.

For traders engaged with BTC perpetual futures , the ability to gauge the collective mood of the market can be the difference between anticipating trends and being caught off guard. Today, we delve into a crucial indicator: the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures across major exchanges. This data offers a snapshot of how traders are positioning themselves, providing invaluable insights into potential market movements. Understanding BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios: A Foundation for Traders Before we dive into the numbers, let’s establish a clear understanding of what BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios represent. Essentially, this metric compares the number of long positions (bets that the price of Bitcoin will increase) against the number of short positions (bets that the price will decrease) over a specific period, in this case, 24 hours. Perpetual futures contracts are a popular derivative in crypto, allowing traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s price without an expiry date, making these ratios a continuous reflection of sentiment. Long Positions: Traders buying perpetual futures contracts, anticipating a price rise. Short Positions: Traders selling perpetual futures contracts, anticipating a price fall. The Ratio: A higher long percentage suggests bullish sentiment, while a higher short percentage indicates bearish sentiment. This ratio is a powerful tool because it directly reflects the conviction of traders. When a significant majority leans one way, it can signal an impending move or, conversely, a potential reversal if the market becomes overly stretched in one direction. Decoding the 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Landscape: What Do the Numbers Say? Let’s examine the aggregated 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios across various cryptocurrency exchanges. This overarching view provides a broad stroke of market sentiment. Total Market Sentiment (Past 24 Hours): Position Type Percentage Long 48.92% Short 51.08% The total data reveals a slight bearish bias, with short positions outweighing long positions by a narrow margin. This indicates that, on aggregate, more traders are currently betting on a downward movement for Bitcoin’s price in the perpetual futures market. However, the closeness of the percentages suggests a relatively balanced, albeit slightly cautious, market. Exchange-Specific Insights: Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io BTC Perpetual Futures Sentiment While the aggregate data offers a general overview, it’s often more insightful to look at individual exchanges. Different platforms cater to different types of traders, and their specific long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures can reveal unique pockets of sentiment or trading strategies. Top Three Exchanges (Past 24 Hours): Exchange Long % Short % Binance 48.72% 51.28% Bybit 48.55% 51.45% Gate.io 50.41% 49.59% Let’s break down these figures: Binance: As one of the largest exchanges, Binance’s data often reflects broader market sentiment. Its ratio of 48.72% long and 51.28% short mirrors the overall market’s slight bearish tilt, indicating that a significant portion of its active BTC perpetual futures traders are leaning short. This could suggest caution among its vast user base. Bybit: Bybit shows an even stronger short bias at 51.45% compared to 48.55% long. This platform is known for its derivatives trading, and a more pronounced short position here might indicate that its professional and active traders are more aggressively positioning for a downside move in Bitcoin. Gate.io: In contrast to Binance and Bybit, Gate.io presents a slightly bullish sentiment, with 50.41% long and 49.59% short. This subtle divergence suggests that traders on Gate.io might be more optimistic or are employing different strategies compared to their counterparts on other major exchanges. This could be due to a different user demographic or specific trading opportunities perceived on the platform. The varied sentiment across these exchanges highlights the importance of not just looking at aggregated data, but also understanding the nuances of different trading environments when analyzing BTC perpetual futures . Navigating Market Sentiment: How to Leverage BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios in Your Strategy So, how can you use these BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios to inform your trading decisions? While they are not a standalone crystal ball, they offer valuable context: Identifying Overextension: When the ratio is heavily skewed in one direction (e.g., 70% long or 70% short), it can signal an overextension. An overwhelmingly long ratio might precede a liquidation cascade if the price drops, as longs get squeezed. Conversely, an extreme short ratio could indicate a potential short squeeze if the price unexpectedly rises. Confirming Trends: If the price is trending up and the long-short ratio for BTC perpetual futures is consistently showing more long positions, it can confirm the strength of the bullish sentiment. The opposite applies to downtrends and short positions. Spotting Divergences: Sometimes, the ratio might diverge from the price action. For instance, if Bitcoin’s price is rising, but the long-short ratio shows an increasing number of shorts, it could indicate that traders are betting against the current rally, possibly expecting a reversal. Benefits: Provides a real-time pulse of trader sentiment. Helps identify potential market turning points or continuations. Complements other technical and fundamental analysis tools. Challenges: Not a Predictor: Ratios indicate sentiment, not guaranteed future price movements. Whale Influence: Large institutional or individual traders (whales) can heavily skew ratios, making them less representative of the broader market. Lagging Indicator: Sometimes, the ratio reacts to price movements rather than predicting them. Beyond Ratios: Complementary Metrics for BTC Perpetual Futures Analysis While BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios are insightful, they are best used in conjunction with other on-chain and market metrics. To build a comprehensive trading strategy, consider: Open Interest (OI): The total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. Rising OI alongside rising price and long positions can indicate strong conviction. Funding Rates: A mechanism in perpetual futures to keep the contract price close to the spot price. Positive funding rates mean longs pay shorts (bullish sentiment), negative means shorts pay longs (bearish sentiment). Volume: High trading volume accompanying a particular ratio can lend more credibility to the sentiment it reflects. Liquidations: Monitoring large liquidation events can highlight moments of extreme market pressure and potential price volatility. By combining these indicators with the long-short ratios, traders can develop a more robust understanding of the market dynamics surrounding BTC perpetual futures . Charting Your Course: The Future of BTC Perpetual Futures Trading The 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures provide a fascinating window into the current state of market sentiment. The slight overall bearish lean, with nuances across major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io, paints a picture of a cautious yet dynamic market. For astute traders, this data is not merely a collection of numbers but a narrative of collective hope and fear, opportunity and risk. While no single indicator guarantees success, integrating these ratios into a broader analytical framework can significantly enhance your ability to navigate the complex world of Bitcoin derivatives. Stay informed, stay analytical, and always trade with a clear strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are BTC perpetual futures? A1: BTC perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have a fixed settlement date, making them popular for continuous trading. Q2: How do long-short ratios help in trading BTC perpetual futures? A2: Long-short ratios indicate the prevailing market sentiment by showing the proportion of traders betting on a price increase (longs) versus those betting on a decrease (shorts). A significant imbalance can suggest an overbought or oversold market, potentially signaling a reversal or continuation. Q3: Why do different exchanges show different BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios? A3: Differences in ratios across exchanges can be attributed to various factors, including their unique user bases, regional preferences, liquidity, and even specific trading competitions or events that might influence trader behavior on that particular platform. Q4: Can I solely rely on long-short ratios for my BTC perpetual futures trading decisions? A4: No, it’s not advisable to rely solely on long-short ratios. While they are a valuable indicator of sentiment, they should be used in conjunction with other analytical tools like open interest, funding rates, trading volume, and technical analysis to form a more comprehensive and robust trading strategy. Q5: What does a high short percentage in BTC perpetual futures indicate? A5: A high short percentage indicates that a majority of traders are betting on a price decline for Bitcoin. While this suggests bearish sentiment, an extremely high short percentage could also precede a ‘short squeeze’ if the price unexpectedly rises, forcing short sellers to buy back to cover their positions. Q6: Where can I find real-time BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio data? A6: Many cryptocurrency data platforms and leading exchanges provide real-time or near real-time data on BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios, often found in their derivatives or market analysis sections.

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, such an event isn’t just a fantasy – it’s a reality that recently unfolded, captivating the attention of enthusiasts and analysts alike. The activation of a long-dormant Bitcoin wallet, holding a staggering 50 BTC valued at $5.91 million, after 15.3 years of inactivity, has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape. This isn’t just about a large sum of money; it’s a profound reminder of Bitcoin’s early days and the incredible journey it has taken. What Just Happened with This Dormant Bitcoin Wallet? The crypto community was abuzz following a report from the blockchain tracker, Whale Alert, renowned for monitoring significant cryptocurrency movements. Their Telegram channel announced the activation of a Bitcoin address that had remained untouched since April 2009. To put that into perspective, Bitcoin itself was only launched in January 2009. This means the Dormant Bitcoin Wallet in question was created and funded within months of Bitcoin’s genesis, making its contents truly historic. The Asset: 50 Bitcoins (BTC) Current Value: Approximately $5.91 million (at the time of activation) Dormancy Period: 15.3 years Original Funding Date: April 2009 (just three months after Bitcoin’s launch) Source of Report: Blockchain tracker Whale Alert The Enduring Mystery: Who Owns This Dormant Bitcoin Wallet? Whenever a significant Dormant Bitcoin Wallet springs to life after such a prolonged period, the immediate question on everyone’s mind is: ‘Who is behind this activation?’ The possibilities are numerous and intriguing, each painting a different picture of the early days of crypto adoption. Early Adopter or Visionary: It could belong to an individual who recognized Bitcoin’s potential in its infancy, acquired coins when they were virtually worthless, and then simply forgot about them or decided to hold them for an extremely long term. This person might have resurfaced after rediscovering old keys or deciding the time was finally right. Lost Keys, Now Found: One of the most common tales in the crypto world involves lost private keys. Thousands, if not millions, of Bitcoins are believed to be inaccessible due to misplaced or destroyed wallets. The activation of this Dormant Bitcoin Wallet could be a rare success story of someone meticulously searching and finally recovering their access. The Satoshi Theory: While highly speculative, some might even wonder if it’s connected to Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, or one of the very first miners. Wallets from Bitcoin’s earliest days are often scrutinized for any potential link to Satoshi’s known addresses, though this specific wallet hasn’t been definitively linked. Institutional or Early Developer Fund: Less likely for such an early wallet, but it could potentially be a fund belonging to an early developer or a small group, now being consolidated or moved for various reasons. Why Activate a Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Now, After So Long? The timing of this activation is as fascinating as the dormancy itself. After 15 years of silence, what prompted the owner of this Dormant Bitcoin Wallet to finally make a move? Several factors could be at play: Peak Market Conditions: Bitcoin has recently seen significant price surges, nearing all-time highs. This elevated value could have incentivized the owner to finally access their long-forgotten fortune, perhaps to realize profits or diversify their holdings. Financial Need or Planning: Life circumstances change. The owner might have a new financial goal, a large investment, or a personal need that requires access to such a substantial sum. Rediscovery of Access: As mentioned, the simplest explanation is often the most plausible. The owner might have stumbled upon an old hard drive, a forgotten paper wallet, or recovered a seed phrase that had been lost for years. The effort involved in recovering such a wallet after so long would likely be immense. Security Consolidation: With advancements in wallet security and cold storage solutions, the owner might be moving their funds from an older, potentially less secure address to a more robust, modern storage method. This is a common practice for large holders. Estate Planning: In some cases, these activations occur as part of estate planning or inheritance processes, where beneficiaries finally gain access to digital assets after the original owner’s passing. The Profound Significance of Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Activations The activation of this particular Dormant Bitcoin Wallet is more than just a news headline; it carries significant weight for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. It underscores several key aspects of Bitcoin’s nature and history: Scarcity and Value Appreciation: This event vividly illustrates Bitcoin’s incredible journey from an obscure digital experiment to a multi-trillion-dollar asset class. The 50 BTC acquired for pennies are now worth millions, highlighting the power of long-term holding and Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity. Decentralization and Immutability: The fact that these funds remained untouched and secure for over a decade and a half, without any central authority interference, reinforces Bitcoin’s core principles of decentralization and the immutability of its blockchain. The funds were always there, waiting for their rightful owner. Market Sentiment Indicator: While one wallet activation doesn’t dictate market trends, large movements from dormant addresses can sometimes spark curiosity about potential selling pressure or shifts in large holders’ strategies. However, in this case, the historical significance often outweighs immediate market impact. A Glimpse into Early Adoption: Each activated Dormant Bitcoin Wallet from the early days offers a unique glimpse into the very first individuals who believed in or experimented with this nascent technology. They are digital artifacts of Bitcoin’s genesis. Navigating the Challenges of Holding Dormant Bitcoin While the story of this reactivated Dormant Bitcoin Wallet is inspiring, it also brings to light the inherent challenges and risks associated with holding cryptocurrency, especially over extended periods: Loss of Private Keys: This is arguably the biggest risk. Without your private keys or seed phrase, your Bitcoin is irretrievably lost. Many early adopters stored their keys on now-obsolete hardware, forgotten paper wallets, or unbacked digital files. Security Vulnerabilities: Older storage methods might not be as secure as current ones. Moving funds to a new, secure wallet is often a wise decision once access is regained. Inheritance Issues: Passing on digital assets can be complex. Without proper estate planning, beneficiaries might never discover or access a deceased loved one’s Bitcoin holdings. Psychological Challenges: The temptation to sell during bull runs or panic during bear markets is immense. Holding for 15 years requires incredible discipline or, as in this case, perhaps a fortunate oversight. Protecting Your Bitcoin: Actionable Insights from the Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Saga The tale of the activated Dormant Bitcoin Wallet serves as a powerful lesson in cryptocurrency security and long-term planning. Here are some actionable insights for anyone holding Bitcoin or other digital assets: Secure Your Private Keys: Use hardware wallets for cold storage. Never store your seed phrase digitally or share it. Consider a multi-signature setup for added security. Backup and Redundancy: Create multiple, geographically dispersed backups of your seed phrase or private keys. Use robust, fireproof, and waterproof storage solutions. Regularly Verify Access: Periodically (e.g., once a year) practice restoring a small amount of crypto from your backup to ensure your recovery method works. Estate Planning for Digital Assets: Incorporate your cryptocurrency holdings into your estate plan. Provide clear, secure instructions for your beneficiaries on how to access your digital assets. Consider using legal tools or specialized services for this. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with best practices in crypto security. The landscape evolves, and new threats or solutions emerge. Avoid ‘Set It and Forget It’ for Too Long: While long-term holding is often praised, completely forgetting about a significant holding for 15 years, while it worked out here, is not a recommended security strategy. Regular, secure checks are advisable. The activation of this Dormant Bitcoin Wallet is more than just a headline; it’s a profound narrative that encapsulates the very essence of Bitcoin’s journey. It speaks to the incredible foresight of early adopters, the unwavering security of the blockchain, and the life-changing potential of holding digital assets over the long term. As Bitcoin continues to mature, such awakenings serve as thrilling reminders of its mysterious past and its promising future. This historic movement inspires us to ponder the possibilities that lie within the digital frontier, emphasizing both the risks and rewards of this revolutionary technology.

This acknowledgment comes from the recently published Digital Asset Report, which emphasizes the importance of decentralized oracles in the functioning of stablecoins and tokenized assets. Chainlink’s Importance In DeFi Market expert Quinten Francois highlighted this recognition on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), stating, “WHITE HOUSE JUST MENTIONED CHAINLINK.” The report underscores how oracles act as a bridge connecting external data sources to blockchain networks, enabling smart contracts to execute agreements based on real-world events and prices. Related Reading: BlackRock Staking For Its Spot Ethereum ETF Has Been Acknowledged — But What’s Coming For ETH? This functionality is crucial for decentralized applications (dApps) that facilitate a range of financial activities, including trading, lending, and earning rewards. Chainlink’s role becomes even more vital in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), where dApps often serve as cross-chain bridges, allowing assets to move seamlessly between different blockchain networks. These wrapped assets, which exist on one chain but are represented on another, illustrate the growing complexity and interconnectivity of the blockchain ecosystem. New Era For The US Financial System Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, responded positively to the White House’s endorsement, expressing his appreciation for the administration’s commitment to advancing the blockchain industry. Nazarov noted that Chainlink’s recognition represents a critical moment for both the industry and the broader US financial system. Chainlink’s co-founder further noted: I think the president’s (Trump) clear placing of our industry as a national priority will be seen as a critical and historic moment for our industry and for the United States financial system’s role globally. Nazarov distinguished the report’s focus on oracles, particularly the Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which according to his assessment highlights the innovative work being done by the Chainlink community to enhance smart contract capabilities.

An earlier report by Bitcoinist also notes that the White House encourages Congress to implement laws that embrace decentralized finance technologies, recognizing their potential to reshape traditional finance. Despite the optimism surrounding these developments, some industry leaders had anticipated further details regarding a federal Bitcoin (BTC) reserve, a topic notably absent from the report. During a press briefing, a White House official mentioned that infrastructure for this initiative is currently being developed, with more information expected in the near future. Despite this development, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, remained unfazed, currently trading at $17.80. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading 66% below its record high of $52.

In a new YouTube update, Gromen says that the US will likely address its growing $36 trillion national debt by printing more money, which debases the dollar, rather than allowing Treasury yields to soar to try and attract investors. “Now the credit risk is at the Treasury market level, except Treasuries have no credit risk. The government can always just print the money to make interest payments and avoid default. So there’s no credit risk in Treasuries, there’s only inflation risk. In my opinion, what we’re seeing in Bitcoin treasury companies, particularly, is logical in light of this primrose path that we’ve followed over the last 25 years, as more and more people begin to realize that the only way out of this is severe devaluation of US debt, of US sovereign debt, of Western sovereign debt. In that case, I would expect credit spreads to remain relatively low, because all else equal, I’d rather own an Apple bond or a Microsoft bond than a US Treasury bond.” Gromen also says the US may be facing an Argentina-style economic future, a reference to the South American country’s problems of high inflation and devaluation of its local currency. “And now huge caveat, unless the US government ever decides, even for a period of time, to stand aside and let the Treasury market dysfunction, but then you’re going to get credit spreads to really blow out as we’ve seen. The credit risks of everything goes to the moon, except for probably gold in that case, to be honest. But again, I don’t think that’s going to be allowed to happen for more than a few weeks, few days at a time. Ultimately, I think what we are watching … is something we’ve long called for to happen and referred to as Argentina with US characteristics, or US with Argentina characteristics, however you want to phrase it. Stocks are up this year in dollars. They’re down in gold, in Bitcoin. We’re seeing pressure from the President’s administration on the central bank [chairman] because they need interest rates down to be able to afford the debt, to be able to reduce the interest expense, to reduce the fiscal pressures.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Despite an increasingly competitive blockchain landscape, a significant shift is underway: projections indicate that Ethereum dApp activity is poised to not just match but remarkably surpass its 2024 levels. This isn’t just a hopeful whisper; it’s a data-backed expectation that underscores Ethereum’s enduring relevance and magnetic appeal in the Web3 space. For anyone invested in the future of digital finance, art, gaming, or simply the decentralized web, understanding this trajectory is paramount. Let’s dive deep into what’s driving this anticipated surge and why Ethereum remains a central pillar of the decentralized future. Understanding the Surge in Ethereum dApp Activity When we talk about Ethereum dApp activity , we’re referring to the collective engagement with decentralized applications built on the Ethereum blockchain. This includes everything from interacting with DeFi protocols, trading NFTs, playing blockchain games, or participating in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Metrics like daily active users, transaction volume, total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols, and NFT sales volume all contribute to painting a comprehensive picture of this activity. Ethereum, as the pioneering smart contract platform, has historically been the go-to blockchain for developers looking to build complex, decentralized applications. Its robust security, extensive developer tooling, and vibrant community have fostered an ecosystem that, despite its challenges, continues to attract innovation and user engagement. The steady engagement observed throughout 2024 wasn’t accidental; it was a testament to the platform’s foundational strength and its ability to adapt and evolve. What’s Fueling This Remarkable Ethereum dApp Growth? The projected surge in Ethereum dApp activity isn’t based on mere speculation. It’s driven by several tangible factors that have seen renewed interest and significant development over the past year. According to DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas, three key sectors have been instrumental in this momentum: Renewed Interest in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) Beyond Collectibles: While early NFT hype was largely centered around digital art and collectibles, the market has matured. We’re now seeing NFTs being integrated into gaming (GameFi), digital identity, ticketing, and even real-world asset tokenization. This expansion of utility has broadened the appeal and potential for sustained engagement. Ethereum’s Dominance: Ethereum remains the primary network for high-value NFT collections and marketplaces. Its established infrastructure and liquidity continue to make it the preferred choice for creators and collectors alike, driving significant transaction volumes and user interactions. The Proliferation of Layer-2 Ecosystems One of Ethereum’s long-standing challenges has been scalability and high transaction fees (gas fees), especially during periods of peak network congestion. This is where Layer-2 (L2) solutions have stepped in, offering a powerful remedy. L2s are separate blockchains that extend Ethereum’s capabilities by handling transactions off the mainnet (Layer-1) and then batching them back to Ethereum for final settlement, significantly reducing costs and increasing transaction throughput. The rapid adoption and development of L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and zkSync have been game-changers for Ethereum dApp activity . These networks provide a much more user-friendly and cost-effective environment for everyday dApp interactions, from swapping tokens to playing games, all while inheriting the robust security of the Ethereum mainnet. This has opened the floodgates for new users and more frequent interactions that might have been cost-prohibitive on Layer-1. The Evolution and Resilience of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) DeFi, the ecosystem of financial applications built on blockchain, found its genesis and continues to thrive predominantly on Ethereum. From decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap to lending protocols like Aave and Compound, Ethereum hosts the vast majority of DeFi’s total value locked (TVL) and user base. The sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience and innovation, moving beyond simple lending and borrowing to include: Yield Farming and Staking: New strategies for earning passive income. Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs): Allowing users to stake ETH and still use their staked assets in DeFi. Real-World Assets (RWAs): Tokenizing tangible assets like real estate or bonds, bridging traditional finance with DeFi. This continuous innovation ensures that DeFi remains a powerful magnet for capital and users, cementing Ethereum’s central role in high-value Web3 sectors. Navigating the Competitive Web3 Landscape: Is Ethereum dApp Dominance Secure? It’s undeniable that Ethereum faces fierce competition. Blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Polkadot have emerged, each vying for a share of the dApp market with promises of higher throughput and lower fees. While these networks have carved out their niches and attracted significant projects, Ethereum’s position as the leading smart contract platform for dApps remains largely unchallenged in terms of overall value and developer mindshare. Why does Ethereum continue to hold its ground? Several factors contribute to its enduring dominance: Unparalleled Security: Post-Merge, Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism provides an extremely high level of security, making it the most trusted network for high-value transactions and critical applications. Deepest Liquidity: Ethereum boasts the largest and most liquid ecosystem for digital assets, making it easier for users to trade and for protocols to function efficiently. Robust Developer Community: Ethereum has the largest and most active developer community in the blockchain space. This translates to continuous innovation, better tooling, and a constant influx of new dApps and improvements. Network Effects: The sheer number of users, developers, and applications built on Ethereum creates powerful network effects, making it increasingly valuable for new participants to join. Here’s a simplified comparison of key aspects often considered when evaluating dApp platforms: Feature Ethereum (Mainnet + L2s) Competitor Chains (e.g., Solana, BNB Chain) Security & Decentralization Highest, battle-tested, extensive node network Good, but often more centralized than Ethereum Scalability Significantly improved with L2s; ongoing L1 upgrades High native throughput, but can face outages Transaction Fees Variable on L1; very low on L2s Generally low, but can spike Developer Ecosystem Largest, most mature, rich tooling Growing, but smaller and less mature Total Value Locked (TVL) Dominant share, especially in DeFi Significant, but trailing Ethereum Ethereum dApp Activity Beyond 2024: Projections for 2025 The momentum observed in 2024 is not expected to wane; in fact, it’s projected to accelerate. Sara Gherghelas’s insight from DappRadar highlights that Ethereum continues to play a central role in high-value Web3 sectors, and this momentum is likely to carry through 2025. This optimism stems from several factors: Continued L2 Adoption: As L2s become even more efficient and user-friendly, a greater volume of everyday transactions and user interactions will migrate to these layers, boosting overall Ethereum dApp activity . Upcoming Protocol Upgrades: While The Merge focused on consensus, future upgrades (like those focused on data availability and sharding) are aimed at further enhancing scalability and reducing costs, making Ethereum even more attractive for dApp development and usage. Institutional Interest: Growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is likely to spill over into the dApp space, particularly in areas like tokenized assets and enterprise blockchain solutions built on or connected to Ethereum. Innovation Cycle: The Web3 space is characterized by rapid innovation. New use cases for dApps, especially in areas like decentralized social media, digital identity, and real-world asset tokenization, are constantly emerging, ensuring a fresh wave of user engagement. Challenges and Opportunities for Future Ethereum dApp Development While the outlook for Ethereum dApp activity is overwhelmingly positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges that remain and the opportunities they present for further growth and innovation. Challenges: Scalability for Mass Adoption: Despite L2s, true mass adoption for billions of users still requires significant advancements. The goal is to make interacting with dApps as seamless and inexpensive as using traditional web applications. User Experience (UX) Complexity: For many new users, interacting with dApps can still be daunting. Wallet management, gas fees, and understanding smart contract interactions present barriers to entry. Simplifying UX through account abstraction and intuitive interfaces is critical. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving global regulatory landscape poses challenges for dApp developers and users. Clearer regulations could foster greater confidence and adoption, but uncertainty can stifle innovation. Interoperability: While Ethereum is dominant, the blockchain ecosystem is multi-chain. Ensuring seamless interoperability between Ethereum and other networks, as well as traditional systems, is an ongoing challenge. Opportunities: Account Abstraction: This technology aims to make crypto wallets more user-friendly, enabling features like gas payment in any token, social recovery, and multi-factor authentication, which could onboard millions of new users to dApps.

The purchase, worth roughly $56.9 million, will be part of the company’s long-term accumulation strategy. The Ether Reserve LLC made the purchase, bringing its total ETH bought and committed to around 334,757. The firm also revealed that it has nearly $407 million remaining for additional ETH purchases. Ether Machine shifts focus to treasury deployment The Ether Reserve has purchased nearly 15,000 ETH today as part of our long-term accumulation strategy. This brings total ETH purchased and committed to 334,757 with up to $407,000,000 USD remaining for additional ETH purchases. ""We couldn't imagine a better way to commemorate… — The Ether Machine (@TheEtherMachine) July 30, 2025 The Ether Machine mentioned that the initiative was timed to coincide with Ethereum’s 10th anniversary. The company plans to continue with ETH purchases as part of its treasury deployment strategy. The crypto firm argued that its treasury deployment of ETH depicts its belief that Ethereum is the most important asset of the decentralized internet. The Ether Machine added that the purchase reflects its mission to build a long-term, institutional-grade ETH treasury. “We couldn’t imagine a better way to commemorate Ethereum’s 10th birthday than by deepening our commitment to ether. Our mandate is to accumulate, compound, and support ETH for the long term – not just as a financial asset, but as the backbone of a new internet economy.” – Andrew Keys , Chairman and Co-Founder of The Ether Machine. The Ether Machine revealed that the Ethereum-focused public vehicle leveraged the $97 million in cash proceeds from its previously announced private placement to buy the digital assets. The company will also use the remaining proceeds to buy additional ETH in the coming days. The firm’s chair also made a personal donation worth $100,000 to a community-led funding initiative called the Protocol Guild. According to Keys, he attributed the donation in appreciation to the network’s contributors and Ethereum’s achievements over the past decade. The Ether Machine’s chair acknowledged that the project focuses on open-source sustainability in Web3. The Protocol Guild also supports Ethereum’s core protocol contributors with a commitment of millions of dollars to researchers, developers, and maintainers of the ETH network. Ether Machine plans to list on Nasdaq The crypto treasury company also announced plans to debut trading on the Nasdaq last week by merging with blank check company Dynamix Corporation. The crypto firm will trade under the ticker ETHM. Keys said The Ether Machine will commit approximately $645 million (169,984 ETH) in an anchor investment, with an additional $800 million in committed capital. The firm targets over $1.5 billion in gross proceeds to build the largest public Ether generation company. The firm will finalize the deal in Q4 of 2025. The Ether Machine aims to help institutional investors access Ethereum, earn ETH-denominated yield, and participate directly in the network. The firm wants to focus on yield generation through staking, restaking, and decentralized finance strategies, rather than just buying and holding ETH. The crypto company said it focused on Ether because it’s the backbone of the digital economy, noting that it’s the first firm purpose-built to own ETH, manage ETH, and compound ETH yield. The digital asset settles over $14 trillion yearly and is responsible for the majority of DeFi activity across the network. Keys argued that investors would get exposure to the coin’s price by purchasing ether from a crypto exchange or buying shares of an ether ETF. He added that investors won’t have access to the dividend of the ETF. He explained that the current ETFs don’t generate yield because they don’t enable staking, but The Ether Machine can enable staking with other additional risk management initiatives. Keys believes that staking makes Ether a more productive asset than Bitcoin. BlackRock also plans to include staking of its ETHA Ether ETF. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In a significant move that could set a global precedent, South Korean financial authorities are taking decisive action to bring much-needed clarity to the burgeoning crypto lending sector. This isn’t just another regulatory announcement; it’s a landmark initiative designed to foster a safer, more transparent environment for participants in South Korea crypto lending . Why is South Korea Stepping Up on Crypto Lending Regulation? The past few years have highlighted both the immense potential and the inherent risks within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, particularly concerning crypto lending services. While these platforms offer attractive yields and flexible financing options, the lack of clear oversight has led to catastrophic collapses, impacting millions of investors globally. Consider the dramatic downfalls of major crypto lending platforms like Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, and the Terra/Luna ecosystem. These events served as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in unregulated markets, from opaque lending practices and insufficient collateralization to liquidity crises and outright fraud. Investors lost billions, and confidence in the broader crypto ecosystem was severely shaken. South Korea, with its highly active and tech-savvy population, has a significant stake in the digital asset space. The nation’s financial regulators understand that for the crypto market to mature and achieve mainstream adoption, investor protection and market stability are paramount. This proactive stance on South Korea crypto lending regulations aims to prevent similar future catastrophes within its borders and instill greater trust among its citizens and institutions. Understanding the Task Force: Who’s Involved in Shaping South Korea Crypto Lending? This isn’t a unilateral decree from the government; it’s a collaborative effort, which is a crucial aspect of its potential success. On July 31, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) – South Korea’s primary financial watchdogs – convened a pivotal first meeting in Seoul. But they weren’t alone. Joining them were representatives from the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) and five of the nation’s leading domestic crypto exchanges. This collaboration signifies a recognition that effective regulation must be informed by industry insights and practical realities. The key players include: Financial Services Commission (FSC): The top financial regulator responsible for setting overall policy and direction for the financial markets. Financial Supervisory Service (FSS): The executive body that supervises and examines financial institutions, ensuring compliance with regulations. Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA): A self-regulatory body formed by South Korea’s major crypto exchanges (Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax). DAXA aims to establish industry best practices and enhance investor protection. Five Domestic Crypto Exchanges: The operational front-liners who possess invaluable practical experience and direct interaction with the market and its users. Their input is vital for crafting rules that are both effective and implementable. This multi-stakeholder approach ensures that the guidelines for South Korea crypto lending are comprehensive, taking into account not just regulatory principles but also the unique characteristics and operational nuances of the digital asset market. What Will the New South Korea Crypto Lending Rules Address? The primary objective of this task force is to establish a baseline regulatory framework for crypto lending services. This framework is expected to draw lessons from several critical areas: Global Regulatory Trends: Regulators are closely observing how other major jurisdictions like the United States, European Union, and the United Kingdom are approaching crypto regulation, particularly concerning lending and staking services. The aim is to align with international best practices where appropriate, fostering cross-border regulatory coherence. Equity Market Practices: Traditional financial markets have decades of experience in regulating lending, securities, and investor protection. The task force will likely adapt proven principles from equity markets, such as robust disclosure requirements, risk assessment methodologies, collateral management standards, and clear dispute resolution mechanisms, to the crypto lending space. Unique Characteristics of South Korea’s Digital Asset Market: The task force will also consider the specific dynamics of the South Korean market, including its high retail participation, technological infrastructure, and existing legal frameworks for financial products. This ensures the rules are tailored and effective for the local ecosystem. Specific areas the new rules for South Korea crypto lending are expected to address include: Area of Focus Potential Regulatory Measures Transparency & Disclosure Mandatory disclosure of risks, terms of service, interest rates, and platform solvency. Risk Management Requirements for collateralization ratios, liquidity management, and stress testing of lending protocols. Investor Protection Clear guidelines on asset segregation, handling of defaults, and mechanisms for investor recourse. Operational Standards Licensing requirements for lending platforms, cybersecurity protocols, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. Prohibited Practices Potential bans on excessively risky or predatory lending practices. Global Context: How Does South Korea Crypto Lending Fit In? South Korea’s move is part of a broader global trend towards regulating digital assets. Jurisdictions worldwide are grappling with how to integrate crypto into existing financial frameworks without stifling innovation. For instance, the European Union is moving forward with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which aims to create a comprehensive framework for crypto assets, including stablecoins and other services. The United States continues to debate various approaches, with agencies like the SEC and CFTC asserting jurisdiction over different aspects of the crypto market. By actively developing its own comprehensive guidelines, South Korea positions itself not just as a follower, but as a potential leader in crafting effective regulatory solutions. The experience and insights gained from developing South Korea crypto lending rules could serve as a valuable case study for other nations looking to navigate similar challenges. This also underscores the growing consensus among major economies that a hands-off approach to crypto is no longer viable, especially for services that mimic traditional financial products. Challenges and Opportunities for South Korea Crypto Lending While the intent is clear, the path to effective regulation is fraught with challenges, yet it also presents significant opportunities. Challenges: Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Overly stringent rules could stifle the very innovation that makes crypto so dynamic. The task force must find a delicate balance that protects users without crushing the industry’s growth. Defining Complex Assets: The legal classification of various crypto assets (e.g., whether a lending token constitutes a security) remains a complex issue that can impact regulatory jurisdiction and requirements. Cross-Border Enforcement: The global and decentralized nature of crypto makes enforcement across national borders inherently difficult. Regulatory arbitrage remains a concern. Rapid Technological Evolution: The crypto space evolves at an incredible pace. Regulations must be flexible enough to adapt to new technologies and business models without becoming quickly outdated. Opportunities: Enhanced Investor Confidence: Clear rules build trust, encouraging more retail and institutional investors to participate in the market. Attracting Institutional Adoption: Institutions typically require regulatory clarity and reduced risk before committing significant capital to new asset classes. Robust regulations for South Korea crypto lending could unlock substantial institutional investment. Fostering a Mature Market: By weeding out bad actors and enforcing best practices, the market can become more stable, predictable, and resilient to shocks. Setting a Global Precedent: South Korea’s proactive and collaborative approach could serve as a model for other nations, contributing to a more harmonized global regulatory landscape. Looking Ahead: The Future of South Korea Crypto Lending The announcement that these guidelines are expected to roll out next month signifies a rapid and determined effort by South Korean authorities. This initial framework is unlikely to be the final word; regulation is an iterative process. We can anticipate ongoing dialogue, industry feedback, and potential revisions as the market continues to evolve and new challenges emerge. For crypto businesses operating in South Korea, this means a period of adaptation. Platforms will need to review and potentially revise their operational procedures, compliance frameworks, and disclosure practices to align with the new rules. For individual investors, it promises a safer environment, with greater transparency and reduced exposure to the kinds of risks that have plagued the industry in the past. This forward-thinking approach to South Korea crypto lending is a testament to the nation’s commitment to building a secure and thriving digital economy. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Lending in South Korea South Korea’s formation of a joint task force with the crypto industry to develop lending rules is a pivotal moment for the nation’s digital asset landscape. By proactively addressing the complexities and risks associated with crypto lending, the FSC, FSS, DAXA, and the participating exchanges are laying the groundwork for a more secure, transparent, and trustworthy market. This landmark initiative is not merely about imposing restrictions; it’s about fostering sustainable growth, protecting investors, and ensuring that South Korea crypto lending can thrive responsibly. As these new guidelines come into effect, they will undoubtedly contribute to a more mature and resilient global crypto ecosystem, paving the way for greater innovation built on a foundation of trust. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto lending? A1: Crypto lending involves users lending out their cryptocurrency assets to borrowers, typically through decentralized or centralized platforms, in exchange for interest payments. Borrowers often use these funds for trading, arbitrage, or to gain liquidity without selling their assets, usually by providing collateral. Q2: Why is South Korea regulating crypto lending now? A2: South Korea is regulating crypto lending due to the significant growth of the sector and the substantial investor losses experienced globally from unregulated platforms (e.g., Celsius, Terra/Luna). The aim is to enhance investor protection, ensure market stability, and prevent financial crimes within the South Korea crypto lending market. Q3: Who is involved in the task force developing these rules? A3: The task force includes key South Korean financial authorities: the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS). They are collaborating with the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) and five major domestic crypto exchanges, ensuring both regulatory and industry perspectives are considered. Q4: What kind of rules can we expect for South Korea crypto lending? A4: The new rules are expected to establish a baseline regulatory framework. This will likely include requirements for transparency, risk management, investor protection (e.g., asset segregation, disclosure), operational standards for platforms, and potentially a clear definition of what constitutes a crypto lending product. They will draw from global trends and traditional equity market practices. Q5: How will these new regulations impact crypto users in South Korea? A5: For crypto users, these regulations are intended to create a safer and more reliable environment. They can expect greater transparency from lending platforms, better protection of their assets, and clearer recourse mechanisms in case of issues. While some services might become more restrictive, the overall goal is to build trust and foster sustainable growth in South Korea crypto lending . Q6: When are these new crypto lending rules expected to be rolled out? A6: The initial guidelines from the task force are expected to be rolled out as early as next month, signaling a swift implementation process by the South Korean financial authorities.

On Wednesday, the one-year put-call skew —the difference in implied volatility between call and put options expiring in 12 months —rose to 3.6%, the highest since April 17, according to data source Market Chameleon . In other words, the demand for put options, which offer protection against price losses, relative to calls, is now strongest in over three months. AI's take A rising put-call IV spread means that the implied volatility of put options (which profit if the stock price falls) is increasing much faster, or is significantly higher, than the implied volatility of call options (which profit if the stock price rises). This suggests that options traders are willing to pay a much higher premium for downside protection or are betting more aggressively on a decline in MSTR's stock price. It reflects a growing apprehension or outright bearish sentiment among options traders regarding MSTR's future performance over the next year. They are pricing in a higher probability of a significant drop in the stock. A put option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset, MSTR, at a predetermined price on or before a later date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, while a call buyer is bullish. MSTR is the largest publicly listed bitcoin holder in the world, boasting a coin stash of 628,791 BTC ($74.7 billion). The company has been aggressively buying BTC as a balance sheet asset for five years in a trend-setting move for corporates around the world. However, its stock price has been struggling lately. MSTR has dropped by over 14% to $292 in two weeks, closing just below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) on Wednesday.",Markets|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|Options|Markets|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-31 07:25:39

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) are a stealth play that could turn into this season’s biggest breakout. Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 6, with the token priced at $0.035, an increase of 16.17% from the previous phase. The next price rise is set at 14.29%, which will take the token to $0.04. Investors who invest during this phase will experience a return on investment of 71.43% upon launch of the token at $0.06.

Pepe Coin (PEPE) Retests Key Levels Near $0.000012 Amid Meme Speculation Pepe Coin is currently trading around $0.0000123, down roughly 5–7% from recent highs in the $0.0000126–$0.0000127 range, and about 55% below its December 2024 all-time high near $0.0000283. Despite the pullback, PEPE maintains strong liquidity and remains firmly within the top tier of meme coins. While PEPE continues to embody meme coin dynamics, attention in the crypto space is also expanding toward emerging DeFi projects such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance has recently finalized its Phase 5 presale and has moved into Phase 6, where the tokens are selling for $0.035, a 16.17% rise from the previous phase.

The MUTM presale has already accumulated over $13.8 million and acquired over 14,700 unique holders. $50K Bug Bounty Launched: Mutuum Finance Partners with CertiK Apart from auditing Mutuum Finance, CertiK has also been involved in carrying out a Bug Bounty Program. The program has a reward pool of $50,000 USDT. Four severities that is low, minor, major and critical will be rewarded upon. The action demonstrates the desire of Mutuum Finance to establish community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Priority to Security and Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also rolling out a stablecoin that will be USD-pegged on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be a secure and stable investment vehicle to avoid risk and volatility that can be observed with algorithmic stablecoins. The project has additionally been audited extensively by Certik for user funds security as well as blockchain security. The success is an attestation of the vision of Mutuum Finance to be an open as well as institutional-grade DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Launches Huge Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway where participants will be rewarded with $10,000 MUTM. In addition, its newly launched leaderboard system will also reward the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders. Mutuum Finance has already secured $13.8 million from over 14,700 holders, and momentum keeps building as Phase 6 tokens hold at $0.035 before the next 14.29% jump to $0.04. Early investors stand to lock in a 71.43% ROI when the token hits its $0.06 launch price, while Pepe Coin continues to hold its position in the meme coin market.

This article delves into the potential of ONDO and ENA coins in the next big bull cycle after 2025. Which of these digital assets could skyrocket and make this dream a reality? Find out which coins are poised for enormous growth and how many might be needed to reach this financial milestone. Ondo Market Dynamics Ahead of a Bull Run Ondo gained about 21.38% in the past month despite a weekly drop of nearly 15.87%. Over the last six months, the coin has lost 38.55%, indicating significant fluctuations with sudden reversals. Periods of recovery were often followed by sharp declines, highlighting its volatility in a changing market. Price movements have demonstrated notable swings, reflecting the challenges that investors face during these transitions. The coin is trading in a range between $0.62 and $0.92. Resistance is seen at $1.07, with a stronger level around $1.37, while the nearest support is at $0.47 and another at $0.17. The indicators show mixed signals. Bears currently dominate following the week's drop, although the month's recovery suggests bulls are stepping in. Trading strategies may focus on buying at support zones or shorting near resistance levels. Movement above $1.07 could lead to higher resistance tests, while a fall below $0.47 may prompt further declines. The market lacks a clear trend, necessitating careful trades based on support and resistance. Ethena Price Action: Short-Term Surge Amid Long-Term Correction Ethena has experienced a remarkable short-term surge with a one-month increase of 108.49% and a weekly jump of 14.41%. However, the price has dropped 24.02% over the past six months. These figures show bursts of buying interest followed by longer periods of correction. Price moves have been volatile, marked by strong gains in the near term against a slower downturn over a longer period. Ethena responds quickly to market shifts, providing traders moments of opportunity amid overall uncertainty. The coin is currently trading between $0.20 and $0.35, with a strong resistance level at $0.44 and a second hurdle at $0.60. Support sits at $0.14, serving as a cushion if the price dips further. The RSI reading of 65.47 suggests potential overbought conditions, while the momentum indicator of 0.09 indicates some ongoing buying pressure. Bulls appear to control the price in the short term, but the lack of a clear trend warrants caution. A trading strategy could involve entering near the support level and taking profits close to resistance while maintaining tight stop-losses to manage risk. Conclusion Accumulating a significant number of ONDO and ENA coins could potentially lead to substantial wealth after the next bull cycle in 2025. It's crucial to analyze current market trends, project developments, and historical performance for both coins. Careful investment strategies and continuous monitoring of price movements are essential. Diversification and informed decision-making will be key factors in achieving financial goals. Thus, acquiring and holding the right quantity of these assets might lead to a seven-figure portfolio post-2025. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Big wallets have been quietly trimming their bags, and the once-vibrant meme coin energy has taken a back seat. This isn’t just noise. It’s a signal, one that sharper traders are reading loud and clear. The memecoin era isn’t over, but eyes are shifting toward projects with deeper roots and real-world direction. That’s exactly why Ozak AI is suddenly on the radar. Built at the sharp edge of AI token infrastructure and blockchain technology, this platform isn’t playing the short game. With a strong tech backbone, an actual use case, and a growing ecosystem, it’s shaping up to be more than just another shiny coin. AI Token Infrastructure That’s Actually Doing Something Ozak AI is not your average AI project. It starts with a real mission, combining artificial intelligence and blockchain into a working platform that’s both smart and scalable. No fluff, no empty promises. Just systems that run on a decentralized physical infrastructure network , built for serious uptime. It makes it stable and almost annoyingly reliable. Every action is locked on-chain using smart contracts. What you see is what you get—no backdoors, no edits, no shady patches. Why Dogecoin Whales Are Eyeing the Ozak AI Presale We believe the movement is more than hype. The Ozak AI presale is now in its fourth stage, holding strong at $0.005 per token. With a proposed listing price of $0.05, early supporters are already lining up. And with over $1.49 million raised, plus more than 58.46 million tokens sold, it’s not just retail jumping in. This feels strategic. On top of that, there’s a bold $1 million giveaway already underway. Around 100 winners will have the opportunity to get the prize. And the entry bar? Just $100 worth of $OZ tokens during the presale window. That’s a clever way to build community while also keeping things competitive. Not Just Hype: Real Listings, Real Recognition It’s easy to spot fluff. But Ozak AI keeps showing up where it matters. The protocol has already been listed on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, major checkpoints for visibility. That kind of coverage doesn’t show up by accident. It signals that people are watching. And more importantly, they’re paying attention to something with depth. Not a meme. Not a trend. Something different. Built for Data-Heavy Industries That Can’t Afford to Fail Think logistics, healthcare, AI analytics, and anywhere real-time data makes or breaks operations. That’s where Ozak AI fits like a glove. Because it’s redundant, scalable, and records every move permanently, it offers exactly what centralized systems often lack: confidence. This tech isn’t flashy, but it’s the kind of thing that survives long after hype cycles crash. Final Thoughts Let’s not pretend Dogecoin is dead. But the tone has shifted. Traders with an eye on the future aren’t asking, “What pumps next?” They’re asking, “What lasts?” With Ozak AI, we believe that question might already be halfway answered. No fancy labels, no grand promises. Just real tech, live listings, and a presale that’s gaining momentum every single day.

Robert “Bo” Hines, the executive director of the US President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, reaffirmed the initiative during an appearance on the Crypto in America show. “We do believe in accumulation,” Hines stated when asked directly about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He emphasized that such a reserve “has been established,” and also referenced a broader national digital assets stockpile. According to Hines, Bitcoin holds a unique position in the digital asset space. “Bitcoin is in a class of its own and everyone recognizes that,” he said. Infrastructure Taking Shape Behind the Scenes While critics noted the lack of mention of a Bitcoin reserve in the recently released White House report, Hines assured the public that efforts are still underway. He explained that establishing the necessary infrastructure requires careful planning and significant labor. “There are countless ways that we can accumulate,” he said. “I think that people will be very pleased with the direction that we are going, and we’ll start moving on that in short order.” The administration, he added, also wants to “give credence” to innovation across other blockchain ecosystems, though no specific altcoins or projects were named. White House Focused on Broader Regulatory Framework On Wednesday, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets unveiled its recommendations aimed at strengthening America’s leadership in digital financial technologies. However, the document made no reference to a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Instead, the report emphasized the need to develop a strong and transparent regulatory framework for the industry. “We understand the importance of the strategic Bitcoin reserve,” Hines insisted in response. “We’re enormous fans of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin community, we want to deliver for them as well, and I’m certain that we will.” US Government Eyes More Bitcoin Pressed on how much Bitcoin the federal government currently holds, Hines declined to disclose exact figures. “I can’t discuss that right now,” he said. “There are several reasons we’re not disclosing that right now, there might be a time when we do, but I will say we want as much as we can possibly get and we’re going to continue to work on that.” According to blockchain analytics firm Nansen, the US government is estimated to hold around 198,000 BTC, valued at approximately $2.35 billion.

THE 4-YEAR CYCLES ARE DEAD!” The post was accompanied by a video in which Abs shared a comprehensive set of developments that, according to him, signal the end of traditional market patterns and the beginning of a new phase led by institutional interest and regulatory transformation. Price Movement, Political Change, and Suppressed Momentum Abs opened the episode by pointing out that XRP had reached unprecedented trading levels, specifically highlighting a recent weekly close around $3.25, which is the second highest in XRP’s history. He attributed this significant movement to a major shift in political leadership, referencing the return of President Donald Trump and asserting that more innovation had occurred in the crypto industry during the initial six months of Trump’s administration than in the previous four years. The suppression of XRP’s price was another focus of the broadcast. Abs revisited the impact of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit, filed in December 2020, which he claims delayed XRP’s growth trajectory by nearly $15 billion. He argued that XRP would have reached similar trading levels in 2021 if not for regulatory interference. Abs noted that, following the November inflection point, XRP demonstrated new resilience by holding the $2 range, a behavior he said had not been previously observed. $XRP BOLD PREDICTION!

CLICK BELOW TO WATCH NOW!! #Ripple #Cardano $ADA #XRPL https://t.co/70jS55bWn6 — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) July 28, 2025 Projected Price Targets and Supply Constraints Moving forward, Abs offered price projections that he described as minimum expectations, citing $4.48 as the lowest breakout target for XRP. Additional price levels such as $6.20, $8, and $9.13 were also discussed. These targets, he suggested, are within reach due to current institutional interest, the impact of the anticipated Clarity Act , and growing retail accessibility. Abs emphasized that supply shock is now a critical factor, suggesting that the limited quantity of XRP available on exchanges, combined with projected capital inflows, could elevate the asset well beyond double digits. He pointed to recent adoption signals, including a pending PayPal integration that would allow crypto payments across nearly 100 assets, including XRP. PayPal’s reach of 280 million users in the U.S. and 430 million globally was cited as a major force for mainstream adoption. Charles Hoskinson Weighs in on Market Structure The video also featured insights from Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, who stated unequivocally that the traditional four-year market cycle is no longer relevant. According to Hoskinson, the future trajectory of digital assets will be determined by institutional participation, the tokenization of real-world assets , and regulatory clarity. He forecasted a total cryptocurrency market capitalization exceeding $10 trillion by the end of the current cycle, expected to run through 2026. Hoskinson criticized the pessimism seen in the market and noted that meaningful institutional investment has yet to begin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ETF Growth and Institutional Demand for XRP Abs also referenced Sal Gilbertie, CEO of Teucrium Trading and issuer of a leveraged XRP ETF (XXRP). Gilbertie confirmed substantial investor interest in XRP, describing it as the firm’s most successful product since inception. He stated that hundreds of millions of dollars had flowed into the fund within 16 weeks of launch. When asked why his firm pivoted from agricultural products to cryptocurrency, Gilbertie attributed it to growing enthusiasm and a unique opportunity to provide leveraged exposure to XRP derivatives. He characterized the shift as comparable to the early days of the internet, suggesting that massive changes in business operations are underway. Gilbertie further speculated that XRP could see inflows ranging from $10 to $20 billion, a scenario that Abs argued could push the asset into triple-digit territory due to limited exchange liquidity. Anticipated Government Action and the Role of Ripple Another major point addressed was the upcoming release of the United States’ first official cryptocurrency report, scheduled for July 30. According to Abs, this report may include the creation of a strategic crypto reserve, potentially including XRP. He also referenced Ripple’s 2025 acquisition of Hidden Road , a move he claimed positioned the firm as a leader in blockchain-based settlement. Abs stated that other prime brokerages would be at a competitive disadvantage without similar capabilities. Abs reiterated that the XRP community is not late to the opportunity. Instead, he asserted that the market is only just entering a new era defined by institutional capital, regulatory certainty, and global adoption. With the potential passage of the Clarity Act and continued momentum from key financial players, Abs suggested that XRP is well-positioned for substantial growth in the months ahead.

Imagine a future where a country’s financial stability isn’t solely tied to gold or fiat currency, but also to a decentralized digital asset. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the emerging reality, as the U.S. digital assets council has unequivocally reaffirmed its commitment to establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve . This move isn’t just a nod to innovation; it’s a profound statement about the future of global finance and the foundational role Bitcoin is poised to play. Understanding the Vision Behind a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve What exactly does it mean for a nation to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve ? At its core, it signifies a government’s decision to accumulate and hold a significant quantity of Bitcoin (BTC) as a national asset. This isn’t merely about investment; it’s about strategic positioning in a rapidly digitizing global economy. The U.S. President Donald Trump’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, under the astute leadership of Robert “Bo” Hines, has been at the forefront of this groundbreaking initiative. Hines, in an interview with Crypto in America, underscored the administration’s deep conviction in BTC accumulation, emphasizing that a national digital asset stockpile is already taking shape. The rationale behind such a bold move is multi-faceted, aiming to: Diversify National Assets: Moving beyond traditional reserves like gold and foreign currencies. Hedge Against Inflation: Utilizing Bitcoin’s perceived scarcity as a potential store of value. Foster Innovation: Solidifying the U.S.’s position as a leader in digital asset technology and policy. Enhance Geopolitical Leverage: Gaining influence in the emerging digital economy. The Official Mandate: Authorizing the Bitcoin Reserve This commitment isn’t just talk; it’s backed by official action. The strategic Bitcoin reserve was formally authorized through an executive order signed in March. This critical directive laid the groundwork for what promises to be a transformative period in U.S. economic and technological policy. The authorization signals a clear intent from the highest levels of government to integrate digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, into the national financial framework. It’s a testament to the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s unique properties as a foundational asset, distinct from other digital currencies. Robert “Bo” Hines highlighted that Bitcoin is seen not just as another digital asset, but as something unique and foundational. This distinction is crucial, suggesting that the U.S. government views BTC with a special significance, perhaps akin to how gold has been historically valued for its scarcity and decentralized nature. Building the Framework: Infrastructure and Regulation for the Bitcoin Reserve With the authorization in place, the administration’s current focus has shifted to the intricate task of developing the necessary infrastructure and regulatory framework. This is no small feat, as it involves navigating complex technical, legal, and economic challenges. Establishing a robust and secure system for managing a national Bitcoin reserve requires: Secure Custody Solutions: Ensuring the safety of substantial BTC holdings from cyber threats and unauthorized access. Regulatory Clarity: Developing clear guidelines for the acquisition, management, and potential deployment of these assets. Interoperability: Creating systems that can seamlessly interact with existing financial infrastructures. Risk Management: Implementing strategies to mitigate volatility and other market risks associated with Bitcoin. The goal is clear: to support long-term leadership in the digital assets space. This isn’t about short-term gains but about establishing a sustainable foundation for the U.S. to remain at the forefront of global financial innovation for decades to come. Why a National Bitcoin Reserve Matters: Benefits and Opportunities The establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve carries significant potential benefits, both domestically and on the global stage. These advantages extend beyond mere financial gains, touching upon national security, economic resilience, and technological advancement. Economic Resilience and Diversification In an increasingly uncertain global economic climate, diversifying national reserves becomes paramount. Traditional fiat currencies are susceptible to inflation and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and capped supply, offers a potential hedge. Holding BTC could provide a buffer against currency debasement and offer a new avenue for wealth preservation, strengthening the nation’s financial backbone. Geopolitical Influence and Digital Sovereignty The nation that leads in digital asset adoption and strategy will likely hold significant sway in the future global economy. By building a substantial Bitcoin reserve , the U.S. signals its commitment to digital sovereignty and asserts its influence in shaping international norms around cryptocurrencies. This strategic move could position the U.S. as a central player in the evolving digital financial landscape. Spurring Innovation and Technological Advancement A government’s endorsement of Bitcoin, through the creation of a reserve, can act as a powerful catalyst for innovation. It legitimizes the technology, encouraging private sector investment, research, and development in blockchain and digital assets. This could lead to job creation and technological breakthroughs, further solidifying the U.S.’s role as a global tech leader. Setting a Global Precedent The U.S. is often a trendsetter in global policy. If its strategic Bitcoin reserve proves successful, it could inspire other nations to follow suit, accelerating the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets worldwide. This could pave the way for a more interconnected and digitally-driven global financial system. Navigating the Path: Challenges and Considerations for the Bitcoin Reserve While the vision is ambitious, the journey to a fully operational and effective national Bitcoin reserve is not without its hurdles. The administration must meticulously address several critical challenges to ensure the success and stability of this pioneering initiative. Key challenges include: Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations are well-known. Managing a significant national holding requires sophisticated risk management strategies and a long-term perspective. Security Concerns: Storing vast amounts of Bitcoin securely is paramount. This necessitates state-of-the-art cybersecurity protocols, cold storage solutions, and robust internal controls. Regulatory Evolution: The legal and regulatory landscape for digital assets is still developing. The government must create a framework that balances innovation with consumer protection and market integrity. Public Perception and Education: Building public trust will be crucial for widespread acceptance and support of such a national initiative. Addressing these challenges effectively will be key to realizing the full potential of the strategic Bitcoin reserve and ensuring its long-term viability. What This Means for the Future of Digital Assets and the Bitcoin Reserve The U.S.’s commitment to a strategic Bitcoin reserve is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful signal to the global financial community. It suggests a future where digital assets are no longer fringe investments but integral components of national economic strategy. For individual investors, this could imply increased stability and legitimacy for Bitcoin as an asset class. For developers and entrepreneurs, it could unlock new opportunities for innovation within a more defined regulatory environment. This initiative solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a serious contender for a foundational asset in the global financial system. As the U.S. moves forward with developing the necessary infrastructure and regulatory framework, the world will be watching. The success of this endeavor could set a powerful precedent, accelerating the integration of digital assets into national economies worldwide and reshaping the future of finance as we know it. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Digital Future The reaffirmation of the U.S. digital assets council’s commitment to a strategic Bitcoin reserve marks a truly pivotal moment. Under the guidance of leaders like Robert “Bo” Hines, the administration is not just acknowledging the rise of digital assets but actively positioning the nation to lead in this new frontier. From diversifying national assets and enhancing geopolitical leverage to spurring innovation, the potential benefits are immense. While challenges remain in establishing the robust infrastructure and regulatory clarity needed, this bold move underscores a clear vision: Bitcoin is seen as a unique and foundational asset, crucial for the U.S.’s long-term leadership in the digital economy. This strategic shift is set to redefine national asset management and propel the U.S. into a new era of financial innovation, making the future of digital assets more exciting and impactful than ever before.

The transaction, at an average price of $3,809.97, marks the start of the company’s treasury deployment strategy, which includes plans to accumulate over 334,000 ETH. The Ether Machine has some $407 million remaining for ETH purchases, bringing its total committed and acquired exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency to roughly $463 million. The timing of the announcement coincides with the 10th anniversary of Ethereum’s launch — a symbolic alignment with the project’s core mission to build institutional-grade, yield-generating ETH infrastructure. The purchase was executed through The Ether Reserve LLC, a vehicle funded in part by a $97 million private placement. The company indicated that further ether acquisitions from that pool would be disclosed in subsequent updates. As part of the launch, Andrew Keys, co-founder and chairman of The Ether Machine, also confirmed a $100,000 personal donation to the Protocol Guild — a community-led funding mechanism for long-term Ethereum core developers and maintainers. The Ether Machine aims to establish one of the largest on-chain ETH treasuries of any publicly traded entity. Its model emphasizes active yield generation through staking, restaking and professionally managed DeFi participation. It also expects to offer Ethereum infrastructure services to DAOs, enterprises, and institutions seeking exposure to the network’s base-layer economics. The company is in the process of finalizing its business combination with Dynamix Corporation (DYNX), a special purpose acquisition company listed on Nasdaq. Following the merger, the combined entity is expected to list under the name The Ether Machine Inc., with its ticker yet to be announced.

The data center will be created in collaboration with Nscale Global Holdings Ltd. and the Norwegian partner Aker ASA. The project will be owned by a joint venture between Nscale and Aker. ‘ Announcing Stargate Norway and delivering one of the first European AI Gigafactory to market is a strategic milestone for the region and boosts its role in the global AI landscape, ’ said Josh Payne, CEO of Nscale. ‘ Sovereign, scalable and sustainable infrastructure is now essential to remain competitive. We’re proud to partner with Aker, drawing on the team’s extensive experience and impressive track record, to deliver a new generation of AI economic and productivity growth in Europe, ’ he said. The data center expansion under the Stargate brand is part of the effort to invest $500B in data centers in the USA. OpenAI tapped SoftBank Group and Oracle Corp. for its data centers on US territory. Later, OpenAI expanded the program to the Middle East, helping establish a major data center in the United Arab Emirates. For the first time, the venture will choose Europe, delivering 100K Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026. The new data center announcement arrived just days after OpenAI tapped assistance from Oracle with a contract for 2M AI-compatible chips. OpenAI picks Norway as growing data center destination Norway is expected to attract $2.15B in new data center investments in the current year. The location has been selected for its climate, recently boosting multiple types of data centers. The country’s government has taken up additional oversight on the new creation of data centers, intending to limit the access of some cryptocurrency miners, while focusing on high uptime data centers and AI infrastructure. In June, the country announced an upcoming crackdown on energy-intensive crypto mining. Norway’s data center approach also mimics the general EU trend of expanding infrastructure capacity. Data centers in Europe show regional specifics, from access to energy to favorable interconnection hubs. The EU has attempted to grow AI infrastructure , tapping the growth of US-based companies with favorable locations. Norway benefits from the overall trend, despite being outside the Euro Area and relying on its own regulations. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

It has had minor gains in the past day but remains down 9% over the last week. While price action has been mixed, the steady rise in large wallet holdings stands out during this period. Alongside the biggest wallets, others holding between 10 million and 1 billion DOGE also made purchases. On July 29, this group added 130 million coins. This follows another wave of buying reported on July 24, when 310 million DOGE was accumulated across larger wallets over two days. In fact, these recent additions show that accumulation is not limited to just the top holders. Instead, multiple wallet sizes appear to be active while the price remains below recent highs. Market Structure Showing Key Patterns Analyst Joe Swanson has pointed out several key patterns on the chart. According to him, DOGE formed a double bottom near the $0.13 to $0.14 range, followed by a move that led to a Golden Cross. $DOGE flashed a Golden Cross on the daily chart, a classic bullish signal!

He also shared a chart showing a possible Elliott Wave setup, with DOGE currently in the third wave. Based on this structure, Swanson expects a move toward $0.3763 if momentum continues. He also mentioned the ongoing talk about a possible Dogecoin ETF. As of now, Polymarket data shows a 75% chance of approval by the end of 2025. This has drawn more attention to DOGE across the market. Familiar Setup Noted in Past Cycles Another analyst, Galaxy, compared the current DOGE chart with a previous pattern from 2024. That earlier setup included a double bottom, a quick pullback, and then a strong price move. The current chart shows a nearly identical shape forming.

According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have accumulated 218,570 BTC since late March, boosting their control to more than 68% of the asset’s total supply. This deep-pocketed buying spree comes as Bitcoin consolidates near $118,000, with analysts increasingly convinced that the next major price surge will be driven by patient capital rather than retail speculation. Building a Stronger Base In a July 31 post on X, Santiment highlighted a strategic shift, with nearly 0.9% of Bitcoin’s supply moving into the hands of whales over the past four months, reinforcing long-term accumulation trends. It matches a wider structural rotation in the asset’s ownership. As reported by CryptoPotato , institutional players are steadily replacing early adopters in what BTC financial services provider Swan calls “the largest holder rotation in Bitcoin’s history.” This rotation was tested last week when a Satoshi-era whale dumped about 80,000 BTC, worth more than $9 billion, briefly pushing down prices from $119,000 to around $115,000. Still, the market soaked up the sale with minimal disruption, which Swan argued was a show of BTC’s “maturity” and resilience. Many observers now believe this transition is the foundation for a more stable, capital-driven bull market, one they expect will be less affected by euphoric spikes and abrupt collapses. Meanwhile, BTC’s current trading range between $115,000 and $119,500 is being viewed as healthy consolidation. According to a recent report from CryptoQuant, the market “overheating” seen lately has been markedly milder than past cycles, suggesting any near-term pullback could be shallow and short-lived. Market Consolidating The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at $118,700, barely moving in the last 24 hours after only managing a 0.4% rise. The story is pretty much the same across seven days, with the asset creeping to a 0.8% increase in that period. However, it is up by a more respectable 11% over 30 days, with a key resistance level emerging above $120,000. A recent Glassnode report warned that a break below $115,000 could expose a thin liquidity gap down to $110,000. However, if the OG crypto pushes past $125,000, it could supply the juice for a run to $141,000. For now, whales seem content to accumulate during this consolidation phase. Their steady buying, coupled with the ongoing transfer of BTC from older holders to institutional giants, points to a maturing market preparing for its next leg up.

While many companies and whales continue to aggressively purchase ETH, the latest buying news comes from a company called Ether Machine. Accordingly, the company announced that it had purchased an additional 15,000 ETH, thus taking one step closer to its $1.5 billion ETH accumulation target. Ethereum (ETH) yield and infrastructure company The Ether Machine announced that it has purchased 15,000 ETH worth approximately $57 million as part of its long-term accumulation strategy, bringing its total holdings to 334,757 ETH. This acquisition pushed Ether Machine's ETH holdings above the Ethereum Foundation, which holds approximately 234,000 ETH, and into third place. Bitmine, led by Tom Lee, and SharpLink Gaming, led by Joe Lubin, remain the two largest institutional holders of Ethereum. “We couldn't think of a better way to celebrate Ethereum's 10th birthday than to deepen our commitment to Ether. Our mission is to accumulate, compound, and support ETH for the long term; not just as a financial asset, but as the backbone of a new internet economy,” said Andrew Keys, Co-Founder of The Ether Machine. At the same time, the company is expecting to go public on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ETHM, which is expected to happen in Q4 or later. Ethereum Accumulation Continues! Apart from Ether Machine, many newly created wallets also accept Ethereum. According to a post by on-chain analyst EmberCN, a newly created wallet purchased 39,652 ETH worth $152 million from Galaxy Digital. The analyst noted that it is not yet clear whether the wallet in question represents a new institutional buyer entering the market or is a newly created address for an existing institutional player like SharpLink Gaming. According to Lookonchain's post, 3 new wallets accumulated 73,821 ETH worth $283 million in the last 8 hours. According to the data, since July 9, a total of 11 new wallets have accumulated 722,152 ETH worth $2.77 billion. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda made headlines by suggesting that the growing use of stablecoins could significantly reshape how transactions occur outside the traditional banking system. This isn’t just a technical observation; it’s a profound statement about the future of finance, especially for everyday transactions that don’t involve banks directly. It signals a crucial shift in how central banks view these digital assets, moving from cautious observation to active consideration of their far-reaching implications. What Exactly Are Stablecoins and Why Are They Gaining Traction? Before diving into their potential impact, let’s clarify what stablecoins are. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or the Japanese Yen, or even to a basket of currencies or commodities. This stability is what makes them appealing for transactions and everyday use, as it mitigates the price swings that deter many from using other digital assets for payments. There are generally three main types of stablecoins : Fiat-backed stablecoins: These are the most common, where each digital coin is backed 1:1 by an equivalent amount of fiat currency held in a reserve account. Examples include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Crypto-backed stablecoins: These are collateralized by other cryptocurrencies, often in an overcollateralized manner to absorb price volatility. Dai (DAI) is a prominent example. Algorithmic stablecoins: These use complex algorithms and smart contracts to maintain their peg, without direct fiat or crypto collateral. While innovative, some have faced significant challenges in maintaining stability. Their growing traction stems from several key advantages: they offer the speed and efficiency of digital transactions without the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies, making them ideal for cross-border payments, online commerce, and even potential micro-transactions. How Could Stablecoins Reshape Non-Bank Transactions? Governor Ueda’s comments specifically highlight the impact on non-bank transactions. This refers to financial activities that occur outside the traditional banking infrastructure, such as peer-to-peer payments, remittances, online marketplace transactions, and even some forms of digital lending. Here’s how stablecoins could be a game-changer: Faster and Cheaper Remittances: Sending money across borders often involves high fees and slow processing times through traditional channels. Stablecoins can facilitate near-instantaneous transfers with significantly lower costs, directly benefiting individuals and businesses engaged in international trade or supporting families abroad. Streamlined Online Commerce: For e-commerce platforms, stablecoins could offer an alternative payment method that bypasses traditional card networks, potentially reducing transaction fees for merchants and offering faster settlement. This could open up new avenues for global trade, especially for smaller businesses. New Financial Services: The programmable nature of stablecoins allows for the creation of innovative financial products and services outside traditional banking. This includes automated escrow services, instant lending platforms, and even tokenized assets that can be traded seamlessly. Financial Inclusion: For unbanked or underbanked populations, stablecoins could provide access to digital financial services simply requiring a smartphone, bypassing the need for a traditional bank account. The essence is greater efficiency, lower costs, and broader accessibility for a wide range of financial activities that currently rely on, or are constrained by, conventional banking rails. The Bank of Japan’s Perspective: Why Are Stablecoins on Their Radar? Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda’s remarks, as reported by JinSe Finance, are not just casual observations; they reflect a deep analysis within one of the world’s most influential central banks. Central banks are primarily concerned with financial stability, monetary policy, and the integrity of the payment system. When a senior official from the Bank of Japan speaks about stablecoins , it signifies that these digital assets are now seen as potentially significant enough to impact these core responsibilities. Ueda’s focus on non-bank transactions suggests a recognition that stablecoins could: Disrupt Existing Payment Systems: A significant shift of transactions from bank accounts to stablecoin networks could impact bank deposits, liquidity management, and the overall effectiveness of monetary policy tools. Introduce New Risks: While offering benefits, stablecoins also bring potential risks related to consumer protection, money laundering, and the risk of ‘runs’ if a stablecoin issuer’s reserves are not robust or transparent. Influence Financial Innovation: The Bank of Japan likely sees the innovative potential of stablecoins but also the need to ensure that this innovation occurs within a safe and regulated environment. They are exploring their own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the digital Yen, which indicates a proactive stance on digital payments. Their interest is not to stifle innovation but to understand, manage, and potentially integrate these new forms of digital money into the existing financial framework responsibly. Navigating the Challenges: What Hurdles Do Stablecoins Face? Despite their promising potential, stablecoins face considerable challenges, particularly in a highly regulated financial landscape like Japan’s. Addressing these hurdles will be crucial for their widespread adoption and integration into the mainstream economy. Regulatory Clarity and Oversight: The lack of a comprehensive global regulatory framework for stablecoins is a major concern. Regulators grapple with how to classify them (currency, security, commodity?), how to ensure consumer protection, and how to prevent illicit activities like money laundering and terrorist financing. Japan, having been at the forefront of crypto regulation, is keenly aware of these complexities. Financial Stability Risks: If a large number of transactions shift to stablecoins , and an issuer fails or faces a ‘run,’ it could have systemic implications for the broader financial system. Ensuring that stablecoin reserves are truly stable, transparent, and regularly audited is paramount. Consumer Protection and Education: Many users may not fully understand the risks associated with different types of stablecoins or the operational nuances of blockchain technology. Protecting consumers from scams, hacks, and issuer insolvency is a significant challenge. Interoperability: For stablecoins to achieve mass adoption, they need to be easily transferable and usable across different platforms, blockchains, and traditional financial systems. Achieving seamless interoperability without compromising security is a complex technical and regulatory task. Privacy Concerns: While blockchain offers transparency, the level of user privacy associated with stablecoin transactions can vary. Balancing privacy with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements is a delicate act for regulators. These challenges highlight the delicate balance central banks and governments must strike between fostering innovation and safeguarding financial stability and consumer welfare. Global Examples: Where Are Stablecoins Already Making Waves? While Japan’s central bank is carefully considering the future of stablecoins , these digital assets are already making significant inroads globally. The two largest stablecoins by market capitalization, Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), process billions of dollars in transactions daily, primarily for cryptocurrency trading, but increasingly for cross-border payments. Cross-Border Remittances: Companies like Circle (issuer of USDC) are actively partnering with financial institutions to leverage stablecoins for faster and cheaper international money transfers, particularly to emerging markets. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Stablecoins are the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, enabling lending, borrowing, and trading activities on decentralized platforms without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. Payment Pilots: Several countries and major companies are exploring the use of stablecoins for various payment solutions. For instance, payment giants like Visa and Mastercard have expressed interest in supporting stablecoin transactions on their networks. Regulatory Initiatives: Jurisdictions like the European Union have introduced comprehensive regulatory frameworks (e.g., MiCA – Markets in Crypto-Assets) that specifically address stablecoins , aiming to provide clarity and foster responsible innovation. This global push for regulation signals a recognition of their growing importance. These examples illustrate that stablecoins are no longer just a niche crypto asset; they are evolving into a fundamental component of the broader digital financial landscape. What’s Next for Stablecoins in Japan’s Financial Landscape? Governor Ueda’s remarks indicate that Japan is not merely observing but actively preparing for the potential impact of stablecoins . The country has already shown a progressive stance on digital assets, being one of the first to regulate exchanges. The next steps for stablecoins in Japan will likely involve a multi-faceted approach: Further Research and Dialogue: The Bank of Japan will continue its research into the implications of stablecoins , likely engaging with financial institutions, fintech companies, and international bodies to develop a nuanced understanding. Regulatory Development: Expect Japan to refine its existing legal frameworks to specifically address stablecoins , focusing on consumer protection, anti-money laundering measures, and ensuring financial stability. This might involve creating new licenses or adapting existing ones for stablecoin issuers. Potential Integration with CBDC Efforts: While stablecoins are privately issued, their development could influence or even integrate with Japan’s ongoing exploration of a digital Yen. The two could potentially coexist, offering different functionalities within the broader digital payment ecosystem. Industry Collaboration: There will likely be increased collaboration between traditional financial players and blockchain innovators to explore pilot programs and use cases for stablecoins that align with Japan’s financial goals. The journey of stablecoins in Japan is set to be a fascinating one, balancing the immense potential for financial innovation with the imperative for robust regulation and stability. Conclusion: A New Era for Transactions? Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda’s insights underscore a powerful truth: stablecoins are no longer a peripheral topic in the financial world. Their unique ability to combine the stability of traditional currencies with the efficiency of blockchain technology positions them as a formidable force capable of reshaping non-bank transactions globally. While the benefits of speed, cost-effectiveness, and financial inclusion are compelling, the challenges of regulation, stability, and consumer protection are equally significant. As Japan, a nation known for its technological prowess and robust financial system, navigates this evolving landscape, its approach to stablecoins will undoubtedly set a precedent. The future of payments is undeniably digital, and stablecoins are poised to play a pivotal, perhaps even revolutionary, role in this transformation, pushing us towards a more interconnected and efficient global financial system. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main difference between stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency (like the USD or JPY), making them less volatile. Other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have highly fluctuating values based on market demand and supply, making them more suitable as speculative assets or stores of value rather than stable mediums of exchange for everyday transactions. Q2: Why is the Bank of Japan concerned about stablecoins? The Bank of Japan, like other central banks, is concerned about stablecoins primarily due to their potential impact on financial stability, consumer protection, and the effectiveness of monetary policy. If stablecoins become widely adopted for non-bank transactions, they could affect traditional banking operations, introduce new systemic risks, and require robust regulation to prevent illicit activities and ensure the stability of the financial system. Q3: How can stablecoins make remittances cheaper and faster? Stablecoins leverage blockchain technology to facilitate peer-to-peer transfers, bypassing traditional banking intermediaries that often charge high fees and take several days to process international transfers. By reducing the number of intermediaries and utilizing a more efficient digital ledger, stablecoins can enable near-instantaneous and significantly cheaper cross-border money transfers. Q4: Are stablecoins regulated in Japan? Japan has been proactive in regulating cryptocurrencies. While specific comprehensive regulations for stablecoins are still evolving globally, Japan’s Payment Services Act has provisions that can apply to digital assets. The country is continuously reviewing and adapting its regulatory framework to address new developments like stablecoins , aiming to balance innovation with financial stability and consumer protection. Q5: Will stablecoins replace traditional banks? It’s unlikely that stablecoins will completely replace traditional banks. Instead, they are more likely to coexist and integrate with the existing financial system. Stablecoins could serve as a complementary payment rail, offering efficiency for specific use cases like remittances and online payments, while banks continue to provide a broader range of services including lending, deposits, and complex financial instruments. Collaboration and integration are more probable than outright replacement. If you found this article insightful, please share it with your network!

Cardano, with a current price of $0.7624, has dropped by 3.01%, whereas experts currently identify another project, Remittix (RTX), as being the most undervalued coin in the current market. While Cardano remains a market leader in blockchain technology, the majority of investors are now carefully scouting for early-stage initiatives that have the possibility to solve real-world issues, especially in DeFi and cross-border payments. Why Cardano Still Has Long-Term Potential Cardano has been promoted as among the sharpest Layer 1 blockchain platforms to emphasize scalability, security, and academic research for years. It has consistently been within the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization and boasts a strong developer base. With a market capitalization of $26.99 billion currently and 24-hour volume of nearly $1 billion, Cardano’s ecosystem continues to increase slowly but surely. But its falling trading volume, down 9.49%, would suggest that some traders may be rolling over into newer, faster-growing plays. While some of the leading crypto presale 2025 candidates are still in their early stages, Cardano’s steady growth may now attract more long-term investors than short-term traders. What Makes Remittix The Most Undervalued Crypto Right Now Although Cardano is widely regarded as a reliable long-term crypto bet, there exist certain experts who currently see Remittix (RTX) as the most undervalued cryptocurrency of 2025. Remittix is one of those DeFi platforms that operates cross-chain and is specialized in one of the most profitable markets in the world — global payments. At a mere token price of $0.0876, Remittix is building a real-world utility that allows users to send cryptocurrency directly into traditional bank accounts across over 30 countries — something that even top altcoins have yet to completely resolve. The project now announced that its beta wallet will become available in Q3 2025 and will offer full support for over 40 cryptos and 30 fiat currencies and thus be one of the premier applications for non-technical users as well as crypto natives. To date, Remittix has already raised more than $17.8 million and distributed more than 575 million tokens, with its $18M soft cap in sight. The Remittix presale early contributors now get a 50% token bonus as an incentive for early adapters. Remittix Solves Key Problems In Global Crypto Adoption The largest challenge to crypto adoption today is still utility — how simple is it to actually use your coins? Remittix addresses this by providing crypto-to-fiat transfers within minutes, avoiding centralized exchanges and slashing gas fees dramatically. Built on low gas fee crypto infrastructure, the Remittix wallet combines the power of decentralized finance with the comfort of traditional money apps.

With market excitement building, the question arises whether these tokens will see significant gains. This article delves into the factors driving these movements and provides insights into whether these digital currencies are poised for a surge. Discover which coins might be ready to take off. Upbeat Recovery Amid Long-Term Correction in Toncoin Toncoin experienced a rapid gain of about 17% in the past month, contrasting with a significant decline of nearly 30% over the last six months. Price action moved into a higher range, reflecting renewed trading interest despite a longer-term bearish backdrop. The month’s surge hints at a shift in market sentiment even as caution remains due to the steep half-year drop. Price stability strengthened as buyers reentered the market, pushing the coin toward its recent high range. Market participants noted a quick turnaround from previous losses, suggesting that recent activity may be setting the stage for further recovery if positive trends persist. Toncoin currently trades within a narrow band from $2.55 to $3.34, with clear support emerging around $2.18 and resistance building near $3.76. Beyond these levels, a secondary support is seen at $1.39 and a second resistance at $4.56, providing valuable reference points for trading strategies. Indicators show a slightly bullish bias, with momentum and oscillators favoring buyers in the short term, yet no distinct trend has formed. Traders might consider stepping in near the support at $2.18 and taking profits as the price nears the immediate resistance at $3.76. Caution is recommended given the coin’s recent volatility and the mixed signals from technical indicators. Aptos Market Outlook: Key Levels and Recent Trends Aptos experienced a -7.90% drop over one month and a significant -41.85% fall in the past six months. Price movements ranged widely during this period while overall sentiment remained low and cautious. Price fluctuations have reflected weakening momentum as traders wrestled with uncertainty and downward pressure. The decline over these durations highlights persistent weakness marked by rapid losses and a lack of recovery, indicating market participants were hesitant to push prices higher. Recent price actions have brought Aptos closer to lower support levels, albeit with noticeable volatility during each leg downward. Current trading levels show the coin trading between $3.99 and $5.55. The nearest resistance sits at $6.22 while immediate support is at $3.10. Additional boundaries include a secondary resistance at $7.78 and a secondary support around $1.53. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator at -0.15 and an RSI of 40.96 point to cautious market sentiment. Bears seem to dominate at current prices, although a lift off support might invite bullish action. Traders could look for short-term opportunities by watching for breakouts above $6.22 or retracements to the support zone near $3.10. Overall, the lack of a clear trend suggests critical play around these levels until a definitive shift occurs. Conclusion TON and APT show strong potential for growth. Increased interest and market momentum suggest that these tokens could continue to rise. Market FOMO might push prices even higher as more investors look to join in. Both tokens are positioned well to benefit from the current trends. Their performance should be closely monitored for signs of continued rally.

Shoki Omori, the Chief Desk Strategist at Tokyo’s Mizuho Securities, was among the many professionals who expected the BOJ to raise its 2025 inflation forecast and hold rates steady. The BOJ raised short-term policy rates to the current 0.5% in January this year after exiting a 10-year-long monetary stimulus program last year. The rates have been held steady since then. However, the Chief Currency Strategist at Tokyo’s SMBC, Hirofumi Suzuki, believes that today’s decision by the BOJ to maintain interest rates unchanged justified a rate hike in September or October. David Chao, a Global Market Strategist for Asia-Pacific at Singapore’s Invesco, said today’s announcement increased the chances of an earlier-than-expected rate hike, possibly in October. The BOJ’s quarterly outlook report also disclosed high (mostly tariff-related) uncertainty regarding the impacts of trade policy changes on prices and overseas economies. The central bank’s observation was less pessimistic than its May report, which suggested the level of trade policy-related uncertainty was “extremely high.” However, it predicted that inflation would drop to 1.8% in 2026 and slightly jump to 2% in 2027. These predictions were higher than May’s forecast of 1.7% inflation in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027. Chao says raising the inflation forecast suggests a possible rate hike Invesco’s Chao said the BOJ’s inflation forecast increase suggested that rates were more likely to go up. Kasutoshi Inadome, a Senior Strategist at Tokyo’s Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management, thought today’s announcement was generally “hawkish” as expected. He explained that the central bank’s claim of a balance between risks and prices was a sign that the central bank was turning hawkish. Inadome also noted that the BOJ’s estimation of lower global trade uncertainty was a reaction to tariff-related trade deals made with the United States. The Head of Asia Research at ANZ, Khoon Goh, said today’s decision was no surprise, adding that the BOJ had previously hinted at the possibility of raising its inflation rate forecast. However, Goh wondered if the ongoing uncertainty in the global trading landscape was enough for the central bank to hold off on a rate hike again. He believes there is a justification for a rate hike in October. “Now, the fact that Japan has finally reached a deal with the U.S. does remove some element of that uncertainty for themselves. So I think the question is whether the BOJ is now prepared to hike in October.” – Khoon Goh , Head of Asia Research at ANZ Masato Koike, the Senior Economist at Tokyo’s Sompo Institute Plus, has maintained since April that 0.5% was the BOJ’s terminal rate. However, he seemed to change his tune as he saw the possibility of a rate hike this year, following the seeming success of tariff negotiations. Sasaki claims the ‘revise up’ for inflation is ‘moderate’ The Tokyo Fukuoka Financial Group Chief Strategist, Tohru Sasaki, claimed the “revise up” for the 2026 inflation forecast was “moderate.” He emphasized that this was a sign that the BOJ was cautious about the risks of its inflation projections. Sasaki pointed out that the central bank’s inflation outlook was hawkish, adding that the central bank could “revise up” interest rates soon. However, he noted a dark cloud was still hanging over the Japan-U.S. trade talks, sparking uncertainty. SMBC’s Suzuki claimed that the BOJ’s upward revision of its inflation forecast for 2025 was higher than expected. However, he said it was important that the 2027 inflation forecast was set at 2%. Charu Chanana, the Chief Investment Strategist at Singapore’s Saxo, believes the September meeting could potentially end with a decision to hike rates, assuming the central bank’s revised outlook aligns with incoming data.

Key Takeaways: Fake crypto app ads have exposed over 10 million people to malware. The malware uses JavaScript and advanced evasion tactics to avoid detection. Victims risk losing passwords, Telegram data, and access to crypto wallets. The campaign, which mimics nearly 50 popular crypto applications such as Binance, MetaMask, and Kraken, has been operating under the radar since at least March 2024. Dubbed “JSCEAL” by Check Point Research, the operation deploys fake crypto app interfaces through online advertisements, luring users into downloading malware that siphons sensitive data. Stealthy JavaScript Malware Evades Detection with Advanced Tactics The malicious software leverages JavaScript and employs advanced evasion techniques, making it difficult to detect and analyze. Check Point highlighted the role of social media platforms in enabling the campaign’s scale. Meta’s ad tools showed over 35,000 malicious advertisements were disseminated in just the first half of 2025. While an estimated 3.5 million users in the European Union encountered these ads, Check Point noted the campaign also targeted users in Asia — regions where crypto trading and social media usage are particularly dense. The firm stressed that estimating the precise number of infected devices remains difficult, given that ad impressions do not directly translate into malware infections. Nonetheless, the campaign’s sophistication and broad targeting suggest the real impact could be much higher than initial estimates. The malware tricks victims by presenting a website that closely resembles the real app’s homepage. When users attempt to install what appears to be a legitimate application, a hidden malware installation runs in parallel. The app often opens the actual platform’s interface to avoid suspicion, while stealing data in the background. Thousands tricked by fake crypto apps via Facebook ads. They install a stealthy new malware—JSCEAL—that hijacks wallets, steals passwords in real-time, and evades most detection tools. Worse? It's still active. Here’s how it works (and how to avoid it) ↓… pic.twitter.com/BnpsGI5RLZ — The Hacker News (@TheHackersNews) July 30, 2025 Once installed, the malware collects a wide range of personal information. This includes keystrokes, which can expose passwords, Telegram credentials, browser cookies, and even saved autofill data. It also has the capability to manipulate crypto browser extensions like MetaMask, making it a significant threat to digital asset holders. Check Point emphasized that the malware’s design relies heavily on obfuscation and compiled code, further complicating analysis. The goal appears to be the extraction of as much device and user data as possible, sending it to threat actors likely seeking to monetize the information or breach users’ crypto wallets. Study Reveals Widespread Leaks of Crypto Keys A recent study has revealed the extent of sensitive information leaked through ransomware attacks and data breaches, including key financial documents and crypto keys. The report, which analyzed over 141 million records from 1,297 breach incidents, revealed that cryptographic keys were stolen in 18% of the breaches. Financial documents appeared in 93% of the breach incidents studied, accounting for 41% of all analyzed files. Nearly half included bank statements, and over a third contained International Bank Account Numbers. In 82% of the cases, customer or corporate personally identifiable information (PII) was exposed, much of it originating from customer service interactions.

Exchange balances fall while wallet count nears 7.3M, signaling long-term holding activity. On-chain activity rebounds to 1B tokens as network use increases ahead of August. Chart Structure and Support Zone Ripple (XRP) continues to trade above a key support range between $3.05 and $3.10. This area has served as a foundation for several rebounds throughout July. Each time the price approached this zone, buyers stepped in to defend it. That behavior has kept the structure of the chart steady. Recent movements suggest a possible double bottom is forming, as identified by Alpha Crypto Signal. This setup, which often appears when a trend is changing, is showing two distinct bounces from the same support level. The price sat at $3.14 at press time, showing a small increase over the past 24 hours and 3% increase across the week. #XRP LTF Analysis: $XRP is holding up well above the key horizontal support zone on the 4H chart. After multiple taps, the level continues to act as strong demand, and the latest bounce from it hints at a potential double bottom forming. This is a classic bullish reversal… pic.twitter.com/qOb6zlbUkn — Alpha Crypto Signal (@alphacryptosign) July 31, 2025 Momentum indicators are starting to shift. XRP has moved back above the 9-period exponential moving average, which can sometimes signal short-term direction changes. The 50-period simple moving average is positioned slightly higher and may be the next test for price strength. Volume has picked up during recent support zone activity, with more trading taking place as the price rebounded. If XRP moves above $3.25, which is considered the neckline of the current pattern, this could confirm a breakout. If that happens, the next move may extend toward the $3.50 level. Wallet Activity and Exchange Trends More XRP is now being stored in private wallets, as we observed . That means less supply is available for quick selling. This shift suggests holders are moving their assets out of trading platforms, possibly to hold them longer term. In parallel, the number of XRP wallets is also increasing. On July 21, the count reached 7.2 million. That number continues to grow and is nearing 7.3 million, pointing to broader network participation and user interest. XRP Activity Spikes Before August XRP recorded wide changes in token movement through July. Transfers reached 1.8 billion tokens at the month’s high but dropped to 300 million by July 28. Activity later recovered to around 1 billion, showing a return of network engagement before August. Source: CryptoQuant According to analyst CRYPTOWZRD, XRP closed the last daily session without clear direction. He noted that a close above $3.23 could open up a longer trading setup. For now, the market is watching for cleaner signals before momentum shifts further. According to our weekly analysis , support is seen at $3.00. Key resistance levels are at $3.60 and $4.00.

Only 7% of the 170 million tokens allocated in this round have been sold so far, signaling immense room for growth before the listing price of $0.06. For early-stage buyers, the pricing window remains extremely favorable in comparison to what’s expected post-launch. Demand-driven utility backing MUTM’s future price trajectory Unlike many speculative tokens with little more than hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to deliver concrete utility that directly feeds into price momentum. The protocol supports both peer-to-collector (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models. Lenders can earn high APYs depending on pool utilization — for example, depositing 10,000 USDT could yield up to 12% APY, resulting in a passive income of 1,200 USDT annually. At the same time, borrowers can unlock liquidity by depositing blue-chip assets like Ethereum (ETH) with calculated loan-to-value (LTV) thresholds. A borrower depositing $5,000 worth of ETH at a 70% LTV can borrow up to $3,500 in stablecoins, without needing to sell their holdings. These real economic activities increase the usage of the protocol, leading to a rise in transaction volume, user base, and demand for its native token, MUTM. Each time users lend, borrow, or stake, they interact with smart contracts that loop value back into the system. That’s where the MUTM token plays a central role — it underpins governance, fee sharing, and rewards across the ecosystem. Adding to this strong base of demand is the upcoming beta launch, which is scheduled to go live before the listing. This beta release will introduce users to live platform functionality, enabling early community interaction, feedback, and improvement. As more users experience the real utility of the platform, visibility will grow, and with it, the desire to own a stake in the ecosystem before it becomes fully operational. Furthermore, Layer-2 integration is designed to make the entire user experience faster and cheaper by reducing gas fees. Lower fees remove friction for small lenders and borrowers, making it easier for the platform to scale rapidly, especially in regions where transaction costs are a barrier. More activity means higher utilization, which drives demand for the token powering that activity: MUTM. Tokenomics, beta, and staking: a recipe for supply squeeze The protocol’s design ensures that token demand grows organically over time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates on a buy-and-distribute model. A portion of revenue generated through platform usage is routed to purchase MUTM on the open market, then redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens in the designated smart contracts. This mechanism drives continuous buying pressure without relying on external hype or listing pumps. Staking also encourages long-term involvement with the platform. When users stake mtTokens — which represent deposited assets and accumulated yield — they gain additional MUTM rewards. This controls the circulating supply and locks up more tokens, increasing demand and supporting upward price movement. Combined with an initial listing price of $0.06, this setup creates a favorable environment for early participants. Investors who bought during Phase 1 at $0.01 have already seen a 250% gain. Even at $0.035 in Phase 6, entry remains significantly below projected post-listing prices. With the underlying utility, staking incentives, active development pipeline, and upcoming exchange listing in place, it is not unrealistic for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to reach $0.70 or more — a 20x return — once broader market attention converges. As BTC inches closer to $150K, and altcoins surge in correlation, undervalued projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are likely to attract capital faster than ever. But unlike tokens that rely on pure market speculation, MUTM is building a user-centric ecosystem with real functionality, which is precisely what makes it more than just a penny coin. It’s a DeFi foundation in the making.

Verisign, an internet infrastructure provider, announced Berkshire’s sale on Monday, noting the Omaha-based investment giant would sell 4,300,000 shares of the company’s common stock to the public for $285 per share . Verisign’s stock, VRSN, is down 3.78% in the past 24 hours and 7.61% in the past five days. The stock is still up 29% in 2025, however. The sell-off materialized after Buffett’s firm acquired multiple new stocks in the first quarter of 2025.

The firm purchased an additional 6,384,676 shares of the alcohol producer Constellation Brands (STZ) for nearly $961 million, and it acquired 238,613 new shares of Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) worth approximately $204 million. The Omaha-based holding company also bought 112,401 new shares of Heico Corporation (HEI), an aerospace and electronics firm. Those new shares were worth nearly $50 million in Q1. The performance of Berkshire’s new investments has been mixed in 2025 so far: POOL is down 8.42% on the year and STZ is down 22.42%, while DPZ is up 13.25% year-to-date and HEI is up 36.8%.

What was once considered a niche digital curiosity has undeniably ascended to the forefront of investment conversations, captivating both individual enthusiasts and institutional giants alike. Recently, a powerful declaration from a prominent voice in the crypto space has echoed across financial markets, solidifying Bitcoin’s burgeoning status. Anthony Pompliano, the insightful founder and CEO of ProCapBTC, didn’t mince words during a recent CNBC interview, boldly proclaiming that Bitcoin has transitioned from a fringe investment into a widely embraced asset, unequivocally calling it “the king of Wall Street.” This isn’t just hyperbole; it’s a reflection of a profound shift in how the financial world perceives and integrates the leading cryptocurrency. The Coronation: Why Bitcoin is ‘King of Wall Street’ Pompliano’s pronouncement isn’t made in a vacuum. It stems from a meticulous observation of market trends and economic shifts that highlight Bitcoin’s superior performance and increasing relevance. His argument is multi-faceted, drawing on critical comparisons with traditional financial benchmarks. The essence of his claim lies in Bitcoin’s remarkable resilience and appreciation, especially when contrasted with the weakening purchasing power of fiat currencies and the underperformance of conventional equities. Erosion of Fiat Purchasing Power: One of Pompliano’s key points, as highlighted by Wu Blockchain, is the significant decline in the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power. Over the past five years, the dollar has reportedly seen a roughly 30% reduction in its value. This erosion means that holding traditional cash assets has resulted in a substantial loss of wealth over time, making a compelling case for alternative stores of value. S&P 500’s Underperformance Against Bitcoin: Perhaps even more striking is the comparison between the S&P 500, a cornerstone of traditional investment, and Bitcoin. Since 2020, the S&P 500 has plummeted by more than 85% when its performance is measured in Bitcoin. This stark contrast underscores Bitcoin’s exponential growth and its potential as a superior long-term investment, outshining even the most robust stock market indices. Institutional Embrace: The ‘king’ status isn’t just about performance; it’s about acceptance. Wall Street, once skeptical, is now actively integrating Bitcoin. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has opened floodgates for institutional capital, providing regulated and accessible avenues for major players to gain exposure to the digital asset. Decoding the Institutional Embrace: Who’s Adopting Bitcoin and Why? The journey of Bitcoin from a fringe asset to a Wall Street darling is largely attributed to the growing institutional embrace. This isn’t a sudden phenomenon but a gradual recognition of Bitcoin’s unique attributes and its role in a diversified portfolio. But who exactly is adopting Bitcoin, and what are their motivations? Major Players Entering the Bitcoin Arena: The list of institutions exploring or directly investing in Bitcoin is growing. This includes: Asset Managers: Firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have launched Bitcoin ETFs, allowing their vast client bases to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Publicly Traded Corporations: Companies like MicroStrategy have made significant Bitcoin acquisitions, integrating it into their treasury reserves as a hedge against inflation and a growth asset. Hedge Funds and Family Offices: These sophisticated investors are allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, seeking diversification and asymmetric returns. Payment Processors: Companies like PayPal and Square (Block Inc.) have integrated Bitcoin into their services, making it more accessible for everyday transactions and investment. What are the Driving Forces Behind This Bitcoin Adoption? Several factors are propelling this institutional shift towards Bitcoin: Factor Explanation Inflation Hedge With unprecedented monetary easing and rising inflation concerns globally, institutions view Bitcoin’s finite supply (21 million coins) as a robust hedge against currency debasement, much like digital gold. Digital Gold Narrative Bitcoin shares characteristics with gold – scarcity, divisibility, and portability – but offers superior digital transferability and resistance to censorship. It’s increasingly seen as a modern store of value. Diversification Benefits Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional asset classes (stocks, bonds) makes it an attractive tool for portfolio diversification, potentially reducing overall risk while enhancing returns. Technological Innovation Institutions recognize the underlying blockchain technology as a groundbreaking innovation with potential to revolutionize various industries beyond finance, making Bitcoin an early-stage investment in this future. Growing Regulatory Clarity The emergence of clearer regulatory frameworks, particularly in major economies, has provided institutions with the confidence and legal certainty needed to engage with digital assets. Navigating the Bitcoin Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities While Bitcoin’s ascent is undeniable, it’s crucial to acknowledge that the journey isn’t without its complexities. Like any investment, Bitcoin presents both significant opportunities and inherent challenges that investors must consider. Potential Challenges for Bitcoin Investors: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings, which can be significant. While this volatility presents opportunities for gains, it also carries substantial risk of losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite progress, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains evolving and fragmented across different jurisdictions, which can introduce uncertainty. Security Risks: While the Bitcoin network itself is highly secure, individual investors face risks related to secure storage (wallets), phishing attacks, and exchange hacks if proper precautions are not taken. Market Manipulation: The relatively nascent nature of the crypto market compared to traditional finance means it can be more susceptible to large-scale market manipulation. Unlocking Opportunities with Bitcoin: Despite the challenges, the opportunities Bitcoin offers are compelling: Asymmetric Upside: Many believe Bitcoin still has significant growth potential, offering a disproportionately high return relative to its current valuation compared to traditional assets. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin is a borderless asset, accessible to anyone with an internet connection, facilitating global transactions and financial inclusion. Inflation Protection: As highlighted by Pompliano, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it a strong candidate for protecting wealth against inflationary pressures. Technological Disruption: Investing in Bitcoin is also an investment in the broader blockchain technology, which is poised to disrupt numerous industries. Actionable Insights for Engaging with Bitcoin For those looking to understand or participate in the Bitcoin market, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing, thoroughly understand Bitcoin’s technology, economics, and market dynamics. Don’t rely solely on headlines or social media trends. Start Small and Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): Given Bitcoin’s volatility, consider investing a small, fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly) rather than a large lump sum. This strategy helps mitigate risk over time. Secure Your Holdings: Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for larger holdings to enhance security against hacks and theft. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is a high-risk, high-reward asset. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Follow reliable news sources, industry experts, and market analysis to stay updated on developments. The Enduring Reign of Bitcoin: A Compelling Future Anthony Pompliano’s bold assertion that Bitcoin is now ‘the king of Wall Street’ is more than just a catchy phrase; it’s a testament to a profound paradigm shift in global finance. The data, from the eroding purchasing power of the U.S. dollar to the stark underperformance of the S&P 500 when measured against Bitcoin, paints a clear picture of a digital asset that is not only holding its own but aggressively gaining ground against traditional financial stalwarts. The increasing institutional embrace, driven by Bitcoin’s role as an inflation hedge, a diversifier, and a technological innovation, signals a future where digital assets play an ever more central role. While challenges remain, the opportunities presented by Bitcoin’s unique attributes continue to attract significant capital and attention, solidifying its position at the pinnacle of modern investment. As Wall Street increasingly bows to its new monarch, the reign of Bitcoin appears set to continue, reshaping the very foundations of wealth and value. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does Anthony Pompliano mean by calling Bitcoin ‘the king of Wall Street’? Anthony Pompliano means that Bitcoin has surpassed traditional assets in terms of relevance, performance, and institutional adoption, becoming the most significant and influential asset for major financial players on Wall Street. He cites its superior returns compared to the S&P 500 and its ability to maintain purchasing power against the depreciating U.S. dollar. Q2: How has Bitcoin performed against the U.S. dollar and the S&P 500? According to Pompliano, the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power has declined by approximately 30% over the past five years. In contrast, the S&P 500 has dropped more than 85% when its performance is measured in Bitcoin since 2020, highlighting Bitcoin’s significant outperformance as an investment. Q3: Why are institutions increasingly embracing Bitcoin? Institutions are embracing Bitcoin for several reasons, including its potential as an inflation hedge due to its finite supply, its role as ‘digital gold’ for portfolio diversification, the increasing regulatory clarity surrounding digital assets, and the recognition of its underlying blockchain technology as a major innovation. Q4: What are the main risks associated with investing in Bitcoin? Key risks include high price volatility, ongoing regulatory uncertainties across different jurisdictions, security risks related to digital asset storage and exchanges, and the potential for market manipulation in a relatively nascent market. Q5: What is ‘Dollar-Cost Averaging’ (DCA) and why is it recommended for Bitcoin? Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. It’s recommended for Bitcoin to mitigate the impact of its high volatility, as it averages out the purchase price over time and reduces the risk of buying at a single price peak.

The cooperation agreement enables mutual information exchange and knowledge sharing on blockchain intelligence tools, risk analysis, and regulatory experiences between both institutions. Source: Press Release Bolivia’s Virtual Asset Usage Explodes 532% in One Year Bolivia’s virtual asset usage surged from $46.5 million to $294 million between June 2024 and June 2025 following regulatory changes. Source: Reuters The partnership comes into effect immediately for an indefinite period. This positions Bolivia to benefit from El Salvador’s pioneering regulatory framework and practical experience as the world’s first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. El Salvador’s CNAD has become a fundamental actor in the global digital assets ecosystem. Bolivia’s embrace of cryptocurrency contrasts sharply with its historical stance, having previously maintained strict prohibitions on virtual assets before implementing Board Resolution 082/2024 in June 2024. The policy shift enables legal use of virtual assets for cross-border transactions and e-commerce payments. The agreement consolidates progress made in establishing digital assets as viable alternatives for families and small entrepreneurs. At the same time, Bolivia’s Central Bank commits to developing policies that modernize the financial system and deepen financial inclusion through regulated cryptocurrency ecosystems. El Salvador’s experience provides valuable guidance despite recent International Monetary Fund restrictions that have capped the country’s Bitcoin purchases and mandated privatization of the state-run Chivo wallet by July 2025. Bolivia’s Cryptocurrency Revolution Gains Momentum Earlier this year, the Central Bank of Bolivia authorized state oil company YPFB to use cryptocurrency for purchasing crude oil and diesel from international vendors in March 2025. They aimed to address foreign currency shortages that created fuel supply disruptions across the country. President Luis Arce’s cabinet granted YPFB permission to conduct fuel import deals using either USD or cryptocurrency, with Bolivia requiring at least $60 million weekly for fuel imports. The decree instructs YPFB to make budgetary adjustments covering financial costs within applicable regulations. Bolivia’s cryptocurrency adoption has accelerated rapidly, with virtual asset transactions exceeding 1.1 million from July to September 2024 , compared to 932,000 in the six months before then. Six financial institutions began operating with virtual assets, reporting 40% growth in operations between July and August. The Central Bank launched educational initiatives, conducting over 33 workshops nationwide, reaching more than 3,000 participants to inform the public about virtual asset characteristics and risks. The legal framework enables Bolivians to use cryptocurrency for cross-border transactions and e-commerce payments. The partnership with El Salvador provides technical expertise for developing secure and regulated cryptocurrency ecosystems. Source: Press Release Bolivia joins a growing number of countries using cryptocurrency for international trade, particularly those seeking alternatives to traditional banking systems amid sanctions or political tensions. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Model Faces IMF Constraints El Salvador maintains approximately 6,244 Bitcoin worth $742 million despite IMF loan agreement restrictions preventing new government purchases since February 2025. The $1.4 billion loan program requires the country to maintain unchanged Bitcoin holdings and privatize the Chivo wallet. President Nayib Bukele’s previous claims of daily Bitcoin purchases have been contradicted by IMF documentation confirming no new acquisitions since the loan agreement. On-chain activity showing Bitcoin movements between wallets represents internal transfers rather than fresh purchases. The IMF praised El Salvador’s updated Bitcoin policy for reducing fiscal risk and strengthening transparency, noting these steps help stabilize inflation and restore macroeconomic stability. However, Bitcoin is no longer considered mandatory legal tender under the agreement. El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment appears to be faltering under the weight of an IMF loan agreement and declining public engagement. #IMF #ElSalvador https://t.co/65lADRixOH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 26, 2025 El Salvador’s CNAD has consolidated its position as a regional leader in cryptocurrency regulation, promoting innovation, security, and regulatory compliance throughout the digital assets sector. The country’s regulatory framework remains among the most developed and advanced in promoting virtual assets globally. The My First Bitcoin organization reported that government-backed education and adoption efforts have stalled since the IMF deal , with declining public engagement in cryptocurrency learning programs. The shift has raised questions about the long-term viability of El Salvador’s original Bitcoin vision.

Most altcoins are also in the green today, with ETH climbing back toward $3,900 and ENA exploding by double digits once more. BTC Recovers After FOMC Meeting After the correction at the end of the previous business week, which drove BTC to a 14-day low of under $114,500, the primary cryptocurrency managed to recover most losses and even headed toward $120,000 at the beginning of the current one. However, the resistance at that level turned out to be too strong for bitcoin’s current momentum, and the asset returned to around $118,000 yesterday ahead of the latest FOMC meeting for the year. All eyes turned to the US central bank, especially after the country’s GDP report for Q2 was significantly higher than expected. However, the Fed refused to change the interest rates, which resulted in some volatility for BTC. Perhaps also driven by the lack of any mention of a strategic bitcoin reserve in the White House’s digital asset report , which went live yesterday as well, the cryptocurrency dropped by several grand to below $116,000. Nevertheless, it has recovered most losses and challenged $119,000 earlier today. As of now, it remains about $500 away from that level, while its market cap has risen to $2.360 trillion.

Even without future forecasts, the current setup is impressive. Investors entering at Phase 6 are already positioned for nearly 6x returns at the public listing price of $0.06. But those who wait may end up buying closer to the top, while early-phase participants from Phase 1 (at $0.01) are already looking at 3.5x gains on paper. With a fixed total supply of 4 billion tokens and increasing presale demand, this token is starting to look like more than just another DeFi play — it’s shaping up to be a next-generation ecosystem for lending, stablecoins, and passive income. P2C lending is building to deliver passive rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a permissionless and non-custodial Pool-to-Contract (P2C) lending model designed to attract both conservative and capital-efficient investors. In this system, users will be able to deposit assets like ETH, USDT, or other blue-chip tokens into a shared liquidity pool. The protocol will then allocate these funds to overcollateralized borrowers, with APYs adjusting dynamically based on pool utilization. For example, a user depositing $20,000 worth of ETH will be able to earn around 9.4% APY—automatically paid as interest accrues within the smart contract. Borrowers, in turn, will unlock up to 70% Loan-to-Value (LTV) against the same $20,000 in ETH, enabling access to $14,000 in stablecoins without needing to sell their underlying asset. All loans will remain overcollateralized, reducing protocol-level risk while enabling flexible, instant lending. Alongside this, the platform will also support Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending for users seeking tailored agreements. In the P2P model, borrowers and lenders will negotiate terms directly, often involving volatile tokens like memcoins or specific loan durations. This option will cater to traders and advanced users looking for custom opportunities, while the P2C model will serve those prioritizing automated, risk-adjusted yield on high-quality assets. Stablecoin engine with peg protection and smart minting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just building a lending network—it’s architecting a full decentralized finance backbone, starting with its stablecoin system. The native stablecoin will only be minted when loans are issued and will be destroyed immediately upon repayment or liquidation. This controlled mint-burn mechanism ensures strict supply control and helps avoid the inflationary pitfalls seen in many algorithmic stablecoin designs. Interest rates on borrowing will be governed at the protocol level. For example, if the stablecoin dips below its $1 peg, borrowing interest rates may be adjusted upward to shrink supply and restore equilibrium. Minting privileges are restricted to pre-approved smart contracts that enforce strict overcollateralization, ensuring all loans backed by the stablecoin remain safe and trustless. By building this system directly into the protocol’s architecture, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to offer a stable, scalable DeFi experience while enabling cross-platform interoperability through its upcoming Layer-2 deployment, drastically reducing gas fees and enhancing throughput. Phase 6 presale is heating up — time to get in Right now, Phase 6 of the presale is live with MUTM priced at $0.035, and already 7% of the 170 million Phase 6 tokens have been sold. Over 14,700 holders have already joined, contributing more than $13.70 million to the presale round. The next price jump is locked in at $0.040 in Phase 7—a 15% increase from the current rate, making this phase a critical window for entry before prices surge again. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also rewarding early supporters with a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. And to reinforce platform security and trust, the protocol has launched a $50,000 bug bounty with CertiK, achieving a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 78.00, reflecting high audit reliability. The project’s Twitter following has already crossed 12,000 users, pointing to a growing and active community base. With public launch around the corner and listing set at $0.06, investors entering now are front-running what might become one of 2025’s most celebrated DeFi breakouts. The momentum is building—and so is the price. Don’t miss the next Solana-like surge The window to buy MUTM under $0.04 is closing fast. With the analyst forecast targeting $2+ by 2026, the 57x return potential is already catching the attention of seasoned whales. Those who watched Solana (SOL) soar from obscurity into the top 10 are now turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next big opportunity. This isn’t about hype—it’s about timing. And in crypto, timing is everything.

Celebrating Ethereum’s 10-year anniversary, the company added $56.9 million worth of ETH on July 30 at an average price of $3,809.97 per token. The purchase brings The Ether Machine’s total holdings to 334,757 ETH, cementing its position among the top firms accumulating Ethereum as a long-term strategic asset. The latest acquisition was executed through The Ether Reserve LLC, the firm’s dedicated treasury arm. According to the company, the purchase was funded from a $97 million private placement and marks the start of its broader treasury deployment. As of now, the Ether Reserve still holds $407 million in cash reserves earmarked for additional ETH purchases shortly. “We couldn’t imagine a better way to commemorate Ethereum’s 10th birthday than by deepening our commitment to ether,” co-founder and chairman Andrew Keys said in the press release. “We are just getting started. Our mandate is to accumulate, compound, and support ETH for the long term — not just as a financial asset, but as the backbone of a new internet economy.” Nasdaq listing on the horizon Ether Machine was formed through a business combination between The Ether Reserve and Nasdaq-listed Dynamix Corporation earlier this year. The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals, will see the merged entity go public under the ticker symbol “ETHM.” The transaction includes over $1.5 billion in fully committed capital, anchored by a $645 million Ethereum contribution from Keys. An additional $800 million in equity commitments has been secured from a consortium of institutional backers, including Kraken, Pantera Capital, Blockchain.com, Electric Capital, Archetype, and 1Roundtable/10T Holdings. Upon listing, ETHM is expected to debut with the largest Ethereum treasury of any publicly traded company. Its core strategy centres on generating ETH-denominated yield through staking, restaking, and structured DeFi participation, a model that’s fast becoming a staple among companies adopting an Ethereum treasury strategy. When operational, Ether Machine also plans to offer Ethereum-native infrastructure services to institutional clients, DAOs, and developers, including validator node operations and custom block-building tools. Corporate race for ETH intensifies Over the past few months, Ethereum seems to have become the new coveted treasury asset , mostly due to its passive yield potential through staking and its central role in powering decentralised finance and tokenised real-world assets. Experts at Standard Chartered have reported that public companies have already acquired 1% of Ethereum’s circulating supply since June, and the total corporate holdings now exceed 1.26 million ETH. The bank estimates this figure could rise tenfold in the coming years. It’s not just new capital that’s flowing into Ethereum; companies from outside the crypto sector are also pivoting toward ETH as they rethink their treasury strategies. One of the boldest examples is Nasdaq-listed 180 Life Sciences, which recently announced plans to exit biotech entirely and rebrand as ETHZilla. Another new entrant, FG Nexus — formerly Fundamental Global — is also pivoting to Ethereum. The firm launched a $200 million raise to fund ETH acquisitions. Among existing players, SharpLink Gaming and BitMine Immersion Technologies remain at the forefront of corporate ETH accumulation. SharpLink , often dubbed the “MicroStrategy for Ethereum,” recently expanded its holdings to 438,190 ETH; however, BitMIne currently leads the pack with over 625,000 Ether in its reserves as per data from StrategicETHReserve.

Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) are among the top gainers. Institutional interest, new developments, and a bullish market mood drive both assets' surge. However, while ETH and ADA are expected to maintain their resurgence in Q3, a relatively unknown meme-based project priced under $0.002 quietly stirs up FOMO. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) , a Layer 2 meme-centric blockchain, is gaining traction for all the right reasons. Could this be the surprise winner of the cycle? Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Poised for a Historic Breakout Ethereum is no stranger to market cycles, but Q3 2025 is shaping up to be special. Over the past three months, ETH has surged over 150%, fueled by overwhelming inflows into Ethereum ETFs, massive corporate accumulation, and a looming supply crunch. Ethereum ETFs saw $296.5 million in net inflows in the past day, marking 12 consecutive days of capital injection from institutional investors. The momentum is also visible at the blockchain level. One wallet bought over $397 million in ETH as Ethereum whales picked up 150,000 ETH in four days. These accumulating trends show a long-term conviction in Ethereum's future as a credible store of wealth and the decentralized network's backbone. Ethereum Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Moreover, the recent passage of the GENUIS Act is expected to spark a broader crypto rally. Analysts expect ETH's inclusion in more government-backed portfolios and an expanded role in treasuries. The market has already responded positively to the debut of the Pectra upgrade. With clear legislation now underway, ETH might be the star of this crypto cycle. As of this report, ETH hovers near $3,700 and is eyeing resistance levels around $4,100. A decisive breakout could send it well past the $10,000 mark this quarter. Cardano (ADA) Gains Traction With Apple Integration & Whale Interest Cardano has also carved out its bullish path with key ecosystem integrations and a surge in community interest. ADA is currently one of the top-performing assets in the top 10, posting an impressive 30-day gain of 62%. It’s rapidly approaching the symbolic $1 level, and momentum doesn’t seem to be slowing. Cardano Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Cardano's recent highlight includes the integration of CardanoKit , a native Swift library that allows for ADA support in the iOS ecosystem. This potentially paves the way for Apple Pay compatibility, opening Cardano to millions of iPhone users and adding serious utility to the token's value proposition. Meanwhile, whale activity has exploded. ADA open interest in futures surged to a record high of $1.7 billion, surpassing its 2021 peak. Trading volumes have followed suit, and investor sentiment has flipped fully bullish, with the Fear and Greed Index at 67. As Cardano rides this renewed wave of interest, some analysts predict it could climb toward the $1.20–$1.50 range, or even challenge the $10 mark if broader adoption takes off. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) Enters to Infuse the Meme Magic into Blockchain Power What happens when you mix frog memes with serious blockchain firepower? You get Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), the internet’s new favorite underdog. At first glance, it may look like another meme coin swimming in the sea of crypto tokens, but a deeper dive reveals something much bigger. $LILPEPE isn’t just a transactional coin; it’s the native token of the world’s first Layer 2 blockchain built purely for memes. Little Pepe's Layer 2 chain is designed to be ultra-fast, ultra-cheap, and sniper-bot resistant, a rare combination that gives it serious tech cred. The project doesn’t just rely on hype.

With a total supply of 100 billion tokens and 0% buy/sell taxes, $LILPEPE appeals to both degens and long-term holders. Its vesting schedule is designed to prevent dumping: presale tokens are locked for 3 months post-launch, with just 5% unlocked every 30 days thereafter. Meanwhile, staking, marketing, and reserve tokens follow equally conservative unlocks, promoting price stability and long-term growth. But perhaps what sets Little Pepe apart is its backing by meme veterans who’ve helped push some of the top meme coins to stardom. These advisors bring strategy, virality, and credibility, all wrapped in anonymity. The team is also preparing for listings on two top centralized exchanges (CEXs), with ambitions to land on the biggest exchange in the world shortly after launch. And if you're looking to track your $LILPEPE holdings, it's easy: visit the dashboard and monitor your bag in real time. Why Little Pepe Could Deliver the Biggest Gains This Cycle With a current price under $0.002 and a microcap profile, Little Pepe is sitting in a sweet spot for explosive growth. Unlike Ethereum and Cardano, which already have multibillion-dollar valuations, $LILPEPE is a new market entrant, meaning it has significantly more upside potential, especially in a meme-friendly bull cycle. The token has already raised over $12 million in its presale, now in Stage 8 at $0.0017, with 8.7 billion tokens sold and over 90% of the stage completed. The next price will rise to $0.0018, fueling additional FOMO. Its visibility skyrocketed thanks to a massive $777,000 giveaway campaign , which has received over 140,000 entries since launch. The top 10 winners will each receive $77,000 in tokens. On top of that, Little Pepe has already secured a CoinMarketCap listing , which further legitimizes the project and makes it easy for investors to track. The upcoming CEX listings will likely introduce massive new liquidity, prompting analysts to call it this cycle’s 100x potential. Meme virality, community passion, and blockchain utility converge, and $LILPEPE is the center. Conclusion: ETH and ADA Look Strong, But Little Pepe Could Be the Wild Card In this cycle, significant institutional inflows, bullish mood, and ecosystem growth might see Ethereum and Cardano extend their bullish runs. However, meme magic, actual tech, fair tokenomics, and tremendous community momentum offer Little Pepe distinct upside potential. As the crypto market heats up, all eyes may soon turn to the frog that leapt ahead of the pack. Don’t miss your shot; join the $LILPEPE presale now at littlepepe.com .

If so, you’re not alone. The digital asset space is currently witnessing a phenomenal shift, with the altcoin market taking center stage. Following Bitcoin’s impressive rally to around $120,000, it appears that the spotlight has firmly turned towards alternative cryptocurrencies, often referred to as altcoins. This isn’t just a ripple; it’s a wave, with on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant reporting a significant surge in trading activity, particularly within the perpetual futures segment. What’s Fueling the Altcoin Market Frenzy? The latest data from CryptoQuant, shared on X, paints a compelling picture: altcoins are gaining substantial momentum. This isn’t just anecdotal observation; the numbers speak volumes. Trading activity in the altcoin market , especially in perpetual futures contracts, has seen a remarkable uptick. But what exactly does this surge entail, and why is it so significant? The combined trading volume for Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoin perpetual contracts has soared to an astonishing $223.6 billion. To put this into perspective, this figure represents the highest volume recorded in five months. Even more striking is that this massive volume now constitutes 83% of the total trading volume across centralized exchanges. This dominance clearly indicates a shift in trader focus and capital allocation. Bitcoin’s Precedent: Bitcoin’s strong performance often acts as a catalyst, pulling the broader crypto market, including altcoins, upwards. Its recent surge has instilled confidence, prompting traders to explore higher-beta assets. Search for Alpha: After Bitcoin’s initial run, many traders look to altcoins for potentially larger percentage gains, leveraging their inherent volatility. Narrative-Driven Cycles: Specific narratives within the altcoin space, such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Real World Assets (RWAs), can ignite significant interest and trading volume in related projects. Why Are Perpetual Futures So Important for the Altcoin Market? Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, making them popular for continuous speculation. Their surge in the altcoin market signifies several key trends: Increased Speculation: A high volume in perpetual futures indicates aggressive speculative activity. Traders are actively taking leveraged positions, betting on significant price movements in altcoins. Enhanced Liquidity: The influx of trading volume provides deeper liquidity to the altcoin futures market, making it easier for large orders to be executed without significant price slippage. Broader Participation: The accessibility of perpetual futures on centralized exchanges attracts a wide range of participants, from retail traders to institutional players, all seeking to capitalize on altcoin volatility. Market Sentiment Indicator: High open interest and trading volume in perpetual futures can be a strong indicator of bullish sentiment, as traders are willing to take on more risk for potential gains. Conversely, a sudden drop could signal a shift in sentiment. Is This Sustainable? Understanding the Benefits and Challenges of the Altcoin Market Boom The current momentum in the altcoin market presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. Understanding these aspects is crucial for anyone looking to navigate this dynamic environment. Benefits: High Growth Potential: Altcoins, especially smaller cap projects, can offer exponential returns compared to more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Diversification: Investing in a diversified portfolio of altcoins can help spread risk and capture growth from various sectors within the crypto ecosystem. Innovation Exposure: Altcoins represent the cutting edge of blockchain technology, offering exposure to new applications, protocols, and use cases that could revolutionize various industries. Challenges: Extreme Volatility: While offering high returns, altcoins are notoriously volatile. Prices can swing wildly, leading to significant gains or losses in short periods. Liquidation Risk (in Futures): Trading perpetual futures involves leverage, which amplifies both gains and losses. Incorrect predictions can lead to rapid liquidations, wiping out an entire position. Rug Pulls and Scams: The altcoin space, particularly newer or lesser-known projects, is susceptible to scams and ‘rug pulls,’ where developers abandon a project and disappear with investor funds. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies can impact altcoin projects, potentially leading to delistings or operational challenges. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Altcoin Market with Confidence Given the current fervor, how can you approach the altcoin market responsibly? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Thoroughly research any altcoin project you consider. Look into its whitepaper, team, technology, use case, community, and tokenomics. Understand Leverage: If you engage in futures trading, understand how leverage works. Start with low leverage and only use what you can afford to lose. Implement robust risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across several promising altcoins in different sectors to mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Platforms like CryptoQuant provide valuable on-chain data that can offer insights. Start Small: Especially if you’re new to altcoins or futures trading, begin with smaller amounts to gain experience and understand the market dynamics before committing significant capital. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide whether you are a long-term investor or a short-term trader. This will influence your strategy and risk tolerance. The surge in altcoin futures trading volume is a clear signal that market participants are increasingly confident about the potential of alternative cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon is not merely a consequence of Bitcoin’s rally but also reflects growing interest in the innovative solutions and high growth potential that altcoins offer. However, with great opportunity comes great responsibility. The volatility and inherent risks of the altcoin market demand a cautious yet informed approach. By prioritizing research, understanding risk management, and staying disciplined, investors and traders can better position themselves to navigate this exciting, albeit challenging, landscape. The coming months will undoubtedly be crucial for the altcoin market . Whether this surge leads to sustained growth or a period of consolidation, one thing is clear: altcoins are here to stay, and their influence on the broader crypto ecosystem is only set to grow. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Altcoin Market Surge Q1: What is a perpetual futures contract in crypto? A perpetual futures contract is a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrency without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, they can be held indefinitely as long as margin requirements are met. They are popular for leveraged trading, allowing traders to control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. Q2: Why is the surge in altcoin perpetual futures volume significant? A significant surge in altcoin perpetual futures volume indicates heightened speculative interest and increased liquidity in the altcoin market. It suggests that traders are actively taking leveraged positions, expecting substantial price movements, and reflects a strong bullish sentiment towards altcoins. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s price affect the altcoin market? Bitcoin’s price often acts as a bellwether for the entire cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin performs well, it typically instills confidence, leading capital to flow into altcoins as traders seek higher percentage gains. Conversely, a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s price can trigger a sell-off across the altcoin market. Q4: What are the main risks of trading altcoin futures? The primary risks include high volatility, which can lead to rapid and significant losses, especially when using leverage. There’s also the risk of liquidation, where your position is automatically closed if the market moves against you and your margin falls below a certain level. Additionally, market manipulation and the inherent risks of specific altcoin projects are concerns. Q5: How can I protect myself when investing in altcoins? To protect yourself, always conduct thorough research (DYOR) on any project. Understand its fundamentals, team, and technology. Implement strict risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and only risking a small percentage of your portfolio on any single trade. Diversify your investments across multiple altcoins and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Did you find this article insightful?

A significant development has just emerged concerning THORChain (RUNE) holders on Binance. The global crypto exchange giant, Binance, has announced a temporary Binance RUNE suspension of deposits and withdrawals for the THORChain network. This move, scheduled for July 31st, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, is in direct support of an upcoming, vital upgrade to the THORChain network. Understanding the implications of this suspension and what steps to take is paramount for ensuring your assets remain secure and accessible. Understanding the Binance RUNE Suspension : What’s Happening? Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently issued an official notice detailing its plans to halt all RUNE transactions on its platform. This isn’t an arbitrary decision but a standard procedure undertaken by exchanges to ensure the smooth and secure transition during significant blockchain network upgrades. The temporary Binance RUNE suspension specifically targets deposits and withdrawals of the THORChain network’s native token, RUNE. The announcement specifies that the suspension will commence precisely on July 31, 2024, at 17:00 UTC . While the exact duration of the suspension has not been explicitly stated beyond the commencement time, such halts typically last until the network upgrade is successfully completed and the network’s stability is verified. Users are advised to closely monitor Binance’s official announcements for updates regarding the resumption of services. Why do exchanges implement such measures? There are several key reasons: Data Integrity: To prevent any potential loss or corruption of user funds during the upgrade process, which often involves significant changes to the blockchain’s underlying architecture. Smooth Transition: To ensure that all transactions are accurately recorded on the new, upgraded chain, avoiding discrepancies or forks that could lead to confusion or financial losses. Security: Upgrades can sometimes expose temporary vulnerabilities. Suspending services minimizes the risk of exploitation during these critical periods. Compliance: Ensuring the exchange’s systems are fully compatible with the upgraded network’s protocols. This proactive step by Binance underscores its commitment to user security and the overall health of the THORChain ecosystem. It’s a testament to responsible exchange management, prioritizing the long-term stability of the assets it supports. What is THORChain (RUNE) and Why is This Upgrade Important? For those new to the space, THORChain (RUNE) stands as a groundbreaking decentralized liquidity protocol that enables seamless, non-custodial cross-chain swaps. Unlike traditional centralized exchanges, THORChain allows users to exchange native cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and RUNE itself) directly between different blockchains without wrapping or bridging assets. This functionality is powered by its native utility token, RUNE, which is used for security, governance, and as a settlement asset within the network. Network upgrades are the lifeblood of any evolving blockchain project. They are essential for introducing new features, improving scalability, enhancing security, and fixing bugs. For THORChain, an upgrade can mean: Increased Efficiency: Faster transaction processing times and lower fees. Enhanced Security: Strengthening the network’s resilience against potential attacks. New Capabilities: Introduction of innovative functionalities that expand THORChain’s utility and appeal. Scalability Improvements: Preparing the network to handle a larger volume of transactions and users. While specific details of this particular THORChain upgrade have not been fully disclosed by Binance in their suspension notice, the very act of an exchange halting services for it signifies its importance. Such upgrades are critical for the long-term viability and competitiveness of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like THORChain. For RUNE holders, a successful upgrade typically translates to a more robust, secure, and valuable network, potentially leading to increased adoption and utility for their assets. Actionable Insights for RUNE Holders: What Should You Do Amidst the Binance RUNE Suspension ? If you hold RUNE on Binance or plan to interact with the THORChain network, this announcement requires your immediate attention. Here are some actionable steps and considerations: Avoid Transactions: Absolutely refrain from initiating any RUNE deposits or withdrawals on Binance from July 31, 2024, 17:00 UTC, until Binance officially announces the resumption of these services. Any attempts during this period may result in the loss of your funds or significant delays. Monitor Official Channels: Regularly check Binance’s official announcements page, their blog, and their social media channels for updates. This is the most reliable source of information regarding the status of the Binance RUNE suspension and the resumption of services. Plan Ahead: If you need to move your RUNE before the suspension, ensure you complete your transactions well in advance of the deadline. Consider the time zones carefully to avoid last-minute rushes. No Impact on Holdings: Your RUNE holdings on Binance will remain safe and unaffected during the suspension. This halt only pertains to the ability to move RUNE in or out of the exchange, not the security or value of your existing balance. Consider Alternatives (If Urgent): If you have an urgent need to interact with RUNE during the suspension period, you might explore other exchanges that support RUNE and have not announced a similar suspension, or consider self-custody solutions if you’re comfortable managing your own private keys. However, always exercise extreme caution and verify the legitimacy of any platform. Being proactive and informed is your best defense against potential issues during network upgrades. The temporary inconvenience of a Binance RUNE suspension is a small price to pay for the long-term health and security of the THORChain network. Navigating Future Crypto Exchange Updates: Best Practices The Binance RUNE suspension serves as a valuable reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. Network upgrades, scheduled maintenance, and various other operational adjustments are common occurrences in this space. Developing a routine for staying informed can save you from unexpected surprises and potential losses. Here are some best practices for navigating future crypto exchange updates: Subscribe to Exchange Alerts: Most major exchanges offer email newsletters or notification services for important announcements. Sign up for these. Follow Official Social Media: Follow your preferred exchanges and the projects you invest in on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, or Discord. Be wary of unofficial accounts and always verify information. Regularly Check Announcement Pages: Make it a habit to periodically visit the official announcement sections of the exchanges you use. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just note the ‘what’ of an announcement; try to understand the ‘why’. Knowing the reason behind a suspension or upgrade helps you assess its impact and importance. Diversify (Where Prudent): While not always feasible for every asset, having funds spread across different secure platforms can sometimes offer flexibility during specific exchange-related events. By adopting these habits, you empower yourself to react swiftly and appropriately to any changes, ensuring your crypto journey remains as smooth and secure as possible. In conclusion, the temporary Binance RUNE suspension for deposits and withdrawals, effective July 31, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, is a necessary measure in support of an upcoming THORChain network upgrade. While it requires users to adjust their transaction plans, it is ultimately a positive sign of a healthy, evolving blockchain ecosystem and a responsible exchange. By staying informed, planning ahead, and understanding the reasons behind such actions, RUNE holders can navigate this period with confidence, looking forward to a stronger and more efficient THORChain network post-upgrade.

Atkins supports the PWG’s crypto policy proposals,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sec-says-us-must-lead-crypto-revolution/,"In a new statement, SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins endorsed the PWG’s crypto policy proposals, describing them as the product of sustained inter-agency efforts and a critical step toward regulatory clarity. He emphasized that their efforts align with President Trump’s goal to make the United States the center of the global crypto economy . SEC’s Atkins says the PWG report will drive innovation and protect investors According to Atkins, the PWG report provides a balanced framework for digital asset oversight that encourages innovation, protects investors, and maintains the world-class standing of America’s financial markets. He explained that the framework would preserve market stability, encourage secure adoption, and enhance investor safeguards. He added that the SEC will continue to exercise its existing authority to create new rules and enforce any legislation passed by Congress. Atkins also acknowledged President Trump for his proactive stance on crypto, which was something he had seen was missing in the past administration. He commented, “Thank goodness President Trump does and is leading on it.” He also supported his colleagues, saying he would work with Commissioner Hester Peirce and the SEC’s Crypto Task Force to foster the crypto vision. The PWG report urges closer coordination between the SEC, CFTC, and other key federal agencies to establish a unified, transparent, and consistent regulatory approach. In line with the report’s recommendations, Atkins stated that they will develop innovative and durable regulatory policies that encourage growth in the sector and address potential risks. He noted that the US still needs to step up its efforts to stay ahead in the crypto revolution, saying he’s ready to do his part of the work. The Trump administration had asked regulators to act on the report’s recommendations On Wednesday, the Trump administration urged federal regulators to implement the report’s recommendations. In a fact sheet, the White House commented on the PWG report, saying, “By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can ensure that the United States leads the blockchain revolution and ushers in the Golden Age of Crypto.” It added that the report calls for the SEC and CFTC to act within their authority to facilitate federal-level trading of digital assets by setting clear rules on registration, custody, trading, and recordkeeping. Additionally, per the fact sheet, the report requires regulators to ensure that new financial products can reach the market swiftly, without being held up by red tape. The report also pushes that the agencies clarify which bank functions are allowed in terms of stablecoins and blockchain technology, and for them to enhance disclosure around the process for obtaining bank charters. These recommendations come on the heels of President Trump signing the first-ever congressional legislation regulating stablecoins , a move hailed as a major victory for the crypto sector. The law outlines a framework for US dollar-backed stablecoins, which proponents say will encourage broader adoption of digital assets in mainstream finance, despite controversial views. Some lawmakers criticized the stablecoin framework, believing the president still has conflicts of interest. Trump and his family have affiliations with digital asset businesses, such as World Liberty Financial, a platform that has launched its token and stablecoin.

The asset is currently moving toward the upper bands of its two-week range-bound channel and could break out soon. “I think I’m wrong about ETH getting some short-term downside,” crypto analyst ‘Byzantine General’ told his 236,000 X followers on Wednesday. “It’s too strong and refuses to print any significant correction,” they added, noting that derivatives funding rates were going negative. Funding rates are periodic payments between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the underlying asset’s spot price. When funding rates go below baseline, it usually indicates bearish market sentiment as more traders are short than long, creating an imbalance, but this doesn’t seem to be happening with ETH.

Founder and CEO of ITC Crypto, Benjamin Cowen, zoomed out, noting the previous rejections at $4,000 in 2024 and saying that Ether needed to “go home” or crash back to bear market levels, which it did in April 2025. Now that the big dump has happened, ETH should break $4,000 this time around, he said. Cowen has predicted that the asset will trade in a realistic range of $5,700 to $7,500 for new all-time highs this cycle. Meanwhile, ‘Crypto GEMs’ predicted that ETH would reach $5,000 by the end of August. This month of the bull market year (the one after the Bitcoin halving) has been historically good for Ether. Super complex technical analysis for Ethereum pic.twitter.com/k4eSLlxuD3 — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) July 31, 2025 ‘Crypto Xlarge’ observed that Ethereum is currently testing the major $3,900 weekly resistance zone. They added that RSI is still not in overbought territory, the post-2021 all-time high breakout structure looks much healthier, and the downtrend has already been broken with a successful retest. The Ethereum community celebrated Ethereum’s 10th anniversary by ringing the closing bell at NASDAQ on Wednesday. “We worked to seed a new ecosystem and onboard TradFi to DeFi, with a mission to rebuild the global financial system. And together, we’re doing it,” said Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin. ETH Price Outlook Ether has gained 1.2% on the day to reach $3,860 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session. However, this resistance level has been approached twice before over the past week, proving too strong. Institutions continue to accumulate the asset with spot Ether ETFs equalling their record 19-day inflow streak and corporate treasury firms purchasing more ETH .

While the SEC has not yet approved any altcoin ETFs other than Ethereum, two major US exchanges have applied to the SEC for simplified regulations for crypto ETF listings. Accordingly, the securities exchange Cboe BZX Exchange, along with NYSE Arca, filed a rule change with the SEC to ensure faster processing of cryptocurrency ETF listings, requesting changes for ETFs to speed up the transaction process. Exchanges have proposed allowing ETF issuers to list their products under a single framework, without having to apply for approval separately for each new cryptocurrency ETF. If approved, this could eliminate the need for separate approvals for each new fund and simplify the approval process. Experts said the proposal from Cboe and NYSE would eliminate the existing review process for exchange rule change applications for ETFs (19b-4) and allow ETFs that meet certain requirements to be automatically listed and traded without additional approval procedures. Under current regulations, exchanges must file Form 19b-4 for each new crypto ETF offering, leading to a lengthy and complex review process of up to 240 days. However, the proposed new framework could shorten this timeframe and simplify the process. Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, said: “Cboe has filed a 19b-4 requesting a rule change that would allow crypto ETFs to be listed and traded under a standard framework. In other words, issuers would not need to seek special approval for each crypto ETF, as long as it meets certain criteria.” *This is not investment advice.

Posting at 2:46 p.m. on July 30, 2025, he shared a TradingView snapshot and wrote: “DOGE weekly — Ichimoku cloud — Bullish Tenkan–Kijun cross — Finding support at the Tenkan (blue line).” He followed with a straightforward disclosure: “I bought a little bit more $DOGE here.” This Dogecoin Ichimoku Signal Can’t Be Ignored The chart he published was captured at 12:46 UTC on July 30 and showed Dogecoin (weekly timeframe) trading near $0.216 after a week-to-date decline of 10.23%. TradingView’s readout on the image lists weekly O/H/L/C at 0.24076 / 0.24854 / 0.21440 / 0.21613, alongside Ichimoku values Tenkan-sen 0.21517, Kijun-sen 0.21142, Senkou Span A 0.21329, and Senkou Span B 0.28247. The thrust of the analyst’s call rests on classic Ichimoku mechanics. The Tenkan-sen (conversion line) has crossed above the Kijun-sen (base line) on the weekly chart—an event technicians describe as a bullish Tenkan–Kijun cross. In the posted image, spot price sits marginally above the Tenkan and Kijun, consistent with his comment that price is “finding support at the Tenkan.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Unlock To Put $22.9M Worth Of Tokens Into Circulation In Ichimoku methodology, the Tenkan often acts as a fast-moving gauge of momentum and, when rising above the slower Kijun, can mark the start of a momentum-led trend attempt. On higher timeframes such as the weekly, participants typically treat those inflections as more consequential than on intraday charts. That said, the same screenshot shows DOGE trading beneath the weekly cloud (Kumo) projected ahead, with Senkou Span B up near the $0.28 area. In textbook terms, signals that occur below the cloud are generally categorized as weaker than signals that occur above it, even when the Tenkan–Kijun cross is bullish. The image also captures the context of the move: after a forceful green candle in mid-July, two red weekly candles followed, leaving price clustered around the Tenkan/Kijun zone. Related Reading: Is $1 Dogecoin ‚Inevitable‘? Analyst Cites Perfect Storm Of Factors Pressed for a status check a day later, the analyst reiterated that the technical picture had not broken down: “DOGE holding weekly Ichimoku Tenkan and Kijun support so far,” he wrote on July 31. That comment underscores how Ichimoku practitioners often judge trend health by whether price can close above the Kijun on the chosen timeframe and continue to respect the Tenkan on pullbacks. For now, the story is a straightforward one: a bullish Tenkan–Kijun cross on the weekly chart, with price attempting to base at those lines while the cloud overhead still looms as longer-term resistance. As ever with Ichimoku analysis, the coming weekly close relative to the Tenkan and Kijun will be the focal reference for traders tracking whether this early signal can mature into a broader uptrend. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22.

Alongside this, the company’s total net revenue climbed to $989 million, marking a 45% increase, while net income jumped 105% to $386 million. Despite outperforming Wall Street expectations, shares of Robinhood dipped slightly in after-hours trading. The boost in revenue coincided with a 32% rise in crypto trading volumes to $28 billion, in line with a broader market rally that lifted the total crypto market cap by 21.7% to $3.36 trillion. CEO Vlad Tenev used the earnings call to emphasize the firm’s long-term strategy to lead in asset tokenization, following the launch of Robinhood Chain — a layer 2 blockchain designed for stock trading in Europe. Targeting Private Markets Through Tokenization Tenev described tokenization as the most transformative innovation in financial services over the last decade. “Private markets and related real-world assets are opportunities that don’t exist up until now,” he said. Robinhood aims to make traditionally illiquid and inaccessible assets like private equity, venture capital funds, and real estate available to retail investors via tokenization. The company’s recent $200 million acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp is expected to serve as a cornerstone for executing this tokenization strategy. Robinhood has already begun issuing private equity tokens in Europe that simulate the shares of high-profile firms such as SpaceX and OpenAI. Interest from developers has grown rapidly since the strategy was unveiled at a high-profile event in Cannes. “We’ve just got lots and lots of calls from developers that either want to tokenize the shares of their own companies or otherwise jump on the tokenization of real-world assets revolution,” Tenev noted. Robinhood Faces Legal Hurdles and Market Competition However, the platform’s early tokenization efforts have not gone unnoticed by regulators. A legal inquiry has been opened in Lithuania regarding Robinhood’s RWA tokens , while OpenAI clarified that Robinhood’s token representing its equity does not constitute a real stake in the company. Still, Tenev believes Robinhood is well-positioned to scale the initiative. With over 25 million users and $1 trillion in assets under custody, he argues that no blockchain-native firm has the same reach or infrastructure to pursue retail-facing tokenized assets at this scale. While Ethereum leads the RWA market with nearly $7 billion in tokenized assets, the company’s strategy suggests it is betting big on bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto infrastructure.

Priced at just $0.035 in its ongoing Phase 6 presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining strong momentum among investors who are now actively looking beyond traditional blue-chip cryptocurrencies. What makes this protocol stand out isn’t price alone—it’s the well-structured, utility-driven ecosystem that backs the MUTM token with real DeFi mechanics and tangible value generation. Bitcoin (BTC) Flatlines for a Third Straight Day Bitcoin (BTC) has remained stagnant near $119,000 for three consecutive days, trading at ~$118,421 with a 0.39% 24-hour decline, as per CoinMarketCap data. Despite record ETF inflows exceeding $55 billion, including $157.02 million recently, BTC struggles to break the $120,000 resistance, with support at $116,000. On-chain data shows 40,000 BTC ($4.7B) flowed to exchanges recently, signaling profit-taking, while miners’ revenue pressures (MPI at 2.78) add headwinds. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart suggests a potential breakout, but low 7-day volatility (1.34%) indicates indecision. Institutional demand, driven by BlackRock’s IBIT ($20B+), remains robust, yet macro uncertainty from U.S.-China trade talks and a neutral Altcoin Season Index (51) dampen momentum. A break above $119,500 could target $122,000, but failure may see a dip to $112,000. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Building During Bitcoin’s Pause Bitcoin’s stability in the short term might signal uncertainty, but while large-cap assets consolidate, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are building from the ground up. The platform is not just a simple lending protocol—it represents a shift toward decentralized finance infrastructure that combines borrowing, lending, passive earnings, and native stablecoin integration within one framework. This makes it an ecosystem, not just a token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique Pooled-to-Contract (P2C) lending model enables users to deposit assets such as USDT, DAI, ETH, or BTC and receive mtTokens, which serve as interest-bearing tokens representing their share in the lending pool. These mtTokens automatically increase in value based on real-time pool utilization. Users can then stake these mtTokens in dedicated smart contracts to earn additional MUTM rewards—rewards that are consistently bought back from the open market using the platform’s revenue. This closed-loop reward system avoids inflation and aligns the interests of both protocol users and token holders. Meanwhile, the borrowing side offers overcollateralized loans using stable or blue-chip assets. For example, a borrower depositing $10,000 in ETH at a 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio would receive $6,000 in liquidity—without having to sell their ETH. This model enables users to retain their asset exposure while accessing capital, a key incentive during sideways or bullish markets. Lenders, in turn, benefit from competitive APYs reaching 10–12%, especially during high utilization periods. For those seeking higher risk-reward strategies, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduces Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. This secondary model allows lenders to negotiate terms directly with borrowers—especially useful for newer or riskier memecoins like DOGE, FLOKI, TRUMP. While it’s not the protocol’s core feature, it adds optionality for experienced users and demonstrates how the ecosystem is engineered for diverse DeFi participants. Security-conscious investors will also take note of the project’s CertiK audit, boasting a Token Security Score of 95 and Skynet rating of 78—demonstrating transparency and a commitment to protocol integrity. Moreover, the team is actively encouraging public participation with a $50,000 bug bounty program, while marketing efforts are being reinforced through a $100,000 giveaway , where ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The Numbers That Matter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, offering tokens at $0.035. So far, the project has already raised $13.8 million, with 14,700+ unique holders participating in the early rounds. As demand continues to build, the token price is set to increase by 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7. This rapid accumulation signals growing confidence in the platform, especially from users who are looking for strong upside potential rather than waiting for another BTC rally. The total token supply is 4 billion MUTM, and at a planned listing price of $0.06, those who got in at Phase 1 ($0.01) would be looking at 6x returns, while even current Phase 6 buyers at $0.035 could be eyeing a solid 70% upside before listing. However, internal projections are significantly more ambitious. Analysts covering this presale have floated future price targets as high as $1.50, which would imply over 42x growth from the current entry point. Add to this a growing social base, with 12,000+ Twitter followers and rising engagement from the DeFi community, and it becomes clear that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a solid foundation before its launch. The platform is also integrating a Layer-2 solution, ensuring scalability and lower transaction costs—two major pain points in legacy DeFi protocols. While meme coins and speculative tokens dominate headlines, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represent the evolution of smart money. It’s not about the noise—it’s about the structure, utility, and reward logic that gives real-world function to crypto investment.

The JAM upgrade removes fees and adds parallel chains, drawing more developers to Polkadot. With the price near key levels, the volume surge hints at a shift against larger assets like Ethereum. ETF Approval Creates New Access for Investors Polkadot has moved into focus following recent changes in ETF listing standards. The US Securities and Exchange Commission currently allows ETFs on assets with more than six months of regulated futures trading. This requirement is met by DOT, which has been trading on Coinbase futures since July 2024. Consequently, Grayscale and 21Shares are among the asset managers that are developing exchange-traded products backed by DOT. Launching may commence in September or October of 2025. These products may bring Polkadot to a broader market, offering exposure through regulated investment channels. DOT ETF IS COMING!

The new design uses multiple smaller chains running at the same time. This setup removes gas fees and is built to improve transaction speed. The upgrade involves 38 development teams and is supported by dedicated funding. It is expected to begin before the end of 2025. Activity around JAM has brought more developer attention and shifted focus back to Polkadot’s roadmap. DOT Price Update and Market History At the time of writing, DOT was priced at $3.90. It recorded a slight gain over the last 24 hours but is down nearly 1% over the past week. The highest price reached was $54.98 in November 2021, while the lowest was $2.70 in August 2020. Source: Coingecko Volume over the past 24 hours reached $340 million. With the price trading near a key level from earlier market cycles and volume showing signs of growth, traders are monitoring the pair closely. This setup may point to the beginning of a shift in momentum when compared to other large-cap assets, including Ethereum .

The clip falsely claims that Ripple is launching a massive XRP giveaway following its lawsuit resolution with the SEC. The video shows Garlinghouse seated in what appears to be a corporate office setting, speaking directly to the camera about XRP’s future and announcing a 100 million XRP giveaway. It was posted by a verified account to target XRP community members, but Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, quickly responded, flagging it as fraudulent. pic.twitter.com/fL6rDF7Pv9 — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 30, 2025 Deepfake Video Targets XRP Community The clip appears to be a deepfake, a type of AI-generated content that mimics public figures using realistic visuals and voice synthesis. The tactic has been increasingly used in financial scams to gain the trust of unsuspecting viewers. What makes the timing of this scam notable is its connection to recent developments in Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June, Ripple announced that it would drop its appeal against the SEC , with the CEO stating that the company was closing that chapter. The SEC is expected to take a similar approach, effectively ending the dispute that began in 2020. The scammer behind the deepfake is exploiting this news, using it to lend credibility to the giveaway hoax. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Avoiding Scammers in the Crypto Space Garlinghouse recently warned the community about similar scams on YouTube, where scammers impersonate Ripple’s official account to attack the community. According to the CEO, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. He noted that XRP’s success and market rallies have drawn out these scammers. However, the company constantly stays ahead of them, keeping the community updated on these scam tactics and ensuring everyone stays safe and secures their investments. The impersonation tactics used in this case align with broader trends in cryptocurrency-related fraud. Attackers often exploit trending topics, verified accounts, or legitimate user replies to increase the visibility of fake promotions. In some cases, they encourage victims to send tokens to an address with the promise of multiplied returns, only for those funds to be lost permanently. Schwartz is also known for regularly calling out impersonators and scams on X and has a consistent history of exposing these schemes. His response in this instance was clear and direct, and Ripple and its executives have consistently reiterated that they will never ask the community for XRP .

Five notable miner wallets from 2010 moved 250 BTC in the past day. BTC from 2010 moved from miner wallets, showing not all inactive holders lead to lost coins. A total of five early wallets moved 250 Bitcoin, becoming a part of the trend for old coins to be shifted around or sold. The five miner wallets probably belonged to the same individual, as they were consolidated in two new addresses. One of the new wallets contained over $11M, while the other wallet held 150 BTC valued at over $17.7M. The coins were mined when market prices were under $0.10. All the block rewards were received on the same day, during the time when Satoshi Nakamoto was also producing blocks. The miner moved the coins as Bitcoin recovered above $118,000, with still robust spot demand. Whales have proven to be long-term holders, but also ready to take profits at the market peak. Previously, miners were awakened from dormancy during the late 2024 market rally, with one ancient whale sending 50 BTC directly to Binance. Bitcoin moves from untouched block rewards The Bitcoin moved all came from untouched block rewards of 50 coins, received on April 2010. The wallets come from the Satoshi era, mined at a much lower difficulty and minimal electricity expenses. 5 miner wallets woke up after being dormant for over 15 years and transferred 250 $BTC ($29.6M) out an hour ago. These miner wallets earned 50 $BTC each from mining on Apr 26, 2010.

While the attack is unable to really establish ownership over the coins, the transactions seem to have become a trigger for securing the ancient coins into new addresses. The recent miner selling arrived just a day after another ancient investor moved 3,963 BTC . The relatively small amounts of coins are not able to affect the market, which recently absorbed sales of 80K BTC without crashing the price. However, old miner coins with no history may be valuable to treasuries. Small-scale treasury buyers can join the top 100 of corporate holders with as low as 29 Bitcoin, meaning even a few older BTC can help create the basis for reserves with provable origin. Miner reserves turn lower on profit-taking Prominent mining companies often retain their coins, forming an organic treasury. Big-scale entities like Mara Holdings have expanded their wallets above 50,000 BTC. Overall, miners decreased their reserves from 1.9M Bitcoin down to 1.8M, based on Cryptoquant data . Despite this, hashrate remains high, barring seasonal fluctuations due to low hydroelectric power resources. Based on the hash ribbon indicator, miners are producing blocks very close to distress conditions. This time, there is no clear miner capitulation, but some are taking profits to make use of the low production price of their older BTC. The selling may also be a part of the pivot to AI data centers, which some of the biggest mining companies have taken up. The Bitcoin hashrate is back above 915 EH/s, with difficulty near its all-time high. Mining remains extremely competitive, though companies are still ready to build mining facilities for their own use, or to lend hashrate.

Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a substantial Binance withdrawal , where a newly created wallet moved a staggering $4.2 million in various cryptocurrencies from the popular exchange. This isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver that provides valuable insights into market sentiment and the behavior of large holders. Understanding these on-chain movements is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the complexities of the digital asset landscape. Unpacking the Recent Strategic Binance Withdrawal The specific details of this notable Binance withdrawal were brought to light by Onchain Lens on X, a reputable source for on-chain analytics. The newly established wallet orchestrated a multi-asset transfer, meticulously moving significant portions of several prominent cryptocurrencies. Let’s break down the components of this substantial transfer: 80,126 LINK: Valued at approximately $1.46 million, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, represents a key player in the decentralized oracle network space. Its inclusion suggests a belief in the long-term utility and adoption of oracle services. 110.34 Billion SHIB: Worth roughly $1.45 million, this massive amount of Shiba Inu (SHIB) highlights continued interest in meme coins, even among significant holders. It speaks to the speculative, yet often lucrative, nature of this segment of the market. 3.44 Million MATIC: Totaling about $762,000, Polygon’s MATIC token indicates an investment in scaling solutions for the Ethereum blockchain. This signals an understanding of the ongoing need for efficient and cost-effective transaction processing in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. 142.62 ETH: Valued at approximately $552,000, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ETH, remains a cornerstone of the crypto world. Its inclusion underscores confidence in the foundational blockchain that powers countless decentralized applications and innovations. These transactions, particularly when originating from a newly created wallet and moving away from an exchange, are widely interpreted as moves towards self-custody or long-term holding. This means the assets are likely being transferred to a personal wallet, often a hardware wallet (cold storage), where the owner has direct control over their private keys, rather than leaving them on an exchange. Why Do Large Crypto Withdrawals Matter? Decoding Wallet Behavior When a substantial amount of cryptocurrency is moved from an exchange like Binance to a private wallet, it’s not just a technicality; it’s a signal. These large-scale Binance withdrawal events can offer several insights into the intentions of the holder and, by extension, potentially influence market sentiment: 1. The Shift to Self-Custody: One of the primary reasons for such a move is to enhance security. Keeping assets on an exchange exposes them to risks like hacks, regulatory seizures, or exchange insolvency. Moving them to a personal, non-custodial wallet gives the owner complete control and significantly reduces these risks. This often indicates a long-term conviction in the assets’ value, as the holder is willing to take on the responsibility of managing their own private keys. 2. Accumulation Phase: Large withdrawals can signal that a ‘whale’ (a large holder) is accumulating assets, moving them off the market to hold for an extended period. This reduces the immediate selling pressure on exchanges and can be seen as a bullish indicator, suggesting that the holder believes the price will appreciate in the future. 3. Reduced Exchange Liquidity: While not immediately impactful for smaller withdrawals, a series of large withdrawals can slightly reduce the liquidity available on exchanges. This means there might be fewer assets readily available for trading, which could, in extreme cases, contribute to price volatility if demand surges. 4. Preparation for DeFi or Other Protocols: Sometimes, assets are withdrawn from exchanges not just for holding, but to be utilized in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, staking, or other on-chain activities that require direct wallet connection. This suggests active participation in the broader crypto ecosystem. Understanding the Assets: What Makes LINK, SHIB, MATIC, and ETH So Appealing? The choice of assets in this particular Binance withdrawal is telling. It reflects a diversified strategy that taps into different facets of the crypto market: Chainlink (LINK): As a decentralized oracle network, Chainlink provides real-world data to smart contracts, enabling them to execute based on external information. Its importance grows with the expansion of DeFi and Web3, making it a fundamental piece of the blockchain infrastructure. Investors often see LINK as a long-term play on the maturation of decentralized applications. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Starting as a meme coin, SHIB has evolved to include its own ecosystem, including a decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap) and efforts towards a Layer-2 solution (Shibarium). Its appeal often lies in its strong community, viral potential, and the possibility of rapid price appreciation, albeit with higher volatility. Polygon (MATIC): Polygon is a leading Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, aiming to address its scalability and high transaction fee issues. By offering faster and cheaper transactions, Polygon enhances the usability of Ethereum-based applications. MATIC’s inclusion suggests a belief in the continued growth of the Ethereum ecosystem and the necessity of scaling solutions. Ethereum (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized internet. Its transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge) and ongoing upgrades aim to make it more scalable, secure, and sustainable. ETH is often considered a core holding for crypto investors due to its foundational role in DeFi, NFTs, and numerous other decentralized applications. The combination of these assets suggests a balanced approach, blending established giants with promising scaling solutions and even high-potential meme coins, indicating a sophisticated understanding of the market’s diverse opportunities. The Crucial Role of On-Chain Analytics in Tracking a Binance Withdrawal In the transparent world of blockchain, every transaction leaves a trace. On-chain analytics platforms, like Onchain Lens, are indispensable tools for monitoring these movements. They provide the public with the ability to track large transfers, identify wallet addresses, and analyze transaction patterns. How On-Chain Analytics Work: Data Aggregation: These platforms constantly scan blockchain networks, collecting data on every transaction, including sender/receiver addresses, amounts, timestamps, and fees. Wallet Profiling: They often categorize wallets (e.g., exchange wallets, whale wallets, miner wallets) to provide context to transactions. Pattern Recognition: Advanced algorithms identify unusual patterns, large transfers, or significant accumulations/distributions that might signal market shifts. Insights Generation: The raw data is then transformed into digestible insights, charts, and alerts that help investors understand market dynamics beyond just price charts. For investors, monitoring these tools means gaining an edge. A large Binance withdrawal , when identified by an on-chain analyst, can prompt further investigation, helping one understand potential shifts in supply dynamics or long-term investor sentiment. Is This a Bullish or Bearish Sign for the Crypto Market? The interpretation of a large Binance withdrawal can vary, but generally, moving assets off an exchange is seen as a positive, or at least neutral, sign: Generally Bullish: When assets are withdrawn from exchanges, it typically means they are being moved to cold storage for long-term holding. This reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market, as these assets are no longer readily available for quick trades. It indicates strong conviction from the holder, suggesting they anticipate future price appreciation. Reduced Selling Pressure: Fewer coins on exchanges mean less potential supply available for immediate sale. If demand remains constant or increases, this supply crunch can lead to upward price pressure. Increased Decentralization: The move towards self-custody aligns with the core ethos of cryptocurrency – decentralization. It empowers individuals with full control over their assets, reducing reliance on centralized entities. While a withdrawal doesn’t guarantee a price surge, it certainly doesn’t carry the same negative connotations as a large deposit to an exchange, which often precedes selling activity. Actionable Insights for Navigating Significant Crypto Transfers For everyday investors, understanding these large-scale movements can provide valuable lessons and actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: While you don’t need to be an expert, following reputable on-chain analysts (like Onchain Lens) can provide early warnings or confirmations of significant trends. Tools like Glassnode, CryptoQuant, or even free blockchain explorers can offer basic insights. Consider Self-Custody: If you plan to hold your cryptocurrencies for the long term, learn about and implement self-custody solutions like hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor). This protects your assets from exchange-specific risks. Diversify Your Portfolio: As seen in this Binance withdrawal , even large holders diversify across different types of assets (utility tokens, meme coins, Layer-2s, foundational cryptocurrencies). This strategy helps mitigate risk and capture opportunities across various market segments. Don’t Panic Trade: A single large withdrawal or deposit shouldn’t be the sole basis for your trading decisions. Always combine on-chain data with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and broader market sentiment. Understand the ‘Why’: Instead of just noting a transaction, try to understand the potential motivations behind it. Is it a new wallet? An old whale waking up? A transfer to a DeFi protocol? The ‘why’ often provides more insight than the ‘what’. Challenges and Considerations in Crypto Self-Custody While the benefits of a Binance withdrawal to self-custody are clear, it’s essential to acknowledge the associated responsibilities and challenges: Responsibility of Private Keys: With self-custody comes the absolute responsibility of safeguarding your private keys or seed phrase. Losing them means losing access to your funds forever. There’s no ‘forgot password’ option. Security Risks: While less prone to exchange hacks, personal wallets can still be vulnerable to phishing attacks, malware, or physical theft if not properly secured. Education on best security practices is paramount. Complexity: For beginners, setting up and managing a hardware wallet can seem daunting. The learning curve is real, but necessary for secure long-term holding. Market Volatility: Even if held securely, the value of the assets remains subject to market fluctuations. A strategic withdrawal doesn’t guarantee price stability. These challenges underscore the importance of thorough research and a careful approach when deciding to move your assets off an exchange. Concluding Thoughts on This Significant Binance Withdrawal The recent $4.2 million Binance withdrawal by a newly created wallet is more than just a large transaction; it’s a microcosm of the evolving crypto landscape. It highlights the growing trend of investors prioritizing self-custody, demonstrating long-term conviction in specific digital assets, and leveraging sophisticated on-chain analytics to inform their strategies. Whether seen as a bullish signal for the market or simply a prudent security measure, such movements underscore the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency. As the ecosystem matures, tracking these strategic transfers will remain a vital practice for understanding market sentiment and making informed investment decisions. The power of transparency offered by blockchain technology continues to empower investors with unprecedented insights into the flow of digital wealth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does a large crypto withdrawal from an exchange typically signify? A large crypto withdrawal, especially from a newly created wallet, typically signifies a move towards self-custody for long-term holding. This reduces immediate selling pressure on exchanges and often indicates strong conviction from the holder in the assets’ future value. It’s generally viewed as a bullish or neutral signal. 2. Why would a newly created wallet make such a significant transfer? A newly created wallet might make a significant transfer for several reasons: to move assets into more secure cold storage (hardware wallets), to prepare funds for participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or as part of an accumulation strategy by a new large investor (whale) entering the market. 3. What are LINK, SHIB, MATIC, and ETH, and why are they significant? LINK (Chainlink) is crucial for connecting smart contracts to real-world data. SHIB (Shiba Inu) is a popular meme coin with a growing ecosystem. MATIC (Polygon) is a leading Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, enhancing transaction speed and cost-efficiency. ETH (Ethereum) is the foundational blockchain for countless decentralized applications. Their significance lies in their diverse roles, from infrastructure and scaling to speculative and community-driven projects, appealing to different investment theses. 4. How can investors track large crypto movements like this Binance withdrawal ? Investors can track large crypto movements using on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers. Tools like Onchain Lens, Glassnode, CryptoQuant, Etherscan, or BscScan allow users to view transaction details, track wallet addresses, and identify significant transfers, providing transparency into market activities. 5. Is moving crypto to a personal wallet safer than keeping it on an exchange? Yes, moving crypto to a personal, non-custodial wallet (especially a hardware wallet) is generally considered safer for long-term holding than keeping it on an exchange. This is because you retain full control of your private keys, eliminating risks associated with exchange hacks, insolvency, or regulatory actions. However, it also places the full responsibility of security on you. 6. Does a large Binance withdrawal indicate a bullish or bearish market trend? A large Binance withdrawal is generally interpreted as a bullish or neutral sign. It suggests that the assets are being moved off the exchange for holding, reducing the immediate supply available for sale and indicating long-term conviction by the holder. This contrasts with large deposits to exchanges, which often precede selling activity and can be seen as bearish. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

After a notable rebound, ETH has climbed back to levels near its March 2024 high of $3,980. This impressive recovery has naturally captured the attention of investors worldwide. However, a deeper dive into on-chain data, courtesy of leading analytics firm Glassnode, reveals an even more intriguing picture: despite this price surge, unrealized profits among ETH holders remain surprisingly low. This fascinating disparity isn’t just a minor detail; it’s a powerful signal that could point to substantial upside potential for Ethereum, with some analysts eyeing a possible target of $4,900. Let’s embark on a comprehensive Ethereum price analysis to uncover the layers of this compelling market dynamic. Understanding the Current Ethereum Price Analysis Landscape Ethereum’s recent price action has been a testament to its resilience. Having recovered significantly to levels approaching its March 2024 peak, ETH demonstrates robust market demand. Yet, Glassnode’s recent insights, shared on X, highlight a critical on-chain metric: the level of unrealized profits . These refer to the gains investors would realize if they sold their ETH at the current market price, but have not yet done so. Glassnode’s observation reveals that, despite the strong price rebound, the overall unrealized profits held by the market are notably lower than what one might typically expect at these price points. This suggests a unique market condition, setting it apart from previous cycles where widespread unrealized gains often led to profit-taking. Here’s what Glassnode’s data implies: Strong Price Recovery: ETH has effectively rebounded, signaling renewed buyer confidence and market strength. Limited Unrealized Gains: A significant portion of ETH holders are not yet sitting on substantial paper profits, indicating less immediate incentive for widespread selling. Bullish Disparity: This gap between a strong price and low unrealized profits suggests reduced selling pressure, potentially paving the way for further upward movement. This dynamic creates a compelling foundation for future price movements, implying that the market has absorbed recent volatility without triggering a massive wave of profit-taking, thus preparing the ground for continued growth. Why Low Unrealized Profits Signal Upside Potential for ETH? The notion that low unrealized profits can be a bullish signal might seem counterintuitive, but it’s a core tenet of sophisticated Ethereum price analysis using on-chain data. The psychology behind this metric is crucial. When a large segment of the market holds significant unrealized gains, the temptation to sell and lock in those profits increases, creating potential downward pressure. Conversely, when unrealized profits are low, it suggests that: Recent Accumulation: Many investors may have acquired ETH at relatively higher prices recently, meaning they haven’t yet seen substantial returns. Strong Conviction: Existing holders might possess a strong long-term belief in Ethereum’s value, choosing to hold even through price fluctuations, anticipating higher targets. Reduced Supply Pressure: With fewer participants eager to sell, the market faces less immediate supply, allowing price appreciation to occur more freely if demand persists or grows. Glassnode’s findings suggest that the market is currently in a state where sellers are less inclined to offload their holdings, creating a ‘coiled spring’ effect. If buying pressure continues, there’s less resistance from profit-takers, which could accelerate price discovery. This underpins Glassnode’s projection of a possible $4,900 target, a level that would represent a new all-time high for Ethereum and likely ignite broader market enthusiasm. What Factors Influence Ethereum’s Price Trajectory Beyond On-Chain Metrics? While on-chain data provides invaluable insights for Ethereum price analysis , ETH’s trajectory is also profoundly shaped by broader ecosystem developments and macroeconomic forces. A holistic understanding requires looking beyond the immediate data points. Key catalysts driving Ethereum’s potential include: Network Upgrades: Ethereum’s continuous improvement roadmap is a major factor. The recent Dencun upgrade significantly reduced transaction fees on Layer 2 networks, enhancing scalability and user experience. Future upgrades focused on efficiency and decentralization will further solidify its foundational role. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) & NFTs: Ethereum remains the leading platform for DeFi and a significant hub for NFTs. Continued innovation and growth in these sectors directly drive demand for ETH as gas and collateral. Institutional Adoption: Following the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, anticipation for a potential spot Ethereum ETF is high. Approval could unlock substantial institutional capital, providing a significant boost to ETH’s price and market legitimacy. Global Macroeconomic Environment: Broader economic trends, interest rates, and geopolitical stability can influence investor risk appetite. As a risk asset, ETH’s performance is often intertwined with these larger financial narratives. These external factors, combined with the bullish on-chain signals from Glassnode, paint a comprehensive picture of Ethereum’s dynamic and evolving market position. Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights for Your Ethereum Price Analysis Strategy The cryptocurrency market is famously volatile, and Ethereum is no exception. While Glassnode’s report offers a bullish perspective, it’s crucial for investors to adopt a disciplined approach. Effective Ethereum price analysis involves not just identifying potential gains but also robust risk management. Consider these actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Research (DYOR): Always combine insights from reputable sources like Glassnode with your own independent research into market trends, technical indicators, and Ethereum’s fundamentals. Understand Risk Tolerance: Only invest capital you can afford to lose. Define clear entry and exit strategies aligned with your personal financial goals. Implement Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Mitigate volatility by investing a fixed amount regularly, rather than a single lump sum. This averages out your purchase price over time. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid over-concentration in a single asset. Spreading investments across different cryptocurrencies or asset classes can help manage risk. Stay Informed and Adapt: The crypto landscape changes rapidly. Keep abreast of network developments, regulatory news, and market sentiment, and be prepared to adjust your strategy accordingly. Prioritize Security: Protect your ETH holdings with strong, unique passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant amounts. By integrating these practices, you can better navigate market fluctuations and potentially capitalize on Ethereum’s growth trajectory. Challenges and Considerations for Ethereum’s Path Forward While the future for Ethereum appears bright, a balanced Ethereum price analysis must also acknowledge potential challenges and headwinds. Understanding these obstacles is key to informed decision-making. Key considerations include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Adverse regulations in major jurisdictions could impact adoption and market sentiment. Competition: Ethereum faces increasing competition from other Layer 1 blockchains offering alternative solutions for scalability and fees, challenging its market dominance. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic downturns, such as rising interest rates or recessions, can reduce investor risk appetite, potentially affecting crypto prices. Network Scalability: Despite ongoing upgrades, periods of extreme network demand can still lead to congestion and higher transaction fees on the mainnet, impacting user experience. Security Risks: Like any digital system, Ethereum is vulnerable to smart contract exploits, exchange hacks, or other security breaches, which could erode investor confidence. These challenges underscore the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the crypto market, emphasizing the need for continuous vigilance. The latest Ethereum price analysis from Glassnode paints a compelling picture: ETH’s strong rebound, coupled with surprisingly low unrealized profits, suggests a robust foundation for significant further gains. This unique market dynamic, where widespread profit-taking is less likely, could pave the way for a push towards the $4,900 mark. While on-chain metrics provide powerful insights, it’s Ethereum’s relentless innovation, its thriving ecosystem, and growing institutional interest that truly underpin its long-term potential. As with any investment, prudence, continuous research, and a comprehensive understanding of both opportunities and risks are paramount. Ethereum continues to be a cornerstone of the decentralized future, and its journey ahead promises to be nothing short of captivating. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are ‘unrealized profits’ in the context of cryptocurrency? Unrealized profits represent the potential gains an investor has on their digital assets that have not yet been sold.

There’s a palpable shift happening, and it’s all centered around Bitcoin. Recent data reveals a fascinating trend: a significant surge in Bitcoin accumulation across all investor groups. This isn’t just a minor blip; it’s a rare and powerful alignment between the market’s giants and its everyday participants, hinting at a renewed wave of confidence that could reshape the landscape. What’s Driving This Unprecedented Bitcoin Accumulation ? The numbers don’t lie. According to insights from Glassnode, as cited by CoinDesk, the number of Bitcoin whale wallets—those holding a staggering 1,000 BTC or more—has seen a notable increase. In just one week, these colossal holdings climbed from 1,392 to 1,417. This isn’t just about whales; the data suggests a broader trend where both large-scale institutional players and smaller, individual investors are actively adding to their Bitcoin holdings. So, what’s fueling this widespread Bitcoin accumulation ? Several factors appear to be at play: Renewed Market Confidence: After periods of volatility, investors seem to be regaining faith in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. This confidence is a critical driver, as it encourages holding rather than selling. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In an era of inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed by many as a hedge against traditional financial instability, prompting more individuals and institutions to accumulate. Halving Anticipation: With future Bitcoin halvings on the horizon, which historically reduce the supply of new BTC and often precede price surges, investors may be positioning themselves early to capitalize on potential future gains. Technological Advancements: Continuous development in the Bitcoin ecosystem, including advancements in scalability and usability, makes the asset more attractive for long-term holding. Why Does Whale Bitcoin Accumulation Matter So Much? When Bitcoin whales start accumulating, it sends a powerful signal throughout the market. These are entities with deep pockets and often sophisticated market insights. Their actions can be a strong indicator of perceived future price movements and market health. Here’s why their Bitcoin accumulation is so significant: Aspect Impact of Whale Accumulation Market Confidence Whales’ buying signals belief in long-term value, encouraging smaller investors. Supply Dynamics Large holdings being taken off exchanges reduce circulating supply, potentially creating a supply shock. Price Stability Less selling pressure from large holders can contribute to more stable price floors. Institutional Interest Often, whale accumulation is tied to institutional strategies, indicating growing mainstream adoption. This coordinated buying pressure, especially from whales, suggests that these major players are not just speculating but are actively building long-term positions. This isn’t about short-term trading; it’s about a fundamental belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition. Are There Any Challenges or Risks to This Bitcoin Accumulation Trend? While the surge in Bitcoin accumulation paints a largely positive picture, it’s crucial to approach the market with a balanced perspective. No investment is without its risks, and even strong accumulation trends can have underlying challenges: Market Volatility: While accumulation can lead to stability, large whale movements can also, at times, trigger volatility. A sudden decision by a few whales to sell could create significant price swings. Concentration Risk: A high concentration of Bitcoin in a few large wallets, while signaling confidence, also means a significant portion of the supply is controlled by a limited number of entities. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies could still introduce unforeseen challenges that impact even the most confident accumulators. However, the current trend suggests that the perceived benefits of holding Bitcoin are outweighing these potential risks for a growing number of investors, especially the large ones. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Surging Bitcoin Accumulation So, what does this mean for you, the everyday investor or crypto enthusiast? The increasing Bitcoin accumulation by whales and smaller investors alike offers several key takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain data and market analytics from reputable sources like Glassnode or CoinDesk. Understanding these trends can provide valuable context for your own decisions. Consider Long-Term Strategy: The current accumulation trend reinforces the idea that many sophisticated investors view Bitcoin as a long-term asset. This might encourage a ‘buy and hold’ strategy rather than short-term trading. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin is a powerful asset, a well-diversified portfolio is always a prudent approach. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket is filled with digital gold. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on market trends. Understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, its technology, and its place in the broader financial ecosystem before making any investment decisions. This period of robust Bitcoin accumulation underscores a growing conviction in its future. It’s a testament to the digital asset’s increasing maturity and its perceived role as a valuable store of wealth in a rapidly changing world. The convergence of large and small investors in this accumulation phase is a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its potential to continue its upward trajectory. As more and more BTC is moved off exchanges and into long-term holding wallets, the stage could be set for interesting market dynamics ahead. This isn’t just about price; it’s about the fundamental belief in a decentralized, digital future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is Bitcoin accumulation? A: Bitcoin accumulation refers to the process where individuals or entities steadily increase their holdings of Bitcoin over time, often with the intention of holding for the long term rather than short-term trading. This can involve buying small amounts regularly or making large, infrequent purchases. Q2: Who are Bitcoin “whales” and why are they important? A: Bitcoin “whales” are individuals or entities that hold a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically defined as 1,000 BTC or more. They are important because their significant holdings mean their buying or selling activities can have a substantial impact on market prices and overall sentiment due to the sheer volume of their transactions. Q3: Does increased Bitcoin accumulation guarantee a price increase? A: While increased Bitcoin accumulation , especially by whales, often signals strong market confidence and can reduce the circulating supply, it does not guarantee a price increase. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by numerous factors, including macroeconomic events, regulatory news, technological developments, and overall market sentiment. Accumulation suggests bullish sentiment but is not a sole predictor of price action. Q4: How can I track Bitcoin accumulation trends? A: You can track Bitcoin accumulation trends through various on-chain analytics platforms. Reputable sources like Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and Santiment provide detailed data on wallet movements, exchange balances, and accumulation addresses, offering insights into investor behavior and market sentiment. Q5: What’s the difference between accumulation by whales and retail investors? A: While both contribute to overall Bitcoin accumulation , the difference lies in scale and potential impact. Whales make very large purchases that can significantly affect market supply and demand. Retail investors, or smaller holders, accumulate in smaller amounts. When both groups are accumulating, it suggests a broad-based confidence in Bitcoin, from institutional-level players to everyday enthusiasts. Did you find this article insightful?

49297514,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=776866,1753962032,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49297514.jpeg,UK CMA turns up scrutiny on Microsoft and Amazon over cloud market dominance,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uk-microsoft-amazon-over-cloud-dominance/,"The UK’s top antitrust body just named names, and it is Microsoft and Amazon. On Thursday, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said both companies are abusing their hold on the cloud infrastructure market and called for a deeper investigation under the country’s new digital regulations. The announcement came after the CMA flagged serious concerns about market distortion, unfair contracts, and pricing structures that it says are locking businesses into long-term dependencies. According to the CMA, Microsoft and Amazon currently dominate the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) space, with both controlling somewhere between 30% and 40% of that segment. That market includes essentials like data storage, network access, and raw computing power. Google is the third-largest player, but lags far behind with only 5% to 10% market share. The regulator said the concentration of power between the top two is limiting competition and giving both tech giants excessive control over pricing and contract terms. CMA pushes for full probe using new UK law The regulator said both companies have been earning profits far beyond the cost of their capital expenditures for an extended period, pointing to what it described as “significant unilateral market power.” Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive of the CMA, explained in a public statement that “the current structure of the UK cloud market is causing harm,” adding that “commercial practices used by the largest firms are making it harder for other players to grow and compete.” The CMA pointed directly at egress fees, costs companies pay when trying to move their data out of a provider’s cloud, as one of the main barriers keeping customers tied down. It also criticized contract terms that force users to stay locked into a single platform. The agency said these business models reduce flexibility and trap companies into using the same provider even if they want to switch. Microsoft came under additional fire for how it licenses Windows Server. The CMA said it is cheaper to run Microsoft software on Microsoft’s own cloud, Azure, than it is to run the same product on a rival platform. It said this creates an unfair pricing edge and “further restricts the already limited choice and attractiveness of alternative products and suppliers.” The regulator said these types of behavior are hurting innovation and driving up costs, especially for startups and smaller companies trying to break into the cloud market. The CMA’s report stressed that the current environment is built to favor incumbents and punish newcomers. To address the problem, the CMA is pushing for a formal probe under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers (DMCC) Act, a new law passed in the UK to regulate large digital platforms. The Act gives authorities the power to label companies as having “strategic market status” if they hold entrenched dominance in a particular sector. Once that label is applied, firms can face legally enforced rules that prevent them from engaging in behavior that harms competitors. The watchdog said Microsoft and Amazon both qualify for this classification and that it plans to recommend they be placed under full review. If they’re designated as strategic market players, they could be hit with targeted obligations meant to increase market access for smaller competitors and give customers more flexibility in who they do business with.

New data from Bloomberg indicates China’s four major onshore gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witnessed combined net outflows of about 3.2 billion yuan (worth nearly $450 million) so far this month. Steve Zhou, an analyst at Huaan Fund Management Co., tells Bloomberg that local Chinese retail investors are taking profits in gold and chasing upside in local equities. The CSI 300 Index, which aims to replicate the performance of the top 300 stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, is up nearly 5.5% in the past month. Conversely, however, the Chinese government has reportedly been covertly buying much more gold than what public numbers disclose. Joseph Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold Council, tells MarketWatch that there is debate over whether the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) reported purchases fully capture its activity. Jan Nieuwenhuijs, an analyst at Money Metals, says the Chinese central bank’s gold holdings are likely more than double what is officially reported. Nieuwenhuijs claims the PBOC held 5,065 metric tons of gold in its reserve at the end of 2024, compared to its reported holdings of 2,280 metric tons. The latest data from the World Gold Council indicates the Chinese government holds 2,296 tons of gold.

Employee arrested; unaware of theft; paid for tasks, claimed part-time job income. CoinDCX vows full compensation; stolen funds moved to foreign wallets, hard to trace. Indian police are currently investigating the theft of $44 million in cryptocurrency from the CoinDCX exchange. According to reports, hackers gained access to the company’s wallets by compromising an employee’s work laptop using malware installed without his knowledge. The attackers initially offered Rahul Agarwal, an exchange employee, a part-time online job involving simple tasks such as writing reviews. Agarwal began using his personal computer for these tasks but later switched to his work laptop, where hackers secretly installed malware to access secure wallets. Authorities have arrested Agarwal, but investigators believe he was unaware of the impending theft. Agarwal reportedly received about 1.5 million rupees (around $18,000) as payment for the tasks and explained this income to internal investigators as earnings from a part-time job. The investigation has been complicated by the transfer of stolen funds to six foreign wallets, making it extremely difficult to trace the cryptocurrency without cooperation from overseas exchanges. On July 22, CoinDCX management released an official statement concerning the incident. The company assured users that it is prepared to fully reimburse the losses using its financial reserves. CoinDCX emphasized that its annual revenue exceeds $132 million and that its treasury and corporate reserves are fully supported by investor backing. This incident highlights the ongoing risks of cyberattacks in the crypto industry and underscores the importance of robust employee cybersecurity protocols.

Explains the Source of ETH's Rise!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bloomberg-etf-analyst-compares-ethereum-to-bitcoin-explains-the-source-of-eths-rise/,"Ethereum (ETH) has been in the spotlight recently for its stunning surge. To this point, it's seen its best monthly return in three years, rising 56%. Ethereum's rise has surpassed that of Bitcoin. According to data, Ethereum's return reached 56% in the last month, while its value gained over 113% in the last three months. While Bitcoin reached its $123,000 ATH, the rally remained limited. Data shows that Bitcoin's monthly return is over 10%, with gains over the last three months remaining around 27%. CryptoQuant said that the rise in Etheruem was not due to capital inflow from Bitcoin, but rather an influx of new money altogether. Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called Ethereum a “tech stock of the 90s” following recent strong ETF inflows and strong gains. At this point, Balchunas attributed ETH's recent price performance to net inflows into spot ETH ETFs. Balchunas also likened Ethereum to the new tech stocks of the 90s in terms of accelerating adoption and network growth, unlike Bitcoin's “new gold” narrative. Spot Ether ETFs recorded a 19-day streak of net inflows this month, the longest such streak in history. “Ethereum Looks Like '90s Tech Stocks as ETF inflows Soar. This is a reminder that altcoin ETFs are more like '90s tech stocks than Bitcoin's 'new gold' appeal. Two blockchains, but very different operations.” *This is not investment advice.

The detainment comes after $44 million of funds vanished from the platform, and it may all boil down to a classic case of social engineering. The suspect, Rahul Agarwal, was a full-time employee at CoinDCX with access to internal systems. On July 19, around 2:37 am, someone used his credentials to transfer just one USDT, which was a test run. Meanwhile, by 9:40 am, the hackers had siphoned off a jaw-dropping ₹379 crore ($44 million) across six wallets. Freelance gig or inside job? CoinDCX’s internal probe revealed that Rahul’s company laptop had been compromised. The suspect claimed that he was unaware of the breach and insisted he was a victim himself. However, he admitted to taking freelance gigs from unknown third parties via WhatsApp calls and foreign numbers, which eventually raised serious red flags. Police reportedly found ₹15 lakh ($17,000) deposited into Rahul’s account from unknown sources. One of the files he received from these “clients” may have been a Trojan that gave hackers access to CoinDCX systems. He was detained on July 26, and investigations are in full swing now. The massive hack came to light when the on-chain sleuth ZachXBT flagged a breach at CoinDCX . Later, the platform’s CEO, Sumit Gupta, confirmed the incident. ZachXBT, in a post, highlighted that a CoinDCX team member was telling people to engage with Sumit’s post to appreciate the platform’s transparency. Meanwhile, the CoinDCX team waited for 17 hours to disclose the breach, and that came after the sleuth alerted the public about the incident. Source: ZachXBT’s X Reacting to the arrest, ZachXBT stated “why are people so negligent?” He also wrote, “is a software engineer, yet opens random files sent to him on a company laptop.” CoinDCX blames sophisticated attackers CoinDCX CEO, in a fresh post, mentioned that some media reports have surfaced referencing the FIR the platform filed with the Karnataka Police regarding the security incident that impacted the platform. However, as the investigation is ongoing, they cannot engage with the media or public on the issue. He added that the breach appears to be the result of a “sophisticated social engineering attack”, with the attackers targeting employees to compromise internal systems. They claim that the company is fully cooperating with law enforcement.

Some analysts believe the price could continue pumping in the short term, but the upcoming token unlocks suggest a bearish scenario may also be in play. ENA Takes Center Stage There are numerous cryptocurrencies well in the green on a monthly scale, but very few can match the price rally of Ethena (ENA) during that period. The token has exploded by almost 160% and is currently worth approximately $0.67 (per CoinGecko’s data). ENA Price, Source: CoinGecko One possible factor contributing to the bull run is the support from Upbit. Earlier this month, the leading South Korean crypto exchange introduced the ENA/KRW, ENA/BTC, and ENA/USDT trading pairs. Thus, it increased the asset’s liquidity, improved its accessibility, and provided it with a reputational boost. It followed the example of Binance, Kraken, KuCoin, and Bybit, which previously embraced ENA. For its part, Coinbase added the token to its roadmap and might officially list it once it meets certain criteria. Another element could be the rapid growth of USDe – the synthetic stablecoin of the Ethena protocol. The product is pegged to the American dollar, but differs from USDT, USDC, and other market leaders because it is not backed by fiat or other assets. Instead, it relies on a strategy called delta-neutral hedging to maintain its peg. Over the past month, the market capitalization of USDe has increased substantially, from $5.3 billion at the start of July to its current value of $8.4 billion. Last but not least, ENA’s price rally could be linked to the recent activity of whales. On July 30, the popular X user Ali Martinez revealed that large investors purchased almost 80 million tokens in just a week. The USD equivalent of the stash is around $53 million (at ongoing rates). The development reflects strong confidence in the asset and may incentivize smaller players to join the ecosystem as well. Moreover, such accumulation leaves fewer tokens available on the open market, which, combined with non-declining demand, should result in a price pump. What’s Next? Multiple analysts believe ENA may continue to rise in the following months. X user McKenna argued the asset has “the best looking chart in DeFi,” suggesting it may soon climb to the early-2025 levels. Recall that at the start of the year, the price traded well above $1. For their part, Reetika assumed that ENA’s further rally will “fully depend” on what happens with Ethereum (ETH) once it potentially reaches $4,000. The analyst said this is not the right time to invest in the token, but cautioned traders to stay ready for possible buy-the-dip opportunities. Meanwhile, over 140 million ENA tokens are scheduled for release in the next seven days. The increased circulating supply may lead to a price pullback if demand doesn’t react accordingly.

The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has launched a transparency initiative using the Polygon blockchain to validate documents such as Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) and Notices of Cash Allocation (NCAs). The rollout, however, coincided with a temporary outage on Polygon’s Heimdall v2 mainnet, raising early questions about reliability even as the platform’s decentralised infrastructure continued producing blocks uninterrupted. Blockchain to support document validation in public finance Launched this week, the Philippine government’s blockchain validation system uses Polygon to inscribe hashes — alphanumeric strings generated from public budget documents — onto the blockchain. These hashes serve as immutable representations of the original documents, offering proof that they have not been tampered with or altered in any way. Users can verify SAROs or NCAs through a search interface or by scanning QR codes to check against blockchain-stored data in real time. According to a Thursday report by local crypto news outlet BitPinas, the system is built on the idea of transparency through immutability. The documents are generated by the DBM, while their representations are logged on-chain. Though the implementation details have not been fully disclosed, BitPinas reported that the system likely uses a hash-based model. By matching a document’s hash to the version stored on-chain, users can confirm its authenticity and origin. The system is intended to safeguard against fraud and promote accountability in public fund management. Partnership with Bayanichain powers budget transparency tool The initiative is being powered by Bayanichain, a local blockchain firm that specialises in Web3 applications. The platform enables public access to the blockchain ledger containing budget document hashes, effectively creating a tamper-proof validation service. According to BitPinas, the collaboration between DBM and Bayanichain aims to improve transparency and accountability in budget allocations using decentralised technology and automation. Undersecretary Maria Francesca Montes Del Rosario of the DBM announced the system’s launch in a Facebook post on Wednesday. At the official launch event, she said blockchain would help prevent document forgery and enhance the integrity of official records in the age of deepfakes and AI manipulation. The programme forms part of a broader initiative to modernise governance using satellite imaging, AI, and data-driven tools. Polygon suffered technical failure during launch While the government’s blockchain service went live on Wednesday, the Polygon network simultaneously suffered a temporary outage. The Heimdall v2 mainnet, which handles consensus for the Polygon proof-of-stake chain, experienced a bug that disrupted the network’s operation. Polygon’s team later described it as a “consensus bug” that affected front-end infrastructure and data reflection. Although the Bor layer continued producing blocks independently, several services were disrupted, including blockchain explorers, which failed to reflect ongoing network activity. The issue was resolved within three and a half hours, limiting broader impact. However, the timing cast a spotlight on the risks associated with relying on decentralised networks for government-grade infrastructure, even as the initiative proceeded uninterrupted with backend stability intact.

The filings also came just after the SEC approved in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms for crypto ETFs.Meanwhile, the White House backed comprehensive reforms through a 168-page policy report from Trump’s Working Group on Digital Assets, which are specifically aimed at reducing bureaucratic delays, clarifying SEC-CFTC oversight, and encouraging innovation. CBOE Files for ETF Rule Change The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) filed a request with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to modify existing rules to allow crypto fund issuers to list exchange-traded products under a unified framework. This move could eliminate the need for separate approvals for each new crypto ETF, and streamline what has traditionally been a very time-consuming regulatory process. ETF analyst Nate Geraci talked about the importance of the filing, and pointed out that under the proposed changes, any crypto ETF meeting predefined criteria would no longer require individual SEC review. A similar proposal was also submitted by NYSE Arca, which means that there is a broader industry push for regulatory modernization. Currently, each new crypto ETF has to be approved through a 19b-4 filing with the SEC, which is a procedure that slowed innovation in the space. The new filings were made just one day after the SEC approved in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms for crypto ETFs, bringing them closer in line with traditional investment funds in terms of operational structure. SEC press release On the same day as the CBOE and NYSE Arca filings, the White House advanced a comprehensive push to integrate crypto into traditional finance by supporting updated regulatory proposals. A 168-page policy document was released by President Donald Trump’s Working Group on Digital Assets, and it outlines key initiatives to modernize crypto regulation. It recommends removing bureaucratic delays, clarifying oversight responsibilities between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and updating rules around crypto custody and trading to make the regulatory landscape more accommodating for innovation. These developments also closely follow Trump’s recent signing of the GENIUS Act, which establishes the foundation for a stablecoin regulatory framework. Additionally, the House of Representatives passed two critical bills—the CLARITY Act and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act—focusing on the structural regulation of crypto markets and placing limitations on the development and deployment of central bank digital currencies. Both pieces of legislation are expected to be reviewed by the Senate once lawmakers return from their August recess.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SPONSORED|EXCHANGE|TRADING|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-31 12:00:00

With Trump-aligned supporters backing the idea of digital freedom combined with U.S.-friendly policy, Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) has emerged as a natural choice. It is not just another decentralized network. It is an infrastructure designed from the ground up to support privacy, regulation, and real-world financial applications under one unified system. Regulation-Ready by Design Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) offers what many in the market have been waiting for. A fully programmable financial ecosystem that does not sacrifice decentralization for compliance. Its architecture merges Proof-of-Yield with Proof-of-Stake validation to deliver a hybrid consensus model. SHA-256 secures the network while validator checkpoints confirm block finality every 100 blocks. This design ensures that transactions are tamper-resistant while still being upgradable through decentralized control. One of BTC3’s biggest strengths is its focus on rewarding real contribution, not just raw power. Its Proof-of-Yield model adapts rewards in real time based on participation, energy efficiency, and governance input. This is a programmable reward designed for sustainability. Key features of BTC3’s rewards: Dynamic rewards tied to user activity and clean energy use AI oracles monitor users performance and carbon impact Efficient, renewable energy users receive higher multipliers Governance votes influence reward adjustments in real time A system built to prioritize long-term health and sustainability Bitcoin Swift’s detailed roadmap and technical achievements have drawn attention from influencers like Token Empire , who breaks down the project’s long-term vision. AI Smart Contracts That Power Decentralized Finance In Bitcoin Swift, smart contracts aren’t static. They’re WASM-compatible and powered by AI agents that evolve based on network activity. These adaptive contracts optimize performance and enhance security as the system grows. Decisions are supported by federated AI oracles that deliver real-time data like prices, energy use, and network stats. Proposals are automatically risk-scored by AI before voting, filtering out spam and strengthening governance. Bitcoin Swift Is Live, Get In Now! Shortest Presale Timeline With Real Yield on Day One Unlike many overhyped token launches that drag on for months, Bitcoin Swift has already kicked off its presale. There are a few days left, making it one of the shortest in crypto. Stage 2 is live with BTC3 priced at $2. Once this stage ends, the price rises to $3, with a confirmed launch price of $15. Stage 2 current APY is 133%. This presale is gaining momentum fast because it isn’t just about buying tokens. What sets BTC3 apart is that rewards begin immediately. Each presale stage ends with programmable rewards distributed through the PoY model. Participants aren’t just holding tokens. They are actively earning and helping to strengthen the network from day one. This structure gives Bitcoin Swift a clear advantage. You can explore more through Bitcoin Swift while Stage 1 is still active. Verified and Audited Infrastructure Security is critical for any decentralized protocol, especially one built for compliance and mainstream adoption. Bitcoin Swift has already passed multiple audits, including reviews from Spywolf and Solidproof . These third-party verifications confirm that BTC3’s smart contract system is functioning as intended and is ready for mass participation. These audits give confidence not just to early buyers but also to institutions and platforms seeking long-term integration. The Bitcoin Swift team demonstrated accountability by finalizing Know Your Customer verification through this audit , providing additional protection and assurance to the community. Roadmap Built on Delivery and Execution Bitcoin Swift’s roadmap is focused, aggressive, and already in progress. Each phase delivers tangible advancements aimed at both users and institutions, with no reliance on future trends or hype. Key milestones for BTC3’s rollout: Q3–Q4 2025: Presale completion, PoY rewards, Solana deployment Q1 2026: AI smart contract engine and reinforcement learning agents Q2 2026: Privacy infrastructure with zk-ledger, private DeFi, and zkLogin Q3 2026: Full governance rollout with AI voting simulators Q4 2026: BTC3 mainnet launch and institutional onboarding The Shift Toward Regulated DeFi Has a Clear Leader As political discourse around crypto intensifies, Bitcoin Swift stands as a rare project that welcomes regulation without compromising decentralization. From AI smart contracts to energy-efficient incentives and a roadmap that is already in motion, BTC3 is built for what comes next. It is no surprise that Trump-aligned crypto investors and institutional watchers are looking to Bitcoin Swift as the foundation of the next wave of regulated DeFi.

Why Altcoins Are Still In The Danger Zone Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) framed the current setup bluntly: “This weekly BTC chart remains the most important chart out there for us to examine. While below the 120–123K zone and the weekly downtrending resistance on the weekly RSI I have to remain cautious.” He added that he would be “the most bullish person on the timeline” once those levels are cleared, but “until then we treat it for what it is and that is major resistance.” Kevin’s read ties the altcoin path directly to Bitcoin’s ability to punch higher. In a follow-up post, he warned that sentiment had flipped at precisely the wrong places: “Most of the #Crypto timeline got max bullish at 4 year historical resistance and was max bearish at major support back in April and even June.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Altcoins Is Collapsing: A Warning Sign? The implication, he suggested, is to avoid chasing optimism under resistance and to “air on the side of caution while #BTC and Total 2/#ETH remain under these major levels.” By referencing Total2—the market capitalization of crypto excluding Bitcoin—and Ethereum, Kevin effectively argued that the broader risk-on impulse for altcoins is unlikely to sustain without a decisive Bitcoin breakout. Macro conditions are a swing factor in his framework, but not yet a catalyst. “The July FOMC was always going to be lack luster with not much stake,” he wrote, noting that two more rounds of data arrive before the September meeting and that “projections are roughly 50/50.” He pointed traders to Core PCE as the next waypoint, while reiterating that he’ll “be the most bullish” only if price and momentum confirm above the highlighted band. Until then, he plans to “manage risk properly and sit back and watch the show unfold.” Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Explodes To $28 Billion—Altcoin Rotation Begins: QCP Market structure and volatility may force the timeline. “#BTC getting ready to make a move soon after volatility has dropped off a cliff over the last week,” Kevin observed, underscoring that compressed ranges typically precede directional expansion. In his view, that expansion must come with a break of both price resistance and the “downtrending resistance on the weekly RSI” to unlock the stronger bullish case. Without that confluence, he sees the set-up as a classic trap for altcoins, which historically underperform when Bitcoin is capped and dominance grinds higher within ranges. Kevin’s stance, delivered across posts on July 30–31, amounts to conditional optimism: the structural bull case for the asset class remains intact only if Bitcoin proves it by clearing the $120,000–$123,000 zone and reversing its weekly momentum profile. “Just be careful who you follow folks,” he cautioned. “There is some good ones but a lot of bad ones.” For now, he remains explicitly cautious on altcoins while Bitcoin and the major breadth gauges sit beneath those levels, with the next decisive tests likely to be driven by the data cadence into September and a volatility breakout that finally chooses a side. At press time, the total altcoin market cap (TOTAL2) stood at $1.48 trillion.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-the-end-is-near-heres-why/,"In a recent video clip shared on his X account, popular crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO made a bold proclamation: “The end is near, and it could make you very rich.” His claim centers on XRP’s current price action, which he believes is entering the final and most explosive phase of a classic Elliott Wave pattern. According to STEPH, XRP is now in the fifth and final wave of a five-wave bullish cycle, similar to the one seen during the 2017 bull run. If history repeats itself, he argues, this last wave could push XRP into new price territory over the next one to two months. Elliott Wave Structure: Why the Fifth Wave Matters Elliott Wave Theory is a technical analysis framework that suggests markets move in a predictable five-wave pattern . The fifth wave typically marks the final upward surge before a significant correction begins. #XRP The End is Near! pic.twitter.com/td7xuo1Q1x — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 30, 2025 STEPH IS CRYPTO believes XRP has already completed waves one through four, and that wave five, historically the strongest move, is underway. This theory is echoed by other analysts, including those at Elliott Wave-Forecast, who project an upside target between $3.80 and $4.50 if the wave structure plays out. XRP Price Action: Bullish Momentum Builds As of report time, XRP is trading at approximately $3.17, recovering from a recent dip to around $3.05. This bounce follows a strong rally earlier in the month when XRP hit a multi-year high of $3.66 on July 18. Market volume has surged to over $7 billion, indicating renewed interest and momentum behind the token. The $3.00 level is acting as a critical support zone. Analysts note that as long as XRP stays above this threshold, the fifth wave scenario remains valid. A break above $3.30 could serve as confirmation of a continued push toward the upper resistance levels projected. Institutional Catalysts and Market Sentiment Beyond technicals, XRP’s bullish setup is being supported by strong fundamentals. Ripple is about to settle its legal case with the U.S. SEC, removing a major cloud over the project. Additionally, Ripple’s growing stablecoin ecosystem and cross-border payments infrastructure are contributing to increased demand. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional analysts have taken note. Standard Chartered projects XRP to reach $5.50 in this cycle. Meanwhile, prominent traders like Peter Brandt foresee a rise to around $4.47, while others suggest a potential climb as high as $6 or more, depending on broader market conditions. The Clock Is Ticking STEPH IS CRYPTO emphasizes that time is of the essence. With the fifth wave unfolding, the next one to two months could mark the final leg of XRP’s parabolic rise in this cycle. Supporting this view, analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino has predicted a 333% rally for XRP within the next 40 days, potentially pushing prices toward $13 under ideal conditions. While forecasts vary, the consensus is that XRP is poised for a significant move. If wave five delivers as expected , current holders could see major returns, but those sitting on the sidelines may miss out entirely. Still, as with all markets, caution is warranted. Price targets are projections, not guarantees, and traders should watch for invalidation signals, especially if XRP dips below key support. For now, the message is clear: the end may be near, but for XRP holders, it could be a spectacular one. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The token is currently trading at $3.17, with a market capitalization of $187.72 billion, and approximately 59.23 billion XRP in circulation (out of a 100 billion max supply). XRP price and volume movements XRP’s price has retracted from a monthly high of around $3.66 in late July, moving back to its present level of $3.17. The drop appears to reflect profit-taking and short-term speculator exits, rather than fundamental weakness; other major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum declined by only 2–3% over the same timeframe, making XRP’s retracement more pronounced in relative terms. On July 30, XRP trading volume slipped modestly compared to earlier peaks, while analysts noted heightened whale activity, with more than 70 million XRP moving from dormant wallets, signaling accumulation from large holders. Ripple unlock mechanics The forthcoming August 1 release is part of Ripple’s monthly escrow program, under which up to 1 billion XRP is unlocked each month. Historically, Ripple re-locks 60–70% shortly after release, leaving only a small portion to support operations or liquidity, including tokenization programs and exchange infrastructure. That means the actual influx into circulating supply typically ranges around 300–400 million XRP, not 1 billion full tokens. Market sentiment suggests that recent unlocks have not historically triggered lasting price pressure when handled transparently and predictably. Selling behavior, not token unlock events is the real driver of volatility.

The token traded within a $0.36 bandwidth and found aggressive support near $5.21 during the 19:00 hour UTC on July 30, where volume spiked to 1.43 million tokens, more than three times the 24-hour average of 476,829 units, according to CoinDesk's technical analysis data model. Upward momentum persisted as the price steadily climbed through successive higher lows to form a solid bullish channel, before resistance began to cap gains around $5.58. DFINITY’s recent launch of Internet Computer 2.0 , which includes tools allowing anyone to build applications using natural language prompts, could open Web3 development to non-technical users and help to further differentiate ICP in a crowded layer-1 ecosystem. DFINITY has burned over 1 million ICP tokens in just five months, reducing overall supply and signaling long-term commitment to value optimization. The twin narratives of AI-enhanced utility and token deflation appear to be gaining traction among institutions seeking exposure to infrastructure-oriented crypto assets.

Buyers are now aiming for a push above immediate Fib levels; however, sellers are strongly defending further surges. The 24-hour volume surged to $2.38 million, showing a surge in interest in trading activity today. Manta is trading at $0.225, surging by over 4% in the last 24 hours. MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and hovers around 48.97, showing that bulls are controlling the momentum of the price. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. Manta/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA lines The 4-hour Manta price chart suggests MANTA continues to face bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. Currently, buyers aim for a surge by sending the price above the EMA20 trend line. MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.25, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost a downward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for positive momentum, strengthening bullish positions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.248, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.272. MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.206, resulting in a correction to $0.173. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.225. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.21. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.25, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus. He talked about the incident in a post on X (formerly Twitter), describing how he came very close to being caught but managed to avoid it just in time.

Taking to his Truth Social platform, Trump didn’t mince words, labeling Powell as “too late, too angry, too stupid & too political” and asserting that his leadership is directly costing the United States “trillions of dollars.” This scathing critique, coupled with an unusual jab at a “corrupt renovation” project, underscores the intense scrutiny faced by the Federal Reserve and its pivotal role in the nation’s economic stability. What’s Behind Trump’s Fiery Federal Reserve Critique? Donald Trump’s recent comments are not just casual remarks; they represent a significant escalation in his long-standing tension with Jerome Powell and the institution he leads. During his presidency, Trump frequently criticized Powell, particularly over interest rate decisions, advocating for lower rates to stimulate economic growth. This latest outburst, however, goes beyond policy disagreements, delving into personal attacks and accusations of incompetence and even corruption. Accusations of Incompetence: Trump’s primary claim is that Powell is “too late” in his actions, implying a failure to address economic challenges effectively or promptly. This often refers to the Fed’s response to inflation, which surged dramatically post-pandemic. Economic Costs: The assertion that Powell is costing the country “trillions of dollars” is a bold claim. While difficult to quantify precisely, this likely refers to the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation, the increased cost of borrowing for the government and private sector, and potential misallocation of capital under current economic conditions. Political Bias: Labeling Powell as “too political” suggests a belief that the Fed’s decisions are influenced by political agendas rather than purely economic data, a charge that central banks globally strive to avoid. Unusual Allegations: The reference to “one of the most incompetent, or corrupt, renovations of a building” adds a peculiar, yet characteristic, dimension to Trump’s critique, hinting at broader dissatisfaction beyond monetary policy. The Federal Reserve’s Mandate: A Balancing Act in Turbulent Times To understand the weight of Trump’s criticism, it’s essential to grasp the fundamental role of the Federal Reserve . As the central bank of the United States, its primary mandate is to foster maximum employment and price stability. This dual objective often requires delicate balancing acts, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. The Fed utilizes various tools, primarily setting the federal funds rate, to influence economic activity, manage inflation, and stabilize financial markets. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve has faced unprecedented challenges: Challenge Fed’s Response Criticism Context Surging Inflation Aggressive interest rate hikes (2022-2023) Trump’s “too late” argument suggests earlier, more decisive action was needed. Economic Downturn (2020) Rapid rate cuts, quantitative easing Accused of overstimulating, leading to later inflation. Global Supply Chain Disruptions Monetary policy cannot directly fix supply issues. External factors complicate the Fed’s ability to control prices solely through demand-side measures. The ‘Too Late’ Argument: Analyzing Monetary Policy Timing The accusation that the Federal Reserve was “too late” in addressing inflation is a common one among critics. For much of 2021, the Fed maintained that rising inflation was “transitory,” a byproduct of supply chain disruptions and pent-up demand following pandemic lockdowns. However, as inflation proved more persistent, the Fed began its aggressive rate-hiking cycle in early 2022. Monetary policy operates with significant lags, meaning the full effect of interest rate changes might not be felt for 12 to 18 months. This inherent delay makes it incredibly challenging for central bankers to perfectly time their interventions. Critics argue that the Fed waited too long to acknowledge the permanence of inflation, allowing it to become entrenched. Supporters, however, contend that an earlier, more aggressive tightening could have stifled a fragile economic recovery and potentially pushed the U.S. into a deeper recession. Economic Fallout: Are Trillions Really at Stake for the U.S. Economy? The claim of “trillions of dollars” in losses is staggering and warrants closer examination. While a precise figure is speculative, the economic costs associated with high inflation and subsequent aggressive monetary tightening are substantial. Here’s how such a figure might be conceptualized: Erosion of Purchasing Power: Inflation directly reduces the value of money. Over time, high inflation can significantly diminish the purchasing power of savings and incomes, effectively costing households and businesses trillions collectively. Increased Borrowing Costs: As the Fed raises interest rates to combat inflation, the cost of borrowing for everything from mortgages and car loans to government debt skyrockets. This can add hundreds of billions, if not trillions, to the national debt servicing costs and household expenses over several years. Misallocation of Capital: Periods of high inflation and uncertain interest rates can lead to inefficient allocation of capital, as businesses and investors struggle to make long-term decisions, potentially hindering productivity and growth. Impact on Asset Values: Higher interest rates can depress asset valuations, including stocks, bonds, and real estate, leading to significant paper losses for investors. While the “trillions” figure is an estimate, it reflects a genuine concern about the economic burden placed on the American populace and the national balance sheet by inflationary pressures and the subsequent policy responses from the Federal Reserve . Political Rhetoric vs. Economic Reality: A Delicate Dance for the Federal Reserve The relationship between political figures and central banks is always a delicate one. Central bank independence is widely considered crucial for effective monetary policy, shielding decisions from short-term political pressures. However, public commentary from influential figures like Donald Trump can undoubtedly impact public perception and market sentiment. When a former president with a significant following levels such strong accusations against the Federal Reserve Chair, it can: Undermine Confidence: erode public trust in the institution’s ability to manage the economy impartially and competently. Increase Volatility: introduce uncertainty into financial markets, as investors react to the potential for future political interference or changes in economic leadership. Shift Policy Debates: push economic discussions into the political arena, potentially complicating the Fed’s efforts to communicate its policy rationale clearly. Maintaining a clear distinction between political discourse and sound economic policymaking is vital for the stability of the U.S. economy and the global financial system. Navigating Economic Headwinds: What Does This Mean for You? For everyday Americans and participants in financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space, understanding these macro-economic dynamics is crucial. While Trump’s comments are specific to the Federal Reserve and its leadership, they highlight broader concerns about inflation, interest rates, and the overall health of the U.S. economy. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic indicators (inflation rates, employment data, GDP growth) and Federal Reserve announcements. Diversify Investments: In times of economic uncertainty and political rhetoric, a diversified investment portfolio can help mitigate risks. Understand the Fed’s Role: Recognize that the Fed operates under a dual mandate, and its decisions are complex, aimed at long-term stability rather than short-term political gains. Assess Your Personal Finances: High interest rates impact mortgages, loans, and savings. Review your financial strategy to adapt to changing economic conditions. Conclusion: The Enduring Debate Over the Federal Reserve’s Role Donald Trump’s blistering critique of Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve serves as a potent reminder of the intense scrutiny faced by central bankers in a politically charged environment. While the former president’s language was undeniably harsh, his comments tap into broader public anxieties about inflation, economic stability, and the effectiveness of monetary policy. The debate over whether the Fed was “too late” or acted appropriately is ongoing, reflecting the inherent complexities of steering a massive economy through unprecedented challenges. Ultimately, the health of the U.S. economy hinges on sound policy, clear communication, and public confidence. The dialogue initiated by Trump’s remarks, while controversial, highlights the critical importance of the Federal Reserve’s independence and its unwavering commitment to its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. As the nation continues to navigate economic headwinds, the performance and perception of the Federal Reserve will remain a central point of discussion and concern for all Americans. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is Jerome Powell? Jerome Powell is the current Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. He was first nominated to the position by President Donald Trump in 2017 and later re-nominated by President Joe Biden in 2021. 2. What is the Federal Reserve’s primary role? The Federal Reserve, often called the Fed, is the central bank of the United States. Its primary roles are to conduct the nation’s monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the U.S. economy, and to ensure the stability of the financial system. 3. Why is Donald Trump criticizing the Federal Reserve? Donald Trump has historically criticized the Federal Reserve, particularly Jerome Powell, over interest rate policies and their perceived impact on the U.S. economy. His recent criticisms stem from a belief that the Fed was too slow in addressing inflation and that its policies have cost the country trillions of dollars. 4. How do Federal Reserve policies impact the U.S. economy? Federal Reserve policies, primarily through adjusting interest rates, directly impact borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, inflation rates, and the overall pace of economic growth. Higher rates can slow inflation but may also curb economic activity, while lower rates can stimulate growth but risk higher inflation. 5. Could political rhetoric affect financial markets? Yes, political rhetoric, especially from influential figures, can significantly affect financial markets. Such comments can create uncertainty, influence investor sentiment, and potentially lead to market volatility, as investors react to perceived risks or opportunities.

Analysts are now eyeing $150,000 as the next major milestone, and if history is any indication, Ethereum and XRP could follow with electrifying gains. Yet amid this potential rally, one lesser‑known crypto is generating buzz that it could soar a staggering 4,000%—and that project is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Bitcoin at $150,000: The Catalyst for Alts The idea of Bitcoin touching $150k by late 2025 isn’t hype—it’s tied to strong signals. Several institutions and hedge funds suggest that favorable macro conditions, combined with easing Fed policy, could propel BTC well beyond its current range. When BTC moves decisively, capital flows into select altcoins where perceived value and momentum align. Extended rallies in Ethereum and XRP have generated 2- to 3-fold gains in past alt-season conditions. Ethereum’s Opportunity in a $150k Bitcoin World Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized applications. If Bitcoin reaches $150,000, ETH typically enjoys at least a 2x surge—or even 3x in strong cycles. That’s because network growth and institutional appetite tend to focus on the smart contract king, especially with Layer 2 and staking adoption building steadily. Analysts suggest ETH could rally toward the $5,000–$6,000 range during a mature bull run. Compared to its current price near $2,700, this aligns with the historical 200–300% return estimates analysts associate with a major Bitcoin-led rally. Simply put, Ethereum’s ecosystem is large enough to absorb and reflect that bullish energy. XRP’s Asymmetric Gains in BTC-Driven Rallies Ripple’s XRP remains a go-to playground for cross-border payment technology and enterprise clients. Positive sentiment around legal settlements and expanding payments integrations has triggered a price rally. If Bitcoin nears $150,000, some chart analysts project XRP breaking past $5 and even surging toward $10–$20 under the right conditions. One popular chart-based analysis predicts XRP may hit $20 if it breaks out of a falling wedge pattern—an outcome made more likely by BTC’s upward push to $150,000. These moves are far from fantasy—they align perfectly with XRP’s bullish momentum in recent months. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Ambitious Meme Coin Now, let’s shift gears to a token that’s miles behind ETH and XRP in notoriety—but potentially miles ahead in upside. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out not because it’s a meme, but because it’s building an Ethereum-compatible Layer‑2 blockchain designed specifically for meme tokens. Unlike typical memecoins, LILPEPE is structured with a purpose: ultra-fast transactions, near-zero fees, anti-sniper-bot protections, and even a Meme Launchpad. The presale is in its early stages, with Stage 8 live at $0.0017, up from $0.0010 in Stage 1. To date, the presale has raised over $12 million in under two months. The Growth MVP: Why LILPEPE Could Be 4,000% Up If Ethereum is primed for a 200% move, and XRP is eyeing 300% gains, Little Pepe aims for an entirely different ballgame—4,000%. At its Stage 8 price of $0.0017, LILPEPE is still priced at a fraction of a cent. Suppose LILPEPE achieves even a modest mainstream listing price of $0.04 to $0.07 post-launch, which represents a 2,200% to 4,000% gain—well within the range of what past micro-cap tokens have delivered after hitting exchanges amidst strong hype and utility. Beyond a simple pump, the project’s Layer‑2 vision gives it a backstory other memecoins lack. With function—memecoin incubation, NFT drop capabilities, and infrastructure, it bridges entertainment and DeFi utility. As on-chain and off-chain interest grow, LILPEPE could very well redefine what a next-gen meme token means. Conclusion As crypto gears up for its next major move, allocating across different assets becomes a smart portfolio construction. Ethereum and XRP are the essence of stability in an inherently volatile space—responsive to macroeconomic cycles but grounded in use-case veracity. Little Pepe , by contrast, embodies the spirit of at-scale innovation from Day One, with meme culture serving as a launchpad rather than a standalone gimmick. If Bitcoin’s rise to $150,000 drives Ethereum to $6,000 and XRP to $20, your base allocation gains become undeniable.

The regulator has proposed listing standards that focus on derivatives markets. The SEC will allow cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds whose futures have been trading for at least six months on Coinbase Derivatives or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Balchunas called the rule a pretty big deal, paving the way for ETFs for about a dozen altcoins. He added that futures on the asset must have been trading for more than six months on the derivatives exchange Coinbase for approval. Bloomberg stock analyst James Seyffart believes that the SEC is effectively handing over decision-making to another agency.“The CFTC is the primary decider of what asset can have futures contracts & having futures is the primary requirement of this rule proposal,” he wrote Seyffart stressed that the proposed standards do not mention market capitalization, liquidity, or the number of tokens in circulation. Balchunas noted that this path is not suitable for meme coins or assets with less developed markets. They will require a more complex one, the Investment Company Act of 1940. Most spot crypto ETFs are governed by the Securities Act of 1933, which issuers choose because of its simpler requirements. Balchunas estimates that the first approvals could come as early as September or October. The rule change is a major milestone in the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial markets. It offers a clearer path for ETFs on digital assets other than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Recall that in June, Balchunas predicted the ”summer of altcoin ETFs.” According to him, the US Securities and Exchange Commission may approve instruments based on a basket of cryptocurrencies as early as July.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-31 12:18:57

According to the document, XRP remains a dominant player in the cryptocurrency space and was worth $2.76 as of February 15, 2025. At the time, its total value ranged between $142 billion and $159.7 billion. The excerpt confirms XRP’s place among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and reinforces that XRP is the native crypto token of the Ripple network. The source text explains that Ripple and XRP aim to streamline cross-border payments and currency exchanges. A small amount of XRP is charged for using the network, which is independent of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Instead, XRP transactions are often highlighted for being low-cost and having a high speed , with confirmations occurring in as little as four to five seconds and with significantly lower energy consumption. Yes, the Trump administration has “paved the way for XRP to CONTINUE to increase in value.” This is documented. https://t.co/T5LJpHUP4Z pic.twitter.com/QZMnjuWTg3 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 30, 2025 The Role of Pre-Mining in XRP’s Performance The document also comments on XRP’s speed, suggesting that one reason it’s fast is that it was mined before launch. Unlike proof-of-work systems such as Bitcoin, XRP was issued all at once and is gradually released by Ripple, allowing for higher scalability and efficiency. This pre-mining structure and limited blockchain dependencies enable XRP to fulfill its use case efficiently within Ripple’s payment infrastructure. Furthermore, XRP has maintained operational independence while offering fast settlement times and low transaction costs. Legal Obstacles and Market Implications SMQKE’s tweet emphasizes a key segment in the legal academic article, stating: “Yes, the Trump administration has ‘paved the way for XRP to CONTINUE to increase in value.’” The tweet references a line from the article that reads: “Only six months ago, XRP was seventh on the top ten list; however, the change in the U.S. administration has paved the way for XRP to continue to increase in value.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The academic commentary also mentions the ongoing legal struggle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , which began over four years ago. It highlights that replacing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler is considered “a big deal” due to the continued delay in resolving the lawsuit. The implication is that changes in leadership at the SEC, combined with a friendlier posture from the Trump administration, could remove major regulatory uncertainties that have historically hindered XRP’s full market potential. Regulatory Framework and Government Stance The position stated in the excerpt is further reinforced by a digital asset report released by the White House on June 30, 2025. The document reportedly outlined recommendations for a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. The report’s timing, just months after the referenced academic commentary, further supports the claim that the administration is aligning with a regulatory environment for XRP’s growth. The academic article and the federal government’s digital asset strategy appear to agree on the outlook for XRP under the current administration.

The operation uses malicious advertisements to distribute fake applications targeting users. An estimated 10 million people globally have been exposed to attacks. The campaign leverages compiled JavaScript files to steal cryptocurrency wallets and credentials effectively. Malicious advertisement campaign reaches 10 million users The JSCEAL campaign exposed around 35,000 malicious ads in the first half of 2025. They themselves garnered millions of views in the European Union. Check Point Research is of the view that around 10 million people viewed these ads worldwide. Malicious material was shared by ill-intentioned actors on hijacked accounts or fresh profiles. Promoted posts assisted in the distribution of fake advertisements on social media. The advertisements mostly discussed cryptocurrencies, tokens, and banks. The campaign run using almost 50 various financial institutions with spoofed applications. The bad actors registered domain names under some naming conventions for redirection. The top-level domains contained a .com extension in accordance with corresponding terminology. Patterns in the domain included app, download, desktop, PC, and window versions. Each word was used singly or in a plural sense in the domains. Combinatorics show that there are 560 unique domain names that are in compliance with the rules. Malicious ads on Facebook, Source: Check Point Only 15% of potential domains appeared registered at publication time. Redirection chains filtered targets based on IP address and referrer sources. Victims outside the desired ranges received decoy websites instead of malicious content. Facebook referrers were required for successful redirection to fake pages. The filtering system helped attackers avoid detection while they reached their target victims. Meta’s Ad Library provided estimates for advertisement reach within the EU. Conservative calculations assume each advertisement reached 100 users minimum. The campaign’s total reach exceeded 3.5 million within the European Union boundaries. Global reach could easily exceed 10 million, considering non-EU countries. Asian crypto and financial institutions were also impersonated in the campaigns. Campaign uses sophisticated deception tactics to avoid detection JSCEAL campaign uses certain anti-evasion methods, resulting in extremely low detection rates. The malware remained undetected for extended periods, according to Check Point analysis. These sophisticated techniques help attackers bypass traditional security measures across multiple platforms. Victims clicking on malicious advertisements get directed to legitimate-looking fake websites. The fake sites encourage downloading malicious applications that appear authentic. Attackers design websites to closely mimic real cryptocurrency platform interfaces. The malware uses the simultaneous operation of the website and installation software. This dual approach complicates analysis and detection efforts for security researchers. Individual components appear harmless when examined separately, making detection challenging. This deception tactic convinces victims that they installed authentic software. Meanwhile, the malware operates in the background, collecting sensitive information without users’ knowledge. The campaign targets cryptocurrency users specifically through platform impersonation tactics. Attackers focus on popular trading applications and wallet software. Users seeking legitimate crypto tools were the most susceptible to the campaign. Check Point researchers describe the detection evasion as highly effective. Traditional security software struggles to identify threats using these methods. The combination of legitimate-looking interfaces and hidden malware creates dangerous scenarios. Malware harvests crypto-related data and user credentials systematically The malware’s primary purpose involves gathering sensitive information from infected devices. Attackers collect data to access cryptocurrency accounts and steal digital assets. Information harvesting occurs automatically without requiring user interaction or awareness. JSCEAL captures keyboard inputs, revealing passwords and authentication credentials across applications. The keylogging functionality records everything users type, including crypto wallet passwords. They also target Telegram account information for potential account takeover. They also harvest browser cookies showing victims’ frequently visited websites and preferences. Autocomplete passwords stored in browsers are also accessible to threat actors. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Grayscale Investments, a name synonymous with institutional access to digital assets, has once again captured attention with the launch of its latest offering: the Grayscale Story Trust . This move isn’t just another addition to their impressive portfolio of crypto trusts; it represents a pioneering step into the burgeoning realm of programmable digital rights, offering accredited investors a unique gateway to the IP token, the native asset of the Story blockchain protocol. As CoinDesk reported, this trust aims to bridge traditional finance with the cutting-edge of Web3’s creative economy. Understanding the Grayscale Story Trust: A Gateway to Programmable IP The Grayscale Story Trust is Grayscale’s newest investment product designed to provide accredited investors with exposure to the IP token. For those unfamiliar, Grayscale has a long-standing history of creating trusts that allow investors to gain exposure to various cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. This approach simplifies the investment process, handles the complexities of digital asset custody, and operates within a more familiar regulated framework for traditional investors. So, what exactly does this new trust entail? Target Audience: The trust is exclusively available to accredited investors. This typically means individuals or entities with a significant net worth or income, deemed sophisticated enough to understand the risks associated with such investments. Underlying Asset: The trust holds IP tokens, which are the native cryptocurrency of the Story Protocol. This is a crucial distinction, as it moves beyond traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum into a more specialized, utility-focused token. Investment Mechanism: Like other Grayscale trusts, the Grayscale Story Trust is expected to operate as a pass-through investment vehicle. Investors purchase shares in the trust, and these shares represent ownership in a portion of the trust’s holdings of IP tokens. Purpose: The primary goal is to offer a regulated, familiar structure for traditional investors to access an emerging and potentially high-growth sector: programmable digital rights and the broader creator economy. This launch underscores Grayscale’s commitment to exploring and validating new frontiers within the digital asset ecosystem, moving beyond just foundational cryptocurrencies to embrace specialized blockchain applications. Unpacking Story Protocol: The Engine Behind the IP Token To truly appreciate the significance of the Grayscale Story Trust , one must first understand the innovation it seeks to capitalize on: the Story Protocol. At its core, Story Protocol is a blockchain-based infrastructure designed to revolutionize how intellectual property (IP) is created, owned, licensed, and monetized in the digital age. Think of it as a decentralized operating system for intellectual property, enabling programmable digital rights. In today’s digital landscape, managing IP can be cumbersome. Creators often struggle with proving ownership, tracking usage, enforcing rights, and receiving fair compensation across various platforms. Story Protocol aims to solve these challenges by: Decentralized IP Registry: Providing a transparent and immutable record of IP ownership and its evolution, from initial concept to derivative works. Programmable Rights: Allowing creators to embed specific rules and conditions directly into their IP, such as automated royalty payments, licensing terms, and usage permissions. This means IP can be self-executing and permissioned. Fractional Ownership & Collaboration: Facilitating shared ownership and collaborative creation, where contributions can be tracked and rewarded automatically. Cross-Platform Interoperability: Ensuring that IP registered on Story Protocol can be recognized and utilized across different Web3 applications, platforms, and even traditional media. The IP token is central to this ecosystem. It serves multiple functions, including network governance, paying for transactions on the protocol, and potentially staking mechanisms that secure the network and incentivize participation. By holding IP tokens, investors in the Grayscale Story Trust are indirectly betting on the widespread adoption and success of this foundational layer for digital rights. Why is the Grayscale Story Trust a Game-Changer for Investors and the Creator Economy? The introduction of the Grayscale Story Trust is more than just another product launch; it carries significant implications for both investors and the broader digital rights landscape. Here’s why it’s a game-changer: Institutional Validation: Grayscale’s involvement lends a substantial degree of credibility and institutional validation to Story Protocol and the concept of programmable digital rights. This signals to the wider financial community that these emerging technologies are serious contenders for future investment. Accessibility for Accredited Investors: For many traditional institutional investors, directly buying and securing IP tokens on a decentralized exchange might be too complex or outside their mandate. The trust provides a familiar, regulated wrapper, removing operational hurdles and making this nascent asset class accessible. Exposure to a New Growth Sector: While Bitcoin and Ethereum have captured much of the crypto narrative, the digital rights space represents a vast, untapped market. From music royalties and digital art to gaming assets and literary works, the ability to program and manage IP on-chain could unlock immense value, and the trust offers early exposure to this potential. Diversification within Crypto Portfolios: For existing crypto investors, the Grayscale Story Trust offers a unique way to diversify their holdings beyond general-purpose cryptocurrencies. It provides exposure to a specific application layer of Web3, focused on the creative economy. This move highlights a growing trend where specialized blockchain protocols, addressing specific industry needs, are attracting institutional interest, moving beyond the initial speculative phase of cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Considerations for the Grayscale Story Trust While the prospects are exciting, it’s essential to approach the Grayscale Story Trust with a balanced perspective, acknowledging the inherent challenges and risks associated with investing in such a novel asset class. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets, particularly utility tokens and those related to IP, is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the valuation or operational viability of the trust and the underlying IP token. Market Volatility: Like all cryptocurrencies, the IP token is subject to significant price volatility. Its value can fluctuate dramatically based on market sentiment, adoption rates of Story Protocol, and broader crypto market trends. Investors must be prepared for potential sharp declines. Liquidity of Underlying Asset: While the trust aims to provide exposure, the liquidity of the IP token itself on secondary markets could be a factor. If the token lacks sufficient trading volume, it could impact the trust’s ability to manage its holdings effectively. Technology Risk: Story Protocol, while promising, is still a relatively new technology. There are inherent risks associated with the development, adoption, and security of any blockchain protocol. Bugs, exploits, or slower-than-expected adoption could impact the token’s value. Accredited Investor Limitations: By limiting investment to accredited investors, the trust restricts access to a broad base of retail investors, which could impact its overall market reach and demand. Potential investors should conduct thorough due diligence and understand that while Grayscale provides a familiar wrapper, the underlying asset remains a high-risk, high-reward investment. The Broader Impact: How Digital Rights are Shaping the Future The launch of the Grayscale Story Trust is not just about a new investment product; it’s a testament to the growing recognition of programmable digital rights as a fundamental building block for the future of the internet, particularly the Web3 creator economy. This paradigm shift could redefine how value is created, distributed, and owned online. Consider the stark contrast between traditional IP management and the vision Story Protocol offers: Feature Traditional IP Management Programmable Digital Rights (Story Protocol) Ownership & Provenance Centralized registries, legal documents, often opaque. Decentralized, immutable blockchain record, transparent. Licensing & Royalties Manual contracts, intermediaries, slow payments, high fees. Automated smart contracts, instant, peer-to-peer, low fees. Derivative Works Complex legal agreements, difficult to track and compensate. On-chain tracking, automated attribution and royalty distribution. Monetization Gatekeepers, limited models, geographic restrictions. Direct creator-to-fan, fractional ownership, global access, diverse models. Transparency Limited, often requires audits or legal discovery. Full on-chain transparency for all transactions and rights. This shift empowers creators by giving them more control, transparency, and direct monetization opportunities. It fosters a more equitable digital ecosystem where value flows directly to those who create it, rather than being captured by intermediaries. The implications span across various industries, from music and film to gaming, publishing, and even academic research. Actionable Insight: For creators and businesses involved in digital content, understanding and potentially integrating with protocols like Story Protocol could unlock new revenue streams and greater control over their intellectual property. For investors, the Grayscale Story Trust represents an opportunity to gain early exposure to a sector poised for significant growth as the Web3 vision materializes. In conclusion, Grayscale’s decision to launch the Grayscale Story Trust marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset space. It not only validates the innovative work being done by Story Protocol in the realm of programmable digital rights but also provides a significant bridge for traditional capital to flow into this exciting new frontier. While the journey ahead will undoubtedly have its challenges, this development underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market and its continuous expansion into specialized, real-world applications beyond just digital currencies. It’s a clear signal that the future of intellectual property is becoming increasingly digital, decentralized, and programmable. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

ETH switched to accumulation, surpassing BTC with short-term demand in July. Ethereum recovered to levels not seen since March 2024, inching up toward the $4,000 level. However, the token is not weighed down by unrealized profits this time around. According to Glassnode data, ETH has much lower relative unrealized gains. In the past year, Ethereum whales were busy trading, trying to achieve a lower average price. During the latest rally, however, some of the purchases were made at a higher market price in a rush to secure available tokens. Despite $ETH trading near its March 2024 highs, unrealized profits are far lower. Back then, #ETH hit +2σ (standard deviations) on Relative Unrealized Profit at $3.98K – today it's just nearing +1σ. A move to +2σ now would imply ~$4.9K $ETH . pic.twitter.com/TdmCIzp3Pm — glassnode (@glassnode) July 31, 2025 The relatively low metric of unrealized gains may mean recent buyers are more willing to hold, potentially signaling a larger ETH rally. During previous ETH local peaks, whales often sold, depressing the price. Even older holders from the ICO era, or the Ethereum Foundation , were frequent sellers near market peaks. ETH proved resilient, even defying the recent market where most altcoins took a step back. ETH continued its climb on Thursday, rising to $3,832.37. The recent ratio between unrealized gains and the current price suggests ETH may attempt a hike close to $5,000, recovering its all-time high. ETH also reached a six-month peak of 0.032 BTC, potentially reversing the trend of being seen as doomed to always slide in BTC pricing. ETH dominance expanded to 11.7%, while traders awaited a spillover for a wider altcoin market. Spot demand grows for ETH Demand for ETH increases, based on a drive to use wrapped or staked forms of the token for passive income. The Ethereum unstaking validator queue also saw fewer requests after a recent spike. Buyers are trying to tap multiple sources of ETH, including older staked coins or unwrapped ETH. The main driver of spot buying are still ETFs, which continued their aggressive accumulation. Both ETH and BTC are seeing an inflow of whale buyers, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. ETH accelerated its net outflows from exchanges, showing the strengthening demand from individual whales and corporate buyers. Strategic ETH reserves broke above $10B in total, after the latest purchases from BitMine and SharpLink Gaming . In total, buyers take 413K ETH from the market each week, while only around 15K are minted and retained in the supply. ETH demand may come from the eventual addition of staking and in-kind settlement for ETFs and other vehicles. The requirement for Ethereum reserves may boost spot demand additionally. Additionally, over 35% of ETH is locked, representing 28.3% of the supply. ETH awaits short squeeze to $3,900 Another major driver of the ETH rally is the peak open interest and the accumulation of short positions. Currently, liquidity has accumulated around $3,900, suggesting a short squeeze may drive the price of ETH higher. ETH may shift between $3,900 and $3,600, depending on which side of liquidity accumulation is attacked first. | Source: Coinank In the past 12 hours, ETH saw a shift to short liquidations, attacking $20M up to the $3,800 price range. On a 24-hour basis, ETH saw more than $93M in long liquidations. Currently, ETH may make a move toward $3,600 based on accrued long liquidity. Ethereum open interest is still above $26B, down from a recent $28B peak. ETH saw significant liquidations, but quickly returned to speculative trading, as the asset awaited a renewed rally.

With coins like Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and Dogwifhat (WIF) also showing signs of recovery, investors are asking: is the meme coin wave ready to surge again? In this article, we examine the indicators behind this movement and spotlight tokens with breakout potential. In a space where timing and visibility drive sentiment, Outset PR stands out as the engine that amplifies such momentum. Pepe (PEPE) Shows Potential Amid Current Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview Pepe (PEPE) is trading between $0.00001145 and $0.00001444. Despite a drop of nearly 19% over the past week, it has shown a remarkable 20% rise in the last month. The current support sits at just over $0.00001010, and PEPE could possibly ascend to the resistance levels of $0.00001609 or even $0.00001908, representing potential growth of around 39% from the current lower range. The RSI sits under 30, hinting that PEPE might be oversold, suggesting a chance to climb. However, investors are cautious as the MACD level still shows bearish signals. Overall, PEPE stands at a crossroads, with both potential for growth and risk of further decline. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Eyes New Highs Amidst Bullish Momentum Source: tradingview Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) shows promising signs as its price hovers around a favorable value. Recently, PENGU experienced a slight 11% decrease over the past week. This rally is pushing the coin closer to its nearest resistance of about $0.05621. If the momentum continues, it could breach this level and aim for a higher resistance around $0.07121. The strong support near $0.02399 provides a safety net, boosting confidence among traders. Indicators like Stochastic and RSI align positively, further hinting at a possible upward trend. With these signals, PENGU could be on the verge of substantial growth. Dogwifhat (WIF) Shows Potential After Recent Drop Source: tradingview Dogwifhat's current price is between $0.97 and $1.30. After losing near 20% in the past week, it might bounce back soon. If it moves past its resistance at $1.48, it could climb to $1.81. This would mean a possible increase of about 50% from its lower point. The coin has a history of ups and downs, with a gain of almost 20% last month but a six-month drop of 16%. Its RSI is low, suggesting it's not overbought. While its current MACD level is slightly negative, the potential for growth is still there. If interest picks up, Dogwifhat might recover strongly.

As Bitcoin holds steady near $120K, its market dominance is declining, making way for altcoins to outperform. Altcoin futures volumes are on the rise, coupled with a strong uptick in retail activity. The prospect of a full-blown altcoin season is fast becoming more potent. Several crypto assets surge amid shifting market dynamics following Bitcoin’s breakout to an all-time high near $120,000 earlier in July. Ethereum, in particular, has become a bellwether for the rally, with institutional inflows, trading volume, and retail activity all pointing toward the beginning of a new altseason. Ethereum Rallies 170% from Lows, Nearing All-Time High Ethereum has surged 170% from its recent lows around $1,300. Currently trading at approximately $3,850, it is just 23% shy of its all-time high of $4,871. The momentum was amplified by a $1.3 billion investment from SharpLink, which now holds 438,190 ETH, one of the largest known Ethereum accumulations this cycle. Other firms, such as The Ether Machine, disclosed new Ethereum token acquisitions today, investing $57 million.

For many, particularly those immersed in the cryptocurrency space, where decentralization and user control are paramount, the concept of digital identity and how it’s managed is always a top priority. Now, a major tech player like Google is taking a significant stride, exploring new frontiers in how it understands and protects its users. This move involves advanced Google age estimation technology, signaling a broader industry shift towards more robust digital safeguards. What is Google’s Age Estimation Technology? Google is currently experimenting with a groundbreaking machine-learning-powered system in the U.S. designed to accurately determine the age of its users. The primary goal? To filter content and tailor experiences across all Google products, ensuring that users receive age-appropriate material. This initiative is a direct response to the growing need for a safer online environment, particularly for younger audiences. While it’s in its testing phase, this development marks a significant shift in how digital platforms manage access and content. This innovative system doesn’t rely on a single data point. Instead, Google’s sophisticated algorithms will analyze a range of information from your Google account. This includes the types of details you’ve searched for, the categories of videos you’ve watched on YouTube, and other behavioral patterns that can provide clues about your age. It’s a comprehensive approach, aiming for accuracy without requiring explicit age declarations upfront for every interaction. How Does AI Age Verification Work? The core of this new system lies in its advanced AI age verification capabilities. Rather than simply asking for a birth date, Google’s machine learning models are trained on vast datasets to recognize patterns indicative of different age groups. When the company’s tool determines that a user might be under 18, they will receive an email detailing how their Google product experience might change. This proactive notification is designed to inform users transparently about the adjustments being made to their accounts. Google has clarified that its approach involves a combination of ‘age estimation’ and, when necessary, ‘age verification.’ This means that while AI might estimate your age based on your activity, if there’s uncertainty or a need for confirmation, Google might then prompt for a more direct form of age verification, such as a photo of a government ID or a selfie. This two-pronged strategy aims to balance user convenience with the imperative of accurate age gating. Empowering Online Youth Protection: Changes for Underage Users For users identified as being under 18, Google will implement a series of significant changes across its ecosystem. These measures are designed to enhance online youth protection and create a safer, more controlled digital experience. Here’s a breakdown of the key adjustments: Google Maps Timeline Disabled: The timeline feature in Google Maps, which tracks and displays a user’s location history, will be turned off. This helps protect the privacy and whereabouts of minors. No Personalized Ads: Underage users will no longer receive personalized advertisements. This reduces the risk of exposure to targeted marketing that might be inappropriate or exploit their vulnerabilities. Restricted Age-Gated Ad Categories: Specific ad categories that are age-restricted will be blocked, further shielding young users from potentially harmful or unsuitable commercial content. Bar from Adult-Themed Apps on Play Store: Access to applications on the Google Play Store deemed adult-themed will be restricted, ensuring that only age-appropriate content is available for download. Prevention of Repeated Exposure to Triggering Content: Google will also work to prevent underage users from repeatedly accessing certain kinds of content that could be detrimental, such as content that might trigger body image issues. This proactive filtering aims to safeguard mental well-being. Fostering Digital Well-being on YouTube and Beyond Beyond content filtering, Google’s initiative extends to promoting overall digital well-being , particularly on platforms like YouTube. The company will automatically enable specific features aimed at encouraging healthier consumption habits for younger users: Break Reminders: These notifications will prompt users to take breaks after extended periods of watching videos, encouraging a healthier balance. ‘Go to Bed’ Notifications: For those consuming videos late at night, these reminders will gently nudge users to stop watching and get adequate rest, helping to maintain healthy sleep patterns. These features, initially rolled out for YouTube earlier this week, are now being integrated into the broader Google account age-gating system in the U.S. This consistent approach across products underscores Google’s commitment to creating a more responsible and mindful digital environment for its younger audience. Navigating User Privacy and the Appeal Process While the intent behind user privacy and protection is clear, any system that estimates or verifies age based on user data naturally raises questions about privacy. Google acknowledges these concerns, stating, “Age assurance helps us ensure that adults can access the information and services they need, while also applying the right protections for our younger users.” The company aims to strike a balance between safeguarding minors and respecting the privacy of all users. Crucially, Google has implemented an appeal process for users who believe they have been mistakenly tagged as underage. If you find yourself in this situation, you can appeal the decision and provide proof of your age. This typically involves submitting a photo of your government-issued ID or a selfie for verification. This mechanism provides an important safety net, allowing users to correct any potential errors in the AI’s age estimation. A Broader Industry Trend Towards Age Gating Google is not alone in this endeavor. Other major platforms, including Instagram and Roblox, have also begun utilizing AI to estimate the age of their users. This collective movement reflects a growing industry-wide recognition of the need for better age assurance online. The push is also coming from lawmakers globally. In the U.S., several states have existing or proposed laws specifically addressing age gating and the protection of minors online. Similarly, platforms operating in the UK have started implementing age verification measures following the passing of the Online Safety Act. This convergence of technological innovation and regulatory pressure is shaping a new era of digital responsibility. As AI capabilities advance, the ability to accurately assess user age becomes a powerful tool for platforms to comply with regulations and, more importantly, to fulfill their ethical obligations to protect vulnerable users. The ongoing experimentation by Google and others signals a future where digital experiences are increasingly tailored and safer for everyone, regardless of age. Conclusion: A New Frontier in Digital Safety Google’s ambitious experiment with machine-learning-powered age estimation in the U.S. represents a significant stride in the ongoing quest for a safer and more responsible digital landscape. By leveraging sophisticated AI to tailor content and experiences based on age, Google is setting a new precedent for how major tech companies approach online youth protection and digital well-being. While challenges related to user privacy and the accuracy of AI age verification remain, the implementation of an appeal process and the broader industry trend towards age gating suggest a collective commitment to creating a more secure online environment for the next generation. This crucial development underscores the evolving nature of digital identity and data management, themes that resonate deeply across all digital domains, including the rapidly expanding world of cryptocurrency and Web3.

Data from NFTPriceFloor shows the collectible soared above $208,000 today, marking the highest mark since mid-2022 in US dollar terms. It hovers at $206,850 after incredible recoveries in the past few sessions. Source -NFTPriceFloor Notably, the price jump follows notable user activity. CryptoPunks trading volume surged to $24.6 million last week. That represented a 416% weekly surge and the highest figure since March 2024. Sudden buyer interest resurgence and ETH’s latest rallies have contributed to the growth. Remember, CryptoPunks is the top Ether-based NFT collection, often used as a proxy for sentiments in the non-fungible tokens space. Moreover, NFTPriceFloor shows that most top collections demonstrated notable growth in the past three months. While CryptoPunks topped the charts with a 162% surge in US dollar terms, Pudgy Penguin climbed to the 2nd spot after a nearly 200% increase. Pudgy Penguins have seen increased demand lately, which has fueled its recent growth . Meanwhile, the current picture appears different in Ethereum terms. CryptoPunks trade at 53.84 ETH, exploring levels not seen since February last year. Source – NFTPriceFloor That shows that the Ethereum surge fueled CryptoPunk’s comeback. The second-largest cryptocurrency by value has seen remarkable growth from above $1,400 in early April 2025 to press time’s $3,850. Meanwhile, CryptoPunks’ record-high prices coincide with intensifying activity as trading volumes have exploded. CryptoPunk’s volume skyrockets The Block data shows that the CryptoPunks NFT collection’s trading volume surpassed $24.6 million last week. That marked a substantial 416% uptick from the past week and the highest seven-day trading volume since March 2024. Meanwhile, the average sale price increased to $182,000 from $140,000 within two weeks. GameSquare fueled the growth after spending $5.15 million to buy Punk #5577. It marked the first considerable corporate NFT purchase financed through equity. CryptoPunks remains the dominant Ethereum-based NFT collection, and ETH’s price trajectory could determine its performance in the upcoming sessions. Ethereum price outlook Ethereum has fueled the altcoin season narrative with its strength. It trades at $3,838 after recovering quickly from a Fed-triggered dip that plunged Bitcoin to $115K. Optimistic sentiments, as the community celebrated Ethereum’s 10th anniversary on July 30, sparked ETH’s upside bias. The token is targeting July highs of $3,941 after an over 50% monthly increase. Chart by CoinMarketCap Bulls will target the sought-after psychological mark at $4,000. Breaking this resistance could trigger uptrends to the November 2021 ATH of $4,890. That would translate to an approximately 27% rally from ETH’s current price. The top altcoin boasts robust momentum after consistent ETH inflows throughout July. The current structure suggests that Ethereum has all it takes to break past $4,000 and head to fresh all-time highs in the coming weeks and months.

These CryptoQuant Charts Point to Yes,https://cryptopotato.com/altseason-in-full-swing-these-cryptoquant-charts-point-to-yes/,"The long-awaited altcoin season is finally here, said CryptoQuant. The altcoin market, led by Ethereum, is heating up, while Bitcoin takes the back seat. This market shift is evident in charts tracking trends on Ethereum, Bitcoin, and metrics like trading volume and crypto dominance. In addition, these charts show increased participation from certain cohorts of investors as the bull cycle progresses. Altseason Has Arrived According to a series of tweets from CryptoQuant, ether (ETH) has surged 170% from its recent lows and now sits approximately 23% from its all-time high of $4,871. Since bitcoin (BTC) broke out above $120,000, altcoins have been on fire too, kickstarting this cycle’s altseason. Ether started leading the hype after the online games developer, SharpLink, made a bold investment in the cryptocurrency. The company initially bought $156 million worth of ETH. They are now the second-largest corporate holder of ETH, with holdings surpassing $1.3 billion in value (438,190 ETH). As altcoins steal the spotlight and BTC consolidates under $120,000, Bitcoin dominance is falling. The leading digital network now accounts for roughly 58% of the total market share, down from 61% a few months ago. Altcoins are seeing heavy trading, with their futures volume spiking to multi-month highs. The futures trading volume for both ETH and altcoins has hit $223.6 billion, a level not seen in five months. Retail Demand is Back Furthermore, the entire altcoin sector now accounts for 83% of centralized exchange (CEX) futures activity. Bitcoin, on the other hand, sits at 17%, with its CEX trading volume declining as well. Interestingly, most futures trading pairs on CEXs have recorded positive returns over the last two weeks. On platforms like Binance, just 23 out of 424 futures pairs have shown negative returns since BTC reached its new high. This indicates that the prices of most altcoins have been climbing for weeks. One of the most exciting trends in this market shift is the return of retail participation. Retail demand is back and on the rise – BTC transactions under $10,000 have risen by 9.7% in 30 days. CryptoQuant said such signals often precede major BTC and altcoin rallies. However, it is also worth mentioning that increased retail participation often appears towards the end of bull cycles. So, this may be a sign that the bull market is coming to an end, and investors have a few more months to make the most of the cycle. The post Altseason in Full Swing?

However, has this latest dip in Bitcoin dominance just come to an end? Is Bitcoin (BTC) about to hog the limelight again? Bitcoin dominance about to rise again? Source: TradingView The above weekly chart for Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) points to a long inexorable climb in dominance from Q3 2022 to the current date. Granted that this last dip in dominance has been the deepest in all this time, with the exception of the 11.3% dip going into the end of 2024. With that said, and with good signs of a bounce taking place just above 60%, this might be the last of the big increases from the altcoins as a whole, although the odd few could still continue to outperform. That said, the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is signalling a potential cross-up of the indicators, which would bring upside price momentum back in the favour of Bitcoin dominance. Is $ETH about to start reversing against $BTC? Source: TradingView Ethereum (ETH) is the biggest cryptocurrency outside of Bitcoin (BTC), and in the weekly chart above it can be seen that the number 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization has rallied a notable 85% from bottom to top. However, with the ETH/BTC pair coming up against the ascending trendline, is it about to roll over? The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart does not bode well either for $ETH . A series of higher highs, going all the way back to 2024, is not imitated in the price action, which in spite of the 85% rally, is still generally going in the opposite direction. Two possible scenarios Could it be that one of two possible scenarios is about to take place? The first scenario is that Bitcoin breaks out of its current bull flag and that most investors are drawn back into crypto’s premier asset and there is a sizable flow of value from altcoins back into Bitcoin. The second scenario is that Bitcoin breaks down, and that there is a significant shakeout of the entire crypto market. In this particular case, investors would not only flee Bitcoin, but they would sell altcoins like hot cakes, leading to a plunge in their values. If either of the above scenarios take place, Bitcoin dominance is going to spike to the upside again. Could it go even higher and take out the 70% resistance? Absolutely! Of course, there are always other scenarios, and one of these might be that some of the altcoins do continue to outperform $BTC in spite of rising dominance. The entire crypto market is at a very delicate point in this bull market. The 4-year cycle is due to come to an end in Q4 of this year. Could it end earlier? Who knows, but one thing is certain, if you are in altcoins, plenty of caution is needed going forward. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The urgency of this discussion was raised after representatives from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the primary regulatory body that handles important internet laws, released a statement dated July 31. The internet watchdog stated that they noticed significant security issues with Nvidia’s chips. The statement cited concerns that the US-based company’s chips may have location-tracking capabilities that can be remotely toggled. Following these accusations, Nvidia did not publicly recognize that its H20 chips had these features, nor did it respond to requests for comments. US ban lift on Nvidia H20 chips triggers backlash The US lifted its April ban on Nvidia’s H20 chip sales to China earlier this month. Following the reversal, both Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. quickly resumed operations in the Chinese market , reclaiming their positions as leading AI chip suppliers to the country. Tech company representatives noted they consulted with Washington officials, who indicated that shipments would be approved once they were ready for export. Apart from this, trade officials from the US and China met recently in Stockholm to discuss potential trade deals . This was a positive outlook after years of conflicts between the two countries. However, China’s recent concerns about Nvidia’s H20 chips have raised tension in the market after what appeared to be an improvement of US-China trade ties. Following China’s concerns, US lawmakers remarked that they had earlier warned Trump’s administration about this move. They pointed out that allowing the sale of Nvidia’s H20 chip would enhance Beijing’s military capabilities, and the country’s AI technology would outperform that of the US. In a letter to US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Representative John Moolenaar of Michigan described Nvidia’s H20 chip as a powerful and cost-effective AI solution. He argued that allowing China access to the chip could significantly boost its AI capabilities, which currently lag behind. Still, Trump’s administration removed the ban, acknowledging that the H20 chip is not the first advanced product in the country. Based on their argument, China has several advanced products from its local tech firms, such as Huawei Technologies Company . Debate intensifies over US policy shift on Nvidia chip exports to China Concerning Washington’s decision, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, highlighted that the US officials had not yet approved any shipment of their AI chips to China. Moreover, the US did not state the exact figures of AI chips that would be allowed for shipment to China. Some officials in Trump’s administration who wished to remain anonymous had also raised concerns about permitting these exports. Despite this, Huang was still optimistic about acquiring those licenses very soon. Meanwhile, Moolenaar did not approve of Washington’s change in policy. He requested clarity on the reasons behind this change in policy with a due date of August 8. Moreover, he requested a briefing on the procedure the US officials would follow, the regulations in place when issuing licenses for the AI chips, and the exact figures to be allowed for shipment to China. Moolenaar warned that allowing China broad access to Nvidia’s H20 chips would enhance its computing power, enabling the development of advanced AI models that could be widely distributed. He also expressed concerns that China aims to use the chips to capture major market share and establish a global technological standard, posing a potential threat to the US and other nations.

According to him, we’re not witnessing typical economic growth; instead, rising asset prices are being fueled almost entirely by a global wave of liquidity . This liquidity isn't tied to GDP performance or business cycles, but rather to the need for governments to refinance massive amounts of debt. With about 75% of financial activity focused on rolling over debt , central banks and financial institutions are pushing fresh liquidity into markets, creating a loop of rising prices, increased collateral, and even more borrowing capacity. For crypto, this is a perfect storm. Howell believes we're now in the “speculation phase” , where high-growth assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum historically perform best. As investors pour into these riskier sectors and yield curves steepen, signs are pointing to a classic late-stage rally. He expects this to lead to a blowoff top , characterized by steep, sudden surges—especially in assets most sensitive to liquidity. The recently passed Genius Act could add even more fuel. By requiring stablecoins to hold large amounts of U.S. government securities, the act gives the Treasury a new funding channel while boosting crypto liquidity. If stablecoin circulation grows from $250 billion to several trillion as predicted, that would supercharge trading volume and capital flows into Bitcoin and Ethereum . In short, both liquidity models and market psychology (as echoed by Raoul Pal’s “banana zone” thesis) are flashing the same signal: a vertical crypto move is coming. Investors watching from the sidelines may want to pay close attention— the cycle isn't ending; it's going parabolic .",,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-07-31 13:54:26

The products include stablecoin credit pools for payment finance (PayFi) and cpUSD, a permissionless token that generates yield from short-term lending to payment providers. ""What many overlook is that while stablecoins settle instantly, fiat does not, forcing fintechs to front liquidity to bridge that gap,"" CEO and co-founder Jakob Kronbichler said in a statement on Thursday. Clearpool’s PayFi pools aim to supply credit to institutional lenders serving these companies, with repayment cycles ranging from one to seven days. The cpUSD token, backed by PayFi vaults and liquid, yield-bearing stablecoin, aims to deliver returns tied to real-world payment flows rather than speculative crypto activity. Clearpool's expansion underscores the broader trend of stablecoins becoming core infrastructure in global payments, particularly in emerging markets where traditional banking rails remain slow or costly. The protocol said it has already originated more than $800 million in stablecoin credit to institutional borrowers, including Jane Street and Banxa.

A sharp divergence in gains may form. Subtle signals point to a coin ready to sprint while the benchmark jogs. Hidden catalysts, fresh money flows and a tight supply hint at a path few have spotted before eyes catch up. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin: Digital Gold Shining in a New Market Cycle Bitcoin is the first and best-known digital coin. It was launched in 2009 by a person, or group, called Satoshi Nakamoto. Instead of paper notes, it uses a shared online list, called a blockchain, that sits on thousands of computers. People can send value to each other at any hour, with no bank in the middle. Special users, named miners, keep the list honest. They race to solve math puzzles, add new blocks, and win fresh coins. Every four years that prize is cut in half, and only 21 million coins will ever exist. Today, many traders see Bitcoin as digital gold. Some newer coins promise faster apps, yet they also bring higher risk and quick swings. Bitcoin holds the longest record, the largest network, and the strongest name. The next halving is on the horizon, meaning fewer new coins will enter the market. Past cuts often sparked fresh rallies as supply tightened and demand grew. Big funds and even some countries now hold a slice, adding more eyes on the price. With stock markets shaky and inflation high, Bitcoin may look like a bright shelter this cycle. Conclusion BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, and DOGE remain solid picks, but XYZVerse outshines; early entry may capture a 20,000% surge by fusing meme buzz with global sports fervor.

A significant development is capturing attention: the rebranding of Nasdaq-listed Fundamental Global to FG Nexus, accompanied by a monumental $200 million private placement. This substantial capital infusion is earmarked for an ambitious Ethereum treasury strategy , a move poised to reshape how institutions engage with digital assets. Backed by industry giants like Galaxy Digital, Kraken, and Hivemind Capital, this initiative signals a new era of institutional confidence in Ethereum’s robust ecosystem. What is the FG Nexus Ethereum Treasury Strategy? FG Nexus has not only rebranded but strategically pivoted its focus towards digital assets. The $200 million raise underscores investor confidence in this new direction. At its core, the Ethereum treasury strategy is designed to generate sustainable returns and diversify exposure within the crypto landscape through two primary pillars: Accumulating ETH for Staking Rewards: This involves acquiring a substantial amount of Ether (ETH) and “staking” it. Staking is a process where ETH holders lock up their assets to support the network’s operations, particularly transaction validation. In return, they earn rewards, effectively generating a yield on their holdings while contributing to the security and efficiency of the Ethereum network. Exposure to Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs): This innovative aspect bridges traditional finance and blockchain. By investing in tokenized RWAs, FG Nexus aims to gain exposure to tangible assets like real estate or commodities, represented as digital tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This offers benefits such as increased liquidity, fractional ownership, and enhanced transparency for traditionally illiquid assets. The backing from prominent entities like Galaxy Digital, Kraken, and Hivemind Capital provides not only capital but also significant expertise and validation within the digital asset space, underscoring the credibility and potential impact of this venture. Why an Ethereum-Based Treasury? The Power of Staking Ethereum’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism has transformed it into a yield-bearing asset, making it highly attractive for institutional investors. FG Nexus’s decision to center its treasury strategy around Ethereum is a strategic move to leverage this potential. Staking on Ethereum allows participants to lock up their ETH to act as network validators, verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. In exchange, they receive newly minted ETH as rewards, generating a consistent yield. The appeal of staking for an Ethereum treasury strategy lies in several key factors: Predictable Yield Generation: Staking offers a relatively consistent income stream, enhancing overall portfolio returns and providing stability amidst market fluctuations. Network Security and Participation: By staking, FG Nexus directly contributes to the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network, aligning with a trend of institutions seeking active participation in the ecosystems they invest in. Reduced Volatility Exposure: While ETH price can fluctuate, staking is a long-term commitment. This implies a strategy focused on accumulating and holding, potentially reducing exposure to short-term market noise and emphasizing the asset’s long-term utility. ESG Alignment: Post-Merge, Ethereum’s energy consumption drastically reduced, making ETH staking a more environmentally friendly option, aligning with growing ESG considerations in institutional investing. This capability allows institutional treasuries to generate returns from their digital asset holdings in a manner more akin to traditional fixed-income investments, but with the added benefits of blockchain technology. Unlocking Value with Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) The second pillar of FG Nexus’s strategy—exposure to tokenized real-world assets—is equally innovative. Tokenized RWAs represent a crucial bridge between the vast value in traditional assets and the efficiency, transparency, and liquidity of blockchain technology. For an Ethereum treasury strategy , this offers immense potential for diversification and new revenue streams. Tokenized RWAs are digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership or a claim on a tangible asset in the physical world. This concept offers several compelling advantages: Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenization allows for fractional ownership and easier transfer, potentially creating more liquid markets for traditionally illiquid assets like real estate. Fractional Ownership: High-value assets can be broken down into smaller, more accessible units, broadening investment opportunities. Increased Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear, verifiable record of ownership and transactions, enhancing trust and reducing fraud. Global Accessibility: Tokenized assets can be traded globally 24/7, transcending geographical and time-zone limitations. Integrating RWAs into their treasury strategy means FG Nexus can access a broader spectrum of asset classes, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk while exploring new avenues for growth and yield that are traditionally inefficient or inaccessible. Who is Backing This Ambitious Ethereum Treasury Strategy? The credibility of FG Nexus’s venture is significantly bolstered by its investors. The participation of industry heavyweights like Galaxy Digital, Kraken, and Hivemind Capital sends a powerful signal about the maturity and potential of institutional engagement with digital assets, particularly within the Ethereum treasury strategy framework. Galaxy Digital: A diversified financial services and investment management company specializing in digital assets. Their involvement brings deep market insight, institutional-grade infrastructure, and a strong track record, signifying belief in the long-term viability of such a strategy. Kraken: One of the longest-standing and most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Kraken’s participation highlights the increasing integration of exchange services with broader institutional investment strategies, especially given their robust staking services. Hivemind Capital Partners: A multi-strategy crypto investment firm. Hivemind brings specialized expertise in identifying and capitalizing on opportunities within the digital asset ecosystem, making them a strategic partner for an Ethereum-based treasury. The combined backing provides not only significant capital but also invaluable strategic guidance, network access, and a stamp of approval that can attract further institutional interest, validating digital assets as a mainstream component of sophisticated financial portfolios. Benefits and Potential Challenges of This Institutional Move The launch of FG Nexus’s Ethereum treasury strategy marks a significant step for institutional crypto adoption. However, like any innovative financial endeavor, it presents both unique benefits and potential challenges. Key Benefits: Pioneering Institutional Adoption: Sets a precedent for other traditional financial institutions, demonstrating a structured approach to managing crypto assets. Market Validation: A $200 million investment from credible players validates Ethereum’s role as a robust platform for institutional-grade financial products. Diversified Yield Opportunities: Staking ETH offers a new yield avenue potentially uncorrelated with traditional markets. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: Inclusion of tokenized RWAs directly links traditional finance with decentralized finance, showcasing blockchain’s practical utility. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for crypto, especially for institutional players and novel strategies, remains a key risk. Smart Contract Risks: Reliance on smart contracts for staking and RWA tokenization introduces risks like bugs or exploits. Market Volatility: While staking offers yield, ETH’s price volatility could still impact overall returns. Operational Complexities: Managing large-scale staking and RWA tokenization requires specialized expertise and robust operational frameworks. Despite these challenges, the strategic backing and careful planning by FG Nexus suggest a calculated approach to harnessing Ethereum’s immense potential. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Crypto? The implications of FG Nexus’s bold move extend far beyond their balance sheet. This Ethereum treasury strategy is a powerful indicator of the accelerating trend of institutional capital flowing into the digital asset space, paving the way for a more integrated financial future. It signifies: Mainstreaming Digital Assets: Publicly listed companies committing significant capital to crypto-native strategies validates digital assets as a legitimate asset class for sophisticated portfolios. Demand for DeFi Infrastructure: The focus on staking and tokenized RWAs will likely spur further development and demand for institutional-grade DeFi protocols and security solutions. Innovation in Treasury Management: Demonstrates a new paradigm where digital assets can be actively managed for yield and diversification, potentially inspiring other corporations. Catalyst for Regulatory Clarity: Increased institutional participation will likely pressure regulators to provide clearer guidelines, crucial for long-term industry growth. Bridging the Gap: This initiative exemplifies the ongoing convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), showing blockchain’s benefits being adopted by established financial entities. FG Nexus’s $200 million commitment is not just a financial transaction; it’s a blueprint for how traditional institutions can strategically engage with the digital economy, moving towards a future where blockchain technology is an integral part of global finance. The journey of FG Nexus, from Fundamental Global to a pioneer in institutional crypto strategies, marks a pivotal moment. Their audacious $200 million raise, backed by industry titans, is a resounding vote of confidence in Ethereum’s potential. By focusing on a dual approach of ETH staking for yield and exposure to tokenized real-world assets, FG Nexus is not only building a robust treasury but also laying down a critical pathway for broader institutional adoption. This strategic foresight has the potential to unlock unprecedented value, bridging the traditional financial world with the decentralized future and inspiring a new wave of innovation in how assets are managed and leveraged globally. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is FG Nexus? FG Nexus is the rebranded entity of Nasdaq-listed Fundamental Global. It has pivoted its strategy to focus on digital assets, particularly an Ethereum-based treasury strategy, after securing $200 million in private placement funding. What does an Ethereum treasury strategy involve? An Ethereum treasury strategy, as adopted by FG Nexus, primarily involves two components: accumulating Ether (ETH) for staking rewards to generate yield, and gaining exposure to tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on the Ethereum blockchain for diversification and new revenue streams. Who are the key investors backing FG Nexus? The $200 million private placement was backed by prominent players in the digital asset space, including Galaxy Digital, a leading crypto financial services firm; Kraken, a major cryptocurrency exchange; and Hivemind Capital, a multi-strategy crypto investment firm. What are tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs)? Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) are digital tokens on a blockchain (like Ethereum) that represent ownership or a claim on tangible assets in the physical world. Examples include real estate, commodities, or art. They offer benefits such as enhanced liquidity, fractional ownership, and increased transparency. How does staking Ethereum generate rewards? After Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, users can “stake” their ETH by locking it up to act as validators for the network. These validators are responsible for verifying transactions and securing the blockchain. In return for this service, they receive newly minted ETH as rewards, effectively earning a yield on their staked assets. What are the main risks associated with this institutional crypto strategy? Key risks include evolving regulatory uncertainty in the crypto space, potential smart contract vulnerabilities, the inherent price volatility of the underlying asset (ETH), and the operational complexities involved in managing large-scale digital asset portfolios and tokenized RWAs.

Key Takeaways: Phoenix Group has launched a $150M crypto reserve, becoming the first ADX-listed firm to hold digital assets. The company’s self-mining revenue surged 219% over two years despite a recent drop in output. Phoenix expects a Q3 rebound as Solana and other holdings regain value. The reserve includes 514 Bitcoin and 630,000 Solana tokens, which the company says reflects a long-term commitment to digital assets. “Holding Bitcoin and other strategic digital assets isn’t just about exposure. It’s about alignment,” said CEO Munaf Ali in a Thursday press release . “We believe in the long-term value these networks represent, and our treasury strategy reflects that belief.” Phoenix Group Emerges as Regional Leader in Crypto Treasury Strategy The move positions Phoenix Group as a regional trailblazer, joining a growing list of mining firms adding altcoins to their balance sheets. Its announcement follows BitMine Immersion Technologies’ recent expansion into Ethereum holdings, where it now controls over 625,000 ETH, 0.52% of the circulating supply. Phoenix Group has also emerged as one of the ADX’s top-performing stocks in Q2 2025, with its share price surging 72% between April and June. Despite a drop in mining output, the company’s broader financials show continued momentum. In the second quarter of 2025, Phoenix mined a total of 336 BTC, a 51% decline from the previous quarter, with 214 BTC attributed to self-mining. However, year-over-year performance remains strong. The company reported a 219% increase in self-mining revenue over two years, growing from $13 million in H1 2023 to $41.7 million in H1 2025. Phoenix Group officially adopts Digital Asset Treasury Strategy, net added 179 BTC in Q2 and now has a total of 514 BTC. pic.twitter.com/QXwdQkDo6Q — NLNico (@btcNLNico) July 31, 2025 It also improved its gross profit margin on self-mining to 31%, while cutting energy costs by 14%. Financial disclosures show Phoenix is managing $16 million in debt and recorded a $29 million non-cash loss tied to asset revaluations and accounting adjustments. Still, the firm expressed optimism, projecting a partial recovery in Q3, driven by gains in key holdings like Solana. Crypto Treasuries Aren’t Really Buying Crypto A growing number of publicly traded companies are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build crypto treasuries, but one analyst says many aren’t actually buying digital assets from the open market . As reported, crypto analyst Ran Neuner claimed that crypto treasury firms are acting less like buyers and more like exit vehicles for crypto insiders. Instead of purchasing assets directly from exchanges, these companies often receive crypto contributions from existing holders, in exchange for shares that later trade at massive premiums on public markets. Skepticism around the sustainability of the crypto treasury trend is also growing. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms.

According to Cornerstone’s July 30 “Securities Class Action” report , the six cryptocurrency-related legal filings in the first half of 2025 targeted various industry participants. Three cases were directed at cryptocurrency issuers, while one targeted a digital asset mining operation. JUST IN: Crypto-related securities class-action lawsuits on pace to nearly double in 2025, nearing total for all of 2024, according to Cornerstone Research. — CryptoAlert (@SatoshiWatch) July 31, 2025 The remaining two lawsuits focused on what the research firm categorized as “cryptocurrency-adjacent entities”, companies involved in activities such as manufacturing mining equipmen t, attempting market entry into digital assets, or establishing partnerships with crypto firms. 114 Securities Lawsuits Filed As Crypto Leads Multi-Sector Legal Surge Notably, the law firm Burwick Law initiated three of the six crypto-related complaints filed this year, representing 50% of all such cases. Source: Cornerstone Research Among their high-profile actions were legal challenges against the meme coin platform Pump.fun and parties connected to the shady LIBRA memecoin project. The research shows that private investors continue pursuing civil remedies against cryptocurrency companies despite reduced enforcement activity from federal agencies, including the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , following policy shifts under the Trump administration. The cryptocurrency sector represents part of a larger securities litigation trend. During the first six months of 2025, plaintiffs filed 114 securities class-action lawsuits claiming financial damages across multiple sectors, including cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, COVID-19-related businesses, and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). This figure aligns closely with the historical six-month average of 113 cases and the 115 filings recorded in the second half of 2024. Source: Cornerstone Research Legal activity showed significant quarterly variation, with 67 cases filed in Q1 2025 compared to 47 in Q2 2025, indicating front-loaded litigation activity. Recent High-Profile Crypto Lawsuits The upward trajectory in crypto-related litigation has materialized through several significant cases targeting major industry players. In May, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase faced a shareholder class-action suit alleging the company failed to provide timely disclosure of a substantial data breach and regulatory compliance violation. The complaint asserts that investors experienced considerable financial harm due to these alleged disclosure failures. That same month, on May 19, MicroStrategy (now known as Strategy), a bitcoin treasury corporation, became the subject of class-action litigation over purportedly misleading communications regarding its bitcoin investment approach. The legal filing alleged that the company concealed associated investment risks, pointing to a $5.9 billion unrealized first-quarter loss that prompted an 8.67% decline in MSTR stock price, negatively impacting shareholder value Several ongoing legal disputes involve Burwick Law, the New York-based firm specializing in cryptocurrency investor advocacy. In February, the meme coin creation platform Pump.fun encountered legal challenges when Burwick Law , in partnership with Wolf Popper LLP, issued a cease and desist notice alleging unauthorized intellectual property usage and unregistered securities violations related to the Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) token. April saw Burwick Law questioning the business practices of NFT infrastructure platform Metaplex , characterizing the company’s activities as ethically problematic and potentially unlawful. The lawsuit targeted the primary protocol supporting Solana’s NFT ecosystem and alleged that Metaplex attempted to transfer over 54,000 unclaimed SOL tokens, valued at approximately $7.3 million , into its decentralized autonomous organization treasury.

The decision triggered a market selloff with the Dow falling over 300 points and cryptocurrency markets experiencing widespread declines before recovering key support levels. MAJOR BREAKING: Jerome Powell just announced that the Fed Reserve will maintain its benchmark interest rate at 4.25% to 4.5%, as it has done since Dec, citing economic uncertainty because of Trump's tariffs. This is a major defeat for Donald Trump. Damn. pic.twitter.com/4LBFtGd4sR — CALL TO ACTIVISM (@CalltoActivism) July 30, 2025 Rate Cut Expectations Collapse as Fed Maintains Hawkish Outlook Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference eliminated expectations for September rate cuts, causing market odds for zero 2025 rate cuts to surge from negligible to 25%. The probability of two cuts dropped from 40% to 33%, while single-cut odds rose from 24% to 27% according to Kalshi data. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Bitcoin briefly dipped below $116,000 during the announcement before rebounding above $118,000, while Ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies saw losses exceeding 2%. The volatility coincided with $4.1 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives expiring, amplifying the price swings. Notably, Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller voted against the decision, preferring a 25 basis point cut. Their dissent marked the first time two Fed members opposed the majority since 1993. Source: The Kobeissi Letter This resulted from the growing internal pressure for policy accommodation despite Powell’s hawkish stance. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone recently warned that Bitcoin may be approaching a “sell when they’re yelling” extreme , comparing current market euphoria to historical bubble peaks. McGlone, who accurately predicted Bitcoin’s $100,000 milestone years earlier, argued that gold’s outperformance since 2024 signals potential weakness ahead for speculative digital assets. The timing coincided with President Trump announcing additional tariffs during the Fed meeting, including 40% duties on Brazil and 50% tariffs on copper imports. ALL during the Fed interest rate decision just now: 1. Trump implements additional 40% tariff on Brazil 2. Trump imposes universal 50% tariffs on imports of semi-finished copper products 3. Trump imposes universal 50% tariffs on imports of copper-intensive derivative products… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 30, 2025 Trump’s simultaneous policy announcements, while calling for 300 basis points of rate cuts, created additional market uncertainty. Powell’s Hawkish Stance Sparks Political Backlash Powell’s press conference drew sharp criticism from market participants and political observers who accused the Fed chair of maintaining a politically motivated monetary policy. James Fishback, CEO of Azoria Capital, called the session “the most confusing, bizarre, and blatantly political Fed press conference” he had witnessed since 2011. I’ve watched every Fed press conference since they began in 2011. I spent a decade trading interest rate derivatives. Following the Fed was literally my full-time job. Yesterday was the most confusing, bizarre, and blatantly political Fed press conference I’ve ever seen. Jerome… — James Fishback (@j_fishback) July 31, 2025 Fishback argued that Powell was “moving the goalposts from meeting to meeting” despite lower-than-expected inflation data. The criticism intensified as housing affordability reached crisis levels, with mortgage rates remaining elevated due to the Fed’s restrictive policy stance. Senator Rand Paul criticized both Trump’s tariff policies and the Fed’s monetary approach, stating that “markets, not central planners, should set interest rates.” Paul pushed for legislation to audit and constrain Federal Reserve authority over rate-setting decisions. I supported the tax cuts & making them permanent. But let’s be clear: tariffs are taxes too. I want a smaller government, not one propped up by tariffs or a bloated Fed. Markets, not central planners, should set interest rates. That’s why I’m pushing legislation to rein in… pic.twitter.com/7b0Y4YyT1u — Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) July 30, 2025 The Fed’s statement cited “somewhat elevated” inflation and “solid” labor market conditions as justification for maintaining current policy. Powell emphasized that tariffs were “pushing up prices” in some goods categories while noting that “changes to government policy continue to evolve.” Powell refused to commit to September action when directly questioned about potential rate cuts, stating only that “we have made no decisions about September.” The comments immediately repriced market expectations and contributed to the broader risk-asset selloff. Crypto Markets Weather Fed Volatility as Bull Structure Remains Despite the initial selloff, cryptocurrency markets quickly recovered with Bitcoin defending the critical $118,000 level and the global crypto market cap stabilizing above $3.8 trillion. The Fear and Greed Index registered 62, indicating continued bullish sentiment despite increased caution. Speaking with Cryptonews, Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes, noted that while the Fed’s hawkish remarks caused “macro tremors,” the broader bullish market structure remained intact. “ We’re currently witnessing a recalibration phase that reveals why non-sovereign money is gaining strategic relevance as a hedge against macro uncertainty and not the end of the bull cycle. ” He emphasized that Bitcoin’s supply dynamics and institutional demand continue providing strong price support. Similarly, Shawn Young, Chief Analyst at MEXC Research, shared with Cryptonews that crypto traders experienced significant liquidation events as leveraged positions unwound following Powell’s comments. However, he observed that the aggressive buying at key support levels enabled swift recovery across major digital assets. “ The Fed’s decision to keep rates steady at 4.25% – 4.5% was broadly expected by most market participants ,” Young said. He added that, “ markets had partially priced in the probability of the macro easing era starting towards September, giving political pressure from the white house and recent soft PCE data prints, but FED Chair Powell’s continued hawkish policy tone reduced the probability of that happening now .” The crypto market’s resilience occurred amid ongoing institutional adoption, with recent ETF inflows maintaining momentum despite temporary slowdowns. Bitcoin ETFs now hold $153.19 billion in assets, while Ethereum ETFs manage $21.5 billion. McGlone’s warnings about speculative excess centered on gold’s superior performance since Bitcoin reached six-figure territory. He suggested that past patterns indicate the precious metal may continue outperforming “highly volatile and speculative cryptocurrency” in 2025, particularly if equity markets decline. Market participants now await crucial earnings reports from major technology companies representing 40% of the S&P 500 market capitalization. Disappointing results could pressure both traditional and digital assets, testing the crypto bull market’s durability against broader economic headwinds. For now, Young believed that “ the crypto bull cycle remains intact as long as BTC holds above $110,000, but its trajectory may become flatter and more rotational with altcoins and utility-driven tokens likely gaining more attention as investors seek to catch a bigger upside before the end of the current cycle. ” The post Federal Reserve Keeps Rates at 4.25%-4.5%, September Cut Odds Drop – Crypto Bull Run Over? appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|bull run|fed rate cut|Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-07-31 13:57:33

The message came from a man considering a modest investment: putting $300 into XRP at a current price of $3.15, with hopes that it might one day reach $10,000 . His reasoning? The upside is astronomical, the downside is tolerable, and the potential for retirement-level returns makes it a gamble worth taking. While some might scoff at such a bold prediction, the conversation touches on broader themes, the emotional psychology of investing, the role of long-term vision in emerging technologies, and the growing belief that XRP might play a foundational role in global finance. My dad's friend texted me this… pic.twitter.com/AKFd2VL6xx — Agent Chud (@AgentChud) July 31, 2025 The XRP Dream The man’s text reads: “If I buy $300 of XRP now at $3.15 and it goes to $10k, that’s one million dollars and retirement for me.” His approach reflects a common strategy among small investors, targeting high-potential assets early, risking minimal capital for potentially life-changing returns. He adds, “$300 isn’t a lot to lose, but if it goes to $10k, I can sell a third and hold the rest.” It’s a simple plan, but it relies on one big question: can XRP realistically reach $10,000? Is $10,000 XRP Plausible? The theory that XRP needs to reach $10,000 to fulfill its role as a global liquidity bridge has been echoed within XRP’s most enthusiastic circles. The logic stems from the belief that XRP, if adopted as a neutral bridge asset for central banks and high-value cross-border settlements, must be priced high enough to facilitate the movement of trillions in global liquidity without significant slippage. However, this claim is controversial. At $10,000 per coin, XRP’s total market capitalization would exceed $500 trillion , several times more than the combined value of all global assets. Critics argue that such a valuation is implausible under the current monetary system, unless drastic changes are made to the global financial architecture and XRP’s circulating supply is dramatically reduced. Nonetheless, others point out that price is not strictly about market cap, but about utility, liquidity velocity, and transaction volume. If XRP becomes integral to real-time settlement on a global scale, its price would likely need to reflect that utility, even if not reaching $10,000, potentially well beyond current levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current XRP Price and Market Data As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.10, with a market capitalization of approximately $183.9 billion, placing it as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value. The price has surged over the past weeks, driven by key developments including growing institutional partnerships, and the gradual resolution of the U.S. SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs. XRP’s daily trading volume remains strong, with increasing usage on Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Ripple’s efforts to tokenize real-world assets, including fiat-backed stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), are also adding fuel to XRP’s long-term use case as a neutral settlement layer. A Hopeful Gamble or a Pipe Dream? The question isn’t just whether XRP can hit $10,000, it’s whether belief in new financial infrastructure should be dismissed simply because it challenges legacy systems. For many small investors like Agent Chud’s dad’s friend, the investment isn’t just about math, but about vision. A $300 wager on a decentralized, globally adopted, real-time settlement asset might seem irrational today, until it isn’t. In the world of crypto, it’s not the price predictions that matter most, but the conviction behind the choices. Whether XRP hits $10 or $10,000, those who took the time to understand its utility may be the ones best positioned for whatever future unfolds.

Prediction market platform Kalshi has recently revealed a striking 29% probability that the U.S. Federal Reserve will implement zero Fed rate cuts this year. This unexpected forecast, reported by Walter Bloomberg and citing the insightful analysis of the Wall Street Journal’s Nick Timiraos, sends a clear signal: the anticipated path to lower interest rates is far from guaranteed, and its implications could ripple across all asset classes, including the volatile cryptocurrency market. For months, market participants largely priced in multiple interest rate reductions, anticipating a return to more accommodative monetary policy. However, Kalshi’s data, reflecting the collective wisdom of thousands of traders, challenges this consensus. This dramatic shift in sentiment is deeply rooted in persistent inflationary pressures that continue to vex policymakers and consumers alike. Understanding the nuances of this prediction and its potential ramifications is crucial for anyone navigating today’s complex financial landscape. Understanding the Kalshi Prediction: What Are the Odds of No Fed Rate Cuts? Kalshi is a U.S.-regulated prediction market where individuals can trade on the outcome of future events. Unlike traditional polls, prediction markets incentivize accurate forecasts by allowing participants to put real money on their beliefs. This mechanism often leads to more precise and forward-looking probabilities, as traders are motivated by financial gain to be right. The 29% figure for zero Fed rate cuts this year represents a significant increase from earlier projections. Just a few months ago, the market largely expected at least two or three rate cuts. This dramatic shift underscores a growing skepticism among informed traders about the Fed’s ability or willingness to ease monetary policy soon. Nick Timiraos, a respected voice on Fed policy, highlighted that core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation – the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation – looks no better, and by some measures even worse, than when the central bank first began considering rate adjustments last year. This stubborn inflation is the primary culprit behind the shifting sentiment regarding future Fed rate cuts . If the Fed maintains its current high interest rates throughout the year, it would signify a continued focus on combating inflation, even at the potential cost of slower economic growth. For investors, this means a prolonged period of higher borrowing costs, potentially impacting corporate earnings, consumer spending, and the attractiveness of riskier assets. Why Are Traders Doubting Fed Rate Cuts? The Persistent Inflation Conundrum The core of the market’s skepticism lies in the persistent inflation conundrum. While headline inflation figures have shown some moderation, core PCE inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, has proven remarkably sticky. This is crucial because core PCE is considered a better indicator of underlying inflationary trends and is the Fed’s go-to metric for guiding policy decisions. What makes this core inflation so stubborn? Several factors contribute: Services Inflation: A significant portion of current inflation is driven by services, less sensitive to interest rate hikes and slower to cool. Strong Labor Market: A robust job market, with low unemployment and rising wages, fuels consumer demand, sustaining inflationary pressures. Supply-Side Factors: Geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions can contribute to higher input costs, passed on to consumers. Fiscal Stimulus: Ongoing government spending can inject liquidity, potentially counteracting the Fed’s efforts to curb demand. The Federal Reserve operates under a dual mandate: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability (targeting 2% inflation). When inflation remains elevated, the Fed’s primary focus shifts to price stability, even if it means maintaining a restrictive monetary policy for longer. This commitment to bringing inflation down sustainably overrides the desire to cut rates and support economic growth. Consider the illustrative comparison below, highlighting the Fed’s challenge: Metric Early 2023 (Fed Rate Hike Start) Current (Q2 2024 – Illustrative) Fed Target / Healthy Range Core PCE Inflation (YoY) 4.7% 2.8% – 3.0% 2.0% Unemployment Rate 3.5% 3.9% – 4.0% ~4.0% (Natural Rate) Note: Figures are illustrative and designed to highlight the relative positions of key economic indicators. Actual real-time data may vary. The data suggests that while the labor market remains strong, underlying core inflation components are proving stubbornly resistant. This makes the prospect of aggressive Fed rate cuts increasingly unlikely in the near term, as the central bank prioritizes ensuring inflation is truly under control before loosening its grip. The Ripple Effect: How Persistent Uncertainty Over Fed Rate Cuts Impacts Crypto The cryptocurrency market, often seen as a barometer for risk appetite, is particularly sensitive to changes in monetary policy. A ‘higher for longer’ interest rate environment, implied by the reduced probability of Fed rate cuts , typically creates headwinds for risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Here’s why: Increased Cost of Capital: Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, reducing capital available for speculative investments, including cryptocurrencies. Opportunity Cost: Less risky investments like bonds become more attractive, diminishing the incentive to take on crypto volatility. Impact on Stablecoins and DeFi: While stablecoins maintain a peg, the broader DeFi ecosystem can be affected by higher real interest rates, impacting yields and liquidity. Reduced Liquidity: Tighter monetary policy generally leads to less overall liquidity, often translating to reduced trading volumes and increased volatility in crypto. Investor Sentiment: Macroeconomic uncertainty and the absence of anticipated rate cuts can dampen overall investor sentiment, leading to caution towards high-beta assets. Historically, periods of quantitative tightening and rising interest rates have often coincided with pullbacks or sideways movements in the crypto market. While crypto has unique drivers, its increasing integration into the broader financial system means it cannot remain entirely immune to global macroeconomic shifts. The prospect of zero Fed rate cuts this year suggests that the market may need to adjust to a new reality of higher capital costs and reduced speculative fervor for a prolonged period. Navigating the Waters: Strategies for Investors Amidst Fed Rate Cuts Speculation While the market grapples with the uncertainty surrounding Fed rate cuts , prudent investors can adopt several strategies to safeguard their portfolios and potentially capitalize on future opportunities. Adaptability and a well-informed approach are key in these dynamic times: Stay Informed and Agile: Continuously monitor economic data releases, Federal Reserve statements, and speeches. Be prepared to adjust your strategy as new information emerges. Embrace Diversification: A diversified portfolio across different asset classes (equities, fixed income, commodities, and various cryptocurrencies) can help mitigate risk. Within crypto, diversify across projects, sectors, and market capitalizations. Implement Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals. This helps smooth out the impact of market volatility by allowing you to buy more when prices are low, potentially lowering your average cost over time. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: Research crypto projects with strong use cases, robust technology, active development teams, and engaged communities. Projects solving real-world problems are more likely to weather downturns and thrive long-term, regardless of short-term Fed rate cuts speculation. Prioritize Risk Management: Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose. Set clear stop-loss orders, manage position sizes, and avoid over-leveraging. Understand that market volatility can be significant, and having a clear exit strategy is essential. Consider Stablecoin and Yield Opportunities: In a higher interest rate environment, stablecoins can offer a relatively safe haven, preserving capital while potentially earning yields in DeFi protocols. Always conduct thorough due diligence on platforms. By adopting these strategies, investors can build a more resilient portfolio, better equipped to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the evolving macroeconomic landscape and the ongoing debate surrounding Fed rate cuts . The Kalshi prediction of a 29% chance of zero Fed rate cuts this year underscores a critical shift in market expectations. With core PCE inflation proving stubbornly resilient, the Federal Reserve faces a delicate balancing act between achieving price stability and supporting economic growth. This ‘higher for longer’ scenario, if it materializes, will undoubtedly reshape investor strategies across traditional and digital asset markets. For investors, particularly in the dynamic crypto space, understanding these macro currents is paramount. The coming months will undoubtedly test the market’s resilience, demanding vigilance, adaptability, and strategic foresight. While the path ahead remains uncertain, staying informed and adopting a disciplined approach can help position portfolios for whatever economic climate the Fed’s decisions ultimately bring. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Kalshi and how reliable are its predictions? Kalshi is a U.S.-regulated prediction market where users can trade on the outcomes of future events. Its reliability stems from the fact that participants use real money, incentivizing accurate predictions. This collective wisdom often provides a dynamic and potentially more accurate forecast than traditional polling. Q2: What is Core PCE inflation and why is it important to the Fed? Core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) inflation measures the prices consumers pay for goods and services, excluding volatile food and energy components. It is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge because it provides a clearer picture of underlying inflationary trends and is considered a more stable indicator of long-term price pressures than the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Q3: How do interest rates affect the cryptocurrency market? Higher interest rates generally make traditional, less risky investments more attractive, increasing the opportunity cost of holding volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. They also increase borrowing costs, which can reduce liquidity and speculative investment in risk assets. Conversely, lower interest rates tend to make crypto more appealing. Q4: What does ‘higher for longer’ mean for the economy? ‘Higher for longer’ refers to the expectation that central banks, like the Federal Reserve, will maintain elevated interest rates for an extended period to combat persistent inflation. For the economy, it implies continued tighter financial conditions, potentially slower growth, and higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Q5: Should I adjust my crypto investment strategy based on this news? While this news highlights a significant macroeconomic factor, it’s essential not to make impulsive decisions. Instead, use this information to inform a more cautious and strategic approach. Consider diversifying your portfolio, employing dollar-cost averaging, focusing on projects with strong fundamentals, and practicing robust risk management. Always conduct your own research and consult with a financial advisor. Did you find this analysis helpful in understanding the potential impact of Fed rate cuts on your investments?

Following a sharp rebound from yesterday’s low of around $3,675, ETH is now trading above the $3,800 mark, regaining momentum as traders eye a decisive move. While short-term volatility remains, the overall structure favors continuation—provided ETH can break cleanly above the $4,000 resistance level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase Signals Market Sits Between Accumulation And Distribution This threshold now stands as the key barrier between consolidation and a potential rally toward new highs. A confirmed breakout would likely ignite fresh bullish momentum across the broader altcoin market. Until then, price remains trapped in a narrowing range, testing both trader patience and liquidity depth. Meanwhile, on-chain data supports the bullish case. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham, whales have ramped up their accumulation, with large addresses steadily adding to their ETH holdings in recent days. This ongoing accumulation trend reflects growing conviction among high-cap players and adds weight to the possibility of further upside in the months ahead. Whale Receives Ethereum From Galaxy OTC As Institutions Double Down Ethereum’s bullish narrative gained further momentum this week after Arkham disclosed a massive on-chain transaction involving a major institutional player. A fresh wallet address—0xdf0A67Ded855F8ea4baB6399690883243c0e2EF3—just received $153 million worth of ETH, purchased directly through Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter (OTC) desk. The scale and nature of this transaction suggest growing institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential. This isn’t just another whale move. The fact that the ETH was funneled into a new wallet from a regulated OTC provider underscores the strategic accumulation taking place behind the scenes. As traditional finance increasingly integrates with crypto, Ethereum’s utility, programmability, and future role in tokenized finance are making it a high-conviction play among institutional allocators. This heavy buy comes after a prolonged period of weakness. Earlier this year, ETH suffered persistent selling pressure, with price action sliding lower for months. Retail interest faded, and sentiment turned bearish. But while the public panicked, sophisticated players appear to have taken the other side of the trade—accumulating quietly during the downturn. Related Reading: BlackRock Goes Heavy on Ethereum: Buys 4x More ETH Than BTC ETH Consolidates Below Resistance Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade in a tight range just below the key resistance level of $3,860.80, as shown in the 4-hour chart. Despite recent price volatility, ETH has remained above its 50- and 100-period moving averages, currently near $3,756 and $3,629, respectively. This suggests that bullish momentum is still intact in the short term. Volume has picked up slightly, indicating rising interest from traders as ETH tests this critical horizontal resistance. The price has failed to close decisively above this level multiple times since July 25, highlighting its significance. However, the consistent higher lows forming over the past week point to building buying pressure beneath the surface. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Begin Distribution: Mirroring Fall 2024 Cycle A confirmed breakout above $3,860.80 could open the door for a push toward the psychological $4,000 level and beyond.

This marked a substantial 47.6% jump from June’s $388.9 million, though it remained below January’s peak of $678.9 million. Despite the surge in volume, the total number of transactions declined by 9%, falling from 5.5 million to 5 million. This shift was offset by a sharp rise in average sale value, which hit $113.08, the highest in half a year. At the same time, unique buyer participation dropped by 17% to 713,085, while unique sellers rose 9% to 405,505. This widening buyer-seller gap indicates a trend of market consolidation, with fewer buyers making larger acquisitions. Ethereum-Based NFTs See Strong Gains Amid ETH Rally Ethereum played a crucial role in the July NFT surge. ETH crossed $3,900 in late July — a 62% increase from its August 1 price of approximately $2,400 — and continues to trade above $3,800. This rally boosted valuations across Ethereum NFT collections. According to NFT Price Floor, all top 10 NFT collections by market cap over the past 30 days were Ethereum-based. CryptoPunks led with $69.2 million in total value traded, followed by Pudgy Penguins at $55.5 million. Polygon’s Courtyard NFTs secured the third spot with $23.8 million in volume. Pudgy Penguins emerged as the growth leader, posting a 65.44% increase in floor price — outperforming other leading collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC). Overall, Ethereum accounted for $275.6 million in NFT sales in July, reflecting a 56% month-over-month increase. Bitcoin and Polygon followed, recording $74.3 million and $71.6 million, respectively. Blockchain Performance Diverges as Buyers Consolidate While Ethereum based NFTs soared, other blockchains showed mixed performance. Cardano posted the highest growth in percentage terms, with sales jumping by 102%. Solana, on the other hand, reported an 8% uptick — a modest rise in comparison. Polygon and BNB Chain saw significant downturns. Polygon’s NFT sales volume dropped 51.1% from the previous month, while BNB Chain recorded a 54% decrease. Despite the retreat in transaction counts and buyer numbers, the rising sale values and dominance of blue-chip collections indicate the market’s focus is shifting from quantity to quality, as higher-value NFTs draw in more serious capital.

Today, the global crypto market is at $3.31 trillion. Of this, Bitcoin controls $2.14 trillion, amounting to over 65% dominance. Meanwhile, XRP has a market cap of $129 billion, giving it a 3.93% share.While conservative compared to Bitcoin, this approximate 4% dominance could translate into a dramatic outcome for XRP if the global crypto market grows to $50 trillion and XRP maintains its share.XRP Price in a $50 Trillion Crypto MarketAs of today, XRP is trading at $3.14, with a circulating supply of 59 billion tokens, resulting in a market cap of approximately $130 billion. Notably, if the global crypto market valuation were to hit $50 trillion, and XRP maintained its 4% share, its market cap would rise to approximately $2 trillion.Relative to its circulating supply, this would imply a token price of $33.27. Essentially, if the global crypto market reaches $50 trillion and XRP holds its current market share, each XRP token could be worth around $33.Given XRP's current price of $3.14, reaching the $33 mark would represent a surge of 1,412% for holders, a 15x increase. In perspective, someone holding over 30,000 XRP tokens, worth about $66,000 today, would see their holdings grow to over $1 million.A $50 trillion crypto market would, in essence, significantly benefit prominent altcoins like XRP.When Can the Crypto Market Reach $50 Trillion?However, the big question is whether the global crypto market can reach a $50 trillion valuation and how long that might take.For context, if the total crypto market reaches $50 trillion, Bitcoin would likely account for over $32 trillion of that, based on its traditional 60%+ dominance. Given its supply, this would mean a Bitcoin price of over $1.6 million per BTC.Several forecasts have predicted that Bitcoin will surpass $1 million, including those from industry leaders such as Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, Eric Trump, and Michael Saylor.Hoskinson believes Bitcoin could pass $1 million by the end of this decade. Meanwhile, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has argued that BTC could be worth at least $1 million by 2030. Telgaon analysts have projected that Bitcoin could exceed $1.5 million by 2035.Essentially, industry experts foresee Bitcoin crossing the $1 million mark within the next decade. This helps put the possibility of a $50 trillion crypto market into perspective.In other words, XRP may be looking at a $2 trillion market cap and a $33 price beyond this decade, assuming it maintains its current market position without a significant increase in dominance.Could XRP Surpass $2 Trillion Before the 2030s?However, this projected timeline doesn’t align with the expectations of many XRP holders.

Whether you're betting on MLB, NPB, KBO, or international matchups, Bitcoin sportsbooks now offer unmatched flexibility—no KYC, no banks, and no waiting. How Baseball Betting Works Baseball offers some of the most statistically rich and versatile betting markets in sports. Bettors can wager on: Moneyline: Picking which team will win the game outright Runline: Similar to point spreads—typically +/- 1.5 runs Totals (Over/Under): Betting on total combined runs scored Player Props: Wagers on individual performance (strikeouts, home runs, hits) Inning Bets: Betting on the outcome of specific innings Live/In-Play Markets: Dynamic odds on pitch-by-pitch outcomes, scoring plays, and comeback potential With multiple games daily, a long season, and rich data sets, baseball is perfect for live betting and crypto parlays—especially when using BTC for fast, borderless access. Popular Baseball Leagues to Bet On While Major League Baseball (MLB) remains the most bet-on baseball league globally, other leagues offer strong action and value: MLB (USA): The gold standard, with 2,430+ games per season NPB (Japan): High-level play and loyal fanbase—great for overnight value bets KBO (Korea): Known for offense-heavy games and emerging talent Winter Leagues (Latin America): Shorter seasons but big opportunities, especially in off-season months Crypto sportsbooks now offer full coverage across these leagues, including regular season, playoffs, World Series, and special tournaments. Baseball Betting Strategies Pitching Analysis: Starters and bullpens heavily influence outcomes—study ERA, WHIP, and recent performance Home/Away Splits: Some teams perform drastically better at home Underdog Runline Value: Backing underdogs +1.5 runs often provides better ROI Weather/Field Conditions: Wind, humidity, and altitude can affect scoring (especially for totals bets) Fade Public Trends: Market overreactions to star players or previous big wins can create value Crypto sportsbooks like Dexsport and Stake.com offer live stats, odds movement tracking, and data-rich interfaces that let sharp bettors act fast and intelligently.

This announcement pushed its stock price about 19% higher in pre-market trades. Roblox offers its library of games at no cost and is accessible on a wide range of devices, attracting a diverse audience across smartphones, tablets, and PCs. During the three months ending June 30, daily active users averaged 111.8 million, representing a 41% year-over-year rise. Engagement surged 58%, with total playtime hitting 27.4 billion hours as reported by Reuters . A significant portion of this boost traced back to “Grow a Garden,” a tycoon-style title where users expand their land by trading seeds and plants. That month, it hit a new benchmark for simultaneous players on a single online title. According to statements from the newly appointed CFO, Naveen Chopra, the company has refined its discovery and search capabilities to amplify exposure for high-performing games. Facing economic headwinds, Roblox is expanding into new monetization avenues outside gaming, introducing social gathering spaces, e-commerce options, and ad placements, a strategy that has won investor approval. Roblox stock has gained over 100% year-to-date in 2025 Year-to-date, the company’s share price has surged by more than 100%, significantly outstripping peers in the gaming sector. For its fiscal year 2025, the firm anticipates total bookings in a range of $5.87 billion to $5.97 billion, marking an increase over the prior estimate of $5.29–$5.36 billion. Moreover, it foresees Q3 bookings hitting between $1.59 billion and $1.64 billion, surpassing the $1.35 billion consensus forecast. During the June quarter, bookings came in at $1.44 billion, outpacing the $1.24 billion market expectation. Earlier Cryptopolitan reported about a 19-year-old creator who offloaded a soccer-themed title on the Roblox marketplace in excess of $3 million just months after its debut. He and his collaborators invested roughly three months in development, and after launching last year, the game attracted peaks of over one million concurrent users and delivered approximately $5 million in monthly in-game revenue. The acquisition was made by Do Big Studios, which holds multiple popular Roblox franchises. Originally launched around two decades ago as a sandbox for straightforward, blocky creations, Roblox has since transformed into a commercial hub where designers can monetize their titles for mid-seven-figure to low-eight-figure sums, serving nearly 100 million daily users. “We’ve seen a real shift in Roblox’s ecosystem,” said David Taylor of analytics firm Naavik, noting that seven of the 15 highest-earning games on the platform were bought from their original developers in June. Roblox allows age verification to build trust in chat features In June, Roblox began offering a new age-verification system for players who wish to chat more openly through its “trusted connections” feature. Roblox’s chief safety officer, Matt Kaufman, said the company chose now to add age-checking tools because it plans to unlock certain chat functions only for users aged 13 and older. “We believe these features should be limited to an older audience, 13 and over,” Kaufman explained. The age checks are powered by Persona, a firm that specializes in identity verification. Players who opt in will have their age estimated before gaining access to the expanded chat options. Roblox’s move comes as several states, including Utah, have passed laws requiring app stores to confirm the ages of their customers. These rules affect major platforms like Apple’s App Store and Google Play. Meanwhile, social media giants such as Meta, X and Snap argue that app-store operators should handle age checks. Apple and Google have publicly pushed back on that idea, saying it should be up to individual apps to handle user verification. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Today, the news from traditional financial arenas is buzzing with positive sentiment: U.S. stock markets have opened notably higher. For many, this signals a potential shift in investor confidence and a broader sense of optimism. But what does this US Stock Market Rebound truly signify, especially for those navigating the often-volatile waters of cryptocurrency? Understanding the Current US Stock Market Rebound The latest figures from the U.S. stock exchanges paint a clear picture of an encouraging start to the trading day. Major indices are showing significant gains, reflecting a collective upward momentum: S&P500: +0.82% – This broad market index, often considered a benchmark for the health of the U.S. economy, shows a solid uptick. NASDAQ: +1.55% – Dominated by technology and growth stocks, NASDAQ’s strong performance suggests renewed investor appetite for higher-risk, higher-reward assets. Dow: +0.17% – The Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 large U.S. companies, also contributes to the positive sentiment, albeit with a more modest gain. This widespread positive movement across different sectors of the U.S. stock market is more than just a number; it reflects a confluence of factors that could be driving this newfound optimism. From improving economic data to corporate earnings surprises, or even shifts in monetary policy expectations, a positive opening often signals underlying strength or a belief in future growth. Why Does Traditional Market Performance Matter for Crypto? It’s a common misconception that cryptocurrency markets operate in a vacuum, entirely detached from traditional financial systems. In reality, the interconnectedness is undeniable. The US Stock Market Rebound , while seemingly unrelated to digital assets, can have profound ripple effects. Here’s why: Investor Sentiment: The Universal Driver At its core, both traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies are driven by investor sentiment. When confidence is high in the broader market, investors are generally more willing to take on risk. A positive outlook in the stock market can translate into a ‘risk-on’ environment, where investors are more inclined to allocate capital to assets perceived as higher-risk, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a ‘risk-off’ environment, often triggered by stock market downturns, typically sees investors pulling back from speculative assets. Liquidity Flows and Capital Allocation A rising stock market can create wealth effects, freeing up capital for diversification into other asset classes. Institutional investors, who increasingly hold significant crypto portfolios, often rebalance their allocations based on their performance in traditional markets. If their stock portfolios are performing well, they might be more inclined to maintain or even increase their exposure to digital assets, viewing them as part of a diversified growth strategy. Macroeconomic Indicators and Their Broad Impact The factors influencing the US Stock Market Rebound – such as inflation data, interest rate expectations, employment figures, and geopolitical stability – are the same macroeconomic forces that influence the crypto market. For instance, if the stock market is rising due to expectations of lower inflation or a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve, these same expectations often fuel optimism in the crypto space, particularly for assets like Bitcoin, which are sometimes seen as inflation hedges or ‘digital gold’. Historical Correlations: A Look Back While crypto markets are still relatively nascent compared to traditional equities, historical data has shown periods of significant correlation. During times of market uncertainty, both traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies often move in tandem, reflecting a unified response to global economic shifts. For example, during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, both markets experienced sharp declines. Similarly, periods of economic recovery often see both asset classes regain ground. However, it’s crucial to note that this correlation is not always consistent. Crypto markets can also decouple from traditional markets, driven by unique catalysts such as technological advancements, regulatory news, or specific blockchain developments. Understanding this nuanced relationship is key for any investor. What Does This US Stock Market Rebound Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, the positive momentum in the U.S. stock market offers a mixed bag of opportunities and considerations: Potential Benefits: Increased Investor Confidence: A bullish stock market often translates to higher risk appetite, potentially drawing new capital into the crypto space. Improved Liquidity: With more capital flowing into financial markets generally, there could be greater liquidity for crypto assets, potentially leading to smoother trading and price discovery. Positive Spillover Effect: Certain crypto projects or tokens that are closely tied to real-world applications or traditional finance (e.g., DeFi protocols, tokenized assets) might benefit directly from a robust economic environment. Challenges and Considerations: Not a Guarantee: While correlations exist, a stock market rally does not guarantee a crypto rally. Crypto markets have their own unique dynamics. Volatility Remains: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Even with positive traditional market sentiment, sudden price swings are always a possibility due to crypto-specific news or market manipulations. Focus on Fundamentals: It’s easy to get swept up in broad market optimism. However, for crypto investors, focusing on the fundamentals of individual projects – their technology, adoption, team, and use cases – remains paramount. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the current market landscape, what steps can crypto investors take to navigate these interconnected dynamics effectively? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye not only on crypto news but also on major macroeconomic indicators and traditional market performance. Understanding the broader financial environment provides crucial context. Diversify Wisely: While a US Stock Market Rebound might inspire confidence, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes and within the crypto space (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins, stablecoins) can help mitigate risk. Define Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much risk you are comfortable taking. A rising tide lifts all boats, but also exposes them to larger waves. Adjust your investment strategy accordingly. Long-Term Vision: For many, cryptocurrency is a long-term investment. Short-term fluctuations, whether influenced by stock markets or internal crypto dynamics, should be viewed within the context of your overall investment horizon. Concluding Thoughts: A Cautious Optimism The positive opening of U.S. stock markets is undoubtedly a welcome sign, reflecting a surge in investor confidence and potentially signaling a broader economic recovery. For the cryptocurrency market, this US Stock Market Rebound can serve as a tailwind, fostering a ‘risk-on’ environment that might encourage capital flow into digital assets. However, it is crucial to approach this optimism with a degree of caution. The crypto market retains its unique characteristics and vulnerabilities, and while traditional market performance offers valuable insights, it does not dictate the entirety of the crypto narrative. Savvy investors will use this information to inform their strategies, remaining agile and well-informed in a world where financial markets are more interconnected than ever before. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How closely do crypto markets track the US Stock Market Rebound? A1: The correlation between crypto and traditional stock markets, particularly the S&P500 and NASDAQ, has varied over time. While there are periods of strong correlation, especially during significant macroeconomic events, crypto can also exhibit independent movements driven by its unique catalysts like technological advancements or regulatory news. Q2: Does a positive stock market always mean a positive crypto market? A2: Not always. While a positive stock market often indicates a ‘risk-on’ environment that can benefit crypto, it’s not a direct causation. Crypto markets are influenced by a multitude of factors, including adoption rates, regulatory developments, technological breakthroughs, and even sentiment within the crypto community itself. Q3: What specific US stock market indicators should crypto investors watch? A3: Crypto investors should pay attention to the S&P500 and NASDAQ, as these often reflect broader investor sentiment towards growth and technology assets. Additionally, macroeconomic indicators like inflation rates, interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve, and employment data can provide insights into the overall financial environment affecting both markets. Q4: Should I invest more in crypto when the stock market is rising? A4: A rising stock market can create a more favorable environment for crypto investments due to increased investor confidence. However, investment decisions should always be based on your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and thorough research into specific crypto projects. Diversification and a long-term perspective are generally recommended. Q5: Can the crypto market rebound even if the stock market is down? A5: Yes, it’s possible. While traditional market downturns can create a ‘risk-off’ sentiment that affects crypto, the crypto market can also rebound independently. This might happen due to significant positive news within the crypto ecosystem (e.g., a major technological upgrade, new institutional adoption, favorable regulatory clarity), or if crypto is increasingly viewed as a safe haven asset during certain traditional market crises.

Analyst Explains Why This Could happen,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/31/eth-going-to-usd16k-in-this-cycle-analyst-explains-why-this-could-happen,"Ether (ETH) hovered near $3,800 on Thursday as increasingly bullish price targets circulated on crypto social media, including one analyst who outlined a case for $16,000 based on long-term technical setups and sustained institutional inflows. ""Edward"", a popular chart analyst on X, argued in a Thursday post that a five-digit ether price is now within reach, pointing to a “clean ascending triangle” formation on the monthly ETH chart. This structure, commonly seen as a pre-breakout pattern, mirrors technical conditions observed in 2020 — just before ether embarked on a 2,000% rally. In Edward’s view, a decisive breakout above $4,000 could trigger a similar move, with the triangle’s projected vertical range implying potential upside toward the $15,000–$16,000 zone. “The structure is there. Demand is rising. Supply is capped,” he wrote, noting that momentum and fundamentals appear to be aligning for the first time in years. He pointed to three main drivers fueling the outlook: accumulation by institutions, the continued success of ether ETFs, and the cryptocurrency’s emerging role as financial infrastructure. According to Edward, volatility in ETH has dropped even as inflows rise—evidence that long-term investors are quietly building positions. “This is not retail-driven mania; it’s long-tail institutional buildup. Quiet, sustained, and methodical,” he said. Edward also cited a surge in spot ETH ETF flows, now totaling over $5.3 billion across 18 consecutive trading days since early July. With ether issuance capped at under 1 million tokens annually and corporate treasuries also accumulating, he warned of a looming supply squeeze. Finally, Edward emphasized that Ethereum’s function as programmable collateral—enabled by restaking, Layer 2s, and real-world asset integrations — has positioned ether as part of the “financial core” of a multi-chain economy. “Price targets like $15K are based on a changing macro role,” he noted. Some analysts caution that ether may encounter resistance before any long-term breakout can take hold. Michaël van de Poppe noted that volatility has sharply declined in recent sessions, a pattern that often precedes local tops. He suggested ether could face short-term resistance near the $4,000 level before entering a modest corrective phase. However, he framed such a pullback as a healthy pause in what he believes is the start of a broader altcoin bull cycle that could unfold over the next 12 to 24 months. At the time of writing, ether is trading at around $3,800, up 1.01% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Data. Technical Analysis Highlights According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, ETH gained 1.01% in the 24-hour period ending July 31 at 12:00 UTC, rising from $3,762.87 to $3,800.85. The trading range stretched 4.87%, from an intraday low of $3,693.42 to a high of $3,873.39. A sharp V-shaped recovery followed a high-volume dip to $3,685.69 during the 18:00–19:00 UTC window, signaling institutional buying. ETH closed the day near $3,800, with volume-supported bounces suggesting accumulation at $3,825. Final hour trading (11:36–12:35 UTC) showed disciplined consolidation, with price action contained between $3,825.22 and $3,842.71.

Bitcoin’s rise today can be the outcome of a confluence of catalysts: Sustained ETF inflows creating structural demand Tether-fueled liquidity providing market momentum Macro tailwinds from a weakening dollar and dovish Fed outlook Corporate adoption cementing Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset Improved market structure reducing fragility during large trades This article dissects the primary drivers fueling Bitcoin’s rally and examines their broader implications for the market. 1. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Fuel Institutional Demand One of the clearest contributors to today’s price action is sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Led by asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, these ETFs continue to attract institutional capital, creating a steady, non-speculative demand for Bitcoin. According to data from CoinGlass, net weekly inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have averaged over $1.2 billion in July, and this consistent buying pressure is gradually tightening supply on centralized exchanges. Source: Coinglass The ETF mechanism also enables traditional investors—particularly pension funds and endowments—to gain exposure to Bitcoin without custody risk, amplifying adoption. 2. Surge in Stablecoin Liquidity from Tether (USDT) Another significant factor is the aggressive expansion of stablecoin supply, particularly from Tether (USDT). Over the last month, Tether has minted over $8 billion in new USDT, including $1 billion in the past 24 hours alone. This injection of liquidity provides traders with immediate firepower to acquire risk assets like BTC. Stablecoin issuance often acts as a leading indicator for crypto market rallies. The market interprets it as a sign of rising demand and capital allocation, particularly from Asian and OTC markets where USDT is widely used. In this context, Tether’s actions have created a liquidity tailwind that supports not just Bitcoin, but the broader digital asset ecosystem. 3. Macro Environment: Dollar Weakness and Risk-On Sentiment On the macro front, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) has declined nearly 11% over the last six months, a development that traditionally correlates with rising demand for alternative stores of value—including gold and Bitcoin. This decline stems from expectations of a Federal Reserve policy shift, with markets increasingly pricing in potential rate cuts in Q4 2025. The resulting dovish sentiment has triggered a renewed appetite for risk assets, benefiting equities, crypto, and commodities alike. 4. Corporate Treasury Adoption Accelerates Corporate adoption is another supportive pillar. In 2025 alone, over 90 publicly listed companies have announced crypto-related treasury strategies. This includes both direct Bitcoin purchases and hedging strategies via BTC derivatives. MicroStrategy’s influence remains dominant, but newer entrants from sectors like biotech, gaming, and renewable energy are increasing. As a result, corporate demand is no longer episodic—it is institutionalizing. These entities are less sensitive to price volatility and tend to hold BTC long-term, contributing to supply absorption and price stability. 5. Market Structure: Resilience to Large Sell Orders Last week, the market witnessed a stress test of liquidity and depth when Galaxy Digital facilitated a $9 billion Bitcoin transaction from a sovereign fund. The trade was executed over-the-counter and distributed across multiple venues—without triggering a major price correction. This event showcases a more mature market structure capable of digesting whale-sized orders without cascading liquidations. It signals that Bitcoin has reached a new level of institutional robustness, further reducing perceived tail risk. 6. Narrative, Perception, and the Role of Strategic Communication While liquidity and macro factors move charts, perception shapes momentum. And in today’s media-saturated environment, how a story is told often matters as much as the fundamentals behind it. This is where communication strategy intersects with market structure—and why players like Outset PR are increasingly central to high-growth crypto brands. Spotlight: Outset PR Builds Stories that Match Market Signals Founded by crypto PR expert Mike Ermolaev , Outset PR operates like a hands-on communications workshop rather than a generic press release mill.

Notable Results: Step App saw a 138% FITFI token price increase during the campaign Choise.ai's CHO token surged 28.5x following a narrative-driven positioning strategy ChangeNOW grew its customer base by 40% via targeted media exposure StealthEX secured 26 media features and over 3.6 billion estimated impressions By aligning messaging with market momentum, Outset PR turns communications into a measurable growth lever. For startups and scale-ups alike, it’s like plugging a newsroom, strategist, and growth hacker into your team—all at once. Conclusion The current BTC rally is built on strong foundations: institutional inflows, stablecoin-driven liquidity, macro tailwinds, and a structurally improved trading environment. But what ties it all together is perception—and how that perception is crafted, packaged, and distributed. As the crypto space matures, narrative becomes infrastructure. And with agencies like Outset PR delivering stories that resonate with both media and markets, the industry is discovering that effective communication is critical.

Wall Street asset manager Bernstein, a name synonymous with insightful financial analysis, has delivered a compelling forecast that’s sending ripples of excitement through the industry. They believe the current crypto bull market is still in its nascent stages, poised for explosive growth, and have pinpointed two major players — Robinhood and Coinbase — as prime beneficiaries of this unfolding phenomenon. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a strategic outlook from a reputable firm, suggesting a significant shift in how traditional finance views the burgeoning crypto economy. Bernstein’s Bullish Stance: What Fuels Their Confidence in the Crypto Bull Market ? When a prominent institution like Bernstein reiterates an “outperform” rating for key crypto-centric companies, the market takes notice. Their assessment isn’t merely optimistic; it’s grounded in observable trends and future projections for the crypto bull market . Bernstein’s analysis suggests that the current upswing is far from over, with substantial room for expansion driven by increasing trading volumes and broader adoption. Early Stages: This indicates that the market has not yet reached its peak, implying sustained growth potential. It’s an invitation to consider the long-term trajectory rather than just short-term fluctuations. Rising Volumes: As more individuals and institutions engage with cryptocurrencies, trading activity naturally increases, benefiting platforms that facilitate these transactions. Broader Adoption: The gradual integration of crypto into mainstream financial systems and everyday use cases is a powerful catalyst for growth. Reiterated Ratings: Repeating an “outperform” rating underscores a strong conviction in the continued positive performance of these companies within the prevailing crypto bull market . For Coinbase, Bernstein has set an ambitious price target of $510, a testament to their belief in the platform’s pivotal role in the ongoing digital asset revolution. This isn’t just a number; it reflects confidence in Coinbase’s infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and strategic positioning to capture a significant share of the market’s growth. Robinhood’s Resurgence: Riding the Wave of Crypto Bull Market Momentum Remember Robinhood, the platform that democratized trading for a new generation of investors? While often associated with meme stocks, Robinhood has quietly been strengthening its position in the crypto realm, and the results are speaking volumes. The firm reported a staggering 46% surge in its Q2 revenue year-over-year. This impressive growth isn’t accidental; it’s a direct reflection of increased user engagement and trading activity, particularly within the crypto sector. Robinhood’s user-friendly interface and commission-free trading model make it an attractive entry point for retail investors eager to participate in the crypto bull market . As crypto assets gain popularity and prices rise, more users flock to platforms like Robinhood, generating revenue through transaction volumes and other services. This synergy between a growing market and an accessible platform positions Robinhood to capture a significant portion of the retail investor influx, making it a key player in broadening crypto’s reach. Coinbase’s Strategic Edge: Deepening Ties and Driving Adoption in the Crypto Bull Market Coinbase stands as a titan in the cryptocurrency exchange landscape, renowned for its regulatory compliance and institutional-grade services. Bernstein’s optimistic outlook for Coinbase is bolstered by a critical development: the strengthening of its ties with JPMorgan. This collaboration is far more than just a business deal; it’s a powerful symbol of the increasing legitimization and integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional finance. Why is the JPMorgan connection such a big deal for the crypto bull market ? Institutional Trust: JPMorgan is a global financial powerhouse. Its deeper engagement with Coinbase signals a growing acceptance of digital assets among major financial institutions, potentially paving the way for more institutional capital to flow into the crypto space. Enhanced Liquidity: Such partnerships can lead to improved liquidity and efficiency in crypto markets, making it easier for large players to execute trades without significant price impact. Regulatory Confidence: Coinbase’s commitment to working within established financial frameworks makes it a trusted partner for traditional firms, reducing perceived risks and encouraging broader participation. Broader Access: These collaborations can open doors for a wider range of institutional clients to access crypto services, further accelerating adoption. Bernstein views this as a major boost for crypto adoption overall, validating Coinbase’s strategy of building bridges between the nascent crypto world and the established financial system. With its robust infrastructure and focus on security, Coinbase is not just participating in the crypto bull market ; it’s actively shaping its future. Why This Matters: The Broader Implications for the Global Crypto Bull Market The insights from Bernstein regarding Robinhood and Coinbase are not isolated observations; they reflect a broader narrative unfolding in the global financial landscape. The continued growth in trading volumes and the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by both retail and institutional players signal a maturing market. This isn’t just about price appreciation; it’s about the fundamental shift in how value is exchanged and stored in the digital age. The current crypto bull market is characterized by: Mainstream Acceptance: Cryptocurrencies are moving beyond niche investment and gaining acceptance as legitimate assets and payment methods. Innovation Acceleration: The bull market fuels further development in blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 applications. Regulatory Clarity (Emerging): Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are working towards establishing clearer frameworks, which can reduce uncertainty and attract more investment. Diversification Opportunities: For investors, crypto offers new avenues for portfolio diversification, distinct from traditional asset classes. This evolving ecosystem suggests that the impact of the crypto bull market extends far beyond just investment returns, promising a transformative effect on global finance and technology. Navigating the Excitement: What Are the Benefits and Challenges in a Crypto Bull Market ? While the prospect of a prolonged crypto bull market is exhilarating, it’s crucial to approach it with a balanced perspective, understanding both the immense benefits and the inherent challenges. Knowledge is power, especially in volatile markets. Benefits: Wealth Creation: Significant price appreciation can lead to substantial gains for early investors and those holding strong projects. Technological Advancement: Bull markets often fund innovation, leading to more robust and scalable blockchain solutions. Increased Liquidity: Higher trading volumes mean easier buying and selling of assets. Mainstream Awareness: Greater media attention and public discourse can lead to broader understanding and acceptance of crypto. Challenges: Volatility: Even in a bull market, sharp corrections and significant price swings are common. Over-exuberance and Bubbles: Intense optimism can sometimes lead to irrational exuberance, inflating asset prices beyond their fundamental value. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape can introduce sudden changes that impact the market. Security Risks: Increased activity can also attract more bad actors, necessitating vigilance against scams and hacks. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Given Bernstein’s optimistic outlook and the unfolding crypto bull market , what can you do to navigate this exciting period? While this article does not constitute financial advice, here are some general insights to consider: Do Your Research (DYOR): Understand the fundamentals of any cryptocurrency or platform before investing. Don’t just follow the hype. Diversify: Spread your investments across different assets to mitigate risk. Long-Term Vision: Consider a long-term holding strategy, as crypto markets can be highly volatile in the short term. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements.

The code, drafted by 13 independent contributors, is voluntary, but it provides legal clarity to companies that adopt it as they prepare for the full enforcement of the EU’s AI Act. xAI and other tech firms have mixed feelings about the code In a post on X , xAI acknowledged that while the AI Act and Code promote safety, other parts are profoundly detrimental to innovation, and its copyright provisions are clearly overreaching. The company, however, confirmed it will sign the safety and security chapter. “xAI supports AI safety and will be signing the EU AI Act’s Code of Practice Chapter on Safety and Security.” ~ xAI. The company did not say whether it intends to adopt the other two sections, transparency and copyright, of the code, both of which will apply to general-purpose AI providers under the upcoming regulation. xAI’s stance adds to a growing divide among major AI developers over how to respond to the EU’s framework. Google , part of Alphabet, has committed to signing the full code of practice, despite expressing serious reservations about aspects of the rules. “We remain concerned that the AI Act and Code risk slowing Europe’s development and deployment of AI,” said Kent Walker, Google’s President of Global Affairs, in a blog post. But he added that recent changes to the code had improved it, and said Google would move ahead with signing. In contrast, Meta has refused to sign . The Facebook parent says the code creates legal uncertainty and includes measures that extend far beyond what the AI Act requires. The tech giant warned the framework could deter companies from developing foundational AI systems in Europe, describing the EU’s direction as “the wrong path on AI.” Microsoft and OpenAI have not confirmed whether they will sign the code. The EU is preparing the tech industry for AI Act enforcement The EU’s AI code of practice is designed as a transitional tool, helping companies align with forthcoming AI laws due to come into force for high-impact models on 2 August. These rules target developers of so-called systemic risk AI models, such as those built by Google, Meta, Anthropic, and OpenAI. Although not legally binding, the code outlines expectations around documentation, content sourcing, and responding to copyright claims. Firms that sign up are likely to benefit from smoother regulatory engagement and fewer legal uncertainties. The broader EU AI Act, a sweeping piece of legislation, seeks to regulate AI based on risk levels. It bans certain uses outright, such as manipulative systems or social scoring, while imposing strict requirements on “high-risk” uses in fields like education, employment, and biometrics. Developers of advanced models will need to carry out risk assessments, maintain transparency records, and comply with strict quality standards. Those who fall short could face fines of up to 7% of their global annual turnover. The differing reactions from AI leaders suggest a rift is growing in how tech firms view regulation in the EU. While some, like Google, are opting for strategic engagement, others such as Meta are pushing back, fearing the rules will stifle innovation . xAI’s decision to selectively support parts of the code may represent a middle ground, acknowledging the importance of AI safety while resisting what it sees as overregulation. As the EU presses ahead with its regulatory agenda, more tech companies will have to make a choice – cooperate early, or risk conflict later. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The company’s board has officially approved the adoption of a Bitcoin strategy , designating Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. This decision begins with an initial allocation of $5 million, setting a precedent for how traditional industries might integrate digital assets into their core financial planning. For those keenly observing the intersection of established markets and the burgeoning cryptocurrency space, this development offers a compelling case study. Why Are Companies Adopting a Bitcoin Strategy for Their Treasuries? The decision by Robin Energy to embrace a Bitcoin strategy is not an isolated incident but rather part of a growing movement among forward-thinking corporations. In an economic landscape marked by inflation concerns, fluctuating interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainties, companies are seeking alternative ways to preserve and potentially grow their capital. Here are some key reasons why Bitcoin is becoming an attractive option for corporate treasuries: Inflation Hedge: With its capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be devalued through quantitative easing, Bitcoin’s scarcity model offers a potential store of value. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a treasury diversifies the company’s asset holdings beyond traditional cash and fixed-income instruments, which may yield low returns in the current environment. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth, offering the potential for substantial capital appreciation that traditional assets might not provide. Technological Advancement: Investing in Bitcoin aligns companies with emerging technologies and the digital economy, potentially enhancing their brand image as innovative and future-oriented. Pioneering companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted a substantial Bitcoin strategy , demonstrating conviction in its long-term value. While each company’s circumstances differ, the underlying rationale often revolves around strategic asset management in a rapidly evolving global economy. Robin Energy’s Specific Bitcoin Strategy: A Prudent and Phased Approach Robin Energy’s approach to integrating Bitcoin into its treasury is particularly noteworthy for its prudence and discipline. According to the Globe Newswire press release, the company’s plan is not a one-off speculative purchase but a carefully considered, long-term commitment: Initial Allocation: The company is starting with a $5 million purchase, a significant yet manageable sum for an initial foray into digital assets. This allows them to gain experience and understand market dynamics before larger commitments. Gradual Expansion: Robin Energy plans to gradually allocate up to 50% of its long-term cash reserves to Bitcoin. This phased approach mitigates risk and allows for flexibility based on market conditions and internal assessments. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): A key element of their Bitcoin strategy is the use of a disciplined dollar-cost averaging approach. DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy helps reduce the impact of market volatility by averaging out the purchase price over time, minimizing the risk of buying at a market peak. Funding from Existing Cash Reserves: Crucially, the entire allocation will be funded from existing cash reserves, meaning the company will not incur new debt or dilute shareholder equity to finance this move. This demonstrates a strong financial position and a responsible approach to treasury management. This systematic and cautious strategy highlights Robin Energy’s commitment to responsible financial stewardship while embracing innovative asset management techniques. What Does This Bitcoin Strategy Mean for the Energy Sector and Beyond? Robin Energy’s adoption of a Bitcoin strategy holds significant implications, particularly for the energy sector, which has traditionally been conservative in its financial practices. This move could inspire other companies within the industry to re-evaluate their treasury management strategies. The energy sector, with its substantial capital expenditures and often long-term investment horizons, could find Bitcoin an appealing asset for long-term reserve management. Beyond the energy sector, this decision reinforces the broader trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. As more publicly traded companies, especially those outside the tech or finance industries, allocate portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin, it lends further legitimacy and stability to the digital asset market. It also signals a growing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate financial instrument rather than just a speculative asset. The intersection of energy and Bitcoin is also fascinating from an operational perspective. As the Bitcoin network grows, its energy consumption is a topic of ongoing discussion. For an energy transport company to invest in Bitcoin, it might also open doors for future integration of blockchain technologies within their operations or even explore sustainable energy solutions for Bitcoin mining, creating a synergistic relationship. Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Considerations for a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy While the benefits of a Bitcoin strategy can be compelling, companies embarking on this path must also be acutely aware of the challenges and considerations involved. It’s not a decision to be taken lightly, and Robin Energy, like any other pioneer, will face certain hurdles: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings, which can be significant. While DCA helps mitigate this, large market downturns can still impact a company’s reported financial health. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations regarding taxation, custody, or usage could impact the value or operational aspects of holding Bitcoin. Custody and Security: Securing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and robust security protocols to prevent hacks or loss of private keys. This is a critical operational challenge. Accounting and Reporting: Current accounting standards (like GAAP) often classify Bitcoin as an intangible asset, which can lead to complex impairment charges if its value drops, even if the company doesn’t sell it. This can affect reported earnings. Public and Investor Perception: While some investors applaud such forward-thinking moves, others might view it as too risky or outside a company’s core business, potentially impacting stock performance. Companies must conduct thorough due diligence, establish clear internal policies, and ensure their leadership and finance teams are well-versed in the intricacies of digital asset management. Looking Ahead: Actionable Insights and the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Robin Energy’s strategic decision offers valuable insights for other companies contemplating a similar path. For those considering a Bitcoin strategy , several actionable points emerge: Start Small and Scale Up: A phased approach, like Robin Energy’s, allows for learning and adaptation without undue risk. Embrace Dollar-Cost Averaging: This systematic buying strategy is crucial for mitigating volatility and building a position over time. Prioritize Security: Invest in top-tier custody solutions and cybersecurity measures to protect digital assets. Understand Accounting Implications: Consult with financial experts to navigate the complexities of accounting for Bitcoin on the balance sheet. Communicate Clearly: Transparent communication with shareholders and stakeholders about the rationale and risks is vital. The trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption appears to be gaining momentum. As digital currencies become more integrated into the global financial system, we may see more traditional companies, from various sectors, follow Robin Energy’s lead, reshaping the future of corporate treasury management. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Corporate Finance Robin Energy’s adoption of a Bitcoin strategy marks a significant milestone in the evolving narrative of corporate finance. By allocating a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin, the energy transport company is not only seeking to optimize its cash reserves but also signaling a bold embrace of digital innovation. This move, characterized by a disciplined dollar-cost averaging approach and funded entirely from existing cash, exemplifies a thoughtful and strategic integration of a novel asset class into traditional business operations. As the digital economy continues to mature, Robin Energy’s pioneering step could serve as a powerful blueprint for other companies looking to navigate the complexities and capitalize on the opportunities presented by Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. It’s a clear indication that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative investment, but as a legitimate and valuable component of a diversified corporate treasury.

After briefly breaking above $600 on Sunday, its highest level since December, BCH has gained 17% in the past week , 12% over the last month , and 37% year-over-year . Unlike many top-100 tokens, Bitcoin Cash hasn’t seen a new all-time high since 2017 , when it peaked at $3,785 — giving it significant ground to recover in this cycle. With momentum building and sentiment shifting, a run toward $1,000 by year-end is now back on the table. Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction: BCH Hits $600 for First Time in 2025 – $1,000 is the Next Target If we look at Bitcoin Cash’s chart today, we see that its indicators are continuing to operate within a bullish but not overbought range. For instance, its relative strength index (yellow) has oscillated between 50 and 70 since early April, and in the past week it has crept towards 70 again, indicating increased buying pressure. Source: TradingView It’s a similar story with regards to the coin’s MACD (orange, blue), which has been able the baseline since April, but which has risen again in the past few days. And if we scan back to late November and early December, when it was much higher, we see that the Bitcoin Cash price has more space to rise in the near term. Its trading volumes have also risen to levels not seen since the end of December, at around $500 million today. Accordingly, we have also seen a few big transfers in recent days and weeks, although it’s not always clear whether these represent OTC buys or single whales moving their own funds around. 130,000 #BCH (74,629,845 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/8b3z4gV7yA — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 28, 2025 At the same time, recent volumes are still nowhere near where they were several years ago, suggesting that the wider market is still not particularly interested in Bitcoin Cash. For example, volumes touched $11.5 billion in May 2021, when the Bitcoin Cash price reached a then-three-year high of $1,500. Even at its peak this year, volumes for BCH have reached only $1 billion, while in late 2024, they reached only $2 billion. Despite this, some analysts are optimistic that it will surge again in the coming weeks, with some predicting new all-time highs. #BitcoinCash is set up for the biggest pump it has ever seen. $BCH pic.twitter.com/aTHCCDIezQ — High Altitude Investing (Dalin Anderson) (@HighAltitudeInv) July 30, 2025 Assuming a bullish market, the Bitcoin Cash price could therefore reach $1,000 by Q4, and potentially end the year at around $1,500. L2 Bitcoin Hyper Passes $6 Million in Popular Presale: Is This the Next Big Altcoin? Given Bitcoin Cash’s slow progress in recent years, some traders may prefer to invest in alternatives, including newer coins that could exhibit more positive volatility. If so, they may want to consider certain presale coins, which can often rally strongly when they list for the first time, particularly if they’ve had a big sale. For example, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is a new layer-two project that has raised just over $6 million in its ICO, indicating growing interest. Let $HYPER bring you higher and higher. https://t.co/VNG0P4FWNQ pic.twitter.com/Jan4MZpr8S — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) July 30, 2025 This figure bodes well for Bitcoin Hyper’s future, and the main reason why investors are excited by the project is that it’s in the process of launching a layer-two network for Bitcoin (BTC). Making use of Solana’s Virtual Machine and zero-knowledge proofs, it will provide Bitcoin holders with greater speed and scalability, while also cutting down on transaction fees. Bitcoin holders can instantly bridge to Bitcoin Hyper by depositing their BTC, which provides them with an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Hyper-based BTC. Therefore, they will be able to use the value of their BTC with a growing range of DeFi apps and DEXes, which could increase their profitability considerably. And as the native token for this L2, HYPER could witness strong demand, with the coin having a max supply of 21 billion. Holders will be able to stake it for a passive income, while they can join its presale by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . HYPER is currently selling at $0.012475, but this price will continue to rise regularly for the duration of the sale.

Following its successful Nasdaq listing via a $100 million reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, TRON Inc. is increasingly attracting institutional capital. This mirrors corporate strategies like MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin reserves, signaling a potential paradigm shift in blockchain finance. Technical indicators remain bullish. TRX sits above key moving averages, with momentum metrics such as MACD and RSI supporting continued price strength. Analysts suggest a breakout above $0.35 could set the stage for a rally toward $0.43. Stablecoin Dominance and Ecosystem Expansion TRON now hosts over $80.8 billion in USDT, surpassing Ethereum in Tether supply and processing over $20 billion in USDT daily. The network’s low-cost infrastructure has made it a preferred choice for stablecoin transactions, bolstering its position in cross-border payments.

According to market analyst CryptoOG, “XRP's 4Hr chart is painting an Elliott Wave sequence, finishing Wave 4 and hinting at a move into the final Wave 5.” The analyst pointed out that Wave 1 launched from the sub $2 range with strong momentum while Wave 2 followed with a healthy correction, preserving the bullish structure. Wave 3 then surged to nearly $3.70, confirming the uptrend. Presently, Wave 4 is consolidating into a potential bull flag, setting the stage for Wave 5, which targets $3.67–$3.70 based on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. CryptoOG added, “With bullish momentum intact and corrections staying orderly, this chart structure aligns with Elliott Wave theory forecasting a final push in Wave 5. Volume confirmation is key on breakout above $3.20.” At the time of this writing, XRP was hovering around the $3.10 zone, according to CoinGecko data . Why is Elliot Wave 5 considered bullish? Well, this is because it marks the final leg of a five-wave impulse, resuming the larger uptrend after Wave 4's correction and often signaling strong market momentum. Notably, Wave 5 is often driven by retail enthusiasm and rising market confidence, reflecting optimism or euphoria. It can be sharp and emotional, especially if Wave 3 lacked extension. SEC Paves the Way for XRP and Altcoin ETFs with New Listing Standards The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a major leap toward mainstreaming altcoin-based exchange‑traded products (ETPs) by unveiling standardized “Listing Standards” via a new exchange filing. Under the ruling, any digital asset with at least six months of futures trading on Coinbase’s derivatives exchange becomes automatically eligible for listing. Assets such as XRP, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, and others that meet the criteria may now clear the regulatory path without requiring individual SEC approval petitions. What Changed—and Why It Matters Previously, each crypto ETP required an exchange-filed 19(b)(4) rule‑change petition, stretching approval timelines up to 240 days. The new framework obviates that process for qualifying tokens, cutting review windows to around 75 days under the generic listing process. SEC Chair Paul Atkins confirmed that the Commission’s July 29 vote also permits in‑kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin and Ether ETPs—aligning crypto ETF mechanics with traditional commodity ETP structures to enhance efficiency and reduce cost. Eligible Tokens & Timeline Industry observers estimate about a dozen major tokens now qualify, including XRP and Solana, which have consistently been viewed as front‑runners. Analysts like Eric Balchunas place the odds of approval at around 95% for these assets under the new regime. The consensus forecast targets September or October 2025 as the likely window for launches of multiple altcoin ETFs. Notably, Solana-based ETPs are expected to clear by October 10, once their six‑month futures threshold is reached, with XRP approvals to follow shortly thereafter. Broader Implications This regulatory shift is widely viewed as the next major turning point in U.S. crypto financialization. By reducing friction and creating a “one‑and‑done” listing process, the SEC may significantly expand institutional adoption. In‑kind redemption mechanisms ease arbitrage and liquidity burdens, making crypto ETPs more cost‑effective and competitive with legacy commodity products. Conclusion With these developments, the SEC’s new paradigm anchored in objective futures‑based criteria marks a foundational shift in crypto ETF policy. It signals the likely arrival of regulated XRP, Solana, and other altcoin ETFs by fall 2025, establishing a more transparent and scalable path for digital asset investing. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether XRP’s Wave 5 will materialize since this will usher in a new bullish phase.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|TRADING|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-31 15:29:01

In a post on X, analyst Lark Davis pointed to an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a technical structure often associated with bullish trend reversals.The breakout occurred just above the pattern's neckline, around $117,000, with Bitcoin now trading slightly above that level. Davis emphasized that the pattern’s projected target exceeds $150,000 and aligns with the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level.Pattern Suggests Bullish ContinuationFor context, the chart's inverse head and shoulders pattern includes a left shoulder formed near $94,000, a head dipping to around $72,000 in April 2025, and a right shoulder near $90,000 in June. The neckline, now flipped into potential support, was broken in early July after weeks of sideways movement. Bitcoin Inverse head and Shoulders Bitcoin Inverse Head and Shoulders Bitcoin's current price is $118,024, a 0.4% rise in the past day, increasing its monthly gain to 10% amidst recent volatility. Bitcoin reached a weekly high of $119,826 on July 27 after retracing from the all-time high above $123,000 recorded on July 14. Notably, the current pattern suggests a measured move upward that supports a long-term price objective of over $150,000, assuming momentum continues, and price holds above the neckline.Fibonacci Levels Add Weight to the TargetThe Fibonacci extension level further supports the bullish target. Davis drew the extension from Bitcoin’s all-time high of $69,028 in November 2021 to its bear market bottom at $15,483. The resulting 2.618 extension level is $155,665, which nearly matches the projected breakout target from the pattern. Bitcoin Fibonnaci sequence Bitcoin Fibonnaci sequence Bitcoin has already crossed the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $102,120, signaling that a new price discovery phase may be underway. Momentum Holds, but Support Is CrucialDespite a weekly dip of paltry 0.6%, Bitcoin remains above the key $117,000 neckline. This level remains a point of note for analysts to see whether the level continues to hold as support. A sustained move above this zone could open the door for further upside.However, a breakdown below $117,000 could pause the current trend or trigger a short-term correction. Lark Davis suggested that the breakout has defined the next major target for Bitcoin and that reaching it may now depend only on timing.How High Can Bitcoin Go in 2025?Similarly, crypto analyst CryptoGoos pointed out that Bitcoin’s volatility dropped to around 11.1%, returning to levels last seen in late 2023 when BTC was priced near $20,000. That previous volatility low preceded a major rally. Bitcoin volatility chart shows comparison with 2023 level Bitcoin volatility compares with the 2023 level. With Bitcoin trading within 116,000 to $120,000, CryptoGoos’ chart highlights a similar setup, volatility pressing against historical lows while price consolidates tightly. This coiling behavior suggests the market may be preparing for a significant breakout, as periods of extreme volatility compression often lead to explosive moves.Adding to the bullish sentiment, veteran trader Peter Brandt recently predicted a cycle top between $125,000 and $150,000 by Q3 2025, contingent on Bitcoin reclaiming its parabolic trendline, an outlook supported by his long-term weekly chart analysis. Meanwhile, analyst apsk32 believes Bitcoin still has significant upside, forecasting a surge past $200,000 before the end of 2025.

The court said Chastain’s guilty verdict for wire fraud and money laundering was built on flawed instructions given to the jury that allowed them to punish him for being unethical, not necessarily criminal. Nathaniel was accused of buying dozens of NFTs using inside knowledge of which collections would be promoted on OpenSea’s homepage. He then resold them for up to five times the original price. The alleged trades happened while he was still working as the platform’s product lead. He was arrested in June 2022, convicted in May 2023, and sentenced to three months in prison plus three years of supervised release by August 2023. Federal prosecutors had labeled the case the first crypto insider trading prosecution in the U.S. Court says jury got “wrong definition” of fraud The appellate court said the trial court allowed jurors to convict Nathaniel for misusing OpenSea’s internal info even if what he misused wasn’t tied to traditional property. The opinion from the judges said, “Chastain argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury that it could find him guilty of defrauding OpenSea of its property if he misappropriated an intangible interest unconnected to traditional property rights… We agree.” The court ruled that fraud must involve the misuse of a real property interest, not just unprofessional behavior. “Under these circumstances,” the judges continued, “we cannot say that the jury would have reached the same verdict if it had been properly instructed that fraud requires the appropriation of a property interest rather than unprofessional business conduct.” Nathaniel’s defense also pointed to Devin Finzer, the cofounder of OpenSea, accusing him of using company info for personal benefit too. Specifically, Nathaniel said Devin bought MATIC tokens before OpenSea made public its plan to integrate with the Polygon blockchain. The filing stated: “Chastain suggests that evidence that Finzer ‘us[ed] similar company information for personal benefit’ would show that the cofounder ‘didn’t believe company policy precluded officers or employees from using similar company information for personal benefit.’” The court didn’t decide on whether Devin’s actions broke any rules, but acknowledged the claim as part of the overall defense — used to show OpenSea may not have enforced its own policies or considered the behavior unusual at the time. There’s no word yet on whether prosecutors plan to retry the case, but as of now, Nathaniel’s conviction no longer stands. The ruling raises new questions about how far U.S. law can reach when it comes to crypto-related misconduct, especially inside a fast-moving platform like OpenSea.

On 31 July, blockchain security firm Immunefi launched Magnus, an AI-powered platform designed to offer real-time protection against these threats. Backed by a growing need for smarter defence systems, Magnus is being positioned to safeguard more than $180 billion in assets across decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols such as Arbitrum, zkSync, and Curve Finance. Immunefi’s new platform aims to plug critical vulnerabilities as they emerge, reflecting a growing trend of integrating artificial intelligence into blockchain infrastructure for preventive security. As DeFi adoption accelerates and cross-chain integrations become more common, security breaches are rising in both frequency and complexity. Crypto hacks in 2025 already exceed $3.1B According to blockchain security company Hacken , the total value of funds lost in crypto-related attacks this year has already reached $3.1 billion. This figure includes both direct protocol exploits and phishing campaigns, affecting individual investors and large projects alike. In response to this growing risk, Immunefi’s Magnus platform aggregates multiple monitoring tools into a unified security interface. This centralised approach allows for instant alerting and faster threat resolution, especially during live exploit attempts when immediate action is required. Magnus is compatible with several industry-standard monitoring solutions and does not require protocols to abandon their preferred tools. Instead, it consolidates their threat intelligence and offers a collaborative dashboard, minimising the time between identifying a threat and acting on it. Codexa AI scans blockchain vulnerabilities in real time At the core of Magnus lies Codexa, Immunefi’s proprietary AI-based tool. Codexa operates as a continuously evolving database of smart contract vulnerabilities. It is designed to monitor blockchain networks in real time, analyse threat patterns, and issue alerts before threats materialise into full-scale exploits. Codexa draws from security disclosures, bug bounty reports, and public exploit databases to detect known vulnerabilities across protocols. This approach enables Magnus to act proactively, not reactively, when a threat surfaces on the blockchain. The platform is being deployed across ecosystems that together represent over $180 billion in total value locked. Arbitrum, zkSync, and Curve Finance are among the protocols integrating with Magnus, according to Immunefi. Immunefi steps up amid pressure to secure DeFi The launch of Magnus comes at a time when investor confidence in DeFi is being tested by recurring security failures. Immunefi, already known for hosting multi-million-dollar bug bounties, is moving further upstream in the security lifecycle—shifting from post-hack mitigation to preemptive protection. Rather than relying solely on community bug reports or manual auditing, the firm is now offering protocols a dynamic security layer embedded within their operational infrastructure. The integration of Codexa allows Immunefi to build an intelligence-driven model that flags threats even before they are publicly known or exploited. Magnus also seeks to promote greater transparency and accountability by encouraging projects to maintain up-to-date threat dashboards. While AI alone cannot eliminate all security risks, platforms like Magnus mark a shift toward automation in DeFi protection strategies.

This move, announced by former President Trump, signals a continued, albeit temporary, framework for one of the world’s most dynamic bilateral trade relationships. For businesses, consumers, and policymakers alike, understanding the nuances of this extension and its implications is paramount, especially as global economic landscapes continue to shift. What does this mean for the flow of goods, the future of manufacturing, and the fight against illicit trade? What Does the Extended US Mexico Trade Deal Entail? The 90-day extension of the US Mexico Trade Deal maintains specific tariff structures and introduces new agreements on trade barriers. At its core, this extension ensures that certain goods crossing the border will continue to face duties, while also pushing for a more streamlined trade environment by addressing non-tariff obstacles. This complex arrangement reflects ongoing negotiations and strategic economic priorities. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements: Continued Tariffs: Mexico will proceed with a 25% tariff on specific categories, including fentanyl and cars. Additionally, a higher 50% tariff will remain in place for vital industrial materials such as steel, aluminum, and copper. These tariffs are not merely revenue generators; they are tools intended to influence trade flows and domestic production. Removal of Non-Tariff Trade Barriers: A significant part of the agreement is Mexico’s commitment to immediately remove its non-tariff trade barriers. These are often less visible than tariffs but can be equally, if not more, disruptive to trade. They include regulations, quotas, subsidies, and other measures that make it difficult or costly for foreign goods to enter a market. This extension, while seemingly short-term, provides a window for further dialogue and potentially a more permanent resolution to some of the long-standing trade disagreements between the two nations. It underscores the intricate balance between protecting domestic industries and fostering a robust cross-border supply chain. Why is the US Mexico Trade Deal Extension So Significant? The relationship between the United States and Mexico is one of deep economic interdependence. The US Mexico Trade Deal , previously embodied by NAFTA and now by the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), underpins billions of dollars in trade annually, affecting everything from automotive production to agricultural markets. The decision to extend this deal, even for a limited period, carries immense significance for several reasons: Economic Stability: A stable trade environment is crucial for businesses on both sides of the border. Uncertainty can deter investment, disrupt supply chains, and ultimately harm economic growth. This extension provides a degree of predictability, allowing industries to plan for the immediate future without drastic changes. Supply Chain Resilience: North American supply chains are highly integrated, particularly in sectors like automotive. Components often cross the border multiple times during the manufacturing process. The continuation of the trade deal, even with existing tariffs, prevents a sudden collapse of these established networks, which would have severe repercussions for production costs and consumer prices. Political Signaling: The extension also serves as a political signal of ongoing engagement and a willingness to negotiate. Despite past disagreements and the imposition of tariffs, both nations recognize the mutual benefits of maintaining a functional trade relationship. Addressing Key Issues: By extending the deal, there’s an implicit agreement to continue working on contentious issues, such as the flow of illicit substances like fentanyl, and balancing trade deficits in key industries. Without this extension, businesses would face a much more uncertain future, potentially leading to significant economic disruption and a reevaluation of manufacturing and sourcing strategies across North America. The Impact on Key Sectors: Cars, Steel, and Fentanyl within the US Mexico Trade Deal The specific tariffs outlined in the extended US Mexico Trade Deal directly target sectors that are vital to both economies. Understanding their impact requires a closer look at each industry: Automotive Industry: Driving Through Tariffs The 25% tariff on cars imported from Mexico has been a contentious point. Mexico is a major hub for automotive manufacturing, with many global automakers having significant operations there. These tariffs aim to incentivize car production within the U.S. or shift supply chains. However, they can also increase costs for consumers and reduce competitiveness for companies that rely on cross-border manufacturing. The extension means that companies will continue to factor these costs into their pricing and production strategies, rather than facing a sudden change that could force immediate restructuring. Steel, Aluminum, and Copper: Foundations of Industry The 50% tariff on steel, aluminum, and copper from Mexico is particularly impactful for manufacturing, construction, and infrastructure development. These raw materials are fundamental to countless industries. The high tariff rate is designed to protect domestic U.S. producers of these metals. While this might support U.S. jobs in these sectors, it can also lead to higher input costs for U.S. manufacturers who rely on Mexican imports, potentially making their final products more expensive or less competitive globally. The continuation of these tariffs maintains a specific market dynamic for these essential commodities. Fentanyl: A Public Health and Trade Challenge The inclusion of fentanyl in trade discussions highlights the intersection of public health crises and economic policy. The 25% tariff on fentanyl, an opioid, is an unconventional use of trade policy. It signals a strong intent to combat the flow of this dangerous substance, which has caused a severe public health crisis in the United States. While tariffs are primarily economic tools, their application here underscores a broader strategy to use all available levers to address critical national issues. The extension means this pressure point on the drug trade through economic means will persist. Addressing Non-Tariff Barriers: A New Frontier in the US Mexico Trade Deal ? While tariffs are direct and quantifiable, non-tariff trade barriers (NTBs) are often more insidious and complex. Mexico’s agreement to immediately remove its non-tariff trade barriers as part of the extended US Mexico Trade Deal is a significant development. NTBs can include: Quotas: Limits on the quantity of goods that can be imported. Import Licenses: Bureaucratic requirements that can delay or prevent imports. Customs Procedures: Overly complex or slow customs processes. Technical Barriers to Trade (TBTs): Regulations, standards, testing, and certification procedures that disproportionately affect imported goods. Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures: Health and safety standards for agricultural products that can be used to restrict trade. Subsidies: Government support for domestic industries that makes foreign goods less competitive. The removal of these barriers aims to streamline trade, reduce administrative burdens, and lower the cost of doing business across the border. For U.S. exporters, this could mean faster market access, reduced compliance costs, and increased competitiveness in the Mexican market. It represents a move towards greater trade facilitation, which benefits businesses by making cross-border transactions smoother and more predictable. What Are the Potential Challenges and Opportunities for the US Mexico Trade Deal ? The 90-day extension of the US Mexico Trade Deal presents both challenges and opportunities for stakeholders on both sides of the border. Challenges: Uncertainty Remains: A 90-day extension is still a short-term solution. Businesses require long-term certainty for significant investments and strategic planning. The looming question of what happens after this period can still create hesitation. Tariff Burden: While continued, the tariffs on key goods like cars, steel, aluminum, copper, and fentanyl remain a cost burden for importers and potentially consumers. They can distort market prices and reduce the overall efficiency of integrated supply chains. Enforcement of NTB Removal: While Mexico has agreed to remove non-tariff barriers, the actual implementation and enforcement of this commitment will be crucial. Monitoring and ensuring compliance can be complex and require ongoing dialogue. Opportunities: Dialogue and Negotiation Window: The extension provides valuable time for both nations to engage in further negotiations, address outstanding issues, and potentially forge a more comprehensive and stable long-term agreement. Supply Chain Optimization: With the current framework maintained, businesses can continue to optimize their existing North American supply chains without the immediate threat of drastic disruption, focusing on efficiency within the current tariff structure. Increased Trade Facilitation: The commitment to remove non-tariff barriers, if effectively implemented, could lead to genuinely smoother and more cost-effective trade, benefiting a wide range of industries that export to Mexico. Addressing Fentanyl Flow: The explicit inclusion of fentanyl in the trade discussion offers an ongoing opportunity to use economic leverage to combat the illicit drug trade, potentially leading to more effective joint strategies. Ultimately, the success of this extension will hinge on the willingness of both governments to engage constructively and find common ground on issues that are vital to their respective national interests and economic prosperity. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of the US Mexico Trade Deal The 90-day extension of the US Mexico Trade Deal is a pivotal moment, reflecting the complex and interconnected nature of modern international trade. While it offers a temporary reprieve from uncertainty and allows for continued dialogue, it also highlights the ongoing challenges of balancing national interests with the benefits of global commerce. The continuation of specific tariffs, coupled with the critical commitment to remove non-tariff barriers, sets the stage for what could be a period of intense negotiation and strategic realignment. For businesses and policymakers, remaining agile and informed will be key to navigating this evolving landscape and harnessing the opportunities that arise from this crucial bilateral relationship. The future of North American trade hinges on these delicate balances, promising continued developments that will shape the economic trajectory of the region. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the US Mexico Trade Deal being extended? A1: The extension refers to the ongoing trade framework between the United States and Mexico, which largely operates under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the successor to NAFTA. This 90-day extension continues specific tariff rates and agreements on non-tariff barriers. Q2: Which products are specifically affected by the tariffs in this extension? A2: Under the extended agreement, Mexico will continue to pay a 25% tariff on fentanyl and cars. Additionally, a 50% tariff remains in place for steel, aluminum, and copper imports from Mexico. Q3: What are non-tariff trade barriers, and why is their removal significant? A3: Non-tariff trade barriers are restrictions on trade that are not tariffs, such as quotas, import licenses, complex customs procedures, and technical standards. Their immediate removal is significant because they can be just as restrictive as tariffs, making trade more costly and time-consuming. Their removal aims to streamline cross-border commerce. Q4: How does this extension impact the automotive industry? A4: The 25% tariff on cars from Mexico continues to impact the automotive industry by increasing costs for manufacturers and potentially consumers. However, the extension provides stability, preventing immediate drastic shifts in supply chains that could occur if the deal were to lapse without a clear alternative. Q5: Is this extension a permanent solution to trade issues between the US and Mexico? A5: No, the 90-day extension is a temporary measure. It provides a window for continued negotiations and dialogue between the two nations, aiming to address outstanding trade issues and potentially work towards a more stable, long-term agreement beyond this period. Q6: How does the tariff on fentanyl fit into a trade deal? A6: The tariff on fentanyl is an unconventional but significant aspect of the trade deal, highlighting the intersection of trade policy and public health concerns. It reflects an attempt to use economic leverage to combat the flow of illicit substances and address the opioid crisis in the United States.

Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00007569 to $0.0000865. In 2031, we expect Bonk price to record a maximum price of $0.000141 with an average price of $0.000135. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 76.92 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

BONK/USD value has dived to $0.00002818 in the past few hours. The decreasing volatility is suggestive of a lesser chance of a reversal. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, leading to decreasing volatility. This decrease in volatility signals a lower market unpredictability.

Bonk price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.00002819 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 0.84 percent today. Technical indicators favor the selling side of the market, and the price charts also project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.000141, which is approximately 679% more than its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a portion of its value over the last 24 hours. Today, its price decreased to $0.00002819. The overall bearish trend in the market moved Bonk’s price in a negative direction, resulting in the recent correction. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000021. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense selloff below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the start of 2027. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by 2028. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the meme coin, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000141 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

While PEPE continues its volatile climb, all eyes are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fast-rising DeFi project that’s performing well with its innovative lending markets.

49308405,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76271,1753977605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Most Popular Crypto Projects This August: BlockDAG, ADA, XRP, & DOT Compared for Growth and Adoption",https://timestabloid.com/most-popular-crypto-projects-this-august-blockdag-ada-xrp/,"The crypto world is watching closely as Cardano, Ripple, and Polkadot continue to dominate headlines, but a lesser-known name is quickly gaining ground. BlockDAG has stepped into the spotlight with a $357 million raise and major ecosystem developments that rival even the biggest players. With August 11 marked for its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, BlockDAG’s growth is turning heads in an already competitive space. Cardano is still refining its network upgrades. Ripple continues to ride institutional optimism. Polkadot remains architecturally sound but is waiting on fresh momentum. Meanwhile, BlockDAG has surged ahead with a low-cost entry point, active development, and products already in motion. With millions mining through the X1 app and hundreds of decentralized applications under construction, the project is not just building hype, it’s delivering. As the launch window narrows, one question stands out: is BlockDAG still early enough to be the next breakout success? Here’s how the top contenders measure up and why BDAG could be this year’s top-performing crypto. 1. Cardano: Slow but Steady Progress with Technical Upgrades Cardano remains a top-tier project known for its academic roots and structured upgrades. Priced between $0.81 and $0.84, ADA has been hovering in a consolidation phase. Its current market cap hovers near $29 billion, with trading volumes around $860 million daily. If it breaks the $0.84 resistance, ADA might climb toward $0.88. If not, it risks slipping back toward $0.78 support. The Basho-era upgrades aimed at scalability are still rolling out, but progress has been gradual. While Cardano offers long-term potential and technological depth, its slow pace has some users searching for projects with faster execution. ADA could still shine, but it’s facing stiff competition from newcomers making rapid progress. 2. Ripple: Institutional Moves Fuel Hopes Despite Uncertainty XRP is trading near $3.18 and has delivered nearly 300% gains this year. A wave of large-scale institutional transactions, totaling over $415 million, has helped stabilize its performance amid recent market swings. Although Bitcoin’s drop below $116K rattled the market, XRP has remained strong in comparison. Much of the excitement around XRP stems from speculation that it could be included in upcoming U.S. digital asset reserves, although regulation remains uncertain. XRP still holds the potential to become one of the most popular cryptos in 2025. Its price strength and high-level interest give it a solid base, but short-term growth depends on broader market movement and policy updates. 3. Polkadot: Strong Tech Framework Waiting on a Breakou Polkadot holds its place among Layer 1 leaders, trading around $4.13 despite a 7% drop over the week. Its strength lies in its parachain and shared security model, appealing to developers building decentralized apps. Market cap stands between $6.3 and $6.6 billion, and its recent trading range has been tight with about 6% volatility. A break above $4.11 could spark positive momentum, but sentiment remains subdued for now. DOT’s long-term value is tied to its technical design, but that alone isn’t sparking much activity. The project’s success in 2025 depends on how fast it can convert its infrastructure into mass adoption and fresh utility. 4. BlockDAG: Real Growth Backed by $357M Raise and Live Ecosystem BlockDAG is quickly reshaping the conversation in crypto. With more than $357 million raised and 24.5 billion coins sold, it’s becoming a serious contender for 2025’s top-performing crypto. Its current price of $0.0016 stands in stark contrast to its locked launch value of $0.05, offering a clear 3,025% ROI opportunity. But price alone isn’t driving the surge. Over 2 million users are actively mining BDAG through the X1 mobile app, while 18,800+ miners have already been sold to users looking to boost output. The platform’s hybrid design blends Proof-of-Work with a DAG-based structure, which supports high transaction throughput and scalability without compromising decentralization. More than 300 decentralized applications are already in development, spanning DeFi, AI tools, and smart governance protocols. BlockDAG has also drawn a global developer community of 4,500+ contributors. A key draw right now is the “no vesting” feature, any coins purchased during this period are fully accessible at launch. While ADA, XRP, and DOT are steady players, BlockDAG’s traction is real-time, not theoretical. With working products and an expanding user base, BDAG is positioning itself not just as a presale success, but a project built to lead. Legacy Coins Hold Ground but BlockDAG Sets the Pace Cardano, Ripple, and Polkadot all bring something to the table, be it trusted networks, institutional ties, or powerful architecture. But none of them match BlockDAG’s combination of adoption, accessibility, and ecosystem depth at this stage. With the presale entering its final stretch, a $0.0016 price, and full coin access guaranteed at launch, BDAG offers an unmatched value proposition. For anyone searching for the most popular crypto in 2025, BlockDAG is more than a name on a list. It’s already proving its place, not by waiting for headlines, but by making them.

49308434,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=796610,1753977613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49308434.jpeg,"Likelihood Of Dogecoin Price Reaching New All-Time Highs Is ‘Extremely High’, Here’s Why",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-to-new-highs/,"The Dogecoin price is currently down more than 70% from its all-time high of approximately $0.74. However, a crypto analyst has predicted that the likelihood of this top meme coin reaching a new ATH is exceptionally high. Based on recurring historical patterns and strong technical signals, the analysis suggests that Dogecoin is getting ready for a critical breakout that could open the doors to a powerful rally. Dogecoin Price To Record New ATH Soon According to a fresh analysis by crypto expert Javon Marks, the probability of Dogecoin setting new all-time highs in this cycle is “extremely high.” Marks’ outlines a compelling case by comparing Dogecoin’s current market structure with its historical price movements from 2014 to date, which appear to follow a repetitive pattern of consolidation followed by explosive upside. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Enters Bullish Livermore Cylinder That Could Catapult Price To $1.5 In his chart analysis shared on the X social media on July 30, the analyst shows that DOGE has historically moved through phases of compression within wedge-like formations, followed by major breakouts to new all-time highs. During the 2016-2017 bull market, the cryptocurrency hit an ATH of $0.01877 after undergoing a long compression. A similar pattern unfolded in the 2021 bull rally, when the meme coin’s price surged to a fresh ATH of $0.739 after an extended period of tightening consolidation. Currently, the chart structure is showing a striking resemblance to these past setups, with DOGE’s price coiling tightly near a potential breakout point. With this in mind, the analyst predicts that the meme coin is on the verge of a massive price rally exceeding 226%, setting the stage for a possible break-through of the $0.739 ATH if momentum continues to build. Based on the expert’s chart analysis, historical fractals further indicate the possibility of Dogecoin surpassing the $1 mark to reach $1.42 or even $2.11. A surge to both targets would represent a significant gain of approximately 545% and over 830% respectively, from the current trading price of around $0.22. Dogecoin Pullback Predicted Ahead Of Next Target Crypto analyst Bitguru revealed in an X post that Dogecoin is showing signs of a pullback that could soon transition into a breakout. The expert’s analysis shows DOGE recovering from the $0.2138 support zone that held firm following a recent decline from its local high of $0.2866. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of 4-Year Bearish Streak With 65% Rally Bitguru noted that Dogecoin’s decline was a healthy one, as it retraced back to test the previous breakout area. This pullback phase is showing signs of exhaustion, with the meme coin’s price now consolidating around $0.22. Notably, the analyst’s chart is reflecting a potential double-bottom structure, hinting at the possible formation of a bullish reversal pattern. Building on this setup, Bitguru forecasts a potential 28.83% upside for Dogecoin, with price targets in the $0.24 to $0.25 range in the short term. If bullish momentum persists, the chart’s projected trajectory points to an extended move near the $0.28 level.

The anticipation stems from a post by prominent crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X, who highlighted the meeting’s potential to bring finality to the long-running Ripple lawsuit. The official Sunshine Act notice confirms that one of the agenda items is the “resolution of litigation claims,” fueling speculation that the SEC may be preparing to formally end its case against Ripple . The Legal Backdrop The SEC’s case against Ripple began in December 2020, accusing the company of conducting unregistered securities sales through its XRP token. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that while Ripple’s institutional sales violated securities laws, its programmatic sales on public exchanges did not. The decision was a partial win for Ripple and a defining moment for XRP’s regulatory status. BREAKING: SEC Closed Meeting is today! Will they announce the end of the @Ripple case? #XRP pic.twitter.com/6wAoFJ5pUj — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) July 31, 2025 Following the ruling, Ripple agreed to pay a $50 million civil penalty as part of a settlement proposal. However, the case remained open as both Ripple and the SEC filed appeals on aspects of the judgment. On June 27, 2025, Ripple voluntarily dropped its cross-appeal , signaling its willingness to bring the case to a close. Now, the ball is in the SEC’s court. Why Today’s Meeting Matters Although Ripple has stepped back, the case cannot be fully resolved until the SEC formally withdraws its own appeal. That requires a vote by the commission, an internal process that typically takes place during these closed meetings. The inclusion of “litigation claims” on today’s agenda has raised hopes that the SEC may be preparing to take this final step. It’s worth noting that the SEC has held multiple closed meetings in recent weeks, including on July 17 and July 24. While none of those sessions resulted in an official update on Ripple, the continued focus on litigation items suggests that internal discussions are ongoing. Today’s meeting, with Ripple having already withdrawn its appeal, is seen as a likely window for resolution. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Implications and XRP Price Action As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.10. Analysts have identified $3.23 as a key resistance level. A favorable outcome from today’s meeting, particularly confirmation that the SEC is dropping its appeal, could trigger a breakout above that threshold, potentially driving XRP toward new cycle highs. Sentiment in the XRP community remains high, with many investors hoping that a resolution will not only solidify XRP’s legal status but also pave the way for institutional adoption and potential exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to the token. Looking Ahead If the SEC votes today to end its appeal, the formal withdrawal will likely be filed with the appellate court within days. That would make Judge Torres’ ruling final and close the case. If no decision is announced, the commission may be preparing for a future vote, potentially before the August 15 deadline to update the court on the status of the appeal. For now, all eyes are on the SEC. The XRP Army is watching closely, hoping today finally brings the clarity they’ve waited nearly five years to see.

Bengaluru police, in charge of the investigation, confirmed the theft was caused by malware linked to a fake job offer . A CoinDCX employee unknowingly installed the malware after being tricked by scammers pretending to be recruiters. A Software Engineer Targeted by Fake Recruiters Police say cybercriminals tricked a CoinDCX software engineer, Rahul Agarwal, by posing as recruiters. They offered him a part-time job and tricked him into installing malware on his work laptop. This gave the attackers access to CoinDCX’s internal systems. Reports suggest the attackers used Agarwal’s login credentials to move the funds. Investigators say the device was then used to breach wallet systems managed by Neblio Technologies, the parent company of CoinDCX. Rahul Agarwal has been arrested and is being questioned. His company laptop has also been seized. When he was interrogated, he claimed he did not know he was involved in the scheme until the company confronted him. The investigation is still ongoing, and authorities are trying to trace the stolen funds. So far, there is no official confirmation of where the money was sent or whether it can be recovered. CoinDCX Promises to Cover Losses In a recent statement, CoinDCX co-founder and CEO, Sumit Gupta, confirmed that the attack came from a breach in a server tied to the company’s internal wallet. He said that user funds are safe and that the company will cover the losses. Neeraj Khandelwal, the company’s other co-founder, shared that CoinDCX has launched a Recovery Bounty Programme. The exchange is offering 25% of the stolen amount, roughly $11 million, to anyone who helps recover the stolen crypto. Scam victims, huge corporations, are increasingly using bounty offers to recover their stolen funds. This method has worked so far, allowing crypto firms to recover their funds without pursuing a legal settlement against the hacker. Second Major Attack on Indian Crypto Firms This latest incident is not the first time an Indian crypto exchange has faced such a blow. In July 2024, WazirX, another major platform, was hacked, losing over $230 million . Authorities believe that North Korea’s Lazarus Group was behind that attack. Efforts to rebuild WazirX hit a setback in June when a Singapore court rejected its reorganization plan. This highlights how hard it can be for companies to recover after a major attack. The CoinDCX breach has sparked new concerns about cybersecurity in India’s growing crypto space and the global industry. As the investigation goes on, the company is working to strengthen its systems and recover the lost funds. Meanwhile, experts are urging users and employees to watch out for online scams, especially fake job offers.

Powered by USDT, Stable positions itself as the first blockchain infrastructure dedicated entirely to stablecoin applications, a model it refers to as a ""Stablechain."" The initiative is backed by key contributors from Tether and Bitfinex, with Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino serving as an advisor. The funding round includes participation from KuCoin Ventures, Ardoino, Bitfinex, Hack VC, and Franklin Templeton, among others—highlighting interest from both crypto-native and traditional financial institutions in advancing stablecoin infrastructure. Unlike general-purpose blockchains such as Ethereum or Tron, Stable is purpose-built to support stablecoin-related activity. It aims to address common challenges in on-chain payments, including volatile transaction fees, slow confirmation times, and usability friction. By embedding payment-centric functionality into the protocol layer, Stable seeks to offer a more efficient and reliable user experience. ""Payments infrastructure around the world needs an overhaul, and traditional methods have failed to achieve fast, reliable, and secure digital payments despite massive demand from consumers across the globe,"" said Joshua Harding, Co-founder and CEO of Stable. ""Stable was developed to take advantage of the potential behind stablecoins like USDT to offer instant and seamless payments, directly addressing problems with current payment rails. The support we have received from major investors in both crypto and traditional finance shows that they share our vision, one that we are incredibly excited to work alongside them to make a reality."" One of Stable’s core features is the use of USDT as its native gas token, removing the need for a separate utility token. Peer-to-peer USDT transfers on Stable are gas-free, simplifying transactions for end users. The blockchain operates on StableBFT, a consensus mechanism derived from Cosmos’ CometBFT, and plans to incorporate DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) architecture to improve scalability and confirmation speeds. The platform also offers enterprise-grade infrastructure, enabling businesses to request dedicated block space for consistent transaction performance. Cass Tsai, Head of KuCoin Ventures, commented on the investment: ""We firmly believe in the long-term potential of stablecoins in global payment ecosystems. Stable, as a high-performance blockchain tailored for USDT, provides a clear path forward for scalable stablecoin circulation, settlement, and cross-border use cases. We look forward to working with the Stable team to advance the development of a global stablecoin clearing and settlement network, and to support the industry’s next growth chapter."" This investment aligns with KuCoin Ventures’ broader strategy to support emerging infrastructure in the stablecoin and digital payments sector, recognizing the growing role of stablecoins in the future of financial systems.

WXRP, backed 1:1 by XRP in custody, gives holders seamless access to Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. What’s Driving the Uptick? Rising DeFi demand for wrapped tokens is key, as users increasingly leverage WXRP to lend, borrow, or provide liquidity on Ethereum-based protocols. Serving as a crucial bridge between the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, WXRP enables seamless cross-chain integration and utility. Secondly, Cross-chain integration is accelerating in 2025, with growing institutional interest in multi-chain solutions over single-chain silos. The rise of wrapped assets like WXRP reflects this shift, enabling seamless asset flow across blockchains and powering the interoperable future of crypto. Thirdly, XRP itself has seen extraordinary relative gains up by 552% year‑on‑year since July 2024 and 49% year‑to‑date through late July 2025. Elevated whale accumulation and bullish technical formations on XRP’s native ledger have bolstered confidence in XRP’s long‑run utility. Why It Matters DeFi Access: WXRP enables XRP holders to tap Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem through staking, yield farming, or collateralized lending, unlocking new utility for XRP beyond payments. Cross‑Chain Trust: Surpassing $60 million signals growing trust in wrapped collateral and custodial reliability, which is important for institutions or retail users bridging assets. Ecosystem Synergy: This milestone may presage deeper integrations between the XRP Ledger ecosystem and Ethereum’s protocols, accelerating innovation in both networks. As Ethereum continues its institutional-strength bullish run now trading at around $3,800 with derivatives open interest surpassing $60 billion, WXRP momentum may further grow. DeFi participants may increasingly include wrapped XRP in portfolios or liquidity strategies, especially given that XRP recently hit a new all-time high of $3.65. XRP’s Bullish Flag Plays Out According to market analyst Lingrid, XRP recently broke key resistance with a strong breakout and is now consolidating just below the upper range. The price continues to hold within a bullish flag, signaling a healthy correction after a sharp upward impulse. She added , “If the current pullback holds above the diagonal support, a renewed push toward 3.60–3.70 becomes likely. Bulls remain in control as structure supports further upside.” At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at the psychological price of $3.10 amid intensified consolidation. Conclusion WXRP’s market‑cap breakthrough is a meaningful indicator of growing demand for cross‑chain liquidity, interoperability, and DeFi usage of XRP. As wrapped assets mature, this milestone may mark the beginning of deeper integration between XRP and Ethereum ecosystems, offering fresh opportunities for holders, developers, and decentralized finance at large. As the value of WXRP skyrockets, it remains to be seen how XRP’s price plays out in the short term as heightened consolidation takes center stage.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|ETH|TRADING|WALLET|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-31 16:07:39

Important products like Embraer’s passenger jets and orange juice were spared from a big tax hike, staying at the current 10% duty instead of jumping to 50%. The change, now delayed until next week, gave some relief to businesses and traders after Trump had warned of broad tariffs on Brazilian goods. Bloomberg says the announcement took Brasília by surprise, given its limited recent dialogue with Washington. Instead of passing through diplomatic channels, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s team enlisted prominent commercial leaders, including executives from Embraer, to make Brazil’s case directly to U.S. officials. Lula resisted U.S. demands to intervene in Brazil’s judiciary or derail the legal proceedings against former President Jair Bolsonaro. He stressed the autonomy of Brazil’s Supreme Court, a position admired domestically but criticized by hardliners in Washington who argued it warranted stricter U.S. measures. Ultimately, Trump clarified that the advertised “50 percent tariff” would not apply uniformly. Now, Lula needs to turn this short-term break into a lasting deal with the U.S., Brazil’s second-biggest export market. Bolsonaro’s upcoming trial for an alleged coup could bring new pressure from the U.S. and put these trade breaks at risk. There’s also worry that sanctions from Justice Alexandre de Morae, issued just hours before the tariff news, could lead to more action against Brazilian officials. Important sectors like coffee and beef were not included in the exemptions and may need government help to protect farmers and exporters. With inflation rising and possible new tariffs ahead, the central bank decided on Wednesday to leave the Selic interest rate unchanged. At the presidential palace, Lula called the exemptions “a sacred win for our sovereignty,” saying they prove Brazil can resist outside pressure without giving up its judicial independence. In the aftermath of Trump’s initial threat of 50% duties , top Brazilian officials had braced for the worst. Cryptopolitan reported earlier how Brazilian governors criticised Lula for his talks with the U.S. Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Vice President Geraldo Alckmin showed growing frustration with U.S. negotiators, pointing out that Brazil has a trade deficit with the U.S., unlike many other countries hit by Trump’s tariffs. Lula defends Brazil’s Independence in tariff fight While the U.S. worked on the exemption list, Brazil was mostly kept in the dark. On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington. He said it was unfortunate that two centuries of partnership had become political. Vieira shared Lula’s view that Brazil is open to trade talks, but its justice system is not up for debate. Soon after, Brazil’s embassy in Washington sent a message to Lula about the exemptions. He quickly called an emergency meeting with Vice President Alckmin and top advisers, according to people close to the talks. Haddad hasn’t spoken directly with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent yet, but expects the talks to take two to three months, like past U.S. talks with other countries. Brazilian officials are hopeful they can get more exemptions for goods like coffee and beef, which Brazil leads the world in supplying and doesn’t produce much of at home. Brazilian companies breathed a sigh of relief. Embraer, which employs over 2,000 people in the U.S., said the exemptions showed its importance in the region. CEO Francisco Gomes Neto jokingly called himself the “Chief Tariff Officer.” Embraer’s stock jumped 11% after the news. Itau now expects the average tariff on Brazilian goods to be around 30%, lower than the earlier estimate of 40%. This change also makes it less likely that Brazil will strike back, easing the risk of a bigger conflict Get seen where it counts.

Recently, a significant milestone for the Ethereum network captured widespread attention: the number of Ethereum active addresses has reached a remarkable two-year high. This surge isn’t just a fleeting statistic; it signals a robust and growing engagement with one of the most foundational blockchains in the decentralized ecosystem. What does this phenomenal growth mean for Ethereum’s future, its users, and the broader crypto landscape? According to a report from Sentora (formerly known as IntoTheBlock) shared via X, the count of active Ethereum addresses soared to an impressive 931,310 on July 30th. This figure represents the highest level of daily activity observed on the Ethereum network in two years, painting a vivid picture of renewed interest and utility. This isn’t just about price speculation; it’s about genuine interaction and participation. What Exactly Are Active Ethereum Addresses, and Why Do They Matter? Before we dive deeper into the implications of this surge, let’s clarify what an ‘active address’ signifies. An Ethereum active address refers to a unique blockchain address that has initiated or received a transaction within a specific timeframe, typically a 24-hour period. Think of it like a unique visitor to a bustling digital marketplace. Each time an address sends Ether, interacts with a smart contract, or receives tokens, it’s counted as active. The number of Ethereum active addresses is a crucial metric for several reasons: Network Health: A high number indicates a healthy, vibrant network with strong user engagement. It suggests that people are not just holding ETH, but actively using the network for various decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFT transactions. Adoption & Utility: It’s a direct measure of how many unique entities are interacting with the blockchain. A rising trend points towards increasing adoption and a broader utility of the Ethereum ecosystem beyond mere investment. Demand Indicator: More active addresses often translate to higher transaction volumes and, consequently, increased demand for block space, which can influence network fees (gas prices). What’s Driving the Phenomenal Rise in Ethereum Active Addresses? The significant uptick in Ethereum active addresses isn’t random; it’s likely a confluence of several factors contributing to renewed confidence and utility within the ecosystem. Understanding these drivers is key to appreciating the current state and future trajectory of Ethereum. DeFi Resurgence: The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has seen a notable rebound, with increased activity in lending, borrowing, and decentralized exchange (DEX) platforms. Users are returning to yield farming and exploring new financial primitives built on Ethereum, driving transaction volume. NFT Market Buzz: While the NFT market experienced a cooldown, it remains a significant driver of network activity. New collections, ongoing trading, and the development of NFT-centric dApps continue to bring users to the blockchain. Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: The growth of Layer 2 (L2) networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon, which process transactions off the main Ethereum chain but settle them securely on it, has made interacting with Ethereum more affordable and faster. This enhanced accessibility encourages more users to participate, contributing indirectly to the overall increase in active addresses by making the ecosystem more user-friendly. Post-Merge Stability: The successful transition of Ethereum to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge) brought significant stability and reduced energy consumption, fostering greater institutional interest and user confidence in the network’s long-term viability. Broader Market Recovery: A general positive sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market often leads to increased activity across all major blockchains, including Ethereum. As Bitcoin and other altcoins show signs of recovery, users become more comfortable engaging with the ecosystem. Understanding the Significance of Active Ethereum Addresses for the Ecosystem The surge in Ethereum active addresses is more than just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of the network’s vitality and evolving role in the digital economy. This metric provides a lens through which we can assess the genuine, organic growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. Firstly, it signifies that Ethereum is not merely a speculative asset but a functional utility. People are using it for real-world applications, whether it’s trading digital collectibles, participating in decentralized governance, or accessing innovative financial services. This goes beyond simple holding or trading on centralized exchanges; it reflects direct interaction with the underlying blockchain technology. Secondly, a growing base of Ethereum active addresses often correlates with increased developer activity. A thriving user base attracts more builders to create new dApps, protocols, and services, forming a virtuous cycle of innovation and adoption. Developers are more likely to build where the users are, and the current data suggests Ethereum remains a prime destination for decentralized innovation. Lastly, this sustained activity strengthens the network’s security and decentralization. More participants mean a more distributed and resilient network, less susceptible to single points of failure. It reinforces Ethereum’s position as a foundational layer for the future of the internet. Challenges and Opportunities Amidst Growing Ethereum Active Addresses While the surge in Ethereum active addresses is overwhelmingly positive, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent challenges that come with increased network demand, alongside the vast opportunities it unlocks. Aspect Potential Challenge Corresponding Opportunity Network Congestion & Gas Fees Higher demand can lead to increased transaction costs (gas fees) and slower confirmation times during peak periods. Accelerates the adoption and development of Layer 2 scaling solutions, making transactions more affordable and faster for users.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions regarding Ethereum network activity and active addresses: Q1: What exactly constitutes an “active Ethereum address”? A1: An active Ethereum address is a unique wallet address that has either sent or received a transaction (ETH or tokens) or interacted with a smart contract within a specific 24-hour period. It represents genuine engagement with the network. Q2: How does the number of active addresses impact Ethereum’s price? A2: While not a direct or immediate price driver, a sustained increase in active addresses is a fundamental bullish indicator. It suggests growing utility, demand, and network health, which can positively influence investor sentiment and long-term price appreciation. Q3: Is this surge in Ethereum active addresses sustainable? A3: The sustainability depends on various factors, including continued innovation within the ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, dApps), effective scaling solutions (Layer 2s), and overall market sentiment. However, the current growth drivers suggest a strong foundation for continued activity. Q4: What are Layer 2 solutions, and how do they relate to active addresses? A4: Layer 2 solutions (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism) are separate blockchains built on top of Ethereum that process transactions off-chain, then settle them on the main Ethereum chain. They reduce gas fees and increase transaction speed, making the Ethereum ecosystem more accessible and encouraging more users to become active addresses. Q5: Where can I find real-time data on Ethereum network activity?

This isn’t just any trade; it’s a strategic move by an entity with a proven track record of profitability, making it a pivotal moment for Solana (SOL) and the broader crypto ecosystem. What Exactly is a SOL Long Position and Why is This One So Significant? For those new to the intricacies of crypto trading, a ‘long position’ essentially means that a trader is betting on the price of an asset to increase. When you go ‘long’ on Solana (SOL), you’re anticipating that its value will rise, allowing you to sell it later at a higher price for a profit. It’s a fundamental strategy in both traditional and digital finance. So, what makes this particular SOL long position so newsworthy? Several factors: Sheer Scale: A $42.3 million investment in a single asset is a monumental sum. This indicates immense conviction in Solana’s future performance by the trader. The Trader’s Pedigree: According to on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain on X, the trader (identified by the address 0x89Da) isn’t just a novice. They’ve amassed over $2.9 million in profits recently, demonstrating a keen understanding of market dynamics. Exceptional Win Rate: Over the past 20 days, this trader has executed 14 trades with an astonishing 85.71% win rate. This level of consistent success is rare and speaks volumes about their analytical prowess and execution capabilities. This kind of large-scale, high-conviction trade often signals a bullish sentiment among experienced market participants, potentially influencing other investors and market trends. Decoding the Trader Behind the Momentous SOL Long Position : Who is 0x89Da? The crypto world is often shrouded in pseudonymity, and the trader behind address 0x89Da is no exception. While their identity remains unknown, their trading performance speaks volumes. Their recent track record paints a picture of a highly skilled and strategic investor, perhaps even a ‘whale’ – a term used to describe individuals or entities holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency, capable of moving markets. Consider these impressive statistics: Metric Details Trader Address 0x89Da Current Position Value ~$42.3 Million (238,909 SOL) Recent Profits Over $2.9 Million Trading Period Past 20 Days Total Trades 14 Win Rate 85.71% This high win rate suggests that the trader is likely employing sophisticated strategies, possibly involving in-depth technical analysis, fundamental research into Solana’s ecosystem, or even leveraging exclusive market insights. Their consistent success highlights the potential for significant gains when combining strategic acumen with substantial capital. The Ripple Effect: How This Massive SOL Long Position Impacts the Market A trade of this magnitude, particularly from a consistently profitable entity, rarely goes unnoticed. Its impact can be felt across several dimensions of the Solana market and beyond: Market Sentiment Boost: A large SOL long position from a ‘smart money’ trader can act as a strong bullish signal. It suggests that institutional or highly informed investors see significant upside potential in Solana, encouraging others to follow suit. Potential Price Action: While one trade doesn’t guarantee a price surge, it contributes to buying pressure. If other investors react positively to this whale activity, it could trigger a short-term rally for SOL. Increased Scrutiny on Solana: This trade puts Solana further into the spotlight, prompting more analysts and investors to examine its fundamentals, development roadmap, and ecosystem growth. Liquidity and Volatility: Large positions can also influence market liquidity and volatility. Should the trader decide to unwind their position, it could lead to significant price movements. It’s crucial for traders to understand that while following whale movements can be insightful, it’s not without risks. Market conditions can change rapidly, and even the most successful traders can face unexpected downturns. Navigating High-Stakes Solana Trading: Lessons from a Major SOL Long Position for Your Strategy While most individual traders won’t be opening $42.3 million positions, there are valuable lessons to be gleaned from the success of 0x89Da. This trader’s consistent profitability isn’t just luck; it’s a testament to disciplined strategy and deep market understanding. Here are some actionable insights: Embrace On-Chain Analytics: Tools like Lookonchain, Nansen, or Arkham Intelligence provide invaluable insights into ‘smart money’ movements. Tracking large transactions can help identify potential trends before they become mainstream. Develop a Robust Trading Strategy: The 85.71% win rate isn’t accidental. It likely stems from a well-defined strategy that includes entry and exit points, risk management, and profit targets. Don’t just trade on impulse; have a plan. Understand Risk Management: Even with a high win rate, losses are inevitable. A successful trader manages their risk by never over-leveraging and understanding their potential downside. For a SOL long position , this includes setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the market moves against them. Conduct Thorough Research: Before making any significant investment, delve into the fundamentals of the asset. For Solana, this means understanding its technology, network activity, developer ecosystem, and competitive landscape. Maintain Emotional Discipline: The crypto market is highly volatile and can trigger strong emotions. Successful traders remain calm and stick to their plan, avoiding impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed. While the allure of quick profits is strong, sustainable success in crypto trading comes from knowledge, discipline, and a calculated approach to risk. Conclusion: The Enduring Impact of a High-Stakes Bet The opening of a massive $42.3 million SOL long position by a consistently profitable trader (0x89Da) is more than just a headline; it’s a significant market event. It underscores the growing sophistication of crypto trading, the power of on-chain data, and the potential for substantial gains within the digital asset space. While the identity of this mysterious trader remains unknown, their actions serve as a powerful case study for anyone looking to navigate the complex world of cryptocurrency investments. As the Solana ecosystem continues to evolve, all eyes will be on how this momentous bet plays out, potentially shaping the market’s trajectory in the coming weeks and months. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly does it mean to open a ‘long position’ in cryptocurrency? A ‘long position’ in cryptocurrency means that a trader buys an asset, like Solana (SOL), with the expectation that its price will increase. The goal is to sell the asset later at a higher price to make a profit. It’s a bullish bet on the asset’s future performance. Q2: Why is the trader’s win rate of 85.71% significant? An 85.71% win rate over 14 trades in 20 days is exceptionally high in trading. It indicates that the trader possesses a highly effective strategy, strong analytical skills, or access to superior market insights, allowing them to consistently make profitable decisions. Q3: How can a single large SOL long position impact the broader Solana market? A large SOL long position from a known successful trader can act as a strong bullish signal, boosting market sentiment. It can encourage other investors to buy, potentially increasing demand and contributing to upward price pressure for SOL. It also highlights Solana’s perceived value among ‘smart money’. Q4: What are the risks associated with opening a large long position? Despite the potential for high profits, large long positions carry significant risks, including liquidation if the price moves sharply against the trader, market volatility, unexpected news events, and the overall unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Even highly profitable traders can experience losses. Q5: How can individual traders track ‘whale’ activity like this SOL long position ? Individual traders can track ‘whale’ activity through on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain (as cited in the article), Nansen, Arkham Intelligence, or Whale Alert.

The bulk of these holdings is dominated by publicly listed firms, with Michael Saylor-led Strategy leading the pack, followed by Japan’s Metaplanet and US-based SharpLink Gaming. Together, treasury companies have amassed 791,662 BTC and 1,313,318 ETH, representing roughly 3.98% of Bitcoin’s and 1.09% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. DATCO Holdings Top $100B According to the latest report published by Galaxy Digital, Strategy alone holds BTC currently valued at $71.8 billion, with more than $28 billion in unrealized profits. It appears that early entry and aggressive accumulation strategies have paid off. Other DATCOs, while smaller in size, also benefit from low cost bases and significant upside potential. A growing number of entrants are diversifying beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. These entities are expanding their holdings to include at least ten other digital assets, such as Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Hyperliquid (HYPE). Ethereum-focused treasury companies are going further by leveraging staking and DeFi strategies to generate non-dilutive returns, a feature not available to BTC-only firms. While the US remains the dominant hub for these companies, international players are increasingly entering the market, owing to “regional capital market dynamics.” Unlike ETFs, DATCOs have the ability to raise and deploy capital more flexibly, which may attract narrative-driven inflows from investors. In the future, DATCOs are expected to play an even bigger role in the crypto industry. But this growth isn’t without risks. Stimulant or Depressant? One major issue is the “reflexive” relationship developing between the stock prices of DATCOs and the price of Bitcoin. When investors put money into DATCOs, these companies can raise capital more easily and use it to buy more BTC, thereby creating a feedback loop. This loop acts like a stimulant during bull markets, which pushes prices higher. But if the broader macro environment shifts to a risk-off setting, that stimulant could become a “depressant,” dragging prices down. A growing concern is that Bitcoin’s price is starting to follow risk-on behavior in the stock market more closely. Galaxy believes that “perhaps this was inevitable.” DATCOs have helped make Bitcoin more accessible to institutional investors, but in doing so, they may be creating a system where Bitcoin depends too much on equity markets – something that goes against the very ethos of being a non-correlated asset.

What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Symbol ETH Current price $3,775 Market cap $455.81B Trading volume (24-hour) $35.28B Circulating supply 120.71M All-time high $4,891 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time low $0.4209 on Oct 22, 2015 24-hour high $3,877.47 24-hour low $3,683.14 ET price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 16.40% 50-day SMA $2,909 200-day SMA $2,428 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green days 21/30 (70%) Ethereum (ETH) price analysis ETH is showing signs of overbought conditions on the daily chart with RSI above 72 and price near the upper Bollinger Band Momentum is weakening on the 4-hour chart with a declining MACD and negative Balance of Power suggesting short-term bearish pressure A pullback to support around 3735 is possible before ETH attempts to resume its uptrend Ethereum price analysis 1-day chart: Ethereum Stalls Below $3,900 as Overbought Signals Hint at Cooling Momentum Based on the 1-day chart on July 31, Ethereum (ETH) appears to be entering a cooling phase after a strong bullish rally. The price has pulled back slightly from recent highs near $3,878, suggesting potential short-term consolidation or correction. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 80.29 indicates that ETH is in overbought territory, typically a precursor to price stabilization or minor pullbacks. Bollinger Bands are widening, and ETH remains above the 20-day moving average, implying the broader trend is still bullish. However, traders should monitor support near $3,560. A sustained break below this could invite more downside, while holding above could resume upward momentum. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart Based on the 4-hour chart of Ethereum (ETH), the price appears to be consolidating in a tight range between $3,735 and $3,884, following an extended bullish rally. The MACD is showing signs of waning momentum, with a bearish crossover and declining histogram bars, suggesting that upward pressure is weakening. Bollinger Bands are narrowing, which typically signals reduced volatility and precedes a breakout. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The Balance of Power indicator at -0.79 also reflects growing seller dominance. If bears maintain momentum, ETH could retest the $3,735 support level. However, a decisive break above $3,884 might reinitiate the bullish trend with renewed volatility. ETH technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 3,136 BUY SMA 5 3,456 BUY SMA 10 3,578 BUY SMA 21 3,398 BUY SMA 50 2,910 BUY SMA 100 2,617 BUY SMA 200 2,428 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 3,281 BUY EMA 5 3,038 BUY EMA 10 2,687 BUY EMA 21 2,366 BUY EMA 50 2,266 BUY EMA 100 2,446 BUY EMA 200 2,661 BUY What to expect from ETH price analysis next? Based on both the 1-day and 4-hour charts, Ethereum (ETH) appears to be entering a potential consolidation or short-term correction phase after a strong bullish rally. On the daily chart, ETH trades near $3,776, just below the upper Bollinger Band at $4,154, while the RSI hovers above 72, suggesting overbought conditions. The MACD remains positive but shows early signs of slowing momentum. On the 4-hour chart, ETH is trading between $3,735 and $3,884 with a weakening MACD and a negative Balance of Power, indicating reduced bullish control. If selling pressure increases, ETH could test $3,735 support before attempting another breakout. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,209 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $37,590, maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $10,003 and a high of $11,875. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $25,413. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $53,844 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $56,126 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial. Recent news/ opinion on Ethereum At ETHGlobal, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized the urgent need for privacy solutions, urging developers to focus on four critical areas: private money, identity, voting, and messaging. He framed privacy as a civilizational priority, particularly for decentralized applications, encouraging the ecosystem to build tools that safeguard individual autonomy in an increasingly digital world. ""On a civilizational level, there's quite alot of urgency in us figuring out privacy."" @VitalikButerin urges builders at ETHGlobal to focus on 4 key categories of privacy apps to help solve for this: 1) private money 2) private identity 3) private voting 4) private messaging pic.twitter.com/1x49zNiVZm — ETHGlobal (@ETHGlobal) May 30, 2025 Ethereum price prediction July 2025 In July 2025, Ethereum is projected to reach a minimum price of $3,772, an average price of $4,125, and a maximum price of $4,243 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $3,772 $4,125 $4,243 Ethereum price forecast 2025 Changes within Ethereum itself and the larger market will affect its path in 2025. Vitalik Buterin’s RISC-V project could make Ethereum’s infrastructure stronger, which could bring in more developers and make it easier to scale. If Ethereum can successfully roll out protocol upgrades and more people start using Layer 2, momentum could return.

XRP in Focus: Technical Bounce Fuels Targets Up to $7 XRP is currently trading around $3.12, holding above key support near $3.00 following a recent breakout beyond $3.30. This has opened short-term targets in the $3.40–$4.00 range if momentum continues. Some analysts view patterns such as a broken bullish flag as signaling further upside toward $6 to $7+ later this year, supported by institutional activity and improved regulatory clarity.

This future might be closer than you think, according to a groundbreaking survey by Deloitte. The report reveals a staggering insight: 99% of chief financial officers (CFOs) surveyed anticipate utilizing cryptocurrency for various business functions in the long term. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it signals a profound shift in how corporate finance leaders view digital assets, pushing CFOs crypto adoption into the spotlight as a strategic imperative. What’s Driving This Monumental Shift in CFOs Crypto Adoption ? The Deloitte survey, titled ‘The Future of Digital Assets in Business,’ paints a clear picture of an evolving financial landscape. The near-unanimous expectation among CFOs regarding long-term crypto use underscores a growing recognition of digital assets’ potential beyond speculative trading. It suggests that businesses are increasingly looking at cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as tools for efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. A particularly telling finding from the survey, highlighted by The Block, is that approximately 40% of CFOs at companies boasting over $10 billion in revenue expect to incorporate cryptocurrency as an investment or payment method within the next two years. This isn’t a distant dream; it’s a near-term plan for some of the world’s largest enterprises. This forward-looking stance from major players is a powerful indicator of the impending widespread CFOs crypto adoption . So, what’s fueling this momentum? Several factors are at play: Efficiency Gains: Cryptocurrencies offer the promise of faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions, especially for cross-border payments. Innovation and Competitive Edge: Early adopters can gain a significant lead, exploring new business models and revenue streams enabled by blockchain technology. Customer and Partner Demand: As digital assets become more common, businesses may face pressure from clients and suppliers to support crypto transactions. Access to New Markets: Digital assets can facilitate entry into previously inaccessible global markets, reducing barriers to entry. The move towards CFOs crypto adoption is not merely about holding digital assets; it’s about leveraging their underlying technology to optimize operations and unlock new strategic opportunities. Navigating the Volatility: Key Concerns for CFOs Crypto Adoption While the enthusiasm for crypto is palpable, CFOs are inherently risk-averse, and their concerns are well-founded. The Deloitte survey identified price volatility as the top concern for 43% of CFOs regarding cryptocurrency investment. This is a critical point, as unpredictable price swings can complicate financial planning, treasury management, and risk exposure for traditional businesses. However, volatility is just one piece of the puzzle. Other significant concerns that CFOs must address include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving and often fragmented regulatory landscape across different jurisdictions poses significant challenges for compliance and legal clarity. Security Risks: The digital nature of cryptocurrencies means they are susceptible to cyberattacks, hacks, and custodial risks, necessitating robust security protocols. Operational Complexities: Integrating crypto into existing financial systems, accounting practices, and tax reporting requires specialized knowledge and significant technological investment. Lack of Internal Expertise: Many organizations lack the in-house talent and understanding to effectively manage and leverage digital assets. Addressing these concerns is paramount for successful CFOs crypto adoption . It requires careful planning, investment in technology and talent, and a proactive approach to risk management. Beyond Investment: Diverse Use Cases for CFOs Crypto Adoption When CFOs talk about using cryptocurrency, they’re often thinking beyond simply holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The potential applications are vast and extend into core business functions. Here’s how businesses are envisioning diverse use cases for CFOs crypto adoption : 1. Payment Methods: Cross-Border Transactions: Facilitating faster, cheaper international payments, bypassing traditional banking intermediaries. Instant Settlements: Enabling real-time payments, improving cash flow management. Reduced Fees: Potentially lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment processors. 2. Treasury Management: Alternative Reserve Assets: Diversifying corporate treasuries with digital assets to hedge against inflation or generate yield. Yield Generation: Exploring decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for institutional-grade lending and borrowing. 3. Supply Chain Finance: Tokenized Invoices: Streamlining invoice financing and payment processes. Enhanced Transparency: Tracking goods and payments across complex supply chains using blockchain. 4. Tokenization of Assets: Fractional Ownership: Enabling fractional ownership of illiquid assets like real estate, art, or intellectual property. New Funding Mechanisms: Creating security tokens for fundraising and capital formation. 5. Smart Contracts: Automated Agreements: Executing self-enforcing contracts for various business processes, reducing legal costs and disputes. Streamlined Operations: Automating royalty payments, licensing agreements, and other contractual obligations. These diverse applications highlight that CFOs crypto adoption is not a monolithic concept but a multifaceted strategy aimed at leveraging the inherent advantages of blockchain technology. The Strategic Imperative: Why CFOs Crypto Adoption Matters Now The overwhelming consensus among CFOs is not just a sign of curiosity; it’s a recognition of a strategic imperative. In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, businesses that fail to adapt risk being left behind. The current landscape suggests that CFOs crypto adoption is moving from a ‘nice-to-have’ to a ‘must-have’ for long-term viability and growth. Competitive Advantage: Early movers in the crypto space can build significant competitive advantages. This includes attracting innovative talent, developing new customer offerings, and establishing a reputation as a forward-thinking leader in their industry. Efficiency and Cost Savings: As explored earlier, the potential for reduced transaction fees, faster settlements, and automated processes can lead to substantial operational efficiencies and cost savings over time. Future-Proofing Business: By understanding and integrating digital assets, businesses can future-proof their operations against evolving market demands and technological shifts. This includes preparing for a future where central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and tokenized economies become commonplace. The strategic value of CFOs crypto adoption lies not just in the technology itself, but in its capacity to transform existing business models and unlock unprecedented opportunities for growth and innovation. Actionable Insights for Businesses Considering CFOs Crypto Adoption For businesses looking to embark on their journey towards CFOs crypto adoption , a measured and strategic approach is essential. Here are some actionable insights: Start Small and Pilot: Don’t attempt a full-scale integration overnight. Begin with pilot projects in controlled environments, such as accepting crypto for a specific product or using it for a limited number of vendor payments. This allows for learning and adaptation without significant risk. Educate and Upskill Your Team: Invest in training for your finance, legal, and IT teams. Understanding the basics of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and digital asset management is crucial for successful implementation. Seek Expert Guidance: Engage with legal, tax, cybersecurity, and blockchain consultants. The regulatory and technical complexities of digital assets necessitate specialized expertise to navigate compliance and security challenges effectively. Develop a Robust Risk Management Framework: Given the volatility and evolving regulatory landscape, a comprehensive risk management strategy is non-negotiable. This includes clear policies for custody, security, and financial reporting. Focus on Problem-Solving: Identify specific business challenges that cryptocurrency or blockchain technology can uniquely solve. Whether it’s streamlining cross-border payments or enhancing supply chain transparency, a problem-first approach ensures tangible benefits. Stay Informed: The digital asset space is rapidly evolving. Continuously monitor regulatory developments, technological advancements, and market trends to adapt your strategy accordingly. By following these steps, businesses can strategically position themselves to capitalize on the transformative potential of digital assets, making their foray into CFOs crypto adoption both successful and sustainable. The Inevitable Digital Horizon The Deloitte survey’s findings are a powerful testament to the growing inevitability of digital assets in the corporate world. With 99% of CFOs expecting long-term crypto use, it’s clear that the conversation has shifted from ‘if’ to ‘when’ and ‘how.’ While challenges like price volatility and regulatory uncertainty persist, the strategic benefits of efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage are too significant to ignore. Businesses that proactively embrace this shift, educating themselves and developing thoughtful strategies for CFOs crypto adoption , will be well-positioned to thrive in the digital economy of tomorrow. The future of finance is undeniably digital, and CFOs are leading the charge. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does “long-term” mean for CFOs crypto adoption ?

The primary risks include price volatility, regulatory uncertainty (lack of clear legal frameworks), cybersecurity threats (hacks, fraud), operational complexities (integration, accounting, tax), and reputational risks. Effective risk management strategies are crucial for mitigating these concerns. How can businesses prepare for future CFOs crypto adoption ? Businesses can prepare by educating their finance and IT teams, investing in pilot projects, consulting with legal and financial experts specializing in digital assets, developing robust internal policies for risk management and compliance, and staying updated on market and regulatory developments.

Tesla and MicroStrategy have famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Companies like PayPal and Square (Block) offer crypto payment and trading services. Many others are exploring blockchain for supply chain management, payments, and loyalty programs. Will all businesses eventually adopt cryptocurrency? While the Deloitte survey indicates a strong trend towards adoption, it’s unlikely that every single business will adopt cryptocurrency in the same way. However, the increasing integration of digital assets into global finance suggests that most businesses will need to understand and potentially interact with crypto in some capacity, whether directly or indirectly, to remain competitive.

The search for the best crypto to buy in 2025 is not about trends alone. It’s about spotting real value, clear growth paths, and strong user demand. From new ways to manage self-custody to fast, scalable blockchains, four names stand out. One project, Cold Wallet, is showing signs that support a bold 1000x potential. Cold Wallet (CWT): A Rewards System Changing Self-Custody Cold Wallet is not just another name in the wallet space. Its recent $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet added 2 million users, placing it next to major wallet platforms. Its key feature is a reward system that gives back each time users make a move on-chain. From gas fees to swaps to fiat transfers, users earn CWT, the utility token, when they act. The more CWT someone holds, the more cashback they receive. With reward levels that can reach 100% and a working referral system that pays in USDT, Cold Wallet is live and built to keep users engaged. The design is also well-planned: 10 billion total CWT supply, 4 billion set aside for presale, and a halving setup that helps rewards last over time. Right now, the presale is in stage 15, pricing CWT at $0.00923. This offers a rare entry point with big upside. There is also talk of a Layer 2 or custom rollup launch, which could lower gas costs and boost efficiency. That mix has led some to view Cold Wallet as one of the few live presales with 1000x potential. It’s not a promise, but it is worth close attention. For those exploring the best crypto to buy in 2025 with a strong user base, clear purpose, and working system, Cold Wallet stands out as a top pick. Avalanche (AVAX): Speed and Structure for Scalable Growth Avalanche remains one of the strongest platforms in terms of technical design. With subnets that allow for custom chains and fast execution, it serves projects that need performance and flexibility. Unlike many other Layer 1 chains that struggle with trade-offs, Avalanche delivers quick finality while keeping decentralization intact. Heading into 2025, AVAX is aiming for more institutional traction through tokenized assets and real-world use cases. Its Evergreen Subnet project is already drawing interest from fintech, and its recent focus on gaming infrastructure has caught the attention of major players. Though its price has seen periods of slow growth, long-term holders often point to its core tech as a steady foundation. For those assessing the best crypto to buy in 2025 from a base-layer technology angle, Avalanche offers a strong case, backed by on-chain activity that supports its rising value. Sui (SUI): A Blockchain Designed for Advanced Applications Backed by Mysten Labs, Sui is a Layer 1 chain with a focus on developers and new design models. Its object-based data structure lets assets behave more like programmable items, which works well for gaming, NFTs, and more complex app logic. This gives Sui a strong edge in building deep user experiences. The Sui Foundation has pushed forward with developer funding, ecosystem support, and learning programs to help build its network. Thanks to fast speeds and low costs, many DeFi, gaming, and social projects are already building on it. SUI still trades at a lower value than some competitors, which makes it a potential opportunity. For those choosing the best crypto to buy in 2025 based on usability and developer support, Sui has clear strengths. Cardano (ADA): A Careful Approach That’s Starting to Pay Off Cardano has followed a patient path. Though it faced criticism for slow development, it has become a complete smart contract chain with many active developers, DeFi projects, and a solid staking base. Its peer-reviewed process may take time, but it has built a strong and secure structure. In 2025, Cardano is working on Hydra to improve scaling without losing its focus on quality. Its push toward better chain connections and steady ecosystem funding shows it’s still building. While it may not deliver quick returns like early-stage projects, ADA is often chosen by those looking for lasting value. For anyone listing the best crypto to buy in 2025 with a long-term focus, Cardano continues to be a trusted option. Final Thought: Spotting Value Before It Moves Whether your focus is on wallets, DeFi layers, or app-focused blockchains, the next cycle is likely to reward function over hype. Cold Wallet tops this group not only due to its presale appeal but because it works within a value loop that already brings real usage, backed by a strong user base. As market momentum picks up, these four projects show a rare blend of growth potential, network strength, and readiness for scale. When looking for the best crypto to buy in 2025 , the smart move is often made before the real move happens. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

On July 30, 2025, Bolivia’s Central Bank (BCB) signed an important agreement with El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD). The goal is to collaborate on improving rules for digital assets and developing blockchain technology. This move shows that Bolivia wants a safer and more advanced financial system. A Strategic Partnership to Share Knowledge and Experience The agreement signed between the two countries is called a memorandum of understanding (MoU). This agreement allows both countries to exchange ideas and improve their knowledge of how to regulate and manage digital assets and blockchain technology . The MoU will allow Bolivia and El Salvador to exchange information on crypto laws and regulatory policies. Both countries will join forces to create tools that lower risks and make digital assets safer. They also plan to use blockchain technology to boost transparency and help spot fraud or misuse. The main goal is to build safe, well-regulated systems that support financial progress and new ideas. Learning from El Salvador’s Crypto Journey El Salvador has led the way in using cryptocurrency. In 2021, it became the first country to make Bitcoin (BTC) an official currency, under President Nayib Bukele. The Central American country continues to expand its Bitcoin reserves and has enacted favourable laws to attract crypto companies. This strategy has attracted major investors, including Tether, a prominent stablecoin issuer. Even though financial groups like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have criticized the move, El Salvador has stayed focused on its crypto plans . Now, Bolivia wants to learn from El Salvador’s experience to develop its own digital asset policies. Bolivia’s Policy Change and Growing Interest in Crypto This partnership follows Bolivia’s significant shift from strict crypto rules to a more open approach. In June 2024, the government passed Resolution 082/2024, which ended the long-term ban on digital assets. The new law allows crypto trading and digital payments under clear regulations. Since that change, Bolivia has seen a sharp rise in crypto use. In June 2024, crypto transactions were worth around $46.5 million. A year later, the value had grown to nearly $294 million. This shows that people and businesses in Bolivia are quickly adopting digital assets now that they are legal. Bolivia has also started to use crypto for trade. The government has allowed the national oil company, YPFB, to use digital currencies when buying fuel from other countries. This is especially important because Bolivia has been facing problems with foreign currency shortages. This move shows how serious the country is about including crypto in its national economy.

While many tokens gain attention through hype alone, only a select few show the potential for real-world adoption and substantial long-term growth. This article explores a curated list of projects that blend strong market momentum with tangible use cases as we move closer to 2025. 1. Cold Wallet (CWT): The Presale That Could Lead the 2025 Boom Cold Wallet isn’t just another token, it’s quickly becoming one of the most talked-about presale plays of the year. Now in Stage 15 at a price of $0.00923 per CWT, the project just made headlines with its acquisition of Plus Wallet, instantly adding 2 million users to its network and increasing on-chain activity. What makes Cold Wallet different is how it flips the usual crypto model. Rather than charging users for every transaction, it rewards them. Actions like gas payments, token swaps, and ramp usage earn cashback in CWT. These rewards are tied to user tiers and can go as high as 100%. It’s a major shift, and one that’s attracting a growing base of supporters. With 40% of the total 10 billion CWT supply reserved for presale and user rewards, the project is focused on actual usage instead of artificial scarcity. With a rapidly expanding user base, Cold Wallet is being touted by some as a 500x opportunity in the making. If there’s one presale worth following in 2025, this could be it. 2. Cardano (ADA): A Conservative Pick With Long-Term Upside Cardano often divides opinion. Detractors say its development pace is slow, while supporters highlight its deliberate focus on scalability and security. Regardless of where you stand, ADA maintains one of the largest crypto communities and billions in staked assets. Smart contracts are live, sidechains are in progress, and new DeFi tools are arriving on the platform. If Cardano manages to simplify DeFi for everyday users, a goal also pursued by Cold Wallet but through a reward-based approach, it could regain investor momentum. ADA might not deliver 500x returns, but it offers a solid growth potential with less volatility. For many, it serves as a stable long-term hold with room for gains as adoption improves. 3. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Coin With Lasting Power Bonk may have started as a meme on Solana, but it’s grown into something far more influential. After a breakout rally in late 2024, Bonk has caught the eye of serious investors looking for community-driven tokens with actual use. Its community is highly engaged, and Bonk has found real footing across several Solana DeFi platforms and NFT projects. This level of integration has helped it stay relevant even after the meme coin craze cooled down. Bonk still carries risk, but it’s proven its ability to deliver strong returns when retail momentum kicks in. With Solana gaining more attention and meme coins staying popular, Bonk is well-positioned to keep climbing. Among meme-driven assets, it remains one of the best crypto coins with real staying power. 4. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Crowd Favorite That Keeps Coming Back Dogecoin continues to hold its place in the crypto world, not for its tech, but for its strong brand and massive retail following. With minimal fees, widespread name recognition, and support from public figures like Elon Musk, DOGE is often a first stop for new investors. Talk around potential use cases through platforms like X (formerly Twitter) or other Musk ventures continues to stir speculation. Despite the memes, DOGE has survived and thrived through multiple market cycles. It might not be the most advanced crypto project, but Dogecoin remains one of the best crypto coins for visibility and culture. When markets pick up, it tends to lead the charge in retail interest. Identifying the Best Crypto Coins to Buy Now As the crypto market shifts toward utility and actual adoption, Cold Wallet has emerged as a standout with its reward-driven model and active user base. Its 500x presale potential could set the tone for 2025. Meanwhile, Bonk and Dogecoin continue to rally communities, and Cardano holds its ground as a methodical, long-term blockchain project. For anyone building a portfolio around the best crypto coins , this mix of high-upside and established names offers both risk and reward. Cold Wallet is the bold bet. The rest are proven players that still have room to grow.

This development is set to revolutionize how developers integrate advanced AI capabilities into their applications, offering unprecedented access to a diverse range of cutting-edge models. For those keenly observing the intersection of technology and digital innovation, especially within the cryptocurrency and blockchain sphere where rapid development is key, Poe’s move marks a pivotal moment, streamlining the path to powerful AI integration. Unlocking Innovation with the Poe API : A Game Changer for Developers Quora’s AI platform, Poe, made waves with its recent announcement: a new Poe API designed to empower developers. This API is not just another tool; it’s a gateway, allowing developers to seamlessly tap into a vast ecosystem of AI models and bots for their own applications. What makes this particularly appealing is the lack of a separate fee structure for the API itself. Instead, usage is cleverly integrated into Poe’s existing point-based subscription plans, making it a natural extension for current and future subscribers. This innovative approach simplifies access, removing common barriers to entry for those looking to leverage sophisticated AI without complex, per-call billing structures often seen elsewhere. It’s a clear signal that Poe is committed to fostering a vibrant developer community, making advanced AI more accessible and manageable for a wide array of projects, from simple integrations to complex, AI-driven applications. A Universe of AI Models at Your Fingertips Imagine having a comprehensive toolkit filled with the most advanced AI models for every creative and functional need. That’s precisely what Poe’s new API offers. Developers gain immediate access to over 100 models spanning various modalities, including voice, text, image, and video generation. This multimodal capability is crucial in today’s dynamic digital landscape, where applications increasingly require diverse AI functionalities. Some of the prominent models available through the API include: Imagen 4: For high-quality image generation. GPT Image 1: Versatile image creation capabilities. Flux Kontext: Likely for contextual understanding or generation. Seedream 3.0: Potentially for unique visual or conceptual generation. Veo 3, Runway Gen 4 Turbo, Kling 2.1: Advanced video generation models. ElevenLabs: Renowned for realistic voice synthesis. Lyria: Another powerful model, potentially for text or creative content. This rich selection means developers can pick and choose the best AI for their specific use case, ensuring their applications are powered by leading-edge technology. The flexibility to switch between or combine these models within a single application through a unified API is a significant advantage. Demystifying the Developer API : How Poe’s Pricing Works Understanding the cost structure is vital for any developer API integration. Poe’s model is straightforward and point-based, aligning with their existing subscription tiers. Each model call consumes a set number of points, providing transparency and predictability. For instance, a low-quality image generation via GPT-4o at a 1:1 aspect ratio and 1024 x 1024 size would cost 328 points. Poe offers a range of subscription plans tailored to different usage levels: Plan Name Monthly Cost Points Included Basic $4.99 10,000 points per day Pro $19.99 1 million points per month Advanced $49.99 2.5 million points per month Premium $99.99 5 million points per month Enterprise $249.99 12.5 million points per month Beyond these plans, developers have the flexibility to purchase additional points at a rate of $30 for 1 million tokens. This ‘pay-as-you-go’ option for add-on tokens means customers can top up their accounts with any dollar amount, receiving tokens based on this competitive rate. This granular control over spending is a welcome feature for developers managing project budgets. The Strategic Advantage of Quora Poe for Application Development The release of this API solidifies the position of Quora Poe as a formidable player in the AI ecosystem. By offering an OpenAI-compatible chat completion API, Poe ensures broad compatibility with existing developer tools and workflows. This means applications already built to work with OpenAI’s APIs can seamlessly integrate Poe’s diverse model offerings. Current examples of tools that can leverage this API include: Cursor: A powerful code editor. Cline: Likely a command-line interface tool. Continue: A development tool, possibly for continuous integration. Roo: Another application or framework. This compatibility significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developers looking to switch or augment their AI backends, providing a compelling strategic advantage. Poe isn’t just offering models; it’s offering a versatile, developer-friendly infrastructure. The Future of the AI Platform : What’s Next for Poe? Poe’s journey as an AI platform is far from over. Gareth Jones, Poe’s Product Lead for Creators and Developers, shared insights into the exciting roadmap ahead. Future enhancements are focused on providing even greater control and flexibility for developers. Key areas of development include: Private Bot API Integration: Allowing developers to use their privately built bots on Poe through the API, enhancing customization and proprietary AI solutions. Improved Key Management: Streamlining the process of managing API keys for enhanced security and ease of use. Budget Management Functionality: Based on developer feedback, Poe plans to introduce tools for better tracking and managing point consumption, providing greater financial oversight. Beyond the API, Poe continues to innovate on the consumer front, having recently introduced tools for easy creation of AI-powered apps and templates for various bot types (server bots, prompt bots, image generation bots). This dual focus on both developers and end-users ensures a holistic and evolving AI ecosystem. Quora’s Poe API represents a monumental leap forward in making advanced AI accessible and actionable for developers worldwide. By consolidating access to a vast array of multimodal AI models under a flexible, point-based subscription, Poe is not just providing tools; it’s fostering an environment where innovation can truly flourish. This strategic move promises to accelerate the development of next-generation applications, making sophisticated AI integration more straightforward and cost-effective than ever before. As the AI landscape continues to evolve at a breathtaking pace, Poe’s commitment to empowering developers ensures it remains at the forefront of this transformative technology.

He urged President Trump to effect the revised tariffs immediately through an executive order instead of drafting agreements that could eventually become “vague.” Akazawa said Japan and the U.S. had agreed to reduce the tariffs on auto imports from 25% to 15%. He praised Trump’s deal-making skills, saying they were the kind that demanded answers. The Economic Revitalization Minister said he dared not remain silent through the negotiations, otherwise that would be “the end of it.” He asked Trump many questions, raising his hand a dozen times to ask “one more…” The trade negotiator stressed the deal’s importance, saying his country had lowered the rates set to kick off on August 1 by 10 percentage points. He pointed out that this move helped Japan avoid losses of up to 10 million Yen. Akazawa also mentioned the plan offering $500B (80T Yen) through state-affiliated institutions like NEXI and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). However, he emphasized that the funds were aimed at providing “economic security” in the bilateral trade deal. The Minister said the funds would be categorized as loans, investments, and loan guarantees. Akazawa fears a written agreement could be ‘misinterpreted’ The Economic Revitalization Minister expressed fear that the U.S. would decide to make a written deal for the Japan-U.S. tariff agreement. He pointed out that a written deal could easily be “misinterpreted,” adding that it was “bad to create one now.” Akazawa acknowledged that an agreement would require confirmations between Trump and his cabinet members. He asserted that this could affect the document’s content, leading to further delays. However, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and seven leaders of the ruling and opposition parties called for a written agreement during a July 25 meeting. They said an agreement needed to be signed despite fears that interpretation differences could raise misunderstandings between the U.S. and Japan. Akazawa referenced the $500 billion Japan-U.S. deal to stress his point of view on deal misinterpretation. He noted that Japan’s losses would be in the tens of billions range if Japan allowed the U.S. to keep 90% of the profits, according to the latest 9-1 profit-split trade agreement, instead of 50% (at most). “The idea that cash will fly from Japan to the United States, and that 90% will be taken and we will become a slave state is completely off the mark and the height of absurdity.” – Shigeru Ishiba , Prime Minister of Japan However, Akazawa defended this deal, saying the people who opposed it as “selling out Japan” were wrong. He pointed out that 1% to 2% of the $500 billion would go to investment; the rest would be loans and loan guarantees. Akazawa claimed that Japan would make money from collecting interest on loans, assuming nothing happens. Tokyo could save up to $68 billion (~¥10T) if the tariff-cutting deal with the U.S. went through. Minister believes Japan may end up giving up less than expected The Economic Revitalization Minister suggested that Japan might give up much less in the long run than previously expected. He clarified that the $500 billion investment deal was not limited to supporting only the U.S. and Japan. Akazawa said officials from other countries were also sifting through trade deals to figure out the terms. However, he mentioned that details of how the deal would be implemented remained unclear. It was also unclear when the revised tariffs or the new investment program would kick in. The Trump administration touted the U.S.-Japan deal as a model for other countries. The absence of a signed deal meant there was still room for negotiations. However, Akazawa expressed concerns over remarks made by U.S. officials claiming that the U.S. would only lower tariffs once the agreement was created. Last week, the veteran trade negotiator said he expected 15% tariffs on Japanese shipments on August 1. Prime Minister Ishiba said the negotiated deal protected “what must be protected” and suited the national interests of both countries. He pointed out that Japan obtained the biggest tariff reduction margin among countries that had trade surpluses with the U.S. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

But with $4 million in longs gone, can the bulls survive a sell-wall showdown? This price jump comes after fresh capital and deals brought life back into Ethena, but charts now flash warning signs as the recovery cools and buyers lose steam. Source: CoinGecko Ethena’s Anchorage Deal Paves Way for Historic U.S. Stablecoin Launch The Ethena ecosystem uses a unique model that combines crypto assets and derivatives to issue a stable dollar-equivalent token, USDe. This system relies on a strategy known as “delta hedging” to manage the volatility of cryptocurrencies. Recently, Ethena Labs introduced a new feature called “Liquid Leverage” in collaboration with Aave. This feature allows users to borrow using a 50/50 mix of sUSDe and USDe, earning around 12% promotional rewards. The goal is to drive more user activity and boost TVL across both the Ethena and Aave ecosystems . Despite the USDe setback in Germany , Ethena continues to forge impactful partnerships that strengthen its ecosystem. This is reflected in its Total Value Locked, having grown to an impressive $8.597 billion. Source: DefiLlama A key development is Ethena Labs’ partnership with Anchorage Digital, a federally chartered crypto bank, to bring its stablecoin, USDtb, onshore in the United States. This milestone not only ensures compliance with the new GENIUS Act but also marks USDtb’s debut in the U.S. market. Evidence of this impact can be seen in the spike in accumulation patterns across Ethena’s ecosystem. Over the past week alone, large holders have acquired more than 79.25 million $ENA tokens. This whale activity coincides with trading volume exploding over 400% from $6 billion in June to $27 billion in July. Whales have accumulated 79.25 million Ethena $ENA in the past week! pic.twitter.com/bD8NAthAwu — Ali (@ali_charts) July 30, 2025 The momentum from large players continues with participation from prominent investor Arthur Hayes , co-founder of BitMEX, who added 2.16 million $ENA to his portfolio, bringing his total to 7.76 million $ENA. Adding to the bullish narrative, stablecoin-focused Ethena treasury, StablecoinX Inc., announced a $360 million capital raise to acquire $ENA tokens , backed by admission plans for its Class A stock (“USDE”) on NASDAQ. But can $ENA’s rally hold above $0.68 with an aggressive bullish setup? The technical analysis has all the answers. $ENA’s V-Shaped Recovery Cools Into Resistance as Derivatives Build The V-shaped recovery on $ENA/USDT has stalled just beneath short-term resistance at $0.68 after a strong bounce from the $0.54 base. The asset’s price momentum faded heading into July 31, with sellers stepping in aggressively near the highs. The volume footprint chart confirms this inflection. Although total volume rose beyond 99 million in the last session, the delta skewed heavily negative at –5.58 million, indicating strong market selling despite liquidity absorption. Earlier blocks near $0.665 to $0.668 also indicate this selling dominance, with multiple candles posting negative delta between –2.0 and –2.6 million even as the price attempted to stabilize. This combination of price pushing into resistance and selling pressure showing up in the footprint suggests that the latest push may be running out of steam and could reverse soon. Regarding overall structure, the green ascending trendline off the $0.54 low is still intact, but momentum indicators are beginning to show a weakening stance. The asset’s RSI sits around 61, just below the overbought threshold, and has started to slope downward, which is a classical move that often precedes a pullback or a move sideways. What adds to the concern here is the crowded long positioning within derivatives markets. According to Coinglass, open interest has increased by 16.32% while volume has jumped 59.74%, both indicating a rise in speculative activity. Over the past 24 hours, $3.94M in longs have been wiped compared to $2.87M in shorts, which, when compared to some other markets, is still a manageable figure given the total leverage deployed. That said, this setup favors a pullback unless bulls can reclaim $0.68 with more market buys than sells and dislodge the passive sell wall showing up in the order book. If the $0.645 area gives way, watch for a move down toward $0.615–$0.62 as the next logical support, followed by $0.585 if the correction deepens.

Just as blockchain disrupted traditional finance, artificial intelligence is now reshaping creative industries. The Iconfactory, a design and development shop synonymous with beloved apps like Twitterrific, finds itself at a critical juncture, forced to sell off parts of its app catalog. This strategic shift is largely attributed to the profound AI impact on its core business, signaling a wider disruption that echoes across the tech world. The Iconfactory’s Crossroads: A Legacy Under Pressure For years, The Iconfactory stood as a beacon of meticulous app design and development, particularly on Apple’s iOS platform. Their flagship app, Twitterrific, was once a cornerstone of the iPhone experience, offering a refined way to engage with Twitter. However, the company recently announced it’s at a crossroads, citing a lack of resources to maintain its extensive app portfolio. While initially framed as a capacity issue, the underlying reality is a harsh economic one: the need to focus solely on applications with a strong return on investment. The decision means beloved side projects, despite having a loyal user base, are no longer sustainable. Ged Maheux, co-founder of The Iconfactory, expressed the difficulty of this choice. The company will continue to develop and support apps such as Tapestry, Linea Sketch, Wallaroo, and Tot. However, they are actively seeking “serious offers” for others, including their intellectual property and source code. This move underscores the immense pressure traditional software companies face in an increasingly automated world. AI’s Unforeseen Blow to App Design Firms A significant factor in The Iconfactory’s current predicament is the disruptive influence of AI. Sean Heber, an Iconfactory developer, candidly stated on Mastodon, “ChatGPT and other AI services are basically killing @Iconfactory, and I’m not exaggerating or being hyperbolical.” This isn’t about AI replacing mobile app usage directly. Instead, it’s about how AI, particularly generative AI, is commoditizing the very services that sustained firms like The Iconfactory. For decades, The Iconfactory generated substantial revenue by offering specialized app design services. This included: Icon Design: Crafting the distinctive visual identities for apps. App Interface Design: Creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user experiences. Marketing Asset Creation: Developing promotional materials for app launches. Branding and Consulting: Providing strategic guidance on digital presence. These bespoke services, once a vital income stream, are now directly challenged by AI tools. As Heber lamented, “I know nothing I say is going to get anyone to stop using ChatGPT and generating a new app icon in 5 minutes for the app that you also had ChatGPT write for you in a few hours, but I’m not sure what the rest of us are supposed to do about making enough money to, ya know, live.” This highlights the immediate threat AI poses to specialized creative roles within the app development ecosystem. The Twitterrific Legacy and Its Demise Beyond the growing specter of AI, The Iconfactory faced another devastating blow in 2023: the shutdown of its most popular app, Twitterrific. Elon Musk’s decision to ban all third-party Twitter clients effectively put Twitterrific, Tweetbot, and similar apps out of business overnight. This abrupt change severed The Iconfactory’s primary revenue source, forcing them to plead with users to decline App Store refunds just to stay afloat. Heber openly acknowledged the compounding effect of these events: “First Twitter/Elon killed our main app revenue that kept the lights on around here, then generative AI exploded to land a final blow to design revenue.” He also dispelled any notion of the company being a large, wealthy entity, emphasizing, “There’s only 6 of us and there’s no war chest.” The loss of Twitterrific revenue left the company vulnerable, making the subsequent AI disruption even more impactful. Navigating New Horizons: Tapestry and the Future of App Development In the wake of Twitterrific’s demise, The Iconfactory pivoted, focusing on the open social web as a new frontier. They launched Tapestry, an innovative app designed to aggregate sources across various platforms, including RSS feeds, YouTube, Bluesky, podcasts, Mastodon, Reddit, Tumblr, and Micro.blog. Tapestry offers advanced tools for content organization, custom feeds, and content filtering, along with an extensible architecture for third-party developers. While Tapestry represents a valiant effort to forge a new path in app development , its future remains uncertain. Open social media platforms, though growing, still cater to a niche audience compared to mainstream tech giants. Heber described Tapestry’s Kickstarter as a “Hail Mary,” acknowledging that subscription numbers aren’t yet sufficient to offset the revenue lost from Twitterrific. This illustrates the challenge of finding sustainable new models when core revenue streams are suddenly cut off and new markets are still nascent. Beyond the Iconfactory: A Broader Look at AI’s Influence The struggles of The Iconfactory are not isolated incidents but rather a microcosm of the broader shifts occurring due to the AI impact . As AI tools become more sophisticated, they democratize creation, allowing individuals and small teams to generate designs, code, and content at unprecedented speeds and costs. While this empowers many, it simultaneously threatens the traditional business models of agencies and firms specializing in these very services. The rise of “vibe coding”—the ability to generate functional code and designs based on simple prompts—raises questions about the value of human input in creative processes. While AI-generated designs can be quick and cheap, they often lack the nuanced understanding, bespoke quality, and security considerations that human experts bring. The Iconfactory’s reputation for high-quality design stems from years of experience and a deep understanding of user needs, qualities that are difficult for AI to replicate fully. The long-term implications for quality, security, and human creativity within the app ecosystem remain to be seen. The Iconfactory’s journey serves as a poignant reminder that even well-established and respected companies must constantly adapt to technological shifts. The combined pressures of platform changes and rapid AI advancements highlight a challenging new era for traditional software development and design. Their story is a testament to the resilience required in an industry where innovation can be both a creator and a destroyer of business models.

Per a Reuters poll, economists expected inflation to fall to 1.9%. In June, the country’s inflation stood at 2%, matching the European Central Bank’s target. Economists and analysts are still looking for the effects of President Trump’s tariffs According to preliminary figures, German inflation data from key states varied, as rates remained flat in certain areas but shifted marginally elsewhere. Inflation in North Rhine-Westphalia held firm at 1.8%, corresponding to June. Likewise, Baden-Württemberg maintained its rate at 2.3%. On the other hand, Bavaria’s state inflation rose to 1.9% from 1.8% in the previous month, while Lower Saxony’s rate slipped to 1.9% from 2.2%. Germany is still the biggest economy in the euro zone, making its inflation data especially impactful for the bloc. The Eurozone is set to release its inflation data later this week, with expectations pointing to 1.9%. According to the data, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, held steady at 2.7% in July, unchanged from June. Meanwhile, services inflation, a key metric, eased to 3.1% from 3.3% the month before. Analysts are watching inflation developments carefully amid the rollout of President Trump’s tariff policies, which have included sector-specific measures and temporarily modified reciprocal duties. Last week, the US and EU agreed on 15% tariffs on EU imports after a round of talks. Analysts, however, expect the levies to drive prices higher in the US, but the extent of their impact on inflation beyond US borders is still uncertain. A day before Thursday’s inflation release, Destatis published an initial estimate of Germany’s Q2 GDP, revealing a slight 0.1% contraction, compared to 0.3% growth in the previous quarter. Spain leads growth as Germany and Italy slip According to Eurostat, in Q2, the Eurozone’s seasonally adjusted GDP surged 0.1% and by 0.2% in the EU, quarter-on-quarter. Year-on-year, seasonally adjusted GDP grew by 1.4% in the euro area and 1.5% in the EU in Q2 2025, slightly down from 1.5% and 1.6% in the previous quarter. Spain led quarterly growth among EU Member States with a 0.7% increase, trailed by Portugal, 0.6% and Estonia, 0.5%. GDP fell in Ireland by 1.0% and edged down in Germany and Italy, both by 0.1%. In the first quarter of 2025, GDP climbed 0.6% in the euro area and 0.5% in the EU, recovering from zero growth in the euro zone during the previous quarter. In Q4 2024, economists expected GDP to grow by 0.1%, following a stronger-than-anticipated 0.4% expansion in the third quarter. However, weaker performance from Germany and France—the euro zone’s two largest economies—dampened the overall result. Q4 data showed Germany’s GDP contracted by 0.2%, France experienced a minor decline, and Italy’s economy remained steady in the quarter. Nonetheless, Spain’s economy grew by 0.8% in Q4, and Portugal posted an even sharper 1.5% expansion, fueled by a boost in household spending. Get seen where it counts.

Crypto gambling has grown rapidly in 2025 as players demand faster gameplay, smoother withdrawals, and trustworthy platforms.

Many platforms lead with bold offers and big numbers, but once you look closer, things often get complicated. High wagering rules, limited currencies, and restrictions can turn a promising deal into a letdown. This article takes a close look at three major platforms, Stake.com, LeoVegas, and Spartans , to find out who really delivers the most worthwhile crypto casino rewards in 2025. From bonus terms to actual usability, here’s what players need to know before picking a platform. Stake.com: High Bonus Offers With Heavy Strings Attached Stake.com definitely knows how to get attention. Its welcome bonuses are hard to miss, with flashy percentages and promises of major returns. But if you dig into the details, the catch becomes clear. There are significant wagering requirements, meaning players must bet the bonus several times before they’re allowed to cash out anything. These conditions vary based on game type, which only adds to the confusion. For many players, especially those new to the platform, this makes the bonus feel more like an obstacle. While Stake.com looks great on the surface, its crypto casino rewards lose their appeal once the fine print comes into play. LeoVegas: Personalized Bonuses With Limited Crypto Support LeoVegas tries to set itself apart with a personalized approach. It lets users choose from various bonus types depending on the games they prefer, which sounds convenient at first. But there’s a downside, especially for those using cryptocurrencies. Many of LeoVegas’ bonuses are tied to specific fiat currencies. If you’re depositing in crypto, or even just outside popular regions, you may find you’re not eligible or your options are limited. That makes things tricky for users hoping for seamless crypto casino rewards. It might be a solid pick for EUR or GBP players, but it doesn’t quite work as well for crypto-first users. Spartans: Honest Bonus Terms With Full Crypto Compatibility Spartans takes a much simpler route, and that’s where it shines. The welcome offer here is straightforward: a 300% match bonus up to $200 with a low $5 minimum deposit. What makes it different is the clear, upfront information. There’s a 35x wagering requirement for casino and 10x for sports, and all conditions are spelled out plainly. Crypto deposits are fully accepted without any conversion problems, and the bonus funds arrive fast. Plus, there’s a 10x cap on bonus withdrawals, so players know from the start what to expect. This transparency makes Spartans stand out as a top choice for players who want real crypto casino rewards without having to decode complicated rules. Clear Value Beats Flashy Promises This isn’t just about the biggest numbers, it’s about how easy those bonuses are to use. Stake.com leans heavily on flashy offers but makes players jump through too many hoops. LeoVegas looks flexible but falls short when it comes to crypto accessibility. Spartans does the opposite. It offers a simple match, fast access to funds, and conditions that anyone can understand. That’s exactly what most players want, clarity, not complexity. For those focused on getting the most out of their crypto casino rewards, Spartans clearly puts users first. Crypto Bonuses That Work the Same for Everyone Another area where Spartans gets it right is crypto support. While Stake.com and LeoVegas offer crypto options, the experience isn’t always smooth. You might face different interfaces, restrictions on certain promotions, or bonus terms that change based on your token. Spartans eliminates that confusion. Whether you’re using Bitcoin, USDT, or other supported currencies, the bonus remains the same. There are no surprise fees or exclusions. For players who prefer betting exclusively with crypto, this kind of consistency makes Spartans one of the few platforms where crypto casino rewards work exactly as expected. Final Thoughts Players shouldn’t have to crunch numbers just to figure out if a bonus is worth it. In 2025, users want simple value and clear rules, not a long list of exceptions. While Stake.com and LeoVegas each have strengths, their bonus structures often create more hassle than help. Spartans flips that script. From your first deposit, you get straightforward terms, reliable crypto support, and bonuses that are easy to use. In a space where many offers sound better than they are, Spartans delivers what it promises: crypto casino rewards that actually make sense. And in the long run, that’s what really matters.

In a recent post on X, Schwartz remarked, “I don’t have the numbers in front of me, but I’m pretty sure XRP’s use as a bridge in Ripple Payments dwarfs every other asset.” His comment highlights XRP’s central position in Ripple’s infrastructure and sets the stage for a broader discussion about how XRP and stablecoins are used in today’s digital financial systems. XRP: The Dominant Bridge in Ripple Payments Schwartz’s statement reinforces what Ripple has long maintained: XRP is the core bridge asset for cross-border transfers within its payment network. This isn’t by chance. XRP is natively integrated into the XRP Ledger (XRPL), allowing for automatic pathfinding between currencies and seamless asset bridging, capabilities that few digital assets can match. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I'm pretty sure XRP's use as a bridge in Ripple Payments dwarfs every other asset. I think stablecoins win for collateral use cases (volatile collateral is annoying) and edge use cases (volatility at the on/off ramps is also… — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 30, 2025 Ripple’s on-demand liquidity (ODL) product relies on XRP to settle transactions in seconds without the need for pre-funded accounts. With throughput of up to 1,500 transactions per second and near-instant settlement, XRP dramatically reduces friction and cost for global transfers. These advantages make it the preferred asset in Ripple’s liquidity corridors, giving it a dominant footprint in real-time value movement across currencies. Stablecoins: The Go-To for Collateral and Edge Use Cases While XRP leads in bridging value , Schwartz acknowledges that stablecoins hold the upper hand in other domains. Their price stability makes them ideal for use as collateral and for transactions at the on/off ramps of the financial system, where volatility is a disadvantage. Stablecoins such as USDC and USDT are widely used in lending, remittances, and institutional treasury operations. In 2024 alone, stablecoin payment volumes exceeded $1.3 trillion, according to industry reports. Their predictability is crucial in environments that demand minimal risk and regulatory clarity, making them the default for many financial players who require stability above all. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Holding Digital Assets vs. Stablecoins Schwartz also suggests that unless one is highly risk-averse, top-tier digital assets, including XRP, are more appealing to hold than fiat-backed stablecoins. This is especially true for users seeking long-term upside and utility beyond just preserving capital. The trade-off is clear: stablecoins offer short-term predictability, while assets like XRP offer broader functionality and speculative potential. XRPL Utility Drives XRP’s Value Schwartz concludes by reaffirming that more real-world use of the XRP Ledger will naturally lead to greater utility, and thus value, for XRP. As the ledger’s native asset, XRP is essential to its operation. Unlike other networks where native tokens can be sidestepped, XRP remains embedded in every transaction path and exchange pair on XRPL. Although most institutional Ripple transactions are still off-chain due to compliance considerations, ongoing efforts to integrate permissioned liquidity and regulatory frameworks could unlock more on-chain activity in the future. David Schwartz’s latest insights reaffirm XRP’s foundational role in Ripple Payments. While stablecoins dominate specific functions due to their stability, XRP’s deep integration into Ripple’s infrastructure gives it a unique and irreplaceable position. As XRPL adoption grows, so too does the long-term utility and value proposition of XRP. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Ripple Exec Says It’s Not What You Think,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrps-secret-weapon-ripple-exec-says-its-not-what-you-think/,"According to comments from Ripple CTO David Schwartz, XRP is still at the heart of Ripple’s payments system, even as the company highlights its new stablecoin, RLUSD.

Ripple’s lead tech officer stressed that XRP remains the primary bridge asset in cross-border transactions—and that wider use of the XRP Ledger will keep boosting the altcoin’s utility and value. XRP Remains Core To Ripple Payments In a recent exchange, an XRP supporter pointed out that Ripple now mentions RLUSD more often than XRP. Schwartz replied that he doesn’t have the exact figures on hand, but he’s sure that Ripple uses XRP far more than any other digital asset for its payments service. I don’t have the numbers in front of me, but I’m pretty sure XRP’s use as a bridge in Ripple Payments dwarfs every other asset.

That role helps institutions send funds quickly and cheaply, even when market swings might make a stablecoin less ideal. Ripple launched RLUSD in December 2024 to meet demand for price stability. According to Schwartz, stablecoins like RLUSD make sense in use cases that depend on a fixed value—such as when firms use crypto assets as collateral or enter and exit markets without risking 5% swings overnight. He noted that Hidden Road, one of Ripple’s big partners that works with over 300 institutions, chose RLUSD as its main collateral asset in May 2025. That move shows RLUSD’s appeal for stability-focused tasks. Stablecoin Role Versus Altcoin Utility Schwartz drew a clear line between the two tokens. For tasks where price predictability matters most, a stablecoin helps avoid hiccups. But for the majority of payments, he believes a liquid asset like XRP does a better job—unless someone wants to avoid risk entirely. Holding major digital assets can capture upside, and XRP fits that need better than cash, he said. Adoption Drives XRP Demand Looking ahead, Schwartz stressed that real-world use of the XRP Ledger will naturally drive more demand for the crypto. As more projects and institutions tap into XRPL’s fast transaction speeds and low fees, they’ll need XRP to power each move. That design makes it harder to sidestep the coin’s native token than it is on other networks, where developers can wrap or bypass the base coin entirely. Schwartz’s remarks arrive amid community worries that XRP is being sidelined in favor of stablecoins. The choice by Hidden Road to back RLUSD raised eyebrows back in May 2025. Related Reading: Don’t Blink: 1,000 XRP Could Be The Best Move You’ve Made—Expert XRP’s Use Case But by highlighting how deeply XRP is woven into XRPL’s mechanics—and reminding investors that the altcoin’s volume still outstrips any other asset in Ripple Payments—Schwartz sent a clear message: XRP’s use won’t fade, even as stablecoins gain ground. Based on these comments, Ripple appears to be taking a two-pronged approach: use RLUSD where price stability is critical, and rely on XRP for its proven liquidity and built-in role on the ledger. That strategy could help keep both tokens busy in different parts of the crypto economy, ensuring XRP stays relevant even as new products emerge.

49313565,https://cryptonews.com/?p=402203,1753984924,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/49313565.jpeg,Conflux (CFX) Surges 7% Amid Breakout Rally and Major Upgrades,https://cryptonews.com/news/conflux-cfx-surges-7-amid-breakout-rally-and-major-upgrades/,"$CFX rebounded 7% after yesterday’s brutal 27% plunge, with bulls now battling to hold the key $0.20 level. As China’s sole government-approved Layer-1 blockchain celebrates new transaction milestones, weakening technicals suggest this recovery may be fragile. The volatile price action comes amid Conflux Network’s expanding influence in Asia’s regulated crypto sector, where its unique compliance status fuels adoption. Conflux Network ($CFX): Scalable Innovation Driving Ecosystem Growth Conflux Network is a Layer-1 blockchain built for speed, compliance, and real-world use, especially in Asia. The platform leverages its unique Tree-Graph consensus mechanism to achieve scalability. This mechanism, in combination with Conflux Network’s hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus, allows high transaction speeds and low costs. This makes the network suitable for various decentralized applications and Web3 development. A key differentiator is Conflux’s unmatched regulatory alignment. As the only Chinese government-approved public blockchain, it plays an important role in the region’s digital infrastructure.

Conflux Network combines technological innovation, regulatory compliance, and institutional partnerships, factors that may support its growth and adoption in 2025. However, after rallying sharply from the $0.191 low, $CFX/USDT has shown weakening momentum near the $0.2338 resistance level, where price action stalled during the session. $CFX/$USDT: Short-Term Buyers Fatigued Below Resistance The Conflux token initially responded well to the support test, bouncing with strength through the $0.21 handle and attempting to reclaim lost ground. However, the reaction at the upper boundary of the move lacked substantial follow-through strong enough to move the needle, and the subsequent rejection has shifted the short-term tone back to caution.

The rejection from $0.28 two days earlier marked the peak of an aggressive vertical rally. This was followed by a sustained sell-off and base formation near $0.191, but the recovery since then has failed to reclaim the mid-range. The inability to break through $0.2338 and form a higher high weakens the bullish case. Current price action, hovering near $0.211, suggests a potential rollover if buyers don’t step in soon. The RSI indicator doesn’t fare better, as it has cooled off too. After topping above 70, it has shifted down toward 42, without any signs of bullish divergence. The MACD offers a similar message. Both the main line and signal line are tightly compressed around zero, with histogram bars diminishing. There is little evidence of building trend strength on either side.

During the move up toward $0.2338, positive delta supported the price. But the tone changed just beneath $0.218, where several candles started printing negative delta despite solid total volume. We can infer that passive sellers have stepped in to absorb market buys. The strong buying effort between $0.211–$0.213 was met with resistance, and since then, net delta has turned red again. Unless price reclaims the $0.218–$0.220 area in strength, we expect further downside pressures to resume. However, a price slump below $0.209 would expose $0.201 and potentially invite a retest of the $0.191 base. For now, the bounce appears to be losing steam as supply caps further progress.

Visa will now support the Stellar (XLM) and Avalanche (AVAX) blockchains, the company announced today, adding two new networks to its existing Ethereum and Solana support. With the new update, Visa will begin supporting two dollar-denominated stablecoins, PayPal USD (PYUSD) and Global Dollar (USDG), in partnership with Paxos, while also supporting the euro-denominated EURC stablecoin issued by Circle. This means Visa's platform now supports payments in both US dollars and euros. Supporting four stablecoins, USDC, PYUSD, USDG, and EURC, on four different blockchains in total, Visa aims to accelerate cross-border transactions and increase inter-system compatibility for fintech companies, banks, and digital wallet developers with this step.

With ETH trading at $3,800 at press time, still 24% below its all-time high, pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst CoinCare says its subdued futures funding rates and deep-pocketed accumulation suggest the uptick is far from over. The Funding Rate Divergence According to CoinCare, Ethereum’s ongoing four-month rally is quite similar in magnitude to a previous surge that happened between the start of Q4 2023 and the end of Q1 2024. However, unlike that run, where funding rates became overheated, today’s futures funding levels remain near pre-rally lows. “In the current rally, there has been no overheating in funding rates,” wrote CoinCare. “In fact, the current funding rates are closer to the levels seen before the October 2023 rally began.” CoinCare believes this is a sign that “a cooldown after a short-term surge is essential,” following which ETH could “enter a full-fledged rally” driven by renewed speculative interest. Beyond derivatives, fundamental and on-chain forces also support Ethereum’s potential breakout. For instance, heavyweight Ethereum investors recently acquired 220,000 ETH, worth an estimated $850 million, in just 48 hours. This boosted their holdings to 23.5% of the asset’s supply, a record high that should lessen market liquidity and amplify an upward push. At the same time, spot ETH ETFs have attracted roughly $5 billion in just 17 days, adding steady demand from regulated investment vehicles. Meanwhile, exchange balances have plunged to a near-decade low of 19 million ETH, with more than 1 million coins withdrawn in the past month alone, potentially reducing immediate sell-side pressure. Price Momentum Looking at the market, ETH has gained 1.7% in the past 24 hours, 7.9% in the last week, and 57% across 30 days. It is currently trading within a tight $3,708 to $3,874 range, with $4,000 as the next key resistance level and $3,500 providing critical short-term support. Analyst Ali Martinez believes going above $4,100 could trigger “the real breakout” for ETH, marking a major psychological shift and potentially opening the door for a run towards its 2021 all-time high. Despite short-term warning signals, such as an overbought RSI and a potential pullback toward $3,300 highlighted in CryptoPotato’s latest analysis , the bigger on-chain picture remains decisively bullish. If CoinCare’s funding-rate thesis proves accurate and institutional demand continues to grow, ETH’s next chapter could be written not with caution but with new highs.

In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 145,200 followers on the social media platform X that, based on the short-term holder (STH) cost basis model, Bitcoin may increase more than 19% from its current value. The STH cost basis model is an on-chain metric that estimates the average price at which short-term Bitcoin holders acquired their coins. The metric can be used to spot potential entry and exit points. “As long as the $105,450 support holds, Bitcoin could be on track for a move to $125,230 and potentially $141,770, based on the short-term holder cost basis.” Source: Ali Martinez/X The analyst also uses the cumulative value-days destroyed (CVDD) metric, which looks at the value of each Bitcoin transaction while giving weight to the number of days since the coins were last moved. The CVDD is used to spot potential market tops and bottoms. “The next Bitcoin top could be at $149,679!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading for $118,250 at time of writing, up marginally in the last 24 hours. Next up, Martinez says that Ethereum may increase more than 35% from its current value based on pricing bands derived from ETH ‘s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator, which is used to identify the key levels of support. “As long as the $3,300 support holds, Ethereum could be on track for a move to $4,220 and potentially $5,140, based on the MVRV Pricing Bands.” Source: Ali Martinez/X ETH is trading for $3,787 at time of writing, down marginally on the day. Looking at XRP , the analyst says that the payments token may be forming a bullish reversal pattern on the four hour chart and potentially increase by more than 16% from its current value. “XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60.” Source: Ali Martinez/X XRP is trading for $3.10 at time of writing, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the analyst says that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator – which is used to determine potential points of reversal for an asset – suggests Dogecoin ( DOGE ) may soon have a bounce. “Dogecoin is ready for another leg up as the TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the daily chart!” Source: Ali Martinez/X DOGE is trading for $0.21 at time of writing, down 1.6% on the day.

Recently, a significant shift has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike: a noticeable decline in Bitcoin daily active addresses . What does this intriguing development signify for the world’s leading cryptocurrency? Is it a fleeting blip or a signal of deeper underlying trends? What Exactly Happened to Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses? According to data shared by Santiment on X (formerly Twitter), the landscape of Bitcoin’s on-chain activity saw a considerable change throughout July. Specifically: In early July, Bitcoin daily active addresses were robust, ranging between 570,000 and 800,000, indicating healthy user engagement. By July 31st, this number sharply declined to approximately 380,000, a significant contraction in unique addresses participating in transactions. In contrast, Ethereum demonstrated remarkable stability during the same period, maintaining around 511,000 active addresses, offering a compelling point of comparison. This divergence highlights distinct user behaviors and network priorities, prompting a deeper dive into what drives such fluctuations. Why Do Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses Matter? Understanding Network Health When we talk about Bitcoin daily active addresses , we refer to the unique blockchain addresses active as either a sender or receiver on a given day. This metric is a vital indicator of a cryptocurrency network’s health and utility: Organic Adoption & Utility: High active addresses suggest genuine adoption, implying more people use Bitcoin for transactions, not just holding. Network Demand: Increased activity can correlate with higher demand for block space and transaction fees. User Engagement: Reflects community engagement; a vibrant network signifies a healthy, growing ecosystem. Market Sentiment: A sustained decline can precede or coincide with waning investor interest and bearish sentiment, while an increase signals renewed interest. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for assessing Bitcoin’s fundamental strength beyond just its price chart. Decoding the Drop: Potential Factors Behind the Decline in Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses A significant drop in Bitcoin daily active addresses is rarely due to a single cause, but rather a confluence of market sentiment, technological shifts, and broader economic conditions. Potential reasons include: Bear Market Fatigue: Prolonged bear markets lead to “hodler” behavior, reducing daily on-chain transactions as users wait out downturns. Speculative activity also wanes. Consolidation of Holdings: Large holders may consolidate Bitcoin across fewer addresses, especially when moving to secure, custodial solutions. Shift to Layer-2 Solutions: As networks like the Lightning Network mature, more transactions occur off the main blockchain, not reflected in base-layer active addresses. Exchange Activity & User Onboarding: Changes in exchange wallet management, rebalancing, or reduced high-frequency trading can impact numbers. Fewer new users or less active existing users also contribute. Seasonal & Macro Factors: Crypto markets experience seasonal dips. Broader macroeconomic concerns, regulatory uncertainty, or lack of positive news can slow network engagement. Consider these factors holistically rather than jumping to conclusions based on a single metric. How Does Ethereum’s Stability Contrast with Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses? The resilience of Ethereum’s active addresses, maintaining around 511,000 while Bitcoin daily active addresses saw a steep decline, provides a compelling contrast. This divergence can be attributed to several key differences in their ecosystems and primary use cases: Diverse Ecosystem & Utility: Ethereum’s strength lies in its robust dApp ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, Web3), driving consistent transaction volume. Bitcoin primarily serves as a store of value. Smart Contract Functionality: Ethereum’s smart contracts allow complex interactions beyond simple transfers (lending, staking, gaming), boosting active address counts. Developer Activity: High developer activity on Ethereum leads to continuous innovation, attracting and retaining users. Staking & DeFi Participation: Ethereum 2.0 and liquid staking incentivize long-term holding and DeFi participation, contributing to a stable user base. This comparison shows that while both are leading cryptocurrencies, their utility and user engagement models lead to different on-chain behavior during market fluctuations. Table: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Active Address Trends (July) Metric Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Active Addresses (Early July) 570,000 – 800,000 ~511,000 (stable) Active Addresses (July 31st) ~380,000 ~511,000 (stable) Trend in July Sharp Decline Consistent Stability Primary Utility Focus Store of Value, P2P Cash Smart Contracts, dApps, DeFi, NFTs Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors Amidst Changing Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses For investors, a decline in Bitcoin daily active addresses can be a cause for concern, but it’s crucial to approach such data with a balanced perspective. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Metrics: Don’t panic. Look beyond active addresses to transaction volume, miner revenue, and long-term holder behavior for a holistic view. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: Bitcoin’s core value proposition as a decentralized, scarce digital asset remains. Short-term fluctuations don’t negate its long-term potential, especially with Layer-2 adoption. Consider Macroeconomic Context: Global economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events influence investor sentiment and on-chain activity. Evaluate Layer-2 Growth: Monitor the Lightning Network’s growth. More off-chain transactions indicate network efficiency, even if base-layer counts are impacted. Stay Informed & Skeptical: Verify data sources and understand metric methodologies. Market intelligence should inform, not dictate, your strategy. Patience and research are paramount. Conclusion: What’s Next for Bitcoin’s Network? The recent drop in Bitcoin daily active addresses to 380,000, as highlighted by Santiment, reminds us of the crypto market’s dynamic nature. While this decline might signal reduced network engagement, a deeper analysis reveals a complex interplay of market cycles, investor behavior, Layer-2 maturation, and the distinct utility of blockchains like Ethereum. Evaluating Bitcoin’s health requires a holistic view, integrating various on-chain metrics, market sentiment, and broader macroeconomic trends. This shift isn’t necessarily a doomsday scenario but an invitation for a more nuanced perspective on digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Bitcoin daily active addresses? Bitcoin daily active addresses refer to the number of unique blockchain addresses that were active as either a sender or a receiver of Bitcoin on a given day. Why did Bitcoin’s active addresses drop in July? The drop in July could be attributed to a combination of factors including bear market fatigue, consolidation of holdings by large entities, increased use of Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, and general macroeconomic conditions affecting investor sentiment. How does Ethereum’s active address count compare to Bitcoin’s? During July, Ethereum maintained a more stable active address count of around 511,000, contrasting with Bitcoin’s sharp decline. This is largely due to Ethereum’s diverse ecosystem of dApps, DeFi, NFTs, and smart contract functionality. Does a drop in active addresses mean Bitcoin is failing? Not necessarily. While a decline can indicate reduced short-term engagement, it doesn’t automatically mean failure. It’s crucial to consider other on-chain metrics and broader market trends for a complete picture. What other metrics should I look at to assess Bitcoin’s health? Beyond active addresses, consider transaction volume, miner revenue, exchange inflows/outflows, long-term holder behavior, and the growth of Layer-2 solutions to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin’s network health. How do Layer-2 solutions impact active address counts? Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network handle transactions off the main blockchain. While this improves scalability and reduces fees, these off-chain transactions are not typically counted in the base-layer’s daily active addresses, potentially leading to a lower reported number even if overall activity is high.

While Ethereum has already tapped into TradFi markets through its approved spot ETF , Cardano is still awaiting the SEC’s green light. That could change with the October 23 deadline for a potential spot ADA ETF, which could open the gates to previously untapped demand if approved. CARDANO ETF APPROVAL ODDS HIT 90%!

Cardano Price Analysis: Are Whales Positioning for a Surge? This consistent long-term accumulation of ADA comes alongside a descending triangle pattern forming since the late 2024 Cardano price peak. ADA / USDT 4-hour chart, descending triangle and flag pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. Following the latest rejection, a newly formed bullish flag structure points to a possible continuation rally toward March highs, supported by improving momentum indicators. The RSI has rebounded sharply from the oversold zone at 25 to 45, often a sign that selling pressure is waning and buyers are re-entering. The MACD has formed a golden cross, surpassing the signal line. On the 4-hour chart, this often signals a short-term uptrend tagging shape. If ADA can hold the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.73 as support, a common accumulation zone in corrections, the flag could extend toward its projected target of $1. This would confirm a breakout of the larger triangle pattern, triggering a potential rally toward higher resistance at $1.20 and its potential $1.63 target, a possible 108% gain from current levels. However, to reach the $10 milestone, the approval of a Cardano spot ETF will likely be required to drive significant new demand from traditional markets. Traders Can Magnify Altcoin Season Gains With Leverage The saying “millionaires are made in bear markets” is true, latecomers who FOMO into bull markets often catch only the tail end of market gains, but that only applies to spot traders. Leverage traders play a different game. They don’t wait for the market to move, they predict it. Now with CoinFutures, the brand-new leveraged trading platform from the hugely popular CoinPoker platform, getting started is simpler than ever. With CoinFutures , you decide if a crypto is going up or down, how much to stake, and how much leverage to use, up to 1000x. This leverage is what multiplies potential winnings (and potential losses). But, thanks to built-in stop-loss orders and the option to cash out any time, you control your exposure and risk. For spot traders, a 1000x is a rare occurrence requiring the luck to get in early or the conviction to play the long game. For leverage traders, it’s a strategic choice. You can try out CoinFutures by downloading the CoinPoker app, with no KYC or exchange accounts required to sign up.

The filing starts a new stage of using crypto in traditional finance, allowing in-kind compensation and passive income. Jito Labs , along with Bitwise, Multicoin, VanEck, and Solana Institute, filed a petition to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow the usage of Solana liquid staking tokens in ETF and ETP.

Solana allows for regular SOL staking, but there is also liquid staking, which includes both passive income and a newly issued token for additional operations. The filing urged to include liquid staking for eight products that filed S-1 forms with the SEC on June 13, 2025. Jito Labs urges the spread of liquid staking tokens to ETP and possibly ETF For now, only ETPs allow for staking, but the practice may spread to ETFs with additional requests. The SEC is also still exploring the legal side of staking , for both Ethereum and Solana ETFs, while fund issuers are pushing to include various forms of staking and in-kind compensation. Jito Labs and its associates claimed LSTs are capital-efficient and low-risk, and can benefit ETP investors. So far, the SEC has not explicitly addressed LSTs on Solana or other networks, though there are general guidelines on proof-of-stake networks. LSTs can work as a proxy for direct staking, and the SEC is urged to consider the mechanism for Solana and other chains. LSTs are most common on Ethereum and Solana, and are a tool to secure the network, while also putting idle tokens to work. Requests for staking started in 2024 The initial ETF and ETP filings omitted the issue of staking, as they focused on BTC products. The inclusion of Ethereum and later Solana ETP filings raised the issue of staking. The first filings avoided the topic due to technical uncertainties, taxation issues, and the fear of pushing crypto innovation too quickly to mainstream investors. Currently, Solana carries over $7.8B in value through its liquid staking tokens. Most of the tokens are issued by validators or other infrastructure projects on the Solana chain, among which JitoSOL is the leader. One of the risks for LSTs is their relative volatility. While SOL traded at $177.75, LSTs ranged between $220 and $200. Jito Staked SOL (JITOSOL) traded at $218.57. Marinade’s token traded as high as $235.06. LSTs are often used in DeFi protocols and have varying price discovery mechanisms. There is no clear standard for staking service, and each has relatively complex rules. The biggest risk for LSTs is ‘slashing’, where flawed validators can have their tokens confiscated. Therefore, some LST issuers are competing to offer safe or vetted services. Recently, Marinade Finance slashed and restaked 340,000 SOL, removing validators from its list. The process is not entirely detailed to mainstream finance regulators, and the SEC will have to research the conditions of staking and slashing. Get seen where it counts.

This isn’t just a futuristic dream; it’s the bold new vision being championed by the Ethereum Foundation for the Ethereum blockchain. As Ethereum celebrates its remarkable 10-year anniversary, the foundation has unveiled an ambitious roadmap. They’re setting their sights on achieving an astounding 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) and, critically, ensuring the network is resistant to the potential threats posed by quantum computing. This groundbreaking announcement, reported by Unfolded via X, signals a profound commitment to making Ethereum not just a leading blockchain, but a truly global, resilient, and future-proof platform. What are Ethereum’s Ambitious Goals for the Future? The core of the Ethereum Foundation’s latest declaration revolves around two pivotal targets: a massive leap in transaction throughput and an essential upgrade in cryptographic security. Let’s unpack what these goals mean for the future of decentralized technology. 10,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS): Currently, Ethereum processes far fewer transactions per second, leading to network congestion and higher gas fees during peak demand. A target of 10,000 TPS represents a monumental increase in the network’s capacity. To put this into perspective, Visa, a global payment giant, processes an average of around 1,700 transactions per second, though it can handle peaks significantly higher. Achieving 10,000 TPS would position Ethereum to handle a truly global scale of activity, from everyday payments to complex decentralized finance (DeFi) operations and burgeoning non-fungible token (NFT) markets. This goal aims to make using Ethereum faster, cheaper, and more accessible for everyone. Quantum Resistance: This might sound like something out of a science fiction novel, but it’s a critical long-term security measure. Quantum computers, still largely in their nascent stages, have the potential to break many of the cryptographic algorithms that secure today’s digital communications and, crucially, blockchain networks. By developing ‘quantum-resistant’ cryptography, the Ethereum Foundation is proactively safeguarding the network against a future where powerful quantum machines could theoretically compromise existing encryption methods, ensuring the long-term integrity and security of all assets and transactions on Ethereum . Why is Ethereum Scalability Crucial for Mass Adoption? For any technology to achieve widespread adoption, it must be both efficient and user-friendly. For Ethereum , scalability is the key to unlocking its full potential and moving beyond niche use cases to truly serve a global audience. Current challenges, such as fluctuating gas fees and occasional network slowdowns, can deter new users and limit the types of applications that can effectively run on the blockchain. Achieving 10,000 TPS would dramatically transform the user experience on Ethereum . Imagine: Lower Transaction Costs: With more space on the network, transaction fees (gas) would likely decrease significantly, making micro-transactions and frequent interactions much more viable. Faster Confirmations: Waiting minutes for a transaction to confirm could become a thing of the past, leading to a smoother and more responsive user experience for dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces. New Use Cases: Increased throughput opens the door for entirely new categories of applications that require high transaction volumes, such as decentralized social media platforms, gaming, or even supply chain logistics at scale. The path to achieving this level of scalability for Ethereum involves a multi-pronged approach, including advancements in rollup technology (like Optimistic and ZK-rollups) and the eventual implementation of sharding, which will divide the blockchain into smaller, more manageable segments to process transactions in parallel. These technical innovations are central to the vision of a high-throughput Ethereum . Securing Ethereum’s Future: The Quantum Resistance Imperative While 10,000 TPS addresses the present and near-future needs for speed, quantum resistance addresses a more distant, yet potentially catastrophic, threat. The development of quantum computers poses a significant challenge to classical cryptography, which forms the bedrock of modern digital security, including blockchain technology. Here’s why quantum resistance is vital for Ethereum : The Threat of Quantum Algorithms: Algorithms like Shor’s algorithm, if run on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, could theoretically break the public-key cryptography used to secure blockchain wallets and transactions. This means a quantum computer could potentially derive a private key from a public key, thereby gaining control over funds. Proactive Defense: The Ethereum Foundation’s focus on quantum resistance is a proactive measure. Rather than waiting for quantum computers to become a widespread threat, they are investing in research and development to integrate ‘post-quantum cryptography’ (PQC) into the network. PQC refers to cryptographic algorithms that are believed to be secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers. Long-Term Trust and Security: For Ethereum to remain a foundational layer for the global digital economy for decades to come, it must be impervious to future technological advancements that could undermine its security. Quantum resistance ensures the long-term integrity, immutability, and trustworthiness of the Ethereum blockchain and all assets stored on it. This commitment demonstrates the foundation’s foresight and dedication to building a truly enduring and secure decentralized platform. The Road Ahead for Ethereum: Navigating Challenges and Driving Innovation Achieving goals as ambitious as 10,000 TPS and quantum resistance is no small feat. It involves overcoming significant technical hurdles, coordinating a global community of developers, and continuous innovation. The Ethereum Foundation plays a crucial role in stewarding these efforts, providing grants, coordinating research, and fostering the open-source development environment that has defined Ethereum since its inception. The roadmap for Ethereum is often described in phases, following the successful ‘Merge’ that transitioned the network to Proof-of-Stake. Future upgrades like ‘The Surge’ (focused on sharding), ‘The Verge’ (focused on Verkle trees for efficiency), ‘The Purge’ (focused on reducing historical data), and ‘The Splurge’ (miscellaneous improvements) are all steps towards realizing these ambitious targets. Each phase brings its own set of challenges, requiring meticulous planning, rigorous testing, and broad consensus from the community. The beauty of Ethereum lies in its decentralized nature and the collective intelligence of its developer community. While the foundation sets the overarching goals, the actual implementation is a collaborative effort, relying on groundbreaking research, innovative engineering, and a shared commitment to the vision of a more scalable, secure, and decentralized future. The Grand Vision: A Resilient and Scalable Ethereum for All The Ethereum Foundation’s announcement of 10,000 TPS and quantum resistance goals marks a pivotal moment in the blockchain’s history. It’s a declaration of intent, signaling a future where Ethereum is not just a leader in the crypto space, but a fundamental piece of global digital infrastructure, capable of handling immense transaction volumes while remaining impervious to future threats. This vision underscores a profound commitment to security, efficiency, and accessibility, ensuring that Ethereum continues to evolve and empower a truly decentralized world. As the blockchain matures, these ambitious targets pave the way for a more robust, secure, and universally adopted decentralized ecosystem, benefiting users, developers, and innovators across the globe.

The two exchanges, Upbit holding the position as Korea’s dominant crypto platform and Bithumb ranking second, collectively control the majority of the nation’s digital asset trading volume. According to a July 30 local report , the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) convened meetings with executives from Korea’s five leading cryptocurrency exchanges to address these new financial products and voice regulatory concerns regarding leverage-associated risks and potential deficiencies in investor protection frameworks. Regulators have expressed concerns over high-risk lending products from Upbit and Bithumb, prompting a push for industry self-regulation. https://t.co/Tv1hXouWRi — Regulation Asia (@RegulationAsia) July 31, 2025 Growing Regulatory Compliance for Crypto Lending and Margin Trading Services Bithumb initiated its cryptocurrency lending service on July 4, allowing users to borrow digital assets using their existing cryptocurrency holdings or Korean won as security, offering leverage ratios up to 4:1. The service encompasses 10 digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Tether. Coinciding with Bithumb’s launch, Upbit rolled out a comparable lending platform supporting three cryptocurrencies: Tether, Bitcoin, and Ripple. The platform is similarly collateralized by crypto assets or traditional currency deposits. These platforms allow traders to borrow cryptocurrencies they don’t possess and execute short sales , generating profits when asset values decline, essentially creating short-selling mechanisms within the virtual asset marketplace. Financial authorities have expressed strong concern that these exchanges may be contravening Korea’s Lending Business Act through their high-risk operations. They particularly pointed out Bithumb’s 4:1 leverage ratio, which surpasses the 2:1 leverage limitation established for Korea’s traditional equity markets. Ki Young Ju, a Seoul-based crypto investor and founder of CryptoQuant, has also noted the dangerous nature of excessive margin trading, particularly when leverage exceeds 4:1 ratio. In a recent social media post, Ju emphasized that utilizing leverage above 5:1 exponentially increases the probability of liquidation within a 24-hour period, noting: “Bitcoin moved more than 2% on most days (82%) this month. If you play 50x Russian roulette every day, the chance of surviving a week is only 0.000612%.” Regulators have expressed concerns over high-risk lending products from Upbit and Bithumb, prompting a push for industry self-regulation. https://t.co/Tv1hXouWRi — Regulation Asia (@RegulationAsia) July 31, 2025 Following regulatory pressure, Upbit discontinued its Tether lending service, citing concerns that providing stablecoin lending in exchange for fees could be construed as consumer lending activity, potentially subjecting the platform to Korea’s lending regulations. Bithumb responded by modifying its service framework while preserving its 4:1 leverage structure. The exchange has temporarily suspended new lending applications due to an exhausted lending inventory. The FSC and FSS are planning to establish an industry collaborative task force to develop voluntary self-regulatory guidelines for cryptocurrency lending and margin trading operations. South Korean Crypto Firms Grow From Gambling Status to Corporate Ventures These developments occur amid a series of investment sector restrictions as Seoul regulators prioritize consumer protection measures. On July 23, the FSS advised asset management companies to avoid “excessive inclusion” of cryptocurrency-related stocks such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy in their ETF portfolios. However, some regulatory constraints may be reconsidered as South Korea considers reclassifying cryptocurrency trading and brokerage operations as “venture companies,” a designation that would provide access to government subsidies, tax benefits, and financial assistance programs. Current legislation, implemented in 2018, specifically prevents blockchain-based cryptocurrency firms from obtaining venture certification, categorizing them alongside gambling establishments and entertainment venues. The proposed regulatory amendment seeks to reverse this classification, potentially legitimizing the country’s expanding digital asset industry. Regulators have expressed concerns over high-risk lending products from Upbit and Bithumb, prompting a push for industry self-regulation. https://t.co/Tv1hXouWRi — Regulation Asia (@RegulationAsia) July 31, 2025 Venture company status in South Korea provides numerous advantages, including tax reductions and enhanced access to government-backed financing programs.

Rather than trading in cash for ETF shares, asset managers can now trade actual Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) directly for ETF shares. The mechanism reduces conversion costs, enhances accuracy in pricing, and streamlines business activities for ETF providers. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas referred to it as “a plumbing fix,” insisting that it doesn’t change how individual investors engage with crypto funds. “This does not mean retail can swap IBIT for actual bitcoin,” he further added. Bitwise Pioneers the Way Bitwise Asset Management was the initial U.S. issuer to roll out in-kind redemptions following the SEC’s July 29 ruling. The firm said that both of its Bitcoin and Ether ETFs would begin to offer this structure simultaneously. “It just makes the pipes a little better,” Balchunas added. Previous SEC leadership, including Gary Gensler, had opposed in-kind models because of perceived risks around where the crypto assets came from. Toward Traditional Market Parity The structural upgrade brings crypto ETFs more in line with the structure of traditional exchange-traded products. Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro stated that it puts crypto funds in line with institutional-grade ETF structure. 21Shares’ Federico Brokate referred to the move as fundamental to further integration between crypto and the mainstream financial system. ETFs Keep Adding Up Bitcoin The SEC decision comes on the heels of continuous growth in crypto ETF holdings. As of July 31, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold over 1.29 million BTC — approximately 6.18% of circulating supply. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust leads the pack with 740,601 BTC worth nearly $88 billion. Fidelity’s fund is second with over 205,000 BTC, with Bitwise holding over 40,000 BTC in its ETF.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-07-31 19:19:10

The announcement came during a speech at the America First Policy Institute, where Atkins outlined plans to bring crypto asset distributions back to America and establish regulatory frameworks for digital asset trading. JUST IN: SEC launches 'Project Crypto' to help make America the “crypto capital of the world.” pic.twitter.com/if6lHudlTt — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 31, 2025 The initiative follows the release of a 166-page White House report titled “ Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology ,” which categorizes cryptocurrency as “ next-generation technology ” alongside railroads and the internet. The document condemns the Biden administration’s regulatory approach as creating a “hostile environment” for crypto businesses and calls for reversing policies that drove fintech firms offshore. Framework Targets Onshoring Crypto Businesses Through Clear Guidelines Project Crypto seeks to establish clear rules for crypto asset distributions, custody, and trading through public notice and comment procedures. Atkins directed Commission staff to draft regulations addressing the confusion surrounding the Howey test, which has led entrepreneurs to treat all crypto assets as securities prophylactically. The SEC plans to develop guidelines helping market participants categorize crypto assets as digital collectibles, digital commodities, or stablecoins based on economic realities. Atkins also emphasized that being deemed a security should not carry stigma, noting that many issuers prefer the flexibility securities laws afford for product design and investor protections. The initiative includes purpose-fit disclosures, exemptions, and safe harbors for initial coin offerings, airdrops, and network rewards. Atkins stated that the goal is to ensure issuers include Americans in distributions rather than excluding them to avoid legal complexity. Source: Paul Atkins on X The SEC will also address tokenized securities requests from Wall Street firms and Silicon Valley unicorns seeking to distribute tokenized stocks, bonds, and partnership interests within the United States. Atkins reported that firms are “lined up at our doors” requesting tokenization capabilities previously available only offshore. Super-App Vision Facilitates Integrated Trading Platforms The SEC plans to allow securities intermediaries to offer comprehensive services under a single license through “super-app” functionality. Broker-dealers with alternative trading systems could offer trading in non-security crypto assets alongside crypto asset securities, traditional securities, and services like staking and lending without requiring multiple federal or state licenses. Atkins directed staff to develop frameworks allowing non-security crypto assets and crypto asset securities to trade side-by-side on SEC-regulated platforms. The Commission will evaluate its authority to permit non-security crypto assets subject to investment contracts to trade on unregistered venues. The approach allows state-licensed crypto platforms not registered with the SEC to list certain crypto assets while allowing CFTC-regulated platforms to offer products with margin capabilities. As a result, the approach eliminates the need for additional Congressional authority while unlocking greater asset liquidity. Project Crypto also addresses outdated custody requirements that limited custodial service provider options. The SEC plans to modernize custody rules for registered intermediaries, moving away from the previous administration’s “special-purpose broker-dealer” framework and SAB 121 guidance . Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary of the SEC, confirmed that SAB 122 has officially replaced SAB 121 in the regulatory framework. #SAB121 #CryptoAccounting #USSEC https://t.co/feyCzuakYH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 24, 2025 Innovation Exemption Speeds Market Entry for New Business Models The SEC is considering an innovation exemption that would allow registrants and non-registrants to quickly enter markets with new business models that don’t fit existing regulations, for which a similar standard was released for ETFs earlier today. SEC establishes new crypto ETF listing standards enabling approximately dozen major digital assets to gain approval by October through streamlined framework. #SEC #ETFs https://t.co/grlJtGb5tH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 31, 2025 Innovators could comply with principles-based conditions, achieving core securities law policy goals rather than burdensome prescriptive requirements. Proposed conditions include periodic Commission reporting, whitelisting functionality, and restrictions on tokenized securities not adhering to compliant token standards like ERC3643. Atkins also emphasized commercial viability as the “true north” for evaluating various models. Additionally, the initiative coincides with growing corporate adoption. A Deloitte survey found 23% of North American CFOs expect their treasury departments to use cryptocurrency within two years, rising to nearly 40% among firms with $10 billion or more in revenue. Deloitte reports CFOs eye crypto treasury adoption, with governance, regulation, and workforce readiness emerging as next-phase priorities. #deloitte #treasury https://t.co/boA1QnYOwm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 31, 2025 Forty-three percent cited price volatility as their top concern, followed by accounting complexity and regulatory uncertainty. The White House report also confirms plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve administered by the Treasury, though it admits the reserve is not yet operational. The document calls for Congress to affirm people’s rights to self-custody digital assets and engage in peer-to-peer transactions without financial intermediaries. Despite these positive regulatory announcements, Bitcoin is still trading relatively flat, slightly above $118,000, with Ethereum gaining modestly above $3,760.

It turns out that some of your seemingly private conversations with ChatGPT, when shared, are not remaining as discreet as you might assume. A simple search on Google or Bing, filtered to include URLs from the ChatGPT domain, can unveil a bizarre and sometimes unsettling window into the minds of strangers. This unexpected phenomenon highlights a significant ChatGPT privacy concern that every user should be aware of. Unveiling Public AI Chats: What’s Being Exposed? Imagine the surprise of finding someone’s personal queries about renovating their bathroom, their attempts to grasp complex astrophysics, or even their recipe ideas, all laid bare on a public search engine. These aren’t just abstract data points; they are intimate glimpses into individual lives. The shared links to ChatGPT conversations offer a peculiar insight into human curiosity and vulnerability. The original intent behind ChatGPT’s sharing feature was likely for users to easily share interesting or helpful conversations with friends or colleagues. Users must deliberately click a ‘share’ button on their chat interface and then a ‘create link’ button to generate a shareable URL. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, states that ‘your name, custom instructions, and any messages you add after sharing stay private.’ However, the reality of search engine indexing paints a different picture, leading to unintended public AI chats being discoverable by anyone. Examples of Exposed Data: Personal Career Details: One user’s attempt to rewrite their resume for a specific job application, complete with enough details to potentially locate their LinkedIn profile, reveals a concerning level of personal information. The irony, as noted, is that the individual seemingly did not get the job, making the public exposure even more poignant. Sensitive Inquiries: Some conversations delve into highly sensitive or controversial topics, resembling discussions found on forums known for extreme viewpoints. This underscores the potential for highly personal or even controversial beliefs to become publicly associated with an individual, even if indirectly. Absurd and Trolling Interactions: While some shared chats are mundane, others reveal users engaging in increasingly absurd or trollish questions, such as asking if one can microwave a metal fork (the answer is a resounding ‘no’). These interactions, though humorous to some, still contribute to a public digital footprint that users likely never intended to create. One memorable example cited was an AI-generated guide titled ‘How to Use a Microwave Without Summoning Satan: A Beginner’s Guide.’ The Role of Google Indexing in Data Exposure The core of this issue lies in how search engines, particularly Google, perform Google indexing . When a web page is created and made accessible on the internet, search engine crawlers discover and add it to their index, making it searchable. While OpenAI’s sharing mechanism creates a unique URL, users likely do not anticipate that these links, even if shared privately, could become part of the public index. There’s a subtle but critical distinction here compared to other cloud services. For instance, when people share public links to files from Google Drive with settings like ‘Anyone with link can view,’ Google generally does not surface these links in search results unless they have been explicitly posted or linked on other public, trusted websites. This implies a level of gatekeeping or discernment. User Expectation vs. Indexing Reality The discrepancy between what users expect when sharing a ChatGPT link and what actually happens with search engine indexing is a significant point of concern. Here’s a quick comparison: Aspect User Expectation (when sharing ChatGPT link) Indexing Reality (for shared ChatGPT links) Audience Only those with the direct link. Anyone using a search engine, potentially globally. Privacy Statement OpenAI states name, custom instructions, and new messages stay private. The entire shared chat log becomes publicly discoverable. Discoverability Low, unless explicitly published elsewhere. High, if the link is discovered by search engine crawlers. Control User controls who receives the link. Search engines control indexing once link is public. OpenAI did not provide comment on this matter prior to the original publication. A Google spokesperson clarified their position, stating, ‘Neither Google nor any other search engine controls what pages are made public on the web. Publishers of these pages have full control over whether they are indexed by search engines.’ This statement places the onus on the content publisher – in this case, effectively OpenAI for hosting the shareable content, and indirectly, the user for making the content shareable. The Alarming Reality of User Data Exposure The implications of such widespread user data exposure are profound. While a single chat about astrophysics might seem harmless, the cumulative effect of many such public conversations can paint a detailed, potentially compromising, picture of an individual. This isn’t just about embarrassing queries; it’s about the inadvertent leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive personal contexts. For instance, if someone shares a chat where they discuss specific health symptoms, financial questions, or unique personal circumstances, and that chat is indexed, it becomes a permanent part of their digital footprint, accessible to anyone with the right search query. This can lead to: Identity Tracing: As seen with the LinkedIn example, seemingly innocuous details can be pieced together to identify individuals. Privacy Breaches: Sensitive personal thoughts, problems, or professional queries become public knowledge. Reputational Damage: Conversations, even those meant as jokes or experiments, can be taken out of context and used to form negative perceptions. Security Risks: While direct financial data might not be in the chats, patterns of behavior or personal vulnerabilities could be exploited by malicious actors. This situation underscores the critical need for users to understand the full scope of what ‘sharing’ means in the digital realm, especially when dealing with AI platforms that process vast amounts of personal text. Safeguarding Your AI Data Security: Practical Steps Given the revelations about Google indexing of shared ChatGPT conversations, it’s more important than ever for users to adopt a proactive approach to their AI data security . While AI platforms continue to evolve, the responsibility for personal data protection largely falls on the user. Actionable Advice for Protecting Your AI Interactions: Be Mindful of the ‘Share’ Button: Treat the ‘share’ feature on ChatGPT (and similar AI platforms) as a public publishing tool. Assume that anything you share could potentially be indexed by search engines and become publicly accessible. Only share conversations that you are comfortable with being seen by anyone. Review Content Before Sharing: Before clicking ‘create link,’ carefully review the entire conversation for any personal details, sensitive information, or anything that could be used to identify you or others. Edit or delete parts of the conversation if necessary. Avoid Including PII: Refrain from inputting personally identifiable information (PII) such as your full name, address, phone number, specific job details, or unique personal circumstances into AI conversations, especially if there’s any chance you might share them. Understand Platform Privacy Policies: Take the time to read and understand the privacy policies and terms of service for any AI tool you use. Look for specifics on data retention, sharing, and indexing practices. Regularly Check Your Digital Footprint: Periodically search for your name or unique online identifiers on search engines to see what information about you is publicly available. This includes searching for ‘site:chat.openai.com [your name/keywords]’ if you’ve ever shared chats. Consider Anonymity Tools: For highly sensitive inquiries, consider using AI tools that prioritize privacy or offer anonymous modes, if available. Beyond ChatGPT: Broader Implications for AI Data Security This incident with ChatGPT’s shared conversations serves as a potent reminder of the broader challenges in AI data security . As AI models become more sophisticated and integrated into various applications, the volume of sensitive data they process will only increase. This necessitates a robust framework for data governance, not just from the AI developers but also from regulatory bodies and users themselves. The evolving landscape of digital privacy demands clearer communication from technology companies about how user-generated content is handled, especially when sharing features are involved. It also calls for greater awareness among users about the implications of their digital actions. The lines between ‘private’ and ‘public’ are constantly blurring in the digital world, and incidents like this highlight the need for continuous vigilance and adaptation.

Conclusion: Navigating the Digital Frontier with Awareness The revelation that public AI chats from ChatGPT are being indexed by search engines like Google is a significant wake-up call regarding digital privacy. It underscores that even seemingly innocuous actions, like clicking a ‘share’ button, can have unforeseen consequences, leading to unwanted user data exposure . While AI platforms provide incredible utility, they also demand a higher level of awareness and caution from their users. Protecting your ChatGPT privacy and ensuring robust AI data security in the age of generative AI is a shared responsibility. Users must be diligent about what they share and how they interact with these powerful tools, while developers must continue to innovate with user privacy at the forefront. By understanding the mechanisms of Google indexing and adopting proactive privacy measures, we can better navigate the complex digital landscape and safeguard our personal information in an increasingly AI-driven world.

The report , completed by global accounting firm BDO, confirms the company’s asset backing for its USDT stablecoin and shows continued momentum in Tether’s global expansion. As of June 30, the total value of Tether’s assets reached over $162 billion, with liabilities tied to issued tokens sitting just above $157 billion. That means the company’s assets continue to exceed its liabilities, reinforcing its solvency. Tether Now Among Top 20 Holders of U.S. Treasuries With $127B Exposure Tether’s exposure to U.S. Treasuries, $105.5 billion in direct holdings and $21.3 billion in indirect holdings, puts it ahead of several countries, including Germany, in total U.S. debt ownership. That amount has grown by $8 billion since the previous quarter, placing Tether among the top 20 holders of U.S. Treasury securities globally. Tether Issues $20B in USD₮ YTD, Becomes One of Largest U.S. Debt Holders with $127B in Treasuries, Net Profit ~$4.9B in Q2 2025 Attestation Report Read more: https://t.co/0sJW8MiSoO — Tether (@Tether_to) July 31, 2025 Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino commented on the findings, saying, “Q2 2025 affirms what markets have been telling us all year: trust in Tether is accelerating. With over $127 billion in U.S. Treasury exposure, robust bitcoin and gold reserves, and over $20 billion in new USD₮ issued, we’re not just keeping pace with global demand, we’re shaping it.” USDT’s circulating supply reached over $157 billion by the end of June, up by $20 billion since the start of the year. According to Tether, $13.4 billion of that was issued in Q2 alone, indicating growing demand across both emerging markets and digital finance platforms. Beyond profits and supply growth, Tether’s report shows that the company’s shareholder equity remains steady at around $5.47 billion. This reserve buffer is meant to shield the company from shocks and ensure long-term operational strength. Of the $4.9 billion Q2 profit, $3.1 billion came from recurring operations. The rest came from gains in Tether’s bitcoin and gold holdings. Gregory Cowles, Chief Strategy Officer of Intellistake.ai, noted while speaking to CryptoNews that “when a stablecoin issuer starts to rival sovereign holders of debt, it shifts the conversation entirely. And with $4.9 billion in profit this quarter, most of it recurring, we’re seeing a model that isn’t just surviving—it’s thriving and operating at scale, showing real financial strength.” Source: Paolo Ardoino In total, Tether has made $5.7 billion in profit during the first half of 2025. The company says it’s using this cash to fund long-term projects. That includes investments in technology platforms, data infrastructure, and media tools, such as the Rumble Wallet and XXI Capital. The report also shows that nearly $4 billion of those investments have gone toward initiatives within the United States. Tether says it’s reinvesting more into foundational infrastructure than it ever has before. Tether’s financial positioning comes as stablecoins draw closer attention from regulators. The U.S. has proposed several bills that would formalize the legal framework for digital dollars. In this context, Tether is pitching itself as a working example of a private sector solution that meets public objectives. “USD₮ is helping billions access the stability of the U.S. dollar,” Ardoino said. “That mission has never been more urgent or more relevant.” Connor Howe, CEO of Enso—a DeFi platform designed to be a DeFi-native liquidity layer—told CryptoNews, “Tether has positioned itself as one of the largest, if not the largest, influences of crypto adoption throughout the world. Netting $4.9b+ is great and shows how much of an impact Tether has had throughout the industry. Recently, their investment portfolios were released, further showing their ability to think out of the box compared to traditional crypto VCs; they enter new market segments to bring crypto adoption, like agriculture.” Tether Expands Gold Reserves, Eyes U.S. Market Amid Stablecoin Growth Stablecoins saw rapid growth in the first half of 2025, with total supply climbing from $204 billion to $252 billion, according to a report by CertiK . Monthly settlement volumes reached $1.39 trillion, driven largely by Tether’s USDT, which now commands over 62% of the stablecoin market. Ardoino revealed that the company has amassed around $8 billion in gold reserves , stored in a private vault in Switzerland. “We have our own vault. I believe it’s the most secure vault in the world,” Ardoino told Bloomberg, declining to disclose its exact location. Tether owns the vast majority of about 80 tons of gold stockpile, worth around $8 billion, stored in a private vault in Switzerland. #Tether #GoldReserves #USDT https://t.co/uqizAQWeZS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 9, 2025 Ardoino framed the gold holdings as a hedge against potential fiat instability, citing growing concerns over U.S. debt. “If people start to get concerned about the potential increase of the debt of the U.S., they might look at alternatives,” he said. Tether is also preparing for a return to the U.S. market following the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, signed by President Trump. The legislation introduces new federal oversight for stablecoin issuers, including a ban on interest-bearing tokens and stricter reserve disclosure requirements. USDT issuer @Tether_to is gearing up for a US comeback, spurred by Trump’s new stablecoin law and a friendlier regulatory climate. #Tether #Stablecoins https://t.co/rfNQsNcp7A — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 24, 2025 “We are well in progress of establishing our U.S. domestic strategy,” Ardoino said, noting a focus on institutional payments and interbank settlements.

49318397,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=184782,1753991710,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/49318397.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Plummets Below $117,000: Urgent Market Update",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-drops-below/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plummets Below $117,000: Urgent Market Update The cryptocurrency market is once again showcasing its inherent volatility, as the Bitcoin price has experienced a notable dip, falling below the critical $117,000 mark. According to real-time market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading around $116,935.78 on major exchanges like Binance’s USDT market. This sudden shift has caught the attention of investors worldwide, prompting questions about the underlying causes and what this means for the broader digital asset landscape. Is this a temporary correction, or a sign of deeper market shifts? Understanding the Significance of the Current Bitcoin Price Drop When the Bitcoin price breaches a significant psychological or technical level like $117,000, it often triggers a cascade of reactions across the market. This isn’t just about a number; it’s about market sentiment, investor confidence, and the potential for further price movements. For many, $117,000 may have been viewed as a key support level, a floor below which the asset would ideally not fall. Its breach suggests that selling pressure has intensified, overcoming immediate buying interest. Psychological Impact: Round numbers or previously established resistance/support levels often act as psychological benchmarks for traders. A break below such a level can induce fear and prompt further selling. Technical Analysis: Traders often use these levels to set stop-loss orders. When the price falls below, these orders are triggered, adding to the selling volume and accelerating the downward trend. Market Contagion: Bitcoin’s dominance means its price movements often influence altcoins. A significant drop in BTC can lead to a broader market downturn. Liquidation Events: Leveraged positions in the derivatives market can face liquidation when prices drop sharply, creating additional selling pressure. What Factors Are Influencing the Current Bitcoin Price Action? The cryptocurrency market is a complex ecosystem influenced by a multitude of factors, ranging from global macroeconomic trends to specific regulatory announcements and even whale movements. Pinpointing a single cause for the current Bitcoin price decline is challenging, but several potential drivers are often at play: Global Macroeconomic Headwinds The broader economic landscape significantly impacts risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Factors such as inflation concerns, interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical tensions can lead investors to pull funds from volatile assets and seek safety in more traditional investments or cash. A strengthening US dollar, for instance, often puts pressure on risk assets globally, including Bitcoin. Regulatory Uncertainty and News Regulatory developments, or even the anticipation of them, can have a profound effect on the Bitcoin price . News related to stricter regulations, potential bans, or even delays in favorable regulatory frameworks (like spot Bitcoin ETF approvals) can create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) among investors, leading to sell-offs. Conversely, positive regulatory clarity can provide a significant boost. Whale Movements and Large Liquidations “Whales” — large holders of Bitcoin — have the capacity to move the market significantly. Large sell orders from whales can overwhelm buying demand, leading to rapid price drops. Furthermore, large-scale liquidations in the derivatives market, where traders use borrowed funds, can amplify price movements. When the Bitcoin price drops to a certain point, these leveraged positions are automatically closed, adding substantial selling pressure. Technical Breakdowns and Market Sentiment Beyond fundamental factors, technical analysis plays a crucial role. A break below a key support level, as observed with the $117,000 mark, can signal a bearish trend to technical traders, prompting them to open short positions or exit long ones. Negative news cycles, social media trends, and overall investor sentiment can also create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where fear leads to selling, which in turn fuels more fear. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Consider When Bitcoin Price Dips? Market downturns can be unsettling, but they also present opportunities for informed investors. Here are some strategies and considerations when the Bitcoin price experiences significant drops: 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR) Before making any investment decisions, it’s paramount to conduct thorough research. Understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, its long-term potential, and the factors that influence its price. Don’t rely solely on headlines or social media hype. 2. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Instead of trying to “time the market,” which is notoriously difficult, dollar-cost averaging involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the Bitcoin price . This strategy helps to average out your purchase price over time and reduces the risk associated with market volatility. 3. Risk Management and Portfolio Diversification Never invest more than you can afford to lose. It’s a golden rule in any investment, especially in volatile markets like crypto. Diversifying your portfolio across different assets, not just cryptocurrencies, can also help mitigate risk. Within crypto, consider diversifying beyond just Bitcoin, though BTC remains the dominant asset. 4. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed Keep abreast of market news, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on every price fluctuation. Understand the difference between short-term noise and long-term trends. Reliable news sources and analytical platforms can provide valuable insights. 5. The “HODL” Mentality (Hold On for Dear Life) For long-term investors who believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition, a price dip can be seen as a temporary setback. The “HODL” strategy involves holding onto your assets through market corrections, aiming for significant gains over years rather than weeks or months. The Broader Crypto Landscape: Impact Beyond Bitcoin Price Bitcoin’s status as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization means its movements often dictate the direction of the entire market. When the Bitcoin price falls, altcoins typically follow suit, often with amplified volatility. This is because Bitcoin serves as the primary trading pair for many altcoins, and investor confidence in the overall crypto market is heavily tied to BTC’s performance. A dip in Bitcoin can lead to a decrease in liquidity across the board, making it harder for altcoins to maintain their value. However, it’s also worth noting that during significant Bitcoin corrections, some investors may reallocate funds to certain altcoins they believe are undervalued or have strong fundamentals, anticipating a quicker rebound. This selective buying can sometimes lead to individual altcoins decoupling from Bitcoin’s immediate price action, though such instances are rare during broad market downturns. Looking Ahead: What Could the Future Hold for the Bitcoin Price ? Predicting the exact future of the Bitcoin price is impossible, given the dynamic nature of the market. However, market analysts often look at several indicators to gauge potential future movements: Support and Resistance Levels: Traders will be watching to see if Bitcoin finds new support levels below $117,000, or if it manages to reclaim and hold this level. Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic stability, inflation rates, and central bank policies will continue to play a significant role. Institutional Adoption: Continued interest and investment from large institutions, corporations, and even sovereign nations could provide long-term stability and upward momentum. Technological Developments: Enhancements to Bitcoin’s network (e.g., Lightning Network for faster transactions) and broader blockchain innovation can bolster its utility and appeal. Regulatory Clarity: Clear, favorable regulations globally would significantly reduce uncertainty and encourage broader adoption. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience, recovering from numerous significant corrections to reach new all-time highs. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this historical context often provides a sense of perspective for long-term holders. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of the Crypto Market The recent dip in the Bitcoin price below $117,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market. While such movements can be alarming, they are also a normal part of its evolution. For investors, understanding the multifaceted factors at play — from macroeconomic shifts to technical indicators and market sentiment — is crucial. By adopting strategies like dollar-cost averaging, maintaining a diversified portfolio, and prioritizing informed decision-making over emotional reactions, participants can better navigate these turbulent waters. The crypto journey is often a rollercoaster, but for those with a long-term vision and a robust strategy, the potential rewards can be significant. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when the Bitcoin price falls below a key level? A1: When the Bitcoin price falls below a significant level like $117,000, it often indicates increased selling pressure and a potential shift in market sentiment from bullish to bearish. It can trigger stop-loss orders and create a psychological impact among traders, potentially leading to further declines. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A2: Whether it’s a ‘good time’ to buy depends on your individual investment strategy, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Some investors view dips as buying opportunities (“buy the dip”), while others prefer to wait for signs of recovery. Strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s price affect other cryptocurrencies? A3: Bitcoin’s price movements heavily influence the broader cryptocurrency market. As the largest crypto by market cap, its dips often lead to corresponding declines in altcoins, as investor confidence in the overall market tends to follow BTC’s performance. However, some altcoins might occasionally show independent movements. Q4: What are the main reasons for Bitcoin price volatility? A4: Bitcoin price volatility is driven by several factors, including market speculation, regulatory news, macroeconomic trends (like inflation and interest rates), technological developments, large institutional investments, and the actions of major holders (whales). Q5: How can I protect my investments during a market downturn? A5: To protect your investments, consider diversifying your portfolio, setting clear risk management strategies (e.g., stop-loss orders, position sizing), avoiding over-leveraging, and investing only what you can afford to lose. Staying informed and avoiding emotional decisions are also crucial. Q6: Has Bitcoin recovered from similar drops in the past? A6: Yes, Bitcoin has a history of significant price corrections followed by substantial recoveries and new all-time highs. While past performance is not a guarantee of future results, this historical resilience is a key aspect often cited by long-term investors.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the best-selling personal finance author says that investors should be foregoing stocks and bonds in favor of gold, silver, and Bitcoin ( BTC ) as US national debt continues to mount. According to Kiyosaki, even legendary billionaire investors Warren Buffett and Jim Rogers have abandoned stocks and bonds. “Do you have a 401k or IRA filled with stocks? Do you know investment legends Warren Buffett and Jim Rogers have sold most if not all of their stocks and bonds? They are both in cash or silver. If you do not know why Buffett and Rogers have sold their stocks and bonds you may want to find out. I sit tight with gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Good luck. We may be on the brink of another 1929 crash and another Great Depression. America’s debt is out of control. America is the world’s biggest debtor nation in history. You can only print money to pay your bills… for so long.” In June, Kiyosaki said that he believes silver was undervalued and that it will be one of the assets investors flock to when the US stock and bond markets collapse. “The biggest bargain today is silver. In 2025, silver may 3x. The better news is silver is still 60% under all-time highs… still about $35… while gold and Bitcoin are at or near all-time highs… Silver is priced around $35 an ounce, which means almost everyone anywhere in the world… has a chance to grow richer… while millions grow poorer.” Earlier this month, he predicted that the top crypto asset by market cap could one day reach a staggering price tag of $1 million per token, and thus its current price is a bargain. BTC is trading for $118,080 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day, while silver is valued at $36.69 per ounce.

49318569,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=796951,1753992000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49318569.jpeg,"Weak Bitcoin Treasury Companies Will Be Crushed By Bear Market, Insider Warns",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/weak-bitcoin-treasury-companies-bear-market/,"The latest What Bitcoin Did episode, hosted by Danny Knowles, turns squarely to the question stalking one of the market’s hottest trades: can the boom in “Bitcoin treasury” companies withstand the next prolonged drawdown? Dylan LeClair, who helps lead the Bitcoin strategy at Tokyo-listed MetaPlanet, argues the answer rests less on ideology than on balance-sheet engineering, scale, and the willingness to endure volatility without blinking. “There’s sort of a ‘gradually then suddenly’ inflection point,” he said, describing how corporate exposure to Bitcoin has migrated from gimmick to boardroom agenda. The shift, in his view, is irreversible, but survival “is a constant fight with gravity” for firms that trade at premiums to their net asset value (NAV). Why Some Bitcoin Treasury Companies Won’t Survive The Bear Market LeClair’s thesis starts with market structure. Bitcoin is homogeneous collateral, but public equities are not. Liquidity, index inclusion, and the absolute size of a balance sheet produce a “winner-take-most dynamic,” he said. Even where two issuers have the same headline premium, the gravity of size changes the calculus: “Strategy is at a measly 1.8x premium, but the premium is like $50 billion of value,” he noted, contrasting that with the far smaller absolute premia attached to emerging players. Premiums compress mechanically as companies buy more Bitcoin or as the price rises, he added, which means maintaining a rich multiple demands ever-larger inflows of capital. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin’s Final Leg Is Near – Time To Be ‘Cautiously Optimistic’? Pressed on what a bear market would do to those premia, LeClair separated cycle folklore from funding reality. He does not buy the inevitability of a 70% “pack it up for three years” drawdown as a base case, arguing the market now tends to reprice and then chop for extended periods. But he is unequivocal that a risk-off phase would punish sloppy balance sheets. “There will be pressure on MNAVs… Are you levered? With what sort of debt? Do you have secured debt where your Bitcoin’s encumbered? Do you have debt due in one year?” By contrast, he pointed to perpetual preferred equity—dividends but “no debt maturity ever”—as a structure that removes the most dangerous cliff: “With the prefs it’s like, no, we’re not selling actually ever.” For MetaPlanet, he framed risk management in deliberately dull terms: “We’re focused on staying… pristine, maintaining maximal flexibility.” He cited a “BTC rating” of roughly 16.5x—“we have 16 bucks of Bitcoin for every dollar of debt”—as intentional dry powder rather than under-optimization. The stress test, to him, is behavioral as much as financial: can management “eat the 70% bear market” if it comes? He expects casualties. “It’s naive to say that every company that adopts Bitcoin will be a success… there will be failures. There will be a bankruptcy… it’s a brutal, competitive world.” Where, then, is the moat? Not merely in being public, he argued, but in graduating from equity capital to the far deeper fixed-income markets. Convertibles provided early leverage—but at a cost he described with traderly bluntness. Convertible desks “woo you,” then short aggressively to hedge, “dampening the volatility” that many treasury companies actually want in their common stock. The more durable solution, he said, is permanent capital in the form of preferred equity. Here he credits Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) with reaching “escape velocity,” pioneering a layered capital stack that now includes a new variable-rate preferred dubbed “Stretch” (ticker: STRC). Stretch is engineered to keep trading near $100 by adjusting its dividend and, if necessary, issuing new shares or calling them at $101—“a pretty genius feat of financial engineering,” in LeClair’s words, because it behaves like a cash-equivalent for investors without imposing maturity cliffs on the issuer. Strategy priced STRC in late July with an initial dividend framework and then closed a multi-billion-dollar offering, with the company describing the instrument as variable-rate, perpetual preferred stock designed to pay monthly and target trading near par. LeClair sees this as the practical realization of a long-standing ambition in crypto finance: a dollar-like instrument tied to Bitcoin collateral, without forcing asset sales in stress. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that were vulnerable to redemptions spirals, Strategy’s preferreds are senior to common equity and massively over-collateralized by transparent Bitcoin holdings, he argued. External observers have reached similar high-level descriptions: Strategy’s own materials emphasize STRC’s variable dividend on a stated $100 amount, while coverage in financial media notes the offering’s explicit aim to hew to par and its place alongside earlier preferreds (Stride, Strike, Strife) in a capital stack backed by tens of billions in unencumbered Bitcoin. All of this feeds the consolidation logic LeClair expects in a downturn. Preferreds, he said, are both offensive and defensive. Offensively, they add dry powder to buy more BTC or even buy back common if MNAV compresses, reversing flow against short sellers “playing this spread game.” Defensively, they function as an “MNAV defense mechanism,” easing reliance on converts and the gamma-trading that “neuters volatility” in the common. If markets turn, he anticipates classic Wall Street behavior: opportunists will “clear off some debt, buy the Bitcoin at a discount.” MetaPlanet, he added, is not seeking to be a roll-up; the focus is “laser” on BTC itself.

LeClair is diplomatic on peers bringing large private Bitcoin pools public, calling it “overwhelmingly positive” for the asset. But his competitive assessment is stark: “I think Saylor’s reached escape velocity… a 600,000 Bitcoin lead is pretty insurmountable.” To contextualize that claim with public data, Strategy now reports roughly 629,000 BTC, giving it a commanding lead over other corporate holders. He adds that only a mega-cap with a decisive pivot—“if Mark Zuckerberg took the orange pill tomorrow”—could realistically challenge, which he deems unlikely given competing priorities like AI. LeClair is no maximalist about smooth sailing. Premiums will ebb. Funding windows will open and slam shut. Some firms, he warned, are “cosplaying as Bitcoiners” and may abandon discipline at the first whiff of pain. He was also frank about the sector’s self-selection bias: during the good times, new “treasury companies” appear by the week; the real filter arrives when prices fall and maturities near. “The times are good now… there will be a cycle. That’s what will separate the men from the boys,” he said. Survival, in his telling, comes down to a few non-negotiables: unencumbered collateral, long-dated or perpetual liabilities, and management that will not sell into downdrafts. Yet his broader message is that the game board has changed. Corporate adoption remains “early innings,” he said, because “the rest of the world actually simply doesn’t care” yet. The depth of the credit markets—and the emergence of Bitcoin-backed instruments palatable to those markets—may be what finally does the persuading. “If Bitcoin is going to eat the world… it has to get to all these different pools of capital.” Treasury companies that make that leap, he believes, can not only endure a bear market—they can use it to widen the gap. At press time, BTC traded at $118,100.

But while the world’s second-largest crypto eyes its next rally, a smaller player is quietly stealing the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising coin in the DeFi sector, has analysts buzzing as early indicators point to a potential 10x surge, outpacing even ETH’s momentum. Over 14,700 investors have already put their money in the project, with Mutuum Finance now having raised more than $13.8 million so far. The project is currently at Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, an increase of 16.67% from Presale Phase 5. The upcoming Phase 7 will also see a price increase by 14.29% to $0.04. Investors are now able to reap a 71.43% ROI when the token launches at $0.06. Ethereum Nears $4,000 While Eyes Turn Toward $7,000 Ethereum is trading around $3,876, holding above key support after a sharp rally from the low‑$3,000s. Institutional ETF inflows continue to pour in, surpassing $1.8B in the last week alone, sparking renewed confidence in ETH’s momentum regime around the critical $3,900–$4,100 resistance zone. Analysts now see potential targets ranging from $5,500 to $7,000 by Q3 or Q4 2025, backed by bullish on-chain data and growing staking and liquidity activity. That said, technical indicators such as RSI have entered overbought territory, suggesting the possibility of a short-term pullback toward $3,800–$3,700 before further upside gains. Meanwhile, interest is also growing in emerging DeFi projects such as Mutuum Finance. Revolutionary Dual-Lending System by Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an active and passive users’ lending platform in DeFi. Passive income is generated from lending USDT in stable passive income-generating smart contract pools. Aside from that, MUTM allows lenders and borrowers to swap as much as they want with no intermediaries. That is usually the case with members who use unstable assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Now Live with Growing Demand Following the complete sell-out of its Phase 5 presale, Mutuum Finance has brought online Phase 6 and the tokens are now priced at $0.035, which represents a rise of 16.17% from the previous round. The next price cap is $0.04, a 14.29% rise. Earliest investors at this level may realize a 71.43% return once MUTM is trading at $0.06. To date, the presale has raised over $13.8 million and attracted over 14,700 distinct investors, which speaks volumes about the project’s growing popularity. Secured by CertiK and a $50K Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Aside from that, the project is certified by CertiK with 95.0 trust score. Mutuum Finance has also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. It will reward on a four-severity scale: critical, major, minor and low. $100,000 in MUTM Tokens Available Mutuum Finance has started a $100,000 giveaway that will reward 10 winners with a total of $10,000 MUTM as gratitude for the investor’s initial trusting the project. Mutuum Finance’s momentum is undeniable, with over $13.8 million raised from more than 14,700 early investors and Phase 6 tokens moving quickly at $0.035. The next price jump to $0.04 represents a 14.29% increase, and early backers are positioned for a 71.43% ROI when MUTM launches at $0.06. Analysts predicting a 10x surge aren’t ignoring the numbers, demand is accelerating, the community is expanding, and the DeFi market is ripe for disruption. Secure your MUTM allocation now before the next presale phase closes and prices climb again.

Glassnode says an unnamed investor disposed of Bitcoin worth nearly $10 billion via Galaxy Digital last weekend, demonstrating Bitcoin’s “growing liquidity profile and market depth.” “This liquidity was put to the test over the weekend, as an early Bitcoin investor, via Galaxy Digital’s services, distributed 80,000 BTC (approximately $9.6 billion), likely through a mix of market sales and [over-the-counter] OTC transactions. The resulting sell-side pressure drove the price down to $115,000 before stabilizing at $119,000. This episode illustrates Bitcoin’s ability to absorb large sell-side volumes, even during typically thinner weekend trading hours, reinforcing the market’s structural robustness.” The analytics platform says that a “super-majority” of Bitcoin holders are currently sitting on significant unrealized profits, with more than 97% of the circulating supply in the black. “This underscores how the majority of investors are sitting on substantial paper gains, and sets up an environment of potential future sell-side pressure should prices continue to rise further.” Source: Glassnode According to Glassnode, profit-taking could “sharply intensify” if Bitcoin goes up by around 20% from the current level. “…Bitcoin may remain range-bound between $105,000 and $125,000 until a decisive breakout occurs. Should the market break convincingly higher, the $141,000 region is likely to present the next major zone of resistance where sell-side pressure may intensify rapidly…” Bitcoin is trading at $117,651 at time of writing.

The monetary authority made it clear it’s not rushing the process, as it hopes for a gradual transition to cards based on its own payment system called Mir, but also pointed out Russians can make the change as soon as they want. Days of Mastercard and Visa cards numbered in Russia The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is preparing to phase out Visa and Mastercard payment cards, replacing them with the Russian Mir cards, TASS reported, quoting the press service of the country’s main financial regulator. The authority is currently considering a deadline for Russian banks to discontinue support for cards issued by the U.S.-headquartered corporations, the official news agency detailed. The CBR is also expecting its replacement with its own Mir cards to be gradual. A spokesperson for the institution was quoted as stating: “We are currently considering the timeline, during which the servicing of cards of international payment systems should stop. It will be reasonable and sufficient for the banks to gradually replace them with Mir cards.” The Bank of Russia emphasized that international cards are still working as usual and that there is no urgent need to pull them out yet. It also noted that commercial banks will promptly inform clients about upcoming changes. Nevertheless, the regulator highlighted that Russian users can substitute them with Mir cards at any time, if they so wish. “The decision to extend the validity period for cards of international payment systems that left the Russian market was made so that people could continue to use these cards,” the CBR remarked, but then stated: “Currently, the need for the measure has lost relevance – the share of such cards in circulation is decreasing, people themselves prefer to replace them with relevant domestic ones.” Russia to scrap foreign cards 3 years after invading Ukraine Visa and Mastercard suspended their operations in the Russian Federation soon after Moscow invaded Ukraine in early 2022. Since then, their cards issued for Russian banks can be used only inside the country. After the American giants pulled out of the Russian market, local banking institutions, working with the National Payment Card System ( NSPK ), extended the validity of their cards. Earlier this month, news came out that the Central Bank of Russia intends to set a maximum validity period for all of them. The NSPK, which is wholly owned and controlled by the CBR, is Russia’s payment clearing house processing bank card transactions within its borders and the operator of the Mir card payment system. It also provides clearing for the Faster Payments System ( SBP ), which allows Russians to initiate interbank transfers using only a mobile phone number, and to make and receive payments through a QR code. Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia has been preparing to launch a digital version of the national fiat. The digital ruble will be introduced in stages, starting from September 2026, the monetary authority announced in June, after President Putin called for mass adoption of the sovereign digital coin. The introduction of the central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be accompanied by wider implementation of payments using the universal QR code already available through the SPB, as Cryptopolitan reported last month. The days of crypto payments in Russia, strongly opposed by the CBR, also seem numbered. The Russian government has been tightening the noose on transactions with Bitcoin and the like by adopting a package of laws , targeting peer-to-peer trades and curbing crypto usage in general. The only loophole for cryptocurrency payments that is likely to remain open is the one suggested by the CBR itself. That’s the “experimental legal regime” that allows Russian companies to use digital coins in foreign trade, in order to circumvent war-related sanctions that have severely limited their access to the global financial system.

Scheduled for October 22–23, 2025, in London, this year’s event promises to be one of the most significant yet. With a star-studded lineup of speakers from leading financial institutions, including BlackRock, Citi, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, BNY Mellon, Nasdaq, and more, XRP holders are buzzing with anticipation and speculation. One name, in particular, is drawing intense attention: Maxwell Stein, Director of Digital Assets at BlackRock. His scheduled appearance at SWELL has fueled growing hopes that BlackRock could be preparing to launch an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , a move that would mark a monumental step in XRP’s journey toward broader institutional adoption. Crypto influencer Crypto Eri was among the first to spotlight the significance of Stein’s presence, posting the complete speaker list and urging the XRP community to “connect the dots.” Her post quickly gained traction, with many interpreting BlackRock’s involvement as a major signal of what may come next. BlackRock Director of Digital Assets at @Ripple SWELL. Just saying. https://t.co/8TgXZ7Tbos pic.twitter.com/g246P50n92 — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) July 31, 2025 BlackRock’s Presence and the XRP ETF Buzz BlackRock has already made headlines by launching Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and its increased involvement in tokenized finance has only strengthened the belief that XRP could be next in line . The company’s presence at Ripple SWELL, specifically through a digital asset executive, has stoked optimism that groundwork is being laid for a potential XRP ETF filing. The timing couldn’t be more appropriate. Ripple has been steadily positioning XRP at the heart of institutional-grade financial infrastructure. With the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, and growing demand for compliant cross-border payment solutions, an XRP ETF would be a logical next step for institutional investors. Major Banks and Institutions Join the Conversation Beyond BlackRock, several major financial institutions will be participating in SWELL 2025, further validating Ripple’s growing influence in traditional finance. Citi’s Ryan Rugg, Global Head of Digital Assets for Treasury & Trade Solutions, is scheduled to speak. Citi has previously explored blockchain-based settlement solutions, including partnerships aligned with Ripple’s technology. Franklin Templeton’s Sandy Kaul, known for her thought leadership in tokenization and digital asset strategy, is another high-profile speaker. Franklin Templeton has actively pursued blockchain innovation, often in parallel with Ripple’s institutional objectives. Carolyn Weinberg, Chief Product & Innovation Officer at BNY Mellon, represents a bank that has been a custodian leader in digital assets. Her presence signals a continued focus on integrating digital assets like XRP into secure, compliant custodial services. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cynthia Lo Bessette, who heads Fidelity Digital Asset Management, brings the perspective of one of the earliest institutional backers of crypto infrastructure and ETFs. Her appearance adds further intrigue, especially given Fidelity’s exploration of tokenized assets. Ripple’s Leadership and Institutional Strategy Ripple’s executive team will be out in full force at SWELL, including Brad Garlinghouse (CEO) , Monica Long (President), Stuart Alderoty (Chief Legal Officer), and Jack McDonald (SVP of Stablecoins). They are expected to share critical updates on RippleNet expansion, regulatory developments, and the evolving use of XRP in liquidity solutions and global settlements. Ripple’s institutional strategy is clear: build a regulatory-compliant, scalable ecosystem where digital assets like XRP play a central role in powering the future of finance. With support from global banking leaders and top-tier asset managers, Ripple is turning that vision into reality. Connecting the Dots With speakers from BlackRock, Fidelity, Citi, BNY Mellon, Franklin Templeton, and others on the agenda, SWELL 2025 is shaping up to be a convergence point of institutional finance and blockchain innovation. The XRP community is not just paying attention; they’re reading between the lines. The presence of BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets at Ripple’s flagship event is no coincidence. While no XRP ETF has been officially filed, the signs are hard to ignore. From increasing institutional engagement to regulatory clarity, all the right pieces seem to be falling into place. For now, XRP holders are doing exactly what Crypto Eri suggested: connecting the dots and waiting for the next big move.

This roadmap, which the foundation describes as a “generational promise,” aims to propel Ethereum into a new era in both performance and security. The goal: 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), quantum-resistant cryptography, and planetary sustainability. According to the Ethereum Foundation, ETH must not only scale but also “survive against all odds.” After 10 years of zero downtime, the ETH network currently has $130 billion in economic security (approximately 35.7 million ETH staked). The Foundation aims to reach $1 trillion in future security. This approach, called “Fort mode,” argues that Ethereum exists only if the internet exists; that the chain exists only if the world is online. This mode aims to make Ethereum resistant to all kinds of attacks, from government threats to quantum computers. Related News: Tether, One of the Largest Cryptocurrency Companies, Releases Its Earnings Report - Here Are Its Assets On the performance front, Ethereum is preparing to enter “beast mode.” While low-cost efficiency gains are expected over the next 6-12 months, more radical steps are coming in the long term: L1 target: 10,000 TPS capacity with Gigagas-level bandwidth L2 target: Tier-2 solutions reaching 1 million TPS with Teragas capacity This goal will be supported by innovations such as zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines), data availability sampling (DAS), and full chain verification from browsers, wallets, and phones. The Lean Ethereum approach redesigns the three layers that form the foundation of ETH: Lean consensus (CL): Beacon Chain 2.0 comes with finality within seconds and superior decentralization. Lean data (DL): More flexible data processing with post-quantum compatible data blocks (blobs 2.0). Lean execution (EL): A new SNARK-compatible, minimal, but EVM-compatible virtual machine (probably based on RISC-V). The Ethereum Foundation concludes its statement with the following words: “Lean Ethereum is a generational promise to keep Ethereum online in all conditions, to scale without compromise, and to make it worthy of those who come after us.” *This is not investment advice.

It is using accredited investors to provide direct exposure to IP, the native cryptocurrency of Story Protocol. Grayscale has made a major push into blockchain-based intellectual property infrastructure this time around with its latest Bitcoin and Ethereum product. A New Frontier: Blockchain Meets Intellectual Property The Story Protocol integrates licensing , attribution, and royalty streams into on-chain assets. The smart contract-facilitated tools are especially relevant in an era rife with AI-generated content and mounting legal uncertainties surrounding data ownership. “Grayscale Story Trust offers investors exposure to a protocol that is developing the underlying intellectual property layer for the information and AI era,” said Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Head of Product & Research at Grayscale. The trust will operate similarly to Grayscale’s other single-asset products, holding IP as its sole asset and allowing regulated investment exposure to a market that is expected to be valued at $80 trillion worldwide. Real-World Demand and Use Cases Story Protocol is already processing over 1.7 million IP transactions a month, from music royalties to robotic surgery data sets. Its token, $IP, derives demand from creators and AI developers that need licensed, verifiable content — unlike the majority of speculative digital assets. This blockchain-first platform gives AI companies buying training data transparency, and also allows artists, researchers, and developers to embed immutable ownership and revenue structures directly into their work. Limited Access For Now The Grayscale Story Trust is currently offered to accredited investors only, which means individuals with $200,000+ annual income or institutions with $5 million+ in assets. Listing on the secondary market may be next, pending regulatory approval. This mirrors the strategy of Grayscale with its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts, which started out as private placements and became ETFs. Those funds had $21.2 billion and $4.25 billion in AUM as of July 30, respectively. The Bigger Picture Grayscale’s foray into the IP token economy is a sign of growing institutional confidence in the viability of blockchain use cases beyond finance. With AI advancing exponentially, clean, licensed data is becoming an essential commodity — and Story Protocol’s tokenized infrastructure may offer the rails for a decentralized, transparent, and scalable intellectual property economy.",Blockchain|Sticky|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-07-31 20:14:13

However, on-chain data shows that BTC is still far from overheating, suggesting the premier cryptocurrency may have more room to run before a significant correction sets in. Bitcoin May Still Have Some Room To Run According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor AxelAdlerJr, new investor dominance in Bitcoin is gradually increasing – currently hovering around 30%, which is only halfway to the historical “overheated” threshold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Overheating Signals Easing – Is A Second-Half Rally Ahead? The analyst shared the following chart, which highlights two past instances – marked in orange – when new investor dominance reached overheated levels and coincided with BTC local price tops. The first instance occurred in March 2024 when the metric hit 64%, and the second in December 2024 when it peaked at 72%. In both cases, BTC experienced a significant pullback, leading to the formation of local bottoms. Notably, as the influx of new liquidity dried up during these phases, long-term holders began actively taking profits. This added further pressure on BTC’s price. Currently, while new investor dominance is trending higher, it remains well below the euphoria zone – typically between 60% and 70% – suggesting more upside potential in BTC’s bullish momentum before exhaustion. Meanwhile, older holders continue to sell moderately. The chart indicates a coefficient of 0.3, showing that the supply of three-year-old BTC is still absorbing fresh demand without sharp disruptions. From a long-term perspective, the market remains balanced, and the risk of large-scale capitulation from veteran wallets appears low. AxelAdlerJr concluded: If the indicator’s growth accelerates and approaches the historical corridor of 0.6-0.7, one should expect intensified profit-taking and, consequently, a correction. For now, the supply/demand structure remains in a healthy late bull cycle phase, when new money is coming in but old players have not yet transitioned to mass selling. Is BTC Price About To Stall? While the data above suggests that Bitcoin still has room to grow, other indicators point to waning momentum. One such signal is the recent decline in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap, which has broken its long streak of positive values. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Rally Might Be Running on Fumes, Analyst Warns of August Turning Point Fellow CryptoQuant analyst ArabChain confirmed this development in their analysis. They noted that US investor enthusiasm for BTC appears to be cooling at current price levels. That said, positive macroeconomic factors – such as BTC’s historical correlation with global M2 money supply expansion – could still lead the digital asset to new all-time highs in the near term.

Bet365, Stake.com, and Spartans each offer a unique view on how crypto will fit into online gambling. While Bet365 uses coin options very cautiously, Stake.com pushes community-driven play, and Spartans focuses on fast payouts and smooth design. This article looks at their differences, explains how regulation affecting Stake.com has shaped the market, and shows why structure now defines success in crypto betting. Spartans: Functionality First, Flash Second Spartans take a design‑first path in crypto betting for 2025. Unlike Bet365’s cautious hybrid model or Stake.com’s socially charged platform, Spartans prioritizes simplicity, clarity, and speed. Its core strength: 100% real‑time play. Bettors use native coins directly, no conversions, no hidden steps. Every game action is recorded on the ‑chain. All rewards, referrals, and instant withdrawals happen without delay. Spartans stand out with its coin logic. Coins are not just a gimmick or marketing tool. They serve as a utility layer. Cashback, affiliate rewards, and gameplay incentives are built into coin logic from the start. That transparency appeals to users and also addresses many regulatory questions about Stake.com regulation and crypto betting compliance. Spartans may lack the celebrity sponsorships of its rivals, but it wins on fundamentals. By building around fast, fair, transparent mechanics, it avoids many regulatory pitfalls faced by other platforms. Its structured reward system and frictionless user flow hint at a future where clean execution surpasses bold marketing. Its architecture is audit‑friendly and regulation‑ready. With instant withdrawals and builtin coin utility, Spartans anticipates scrutiny and response needs. This design reduces friction if regulators focus on user protection, source of funds, or responsible gaming. Spartans’ clarity and execution strength give it resilience that platforms like Stake.com, under heavy regulatory view in 2025, struggle to match. By focusing on speed, transparency, and compliance built into core mechanics, Spartans chart a third path. It shows that careful planning and clear coin structure matter more than hype when regulation becomes central. Bet365: Controlled Integration With Traditional Leverage Bet365’s crypto strategy is strategic and measured for 2025. It adds digital assets as a complement to existing fiat systems. This lets Bet365 retain its traditional user base while testing blockchain betting. Crypto is treated as a feature, not a revolution. That appeals to users who want privacy and flexibility via coins. Yet this hybrid model has limits. Bet365 offers no utility coin layer, no staking rewards, and no native wallet gaming. Its chief focus is regulatory alignment. As Bet365 has long followed global compliance frameworks, it moves slowly in regions with unclear crypto betting laws. That shields the brand but slows innovation. Users wanting fast, fully coin-integrated gameplay may find Bet365 incomplete under today’s expectations. Stake.com: Community Engagement Meets Regulation Pressure Stake.com is famous among crypto gamblers for its strong community focus, social features, and aggressive sponsorship in 2025. It built a user base early by offering wallet-based betting, instant deposits and withdrawals, and a wide game library. Its success, however, drew regulatory attention in many jurisdictions. Stake.com regulation became intense in 2024 and 2025. Regulators questioned its KYC protocols, marketing tactics, and compliance with local gambling laws. In response, Stake.com tightened onboarding, added identity checks, and started applying for licenses. But stricter controls may weaken the appeal for those who came for low friction and anonymity. Still, Stake.com leads in social engagement. Its chat features, VIP programs, and global reach give it strong user retention. But with growing regulatory scrutiny and without a clean coin omics model, its next decisions are critical. Reputation increasingly depends on transparency, governance, and how it addresses compliance going forward. Stake.com Regulation: 2025’s Defining Theme The key issue in 2025 is accountability. Nowhere is that clearer than in Stake.com regulation discussions. Stake.com’s fast growth has drawn lawmakers’ attention. Regulators demand crypto platforms meet the same consumer protection standards as fiat operators. They look at sources of funds, responsible gaming, and oversight. In this context, Bet365’s slower but steady crypto entry feels safer, though less scalable. Stake.com’s rapid rise now calls for structural recalibration. Spartans benefit by learning from those challenges. Its clean coin design and audit-ready operations make it more resilient amid regulatory concerns. As regulation becomes central in 2025, platforms built for clarity and compliance will earn long-term trust and stability. Final Words Crypto betting is not one shape, it’s evolving several ways in 2025. Bet365 shows traditional caution with optional coin use. Stake.com shows growth through rapid crypto adoption but now faces regulation tradeoffs. Spartans offer a third path: structuring its coin utility, speed, and transparency from the ground up. As debates over Stake.com regulation grow, the edge goes to platforms that prioritize strong execution, clear coin logic, and smooth compliance. In the long run, the platform built to endure scrutiny and scale will succeed, not necessarily the flashiest brand.

According to the earnings report , the company posted $94.04 billion in revenue for the three-month period ending June 28, up 10% from the same quarter last year. The numbers weren’t close. Analysts had expected $89.53 billion, but Apple delivered nearly $4.5 billion more than that. The company also booked $1.57 in earnings per share, well above the $1.43 analysts expected, bringing in $24.43 billion in profit, compared to $21.45 billion a year ago. CEO Tim Cook said the company’s performance was boosted partly by people rushing to buy Apple products ahead of possible tariff hikes. “About 1% of the 10-point revenue growth was from customers looking to stay ahead of tariffs,” Tim told CNBC’s Steve Kovach. iPhone drives revenue while Mac leads in growth The iPhone once again led the charge, pulling in $44.58 billion in revenue, which is 13% more than the same quarter last year and beat the $40.22 billion estimate by a wide margin. Tim said sales were stronger this time around because the iPhone 16 was outperforming the iPhone 15, which had been on sale during the same period last year. He added that the iPhone 16 saw “strong double-digit” sales growth over its predecessor, especially from current users upgrading. While the iPhone brought in the most revenue, the Mac lineup grew faster than any other unit. Apple’s Mac business grew nearly 15% year-over-year, reaching $8.05 billion, topping the $7.26 billion forecast. That spike came after Apple launched new MacBook Air laptops—its top-selling Mac—right before the quarter began. Apple’s services division, which includes iCloud, the App Store, AppleCare, and licensing deals like the one with Google, also grew. Services brought in $27.42 billion, a 13% increase over the previous year, beating the $26.80 billion expectation. Tim said iCloud subscriptions saw “meaningful” growth, and App Store revenue climbed in double digits. iPad and wearables report weak numbers It wasn’t all up. The iPad business fell 8%, pulling in $6.58 billion, missing the $7.24 billion estimate. Apple had released a budget iPad in March, but it didn’t boost the numbers enough. Also down was the “Other Products” unit, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, and other accessories. That segment dropped 8.64% to $7.4 billion, under the $7.82 billion forecast. Still, Tim emphasized that even with those two weak spots, the overall numbers came in strong because of demand across the iPhone, Mac, and Services units. The company’s gross margin came in at 46.5%, beating the 45.9% estimate. Tim also repeated that part of the boost came from customers trying to get ahead of tariff-related price increases. Apple had previously estimated $900 million in extra costs tied to the Trump administration’s tariffs in the quarter. Tim didn’t give a new number but made it clear that the tariffs had already started affecting buyer behavior. China sees a rebound as Apple increases its AI push Apple also reported that revenue in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, grew 4% to $15.37 billion. That growth came after two straight quarters of decline—down 2% in Q2 and down 11% in Q1. Tim said local government subsidies helped boost sales in the region. “The subsidy does apply to some of our products, and it clearly helps,” he said on the earnings call. On the tech front, Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in June showcased new software for its hardware lines, but the company’s AI announcements left investors unimpressed. Still, Tim said Apple was putting heavy resources into artificial intelligence. “We are significantly growing our investments,” he said, calling AI “one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime.” Tim also said Apple had acquired around seven companies in 2025 to support its AI strategy, though none were major deals. “We’re open to M&A that accelerates our roadmap,” he said.

The company, which now identifies as a Bitcoin treasury firm, reported $14.03 billion in operating income, a record-setting figure driven by crypto gains. This number shows a 7,106.4% increase from the same quarter last year, when the firm posted a $200 million operating loss. Strategy’s stock MSTR has surged by 2% after hours. According to Strategy’s official statement , this turnaround is directly tied to the company’s decision to value its crypto assets at fair market price under new accounting rules. The company also logged $10.02 billion in net income, up from a $102.6 million net loss the year prior. Diluted earnings per share reached $32.60, blowing past all historical performance. Strategy’s total Bitcoin holding stood at 628,791 BTC, bought at a cost of $46.07 billion. The average cost per coin sits around $73,277, and the company’s BTC is now worth far more than that based on current market prices. Bitcoin lifts income and updated yearly targets Phong Le, Strategy’s President and CEO, confirmed the numbers are a direct result of the firm’s aggressive crypto accumulation. “We expanded our bitcoin holdings to 628,791 bitcoins, raised over $10 billion through our ATM programs and IPOs, and saw growing institutional and retail demand for our securities,” Phong said. He added that Strategy’s Bitcoin per Share (BPS) climbed 25% year-to-date, prompting the firm to revise its BTC Yield target from 25% to 30%, and its BTC $ Gain projection from $15 billion to $20 billion by year’s end. He explained that fair value gains from Bitcoin pushed Q2 operating income to $14 billion and that the firm expects $34 billion in operating income and $24 billion in net income for the full year. The company is also forecasting $80 in EPS, predicting that Bitcoin reaches $150,000 by December. The crypto gain for Q2 alone stood at $9.5 billion, with the company holding 597,325 bitcoin as of June 30. These were valued at $64.4 billion, with a cost basis of $42.4 billion. An additional 31,466 BTC was acquired between July 1 and July 29. Strategy said it booked a $14 billion fair value gain in Q2, compared to a $180 million impairment loss using the old cost-based accounting system last year. Capital programs boost liquidity for Bitcoin buys Strategy brought in over $10.5 billion in fresh cash in Q2 and July through stock sales, with nearly half of it raised via its common stock ATM program. The company sold 14.2 million shares between April and June, raising $5.2 billion, and another 2.4 million shares in July for $1.1 billion. As of July 29, there’s still $17 billion worth of shares that can be sold under this program. The firm also leaned heavily on four preferred stock instruments: STRK, STRF, STRD, and STRC. It raised $446.9 million from selling STRK shares in Q2 and another $71.8 million in July. For STRF, the numbers were $163.1 million in Q2 and $55.8 million in July. The IPO of STRD in May pulled in $979.7 million, and another $17.9 million came in through the STRD ATM in July. In total, the STRD ATM still has $4.2 billion left unissued. Then in July, the company launched STRC and raised $2.5 billion through its IPO. Outside of crypto, Strategy’s software business reported $114.5 million in total revenue for Q2, a 2.7% increase from last year. The biggest growth came from subscription services, which climbed 69.5% year-over-year to $40.8 million. Gross profit for the quarter was $78.7 million, giving the segment a 68.8% gross margin, slightly below last year’s 72.2%. Strategy closed Q2 with $50.1 million in cash, up from $38.1 million at the end of 2024. For the rest of 2025, Strategy said it expects to hit its revised Bitcoin goals through a mix of preferred stock offerings and common stock issuance, guided by mNAV thresholds. The company said this approach would grow its bitcoin wallet without exposing shareholders to unnecessary dilution. Strategy also noted that because of its large crypto holdings and the use of fair value accounting, its earnings are highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s market price. The firm closed by stating it will not update its guidance unless required by law.

This favors a bullish Ethereum price prediction as momentum has accelerated for the top altcoin. ETH has managed to outperform Solana (SOL) on a year-to-date basis even though, at some point, it lagged its competitor with much higher yearly losses of around 50%. Now the top altcoin has booked year-to-date gains of 15.1%, primarily aided by the positive impact of the Pectra upgrade in the network’s operational framework. ETHEREUM BREAKING OUT ON THE MONTHLY!!!!!!!!!!!! TARGET $7,700 YES OOOH YES GUYS pic.twitter.com/z0sZvKxOYW — Ivan on Tech (@IvanOnTech) July 20, 2025 The popular crypto trader Ivan on Tech, whose X account is followed by nearly 500,000 users, shared an interesting bullish Ethereum price prediction that sees the token rising to $7,700 after a bullish breakout of a symmetrical triangle. This kind of technical setup occurs when the price consolidates and compresses until it trades in a very tight range. Symmetrical triangles are unbiased, meaning that they are not bullish or bearish until a breakout occurs. If the price breaks out to the upside as it has this time for Ethereum, this typically anticipates an explosive move. Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch as ETH Nears $4,000 The weekly chart for ETH shows that the token has entered a key area of resistance as it nears the $4,000 level. However, it has not touched this psychological threshold. The market seems to be approaching this area cautiously as the last three times it has hit this mark the price has responded with a strong retreat. We could probably see ETH retesting $4K within the next few days (if not today). If the token does experience a setback the key support to watch in this higher time frame would be the $2,700 area. Even though this would mean a sizable correction, it could be the necessary pullback for a much stronger move toward higher targets like $5,000 and even $7,700 as Ivan On Tech predicts – although that sounds a bit extreme, all things considered. A move to $16,000 is unlikely right now unless a major breakthrough occurs that propels Ethereum to a new stage of growth. However, the token’s outlook is bullish as both technical indicators and the macroeconomic landscape favor a bullish Ethereum price prediction. As the crypto market continues to enjoy a wave of positive momentum, the most promising crypto presales like SUBBD (SUBBD) could deliver the highest upside potential as investors look for the next crypto to 10X. SUBBD (SUBBD) Raises Nearly $1M to Launch Its Decentralized Content Platform SUBBD (SUBBD) creates a better environment for influencers where they can share their content freely without fearing unfair restrictions and bans.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a unanimous ruling, rejected Google’s claims that the trial judge made legal errors in the antitrust case from 2020 that unfairly benefited Epic Games . Google says the decision will harm user safety significantly Thursday’s ruling means Google Play Store will have to remove restrictions put in place to prevent app developers from setting up rival marketplaces and billing systems. The injunction should have taken effect earlier, but it has been on hold since last year after Google’s appeal. “It is well established that antitrust remedies can and often must proscribe otherwise lawful conduct to unwind and further prevent violators’ anticompetitive activity,” Judge Margaret McKeown wrote in a statement for the unanimous panel. McKeown also pointed out that the district court has the right to require Google to deal with parties harmed by its anticompetitive conduct, even its competitors. Google believes the decision has the potential to not only “significantly harm user safety” but also to undermine innovation for the Android operating system. Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s Vice President for Regulatory Affairs, spoke about the subject: “Our top priority remains protecting our users and developers, and ensuring a secure platform as we continue our appeal.” Meanwhile, Epic Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney has praised the ruling via a post shared on X, saying it would allow the company to offer its Epic Game Store via Google Play. This revamp is sure to affect Google, but by how much that will be is hard to say because Alphabet doesn’t process app store revenue separately in earnings. Mandeep Singh, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note last year that heightened use of third-party billing systems by media and gaming companies poses a larger threat to Google than rival app stores. “In a worst case scenario this could be a 20-30% drag on gross app store sales of around $50 billion, mostly subscriptions, which could be a $1-$1.5 billion drag on the company’s gross profit, based on our estimates,” Singh said. Epic concluded its case against Samsung weeks ago Epic Games’ case against Google is now taking center stage weeks after the company settled its antitrust claims against Samsung earlier this month. The lawsuit, which also involved Google, claimed that it conspired with the search engine giant to shield its app store, Google Play, from competition by using Samsung’s Auto Blocker feature, which allegedly discouraged users from downloading apps outside of Google Play and Samsung’s Galaxy store. Both Samsung and Google have denied any wrongdoing, and they have refused to disclose specific terms of the settlement. However, Epic Games is clearly satisfied with the outcome of the ruling, as the company’s chief executive Tim Sweeney expressed gratitude, claiming that Samsung will address its concerns in a post shared on X. As for its ongoing lawsuit with Google, it is a little early to break out the champagne because Google’s possible Supreme Court appeal could delay or alter the final outcome. Depending on how it turns out, the ruling could potentially reshape the Android app market by reducing barriers for developers and increasing consumer choice. Get seen where it counts.

The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 32 real-time technical indicators, BlackRock partnership speculation, SEC appeal developments, and institutional adoption metrics to assess XRP’s 90-day trajectory amid key technical inflection between continued consolidation and explosive breakout momentum. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Strong Bullish Structure Above All EMAs XRP’s current price of $3.09 reflects a minimal -0.16% daily decline from an opening price of $3.10 , establishing a tight trading range between $3.18 (high) and $3.08 (low). This 3.3% intraday range demonstrates controlled consolidation typical of preparation phases before major directional moves. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern!

Moving averages reveal an exceptional bullish structure with XRP trading above all major EMAs: 20-day at $3.07 ( +0.7% ), 50-day at $2.77 ( +10.3% ), 100-day at $2.56 ( +17.2% ), and 200-day at $2.32 ( +25.0% ). This EMA configuration represents one of the strongest bullish technical setups in XRP’s recent history. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 The MACD indicators show key positioning at the zero line ( 0.0000 ) with a positive histogram at 0.2075, suggesting momentum building despite a neutral MACD reading. According to ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis, volume analysis shows substantial expansion to 73.86 million XRP, indicating massive institutional participation during consolidation. ATR readings at 2.29 suggest a high volatility environment with potential for major moves once the current consolidation phase resolves with institutional catalysts. Historical Context: Explosive Recovery from May Lows XRP’s 2025 performance demonstrates strong institutional confidence through regulatory uncertainty, with an explosive 122% recovery from April’s $1.60 low to the current consolidation above $3.00 . January-March consolidation between $3.10-$2.70 preceded April’s correction to $2.19 as regulatory uncertainty peaked. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 The decisive May bottom at $1.80 marked the institutional accumulation phase, followed by the explosive June recovery and July’s continued momentum toward current elevated levels. Current pricing maintains a 19.47% discount to the all-time high while securing extraordinary gains of over 110,000% from 2014 lows. Support & Resistance: Multiple Strong Support Levels Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $3.08 , reinforced by the key 20-day EMA at $3.07 . Key support zones demonstrate remarkable strength with 50-day EMA at $2.77 ( +10.3% buffer), 100-day EMA at $2.56 ( +17.2% buffer), and 200-day EMA at $2.32 ( +25% buffer). Resistance begins immediately at today’s high around $3.18 , followed by the key psychological resistance at $3.20-$3.25 . $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 Major resistance emerges at $3.30-$3.40, where the completion of the double-bottom pattern could trigger explosive momentum toward $3.60+ targets. The technical setup suggests any pullback would find substantial support, while a breakout above $3.18 could trigger rapid appreciation toward $3.30-$3.60 based on pattern recognition and volume expansion potential. Institutional Breakthrough: BlackRock Partnership Speculation BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, Maxwell Stein, has confirmed participation in Ripple Swell 2025 . $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 The timing coincides with Ripple’s pursuit of U.S. Trust Bank status, which would allow XRP integration into Fed infrastructure for institutional payments. BlackRock’s engagement validates XRP’s institutional readiness and payment rails capabilities for traditional finance integration. The institutional validation extends beyond speculation, with Ripple’s legal status reaffirmed after the SEC motion rejection . Market Fundamentals: Stable Volume Amid Consolidation XRP maintains its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $184.13 billion , demonstrating institutional validation and sustained confidence. Volume metrics show remarkable stability with 24-hour trading volume at $5.98 billion , representing a healthy 3.19% volume-to-market cap ratio. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern!

The $310.8 billion fully diluted valuation reflects long-term growth expectations based on payment infrastructure adoption and institutional integration. Social Sentiment: Strong Community Despite Consolidation LunarCrush data reveals moderate social performance with XRP’s AltRank at 671 , indicating consolidation in speculative interest while maintaining fundamental strength. Galaxy Score of 37 reflects building momentum around institutional developments and partnership speculation. Engagement metrics show solid activity with 10.79 million total engagements, 58.32K mentions, and 8.87K creators contributing to discussions. Social dominance of 3.65% demonstrates XRP’s ability to maintain attention during consolidation phases. Sentiment registers at a robust 80% positive, reflecting community optimism around BlackRock partnership potential, SEC resolution, and institutional adoption acceleration. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern!

Three-Month XRP Price Forecast Scenarios BlackRock Partnership Breakout (45% Probability) Confirmed BlackRock strategic partnership combined with SEC appeal resolution could drive explosive appreciation toward $4.50-$6.00 , representing a 50-95% upside from current levels. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 This scenario requires sustained volume above 80 million daily and a successful break above $3.30 resistance. Technical targets include $3.60 , $4.80 , and $6.00 based on historical resistance levels and institutional flow projections. Extended High-Level Consolidation (35% Probability) Delayed partnership announcements could result in extended consolidation between $2.80-$3.40 , allowing technical indicators to reset while institutional positioning continues. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 Support at multiple EMA levels would likely hold during consolidation, with volume maintaining around 60-70 million daily. This sideways action could extend 6-10 weeks pending major institutional announcements. Correction on Partnership Delays (20% Probability) Major delays in BlackRock partnership or Trust Bank approval could trigger selling toward $2.60-$2.80 support levels, representing 15-20% downside from current levels. This scenario would require unexpected institutional setbacks or broader crypto market weakness. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 Recovery would depend on institutional buying at EMA support levels and eventual resolution of partnership speculation through confirmed collaboration announcements. XRP Price Forecast: Institutional Validation Meets Technical Strength ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis notes that XRP’s current positioning reflects unprecedented convergence of institutional validation, technical strength, and regulatory clarity. The combination of neutral RSI, key zero-line MACD with positive momentum building, and exceptional EMA support structure creates optimal risk-reward dynamics. Next Price Target: $5.00-$7.00 Within 90 Days For the next price action, XRP needs to stage a breakout above $3.18 resistance. From there, BlackRock partnership acceleration could propel XRP toward the $5.00 psychological milestone, with sustained institutional collaboration driving toward $7.00+ , representing new cycle highs. However, failure to break $3.18 resistance would indicate extended consolidation to the $2.80-$3.20 range. Institutional accumulation and increased demand can further drive XRP toward $10+ targets.

Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, is set to launch groundbreaking services that will redefine how we interact with financial markets. Imagine trading traditional stocks on the blockchain or participating in decentralized prediction markets – this is becoming a reality thanks to Coinbase’s vision. The introduction of Coinbase tokenized stocks signals a bold new chapter for both the exchange and the broader financial landscape. What Are Coinbase Tokenized Stocks and Prediction Markets? Coinbase’s Vice President of Product, Max Branzburg, recently unveiled the company’s plans in a CNBC interview, detailing their intention to offer services like tokenized stocks and prediction markets. But what exactly do these terms mean, and why are they generating such excitement? Understanding Tokenized Stocks A tokenized stock is a digital representation of a traditional company share, issued and traded on a blockchain. It’s a crypto token whose value is derived from an underlying real-world stock, offering several advantages: Fractional Ownership: Investors can buy small portions of high-value stocks, making blue-chip companies more accessible. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional markets, tokenized stocks can potentially be traded around the clock, reflecting the always-on nature of cryptocurrency markets. Increased Liquidity: By opening up trading to a global, always-on audience, liquidity could improve significantly. Transparency and Immutability: All transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, offering unparalleled transparency and resistance to manipulation. Lower Fees: Blockchain-based transactions can often bypass traditional intermediaries, potentially leading to reduced trading fees. This innovation could democratize access to traditional equity markets, allowing more individuals to participate in global economic growth through Coinbase tokenized stocks . Exploring Prediction Markets Prediction markets are platforms where users bet on the outcome of future events, from elections to economic indicators. Participants buy and sell shares representing specific outcomes, with prices reflecting the crowd’s perceived probability. Correct outcome shares pay out when the event concludes. Coinbase’s foray into prediction markets could bring several benefits: Decentralized Forecasting: Harnessing the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ for more accurate predictions. New Investment Avenues: Offering users unique ways to engage with and profit from their knowledge of various events. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain ensures that all bets and payouts are transparent and auditable. Why Is Coinbase Venturing into Tokenized Stocks and Prediction Markets? Coinbase’s strategic move into these services is about fulfilling a grander vision. Branzburg stated Coinbase is transforming into a “one-stop shop” for all on-chain trading needs. This ambitious goal is driven by several factors: Meeting Evolving User Demands: As the crypto space matures, users seek more sophisticated and diversified investment opportunities beyond just cryptocurrencies. Bridging Traditional Finance and Decentralized Finance (DeFi): By offering tokenized versions of traditional assets, Coinbase directly links the established financial world with the innovative blockchain ecosystem. This could onboard a new wave of users. Strengthening Market Position: In an increasingly competitive crypto landscape, offering unique services like Coinbase tokenized stocks helps solidify its position as a market leader. Long-Term Growth Strategy: Diversifying revenue streams and user engagement beyond volatile cryptocurrency trading. This strategy aims to provide a seamless, integrated experience where users can manage a wide array of digital assets, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to tokenized shares of Apple or Tesla, all within the Coinbase ecosystem. The Roadmap Ahead: US Launch and Global Expansion for Coinbase Tokenized Stocks These new services are set to launch in the coming months for U.S. users. This initial domestic focus allows Coinbase to navigate the complex U.S. regulatory landscape before broader expansion. Navigating the Regulatory Maze “Subject to regulatory approval” is crucial. Tokenized stocks involve securities laws, which vary globally. Coinbase must work closely with regulators like the SEC in the U.S. for full compliance, potentially involving: Obtaining necessary licenses. Adhering to strict know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Ensuring robust investor protection frameworks. Once a successful framework is established in the U.S., Coinbase plans to gradually expand internationally. This phased approach is a prudent strategy for managing significant legal and compliance challenges in global financial services. What Are the Benefits and Potential Impacts of Coinbase’s New Offerings? The launch of Coinbase tokenized stocks and prediction markets could have far-reaching implications for investors, the crypto market, and the financial industry. For Individual Investors: Enhanced Accessibility: Easier access to global equity markets, especially for those in regions with limited traditional brokerage services. Portfolio Diversification: A new avenue for crypto investors to diversify holdings with assets that typically exhibit different risk profiles. Innovation in Engagement: Prediction markets offer a novel way to engage with current events and potentially profit from informed opinions. For the Crypto Market: Increased Mainstream Adoption: By offering familiar assets on a blockchain, Coinbase could attract traditional investors into the crypto ecosystem, bridging TradFi and DeFi. New Use Cases for Blockchain: Showcasing the practical utility of blockchain technology beyond just cryptocurrencies. Greater Liquidity and Efficiency: Bringing more capital and trading activity onto the blockchain. For the Financial Industry: Disruption and Innovation: Pushing traditional financial institutions to innovate and potentially adopt blockchain technologies. Democratization of Finance: Potentially leveling the playing field for investors globally, reducing barriers to entry. Navigating the Challenges: Risks and Regulatory Landscape for Coinbase Tokenized Stocks While exciting, these new ventures come with significant hurdles and risks. Regulatory Uncertainty: This remains the most significant challenge. Regulators worldwide are still grappling with how to classify and regulate digital assets, especially those linked to traditional securities. Coinbase will need to meticulously navigate different legal frameworks, which can be time-consuming and costly. A misstep could lead to significant fines or operational restrictions. Market Volatility and Price Discrepancy: While tokenized stocks are pegged to traditional stock prices, the crypto market itself is highly volatile. This could introduce new layers of volatility or price discrepancies if the underlying crypto asset or stablecoin used for trading experiences significant fluctuations. Maintaining a stable peg will be crucial. Security and Smart Contract Risks: Any blockchain-based system is susceptible to smart contract bugs or hacking attempts. While Coinbase has a strong security track record, the complexity of new products always introduces new vectors for potential exploits. Robust auditing and security measures will be paramount. User Education and Protection: As these are novel financial products, ensuring users fully understand the risks, mechanisms, and regulatory implications will be vital. Coinbase will need to invest heavily in clear communication and educational resources to protect its users. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor For those eager to explore these offerings, consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on official Coinbase announcements regarding launch dates, available assets, and regulatory approvals. Understand the Mechanics: Before diving in, take the time to learn how Coinbase tokenized stocks and prediction markets truly work, including their underlying technology and potential risks. Start Small and Diversify: As with any new investment, consider starting with a small amount you’re comfortable losing and ensure these new assets fit into a diversified portfolio strategy. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: While tokenized stocks aim to mirror traditional stocks, the crypto infrastructure adds a layer of complexity. Understand your personal risk tolerance before engaging. A Glimpse into the Future of Finance Coinbase’s ambitious move into tokenized stocks and prediction markets is a profound statement about the future of finance. By aiming to be a “one-stop shop” for on-chain trading, Coinbase is actively shaping the digital landscape. This venture could break down traditional barriers, democratize access to financial instruments, and integrate blockchain into everyday investment strategies. The coming months will be pivotal as Coinbase takes these revolutionary steps, potentially setting a new standard for accessibility and innovation in global finance.

This isn’t a fantasy; it’s the latest reality for Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy. Their audacious commitment to Bitcoin continues to yield remarkable results, positioning them as a unique player in both the corporate and cryptocurrency landscapes. The firm’s recent Q2 2025 report highlights an astounding period of growth, largely fueled by the surging value of its MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings. This isn’t just about profit; it’s about a pioneering corporate treasury strategy that is redefining how companies view their balance sheets. The Astounding Success of MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings According to a recent report by Wu Blockchain on X, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has reported an eye-popping $10 billion in net income for Q2 2025. This colossal figure underscores the profound impact that Bitcoin’s price appreciation has had on the company’s financial health. For a firm primarily known for its business intelligence software, this pivot to becoming a de facto Bitcoin holding company has paid off handsomely, demonstrating an unprecedented level of conviction in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This isn’t just a one-off gain; it’s the culmination of a deliberate and consistent strategy initiated years ago. Strategy’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset was, at the time, seen by many as highly unconventional, even risky. Yet, under the guidance of its visionary leadership, the company has steadfastly accumulated Bitcoin, transforming its balance sheet and delivering substantial value to shareholders. The Q2 profit is a testament to the long-term potential of a bold MicroStrategy Bitcoin investment strategy. Why is MicroStrategy Investing So Heavily in Bitcoin? The question on many minds remains: why such an unwavering commitment to Bitcoin? Strategy’s rationale is multifaceted and deeply rooted in a macroeconomic outlook that sees traditional fiat currencies depreciating over time. Here are the core reasons driving their aggressive MicroStrategy Bitcoin accumulation: Inflation Hedge: The company views Bitcoin as a superior store of value, a digital gold that can protect corporate assets from inflationary pressures and currency debasement. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Strategy believes Bitcoin is in its early stages of adoption and will continue to appreciate significantly as it becomes a global reserve asset and a primary means of wealth transfer. Capital Allocation Efficiency: Rather than holding cash that loses purchasing power, the company opts to convert excess capital into a scarce, decentralized asset with perceived long-term growth potential. Pioneering Institutional Adoption: By being the first publicly traded company to make such a significant commitment, Strategy aims to set a precedent and encourage other corporations to consider Bitcoin for their treasury reserves. This strategic foresight has not only propelled their own growth but has also played a crucial role in legitimizing Bitcoin as a serious asset class for institutional investors worldwide. Their transparent and consistent approach to acquiring MicroStrategy Bitcoin has made them a bellwether for corporate crypto adoption. Understanding MicroStrategy’s Bold $4.2 Billion Raise The firm’s commitment isn’t just about holding existing assets; it’s about active expansion. Strategy has announced plans to raise an additional $4.2 billion through the issuance of STRC perpetual preferred stock. The explicit purpose of this massive capital raise? To buy more Bitcoin. This move signals an incredibly bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future price trajectory and reinforces their ‘Bitcoin maximalist’ stance. The scale of their ambition is evident in their recent acquisition spree. In Q2 alone, Strategy significantly expanded its Bitcoin portfolio: Start of Q2 Holdings: Approximately 499,000 BTC End of Q2 Holdings: Approximately 597,000 BTC Total Holdings (Post-Q2 acquisitions mentioned): An astounding 628,800 BTC To put this into perspective, Strategy’s total holdings of 628,800 BTC represent roughly 3% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. This makes them, by far, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, dwarfing even some institutional funds. The planned $4.2 billion raise will only solidify their position as the leading corporate proponent of MicroStrategy Bitcoin adoption. What Does This Mean for the Future of MicroStrategy and Bitcoin? Strategy’s ongoing Bitcoin strategy has profound implications for both the company itself and the broader cryptocurrency market. For Strategy, its stock performance has become increasingly correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements, effectively transforming it into a proxy for Bitcoin exposure in traditional equity markets. This unique positioning attracts a specific type of investor looking for a publicly traded vehicle to gain exposure to digital assets. For Bitcoin, Strategy’s continued accumulation and public advocacy lend significant credibility. Each new purchase, especially one as large as the planned $4.2 billion raise, sends a strong signal to the market about institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. It highlights a growing trend of corporations exploring digital assets as legitimate components of their financial strategy. This relentless pursuit of MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings contributes to Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative and strengthens its position as a global macro asset. Navigating the Risks and Rewards of MicroStrategy Bitcoin Strategy While the recent profit figures are compelling, it’s essential to consider both the rewards and potential challenges associated with Strategy’s high-conviction MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy. Potential Rewards: Exponential Growth Potential: If Bitcoin continues its long-term upward trajectory, Strategy’s holdings could lead to immense shareholder value. Pioneering Market Position: The company has carved out a unique niche, attracting investors specifically interested in Bitcoin exposure through a traditional stock. Inflation Hedging: A strong defense against the erosion of purchasing power for corporate treasury assets. Potential Challenges: Bitcoin Price Volatility: While beneficial during bull runs, significant price drops could lead to substantial unrealized losses, impacting financial reports and investor sentiment. Concentration Risk: A large portion of the company’s value is tied to a single, volatile asset, increasing overall risk. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies could introduce unforeseen challenges. Dilution Risk: Issuing new stock, even preferred stock, can dilute existing shareholder value if not managed effectively against the appreciation of the underlying asset. For investors, Strategy’s journey offers valuable insights into high-conviction investing. It demonstrates the potential rewards of a long-term, patient approach to assets believed to have transformative potential, but also highlights the importance of understanding and accepting significant volatility. Strategy’s Q2 2025 financial report is more than just numbers; it’s a powerful affirmation of their pioneering MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy. The $10 billion profit, largely attributable to Bitcoin’s performance, coupled with the ambitious $4.2 billion raise for further acquisitions, solidifies their position as a leading corporate evangelist for digital assets. This bold approach not only generates significant returns but also pushes the boundaries of corporate finance, signaling a new era where Bitcoin plays an increasingly central role in global treasury management. As the firm continues its journey, the world watches to see how this unprecedented bet on Bitcoin will reshape both corporate balance sheets and the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Strategy’s primary business? Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, is primarily a business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services company. However, in recent years, it has become widely recognized for its corporate treasury strategy centered on accumulating Bitcoin. How much Bitcoin does MicroStrategy own? As of the end of Q2 2025, and including subsequent acquisitions mentioned, Strategy’s total MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings reached approximately 628,800 BTC. Why is Strategy raising $4.2 billion? Strategy plans to raise $4.2 billion through the issuance of STRC perpetual preferred stock specifically to acquire more Bitcoin, further increasing its already substantial holdings. What is STRC perpetual preferred stock? STRC perpetual preferred stock is a type of equity security issued by Strategy. ‘Perpetual’ means it has no maturity date, and ‘preferred’ typically means it pays fixed dividends and has priority over common stock in claims on assets and earnings. How does MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy impact its stock price? Strategy’s stock price (MSTR) has shown a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements. Investors often view MSTR as a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded company, making its stock performance highly sensitive to BTC’s value. Is MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy risky? While the strategy has yielded significant profits, it carries inherent risks due to Bitcoin’s price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and the concentration of a large portion of the company’s assets in a single, albeit transformative, digital asset.

This move holds significant implications, not just for the tech sector but also for the broader digital economy, including the realm of cryptocurrencies and decentralized technologies, which often rely on advanced computational capabilities and data processing. Apple’s renewed commitment to Apple AI could set new benchmarks for how AI is integrated into everyday devices, influencing user interaction, data privacy, and potentially, the infrastructure supporting emerging digital assets. Why is Apple Ramping Up AI Investments Now? During its Q3 2025 earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook articulated a clear vision, stating, “We see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments.” This declaration comes amidst a period of robust financial performance, with Apple reporting better-than-expected iPhone sales and record revenue in Q3, which saw its stock climb in after-hours trading. This strong financial standing provides a solid foundation for Apple to commit substantial resources to its AI initiatives, aiming to solidify its position in the competitive AI landscape. For years, Apple has been lauded for its ability to integrate cutting-edge technology seamlessly into user-friendly products. Cook reiterated this core philosophy: “Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone, and that’s at the heart of our AI strategy.” This approach suggests that Apple’s AI investments will prioritize practical, user-centric applications over mere technological demonstrations, aiming for broad accessibility and genuine utility. Navigating the AI Race : Apple’s Strategic Approach Apple has faced criticism for seemingly being caught off guard by the rapid acceleration of the AI era. Some observers have pointed to announced AI features that have yet to ship, and even accusations of showcasing an improved AI-powered Siri that was far from ready for launch. However, Apple has consistently defended its measured approach, asserting that rushing to market with incomplete or flawed features would be a mistake. Their philosophy centers on delivering polished, reliable products that work as promised, rather than chasing headlines for being first. This cautious yet determined strategy highlights Apple’s commitment to quality over speed in the intense AI race . While competitors might prioritize rapid deployment, Apple focuses on deep integration and refinement, ensuring that when their AI features do arrive, they meet the high standards users expect from the brand. This long-term view aims to build enduring trust and superior user experiences, differentiating them in a crowded market. The Power of Apple Intelligence : What’s Here and What’s Coming? Despite the criticisms, Apple asserts it has already launched over 20 Apple Intelligence features. These include practical tools designed to enhance daily user experience: Visual Intelligence: Enhancing image recognition and processing capabilities. Cleanup Tools: Streamlining digital content organization and optimization. Writing Tools: Assisting with text generation, summarization, and refinement across various applications. Looking ahead, Apple has exciting plans for future AI integrations: Live Translation: Real-time language translation to break down communication barriers. AI-Powered Workout Buddy: Personalized fitness guidance and tracking. However, some highly anticipated features, such as the more personalized improvements to Siri, have been delayed to 2026. This delay underscores the complexity of integrating advanced AI capabilities while maintaining Apple’s commitment to quality and user privacy. Exploring Tech Acquisitions : Apple’s M&A Strategy To accelerate its AI ambitions, Apple has explicitly stated its openness to mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Ahead of its earnings call, the company confirmed in an interview that it is actively considering strategic acquisitions to bolster its AI capabilities. Tim Cook revealed that Apple has already acquired seven companies this year, though none were “huge” in terms of dollar amount. This indicates a strategy of acquiring smaller, specialized firms that can provide niche technologies, talent, or intellectual property crucial for specific aspects of AI innovation . These smaller tech acquisitions allow Apple to integrate cutting-edge advancements without the complexities and public scrutiny often associated with large-scale mergers. This agile approach enables them to quickly absorb new technologies and talent, ensuring their AI development remains at the forefront of the industry. Beyond the Hype: The Future of Apple AI Apple’s reinforced commitment to AI is not merely about keeping pace; it’s about redefining the interaction between users and technology. By significantly growing its AI investments and strategically pursuing acquisitions, Apple aims to deliver AI experiences that are not only powerful but also intuitive and seamlessly integrated into its ecosystem. This long-term vision positions Apple to continue shaping how we interact with our devices, potentially influencing the very infrastructure of digital economies, including how data is processed and secured, which could have ripple effects on the development of decentralized applications and blockchain technologies. Apple’s strategic pivot towards aggressive AI investment and its openness to M&A signal a pivotal moment for the tech giant. By prioritizing thoughtful integration and user accessibility over a rushed release, Apple aims to cement its leadership in the AI-driven future. While the path may involve delays for some features, the ultimate goal is to deliver robust, reliable, and profoundly impactful AI experiences that truly enhance the lives of its users.

When a major player like Coinbase, one of the largest and most influential crypto exchanges globally, releases its quarterly earnings, the entire market pays close attention. Recently, the announcement regarding Coinbase Revenue for Q2 came as a bit of a surprise, missing market estimates and sparking discussions across the industry. Let’s dive deep into what these numbers truly mean for Coinbase and the broader crypto landscape. Understanding the Q2 Coinbase Revenue Snapshot Coinbase’s Q2 financial report painted a picture that, while showing profitability, didn’t quite meet the Street’s expectations. Wu Blockchain, a reputable source for crypto news, was among the first to report the key figures via X, highlighting a significant miss in the anticipated revenue. Here’s a quick look at the core numbers: Total Revenue: $1.5 billion Market Estimates: Significantly higher than reported Quarter-over-Quarter Decrease: A substantial 26% drop from the previous quarter’s revenue. While the top-line revenue figure caught attention, it’s crucial to dissect where this revenue originated and how it compares to the company’s profitability. Breaking Down the Numbers: Where Did Coinbase Revenue Come From? Coinbase generates its revenue primarily through transaction fees from trading activities and, increasingly, from subscription and services offerings. The Q2 report offered insights into these streams: Category Q2 2023 Performance Significance Total Revenue $1.5 billion Missed market estimates, indicating lower-than-expected trading activity or other revenue streams. Net Income $1.43 billion This figure was significantly bolstered by a non-cash gain related to a specific accounting adjustment, not core operational profitability. Adjusted Net Income $33 million A more accurate reflection of operational profitability, showing a modest positive result after accounting for one-off items. Stablecoin Revenue $330 million A strong performer, indicating the importance of interest income from stablecoin reserves in Coinbase’s diversified revenue strategy. The stark difference between the reported Net Income and Adjusted Net Income is particularly noteworthy. The $1.43 billion Net Income included a substantial non-cash gain, primarily from an accounting adjustment related to its investment in Circle, the issuer of USDC. This highlights the importance of looking beyond headline figures to understand a company’s true operational health and the underlying drivers of Coinbase Revenue . What Factors Influenced Coinbase Revenue in Q2? Several macro and micro factors likely contributed to Coinbase’s Q2 performance falling short of expectations. Understanding these elements is key to grasping the broader market dynamics: Lower Trading Volumes: The crypto market experienced a period of relatively subdued volatility and lower trading volumes throughout Q2 compared to previous quarters. When fewer people are actively trading, an exchange’s transaction fee revenue naturally declines. This directly impacts the core Coinbase Revenue stream from trading. Regulatory Headwinds: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains uncertain and, at times, challenging. Increased scrutiny from bodies like the SEC can create apprehension among institutional and retail investors, potentially leading to reduced trading activity and a more cautious approach to crypto investments. Competition: The crypto exchange space is increasingly competitive, with new platforms and established financial institutions entering the arena. This competition can put pressure on fees and services, impacting revenue generation. Stablecoin Performance: While overall revenue missed, the $330 million from stablecoin activities was a highlight. This revenue primarily comes from interest earned on the reserves backing stablecoins like USDC. As interest rates have risen, this has become a more significant and reliable source of Coinbase Revenue , helping to offset declines in other areas. Why Does This Matter for the Crypto Market? Coinbase is often seen as a bellwether for the wider cryptocurrency market, especially in the U.S. Its performance can provide valuable insights into retail and institutional investor sentiment, as well as the overall health of the digital asset economy. A miss in Coinbase Revenue , even if accompanied by adjusted profitability, signals that the market might still be navigating a period of consolidation or slower growth after the peaks of previous bull runs. For investors, these results underscore the importance of diversification within crypto portfolios and looking beyond just price action. Understanding the underlying financial health of major infrastructure providers like Coinbase is crucial for long-term strategic planning. The reliance on stablecoin revenue also highlights a shift in how crypto companies are generating income, moving towards more diversified and less volatile streams. Coinbase’s Strategic Response and Future Outlook Despite the Q2 revenue miss, Coinbase has been actively working to strengthen its position and diversify its business model. Their focus on subscription and services revenue, which includes staking, custody, and stablecoin interest, is a clear strategy to reduce reliance on volatile trading fees. This shift is vital for building a more resilient business that can weather market fluctuations and ensure sustained Coinbase Revenue streams. Furthermore, Coinbase continues to advocate for clear regulatory frameworks, engaging with policymakers to foster an environment conducive to crypto innovation. Their international expansion efforts also aim to tap into new markets with potentially more favorable regulatory climates and higher growth potential. The company’s ability to achieve an adjusted net income of $33 million, despite the revenue decline, demonstrates a strong focus on cost management and operational efficiency. This financial discipline is crucial for navigating challenging market conditions and positioning the company for future growth when market sentiment improves. As the crypto market evolves, so too must the strategies of its leading players. Coinbase’s Q2 results serve as a reminder that even established companies face significant challenges, but also that adaptability and strategic diversification are key to long-term success. The focus on recurring revenue streams and responsible financial management will likely define the path forward for Coinbase Revenue and its role in the global crypto economy. Summary: What We Learned About Coinbase Revenue in Q2 Coinbase’s Q2 2023 financial report revealed a total revenue of $1.5 billion, falling short of market expectations and marking a 26% decrease from the prior quarter. While headline net income was high due to a non-cash accounting gain, the adjusted net income of $33 million provided a more accurate picture of operational profitability. A significant highlight was the $330 million generated from stablecoin revenue, underscoring its growing importance to the company’s financial health. The miss was primarily attributed to lower trading volumes amid a subdued crypto market and ongoing regulatory uncertainties. Despite these challenges, Coinbase is strategically focusing on diversifying its revenue streams, particularly through subscription and services offerings, and maintaining strong operational efficiency. This proactive approach aims to build a more robust business model, ensuring the long-term sustainability and growth of Coinbase Revenue in a dynamic crypto landscape.

The filing , submitted to the SEC and announced late Thursday, follows the company’s strongest quarterly performance on record and comes amid a sharp expansion of its Bitcoin treasury. Strategy Announces $4.2 Billion STRC At-The-Market Program https://t.co/4wOYjw8B2u — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 31, 2025 The STRC program, designed for Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock, provides Strategy with the flexibility to raise capital over time, depending on market conditions. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be channeled into general corporate purposes, including working capital and dividends on previously issued preferred shares. However, consistent with Strategy’s stated objectives, a major portion is anticipated to be allocated directly to purchasing additional Bitcoin . The move builds on the momentum of four other ATM programs already in operation. Each has allowed Strategy to convert investor capital into digital assets, reinforcing CEO Michael Saylor’s long-standing belief in Bitcoin as a superior corporate treasury asset. The firm’s filing indicates its intent to continue leveraging equity markets to support its expanding crypto strategy, which now spans multiple asset classes and preferred share structures. Saylor’s Strategy: Profits, BTC, and Scalable Capital Programs Amid Soaring Equity Demand Strategy’s second-quarter earnings report , released just after the STRC announcement, showed a sharp rise in profitability. Net income surged to over $2.3 billion, driven by unrealized gains on Bitcoin holdings during a quarter when the price of BTC soared above $110,000. This represented a nearly 140% increase from Q1, indicating the material impact of the company’s digital asset position on its bottom line. Source: Strategy Its Bitcoin holdings, which stood at 628,212 BTC as of July 29, are currently valued at roughly $69.4 billion. This includes a recent purchase of 14,620 BTC disclosed earlier this week, acquired using proceeds raised through existing ATM equity programs. SEC filings show that between July 14 and July 20, Strategy raised over $740 million by selling multiple classes of shares, a mix of common and preferred. Strategy’s momentum is also visible in its capital markets activity, which has generated more than $10.5 billion in gross proceeds in just the last four months. Between April and the end of June, the company secured $6.8 billion through multiple stock issuance programs. An additional $3.7 billion was raised between July 1 and July 29 across both public offerings and ATM facilities. A sizable portion of that capital is already being recycled into Bitcoin. The largest tranche came from Strategy’s Common Stock ATM Program, which brought in over $6.3 billion during that time frame through the issuance of nearly 16.7 million shares. Even after those sales, $17 billion remains authorized under its May 2025 common equity program. In addition to common equity, Strategy is leveraging preferred shares across several new products. Its STRK ATM program generated over $518 million during the same period, while the STRF ATM program raised approximately $219 million. The company’s May IPO of STRD stock added $979 million, and its follow-up STRD ATM launch in July has raised $17.9 million so far, with $4.2 billion still available. @MicroStrategy doubles down, acquiring 21,021 #Bitcoin after closing the largest U.S. IPO of 2025 worth $2.52B with its new STRC preferred stock. #Startegy #Bitcoin https://t.co/BNc5V6UfhF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 29, 2025 STRC itself also saw a strong cash infusion even before the ATM program was announced. Strategy raised $2.5 billion in its initial STRC stock offering , selling over 28 million shares at $90 each. The preferred stock includes a variable monthly dividend, with the first $0.80 payout declared on July 31 and scheduled to be paid on August 31 to shareholders of record as of August 15.

The foundation stated that the roadmap is part of its efforts to boost real-world blockchain adoption. According to the press release from the foundation, its new roadmap will focus on four key areas, including simplifying user experience and accelerating innovation to deliver constant upgrades to the network. It noted that part of the innovation will focus on enabling use cases that support stablecoins, tokenizations, and AI agents while improving the network security and privacy standards to be quantum-resistant. Speaking on its plans, Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden noted the new roadmap is all about Algorand building the right infrastructure for the future on-chain economy. She said: “This roadmap lays the groundwork to onboard a new generation of people and enterprises that need the blockchain-based products of the future, but that don’t need to know what a blockchain is or how it works under the hood.” Meanwhile, the Foundation’s principal engineer, Bruno Martins, noted that the roadmap focuses on developers and builders. According to him, the core goal is to make it easy to deploy and use projects on the Algorand network, and he expects more builders to launch on the protocol. Algorand plans major product releases for 2025 and 2026 Interestingly, Algorand already has a slate of products set for release between Q3 of 2025 and Q4 of 2026. According to the foundation, these products will address its core goals for the next few years. One such product is xGov Governance, an on-chain community governance framework set to launch by Q3 of 2024. The framework is expected to be used for allocations of grants on the network, starting with an xGov council before full implementation in 2026. Beyond that, the foundation plans to improve developers’ experience by launching AlgoKit 4.0 in the first half of 2026. This software development kit (SDK) is expected to enable easy deployment on Algorand with new SDKs for programming languages such as Kotlin, Swift, and Rust, in addition to Python and Typescript, which Algorand already supports. Other planned products include a self-custody wallet, Rocca Wallet, set for full launch in the first half of 2026, and Agentic Security and Identity Framework that will allow AI agents to execute on-chain transactions on Algorand. The foundation added that it will further beef up institutional compatibility by launching Intermezzo, a custodial solution for businesses integrating blockchain technology. With the tool, released in Q3 of 2025, enterprises can use Algorand for treasuries, loyalty programs, and other business models. WorldChess has already adopted it for its on-chain loyalty program. ALGO sinks further Meanwhile, the roadmap release has not had much impact on the Algorand native token ALGO’s performance. While many people were excited about the roadmap ahead of its release, ALGO is down almost 1% in the last 24 hours and has lost 6% of its value in the past week. Its price decline today coincides with the general market struggles, with Bitcoin falling to $116,500 range after trading as high as above $118,900 earlier in the day. With BTC’s decline, almost all other major cap assets have also fallen in value, with ETH and SOL down by around 1% each. However, ALGO struggles extend beyond today’s performance, given that the token, which is trading at $0.25, is down by 33.36% year-to-date. Its poor performance is more pronounced when compared with its peak price of $3.56 back in 2019, showing it is 93% down from its all-time high. The poor performance of ALGO is likely connected to the decline in activity on Algorand. The blockchain network has slowly lost relevance compared to competitors such as Ethereum, Solana, BNB Smart Chain, Sui, Aptos, or Layer-2 networks. Per Defillama data, it has a total value locked (TVL) of $79.91 million, putting it at 49th on the list of networks with the biggest TVL, showing just how little DeFi activity happens on it. With the new roadmap, investors in ALGO will be hoping to see the Layer-1 network record a resurgence. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

According to the report, trading platforms like Robinhood and Coinbase stand to benefit significantly from increased trading volume and greater mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Bernstein reiterated his “outperform the market” rating for both companies, maintaining confidence that their strong performance will continue. The report noted that Robinhood's second-quarter results, announced on Wednesday, were impressive. It noted that the company continued to expand its cryptocurrency offerings, with trading volume reaching a six-month high in July. This increase was driven by the recovery in market volatility and increased investor interest in ETH, SOL, and DeFi tokens, driven by Circle's listings. Cryptocurrency trading volume is expected to recover significantly in the second half of the year.

JPMorgan's embrace of an industry once criticized by its CEO will accelerate Coinbase's customer acquisition. Bernstein argued that recent developments confirm the view that the bull cycle in the crypto market is still in its early stages, adding, “There is no need for any action for now.” *This is not investment advice.

Just when you think you’ve got a handle on its movements, a new report emerges, urging caution. Recently, 10x Research, a prominent name in crypto analytics, issued a significant warning that has caught the attention of investors worldwide: the Bitcoin price might be heading for a period of notable weakness, particularly as we approach the historically challenging month of August. This isn’t just a speculative guess; it’s backed by seasonal trends and a closer look at on-chain capital flows, painting a nuanced picture of what could be ahead for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Is the Bitcoin Price Headed for a Summer Slump? Markus Thielen, the astute lead analyst at 10x Research, has highlighted a compelling historical pattern concerning the Bitcoin price in August. His research indicates that this particular month has, more often than not, been Bitcoin’s weakest performer. We’re talking about significant pullbacks, with most years experiencing losses ranging from 5% to a substantial 20%. This isn’t just a recent phenomenon; it’s a recurring theme in Bitcoin’s volatile history. While the crypto market is known for its unpredictable swings, understanding these seasonal tendencies can provide investors with a valuable edge. What makes August so challenging for the Bitcoin price ? While no single factor is definitive, several theories exist. Historically, August falls within the summer holiday period in many parts of the world, leading to decreased trading activity and potentially lower liquidity. This ‘summer lull’ can make the market more susceptible to larger price movements on lower volume. Additionally, institutional investors and whales might reduce their activity, contributing to less buying pressure. Thielen’s analysis reinforces the idea that ignoring these historical patterns could be a costly mistake for those invested in Bitcoin. Unpacking the On-Chain Inflow Puzzle: What Does it Mean for Bitcoin Price? Beyond seasonal trends, 10x Research’s report delves into another critical metric: on-chain capital flows. These flows represent the movement of funds into and out of the Bitcoin network, offering insights into investor sentiment and demand. Alarmingly, the report points to a decline in these inflows. The 30-day rolling average of capital flows has dipped from $62.4 billion to $59.3 billion. This reduction isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signals a potential shift in market dynamics, suggesting that the influx of new capital, which typically fuels upward price momentum, is slowing down. CoinDesk reported on these findings, emphasizing that a decline in on-chain inflows often precedes or accompanies a consolidation phase for the Bitcoin price . While Bitcoin has seen impressive total inflows, exceeding $1 trillion, with a significant $206 billion flowing in during 2024 alone, Thielen notes that the price impact has been ""surprisingly muted."" This observation raises a crucial question: if such massive capital is entering the ecosystem, why isn’t the Bitcoin price reacting with the explosive gains many expect? This disconnect could indicate that existing holders are selling into strength, or that the new capital is being absorbed without creating significant upward pressure, casting shadows of doubt on immediate further upside potential. Navigating Potential Support Levels: Where Could the Bitcoin Price Find Stability? Understanding potential downside risks is crucial for risk management. The 10x Research report doesn’t just warn of weakness; it also provides specific price targets for potential support levels, offering a roadmap for investors to consider. According to Thielen’s projections, a breakdown below the $117,000 mark for the Bitcoin price could trigger further declines. Should this level fail to hold, the next significant support is identified around $112,000. For a deeper correction, the report suggests a range between $106,000 and $110,000 as a potential consolidation zone. These levels are not arbitrary; they often correspond to previous areas of significant trading activity, psychological barriers, or technical indicators. Investors and traders typically watch these support zones closely, as they can represent opportunities for accumulation or areas where selling pressure might temporarily abate. Preparing for these scenarios allows market participants to make informed decisions rather than reacting impulsively to market volatility. Historical Resilience: Can Bitcoin Price Defy August’s Curse? Despite the ominous warnings, there’s a silver lining that bulls might cling to. Markus Thielen himself acknowledged that August hasn’t always been a losing month for the Bitcoin price , especially during post-halving bull markets. He specifically pointed to years like 2013, 2017, and 2021, which saw notable gains in August following a Bitcoin halving event. These periods were characterized by strong underlying bullish momentum, often driven by renewed investor interest, technological advancements, or broader market euphoria. The key question then becomes: are current market conditions similar enough to these historically positive post-halving Augusts? While Bitcoin did experience its latest halving in April 2024, the broader economic landscape, regulatory environment, and institutional adoption narrative are constantly evolving. Investors must weigh the current macro factors and on-chain data against these historical precedents. While history doesn’t repeat itself exactly, it often rhymes. Understanding these nuances is vital for forming a balanced outlook on the future trajectory of the Bitcoin price . Actionable Strategies for Navigating Bitcoin Price Volatility Given the mixed signals and potential for heightened volatility, what can investors do to protect their portfolios and potentially capitalize on market movements? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor reports from reputable research firms like 10x Research and news outlets like CoinDesk. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and staying updated on the latest analysis is paramount. Risk Management is Key: Implement robust risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, and only investing what you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of attempting to time the market, consider a DCA strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the Bitcoin price . This approach helps average out your purchase price over time and can mitigate the impact of short-term volatility. Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Pay attention to on-chain data beyond just price. Metrics like exchange inflows/outflows, active addresses, and mining difficulty can offer deeper insights into the underlying health and demand for Bitcoin. Prepare for Both Scenarios: While the warning points to weakness, the market is unpredictable. Have a plan for both a downside correction and a potential rebound. Identify your entry and exit points for various scenarios. The current market outlook for the Bitcoin price is undeniably complex. While 10x Research’s warning about seasonal weakness and declining on-chain inflows presents a cautious near-term view, it’s essential to remember Bitcoin’s historical resilience, especially during post-halving periods. The market is a constant interplay of fear and greed, data and sentiment. By staying informed, understanding the underlying dynamics, and employing sound investment strategies, you can navigate these challenging waters with greater confidence. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin succumbs to historical patterns or defies expectations once again. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is 10x Research’s main concern about the Bitcoin price? 10x Research is primarily concerned about potential Bitcoin price weakness in August, citing historical seasonal downturns and a noticeable decline in on-chain capital inflows as key indicators. Q2: Why is August historically considered a weak month for Bitcoin? Historically, August has shown a pattern of negative returns for Bitcoin, with losses often ranging from 5% to 20%. This could be attributed to factors like reduced trading activity during summer holidays and lower market liquidity. Q3: What do declining on-chain inflows suggest for the Bitcoin price? Declining on-chain inflows, as reported by 10x Research, suggest a slowdown in new capital entering the Bitcoin ecosystem. This can indicate a potential consolidation phase or a lack of strong buying pressure, which may lead to muted price action or even downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Q4: What are the key support levels for Bitcoin identified in the report? The report projects a potential breakdown below $117,000, with key support levels identified at $112,000 and a deeper range between $106,000 and $110,000. Q5: Are there any historical precedents for Bitcoin gaining in August despite the general weakness? Yes, Markus Thielen noted that Bitcoin has seen gains in August during post-halving bull markets, specifically in 2013, 2017, and 2021. These instances offer a glimmer of hope for bulls, suggesting that strong underlying market momentum can sometimes override seasonal trends. Q6: How can investors prepare for potential Bitcoin price volatility? Investors can prepare by staying informed, implementing strong risk management strategies like stop-loss orders, considering dollar-cost averaging (DCA), monitoring on-chain metrics, and having a plan for both upward and downward market movements.

Trading at just $0.035, this next‑generation DeFi protocol is capturing attention for its innovative approach to cross‑chain liquidity and yield optimization, sparking speculation that it could surge to $3.50, delivering life‑changing returns for early holders. With the crypto market bracing for a transformative year, the quiet rise of Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of 2025’s most talked‑about stories, even as Solana and other established players hold steady. Solana (SOL) Eyes Moderate Upside as Analysts Preview 2025 Bull Cases Solana is currently trading around $177, consolidating below the year’s all‑time highs, after a late‑July dip from higher levels $200+. Analysts are split: some conservative models expect SOL to hold in the $160–$200 range if support around $160–$170 holds, while more bullish outlooks see potential for a breakout toward $300–$380 later in 2025, supported by institutional ETF inflows, protocol upgrades like the Firedancer validator, and overall DeFi activity on the network. That said, short‑term resistance at $180–$190 may need to be convincingly cleared to unlock further gains. As traders assess speculative narratives, some are also tracking emerging DeFi names like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale: Phase 6 Offers 71% ROI Mutuum Finance is at $0.035 in presale phase 6 due to an early sell-out for presale phase 5. Phase 6 investors will earn a return on investment of 71.43% upon launch of the token. More than $13.8 million have been raised, and over 14700 early investors have joined the presale. Token price in Presale Phase 7 will increase to $0.04, a 14.23% increase from Phase 6. Mutuum achieves DeFi Security with CertiK-Supported Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently released an Official Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK as a security and transparency program. Users will be compensated the equivalent of $50,000 USDT for reporting probable bugs in the project. The aim of the bounty program is to provide an equal coverage to all the classes of vulnerabilities. It has been categorized into four classes of severity; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Announces Massive Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a $100,000 giveaway where contest participants will be rewarded in the form of MUTM tokens, each worth $10,000. The top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded by the project’s newly launched leaderboard system. Bonus tokens are earned on leveling up. Mutuum Finance: Revolutionizing DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending with a product that offers customers the utmost control over assets. It is an open multi-purpose double-lending platform built through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Access to P2C lending pool is through smart contracts. The platform responds based on the prevailing market sentiment, diminishing lenders’ revenue volatility and economic risk of borrowing. The P2P model removes middlemen, creating space for lending directly, appropriate for volatile assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance is accelerating its momentum, raising over $13.8 million from more than 14,700 early investors, with presale demand outpacing expectations. Currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, the token is set for a 14.23% jump in the next round before launching at $0.06, locking in a 71.43% ROI for early participants. As analysts debate Solana’s path to $750 MUTM’s potential climb to $3.50 is capturing the spotlight promising transformative gains for those who act early.

33767162,[object Object],1753999226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto In The Courtroom—2025 Class Actions Could Hit All-Time High,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-in-the-courtroom-2025-class-actions-could-hit-all-time-high/,"According to a report by Cornerstone on Wednesday, investors in the US have filed six class-action lawsuits tied to crypto so far in 2025. That number nearly matches the seven brought all of last year. Meanwhile, AI-related suits are closing in on last year’s total too. Surge In Crypto Lawsuits In the first half of 2025, six crypto-related filings went to court. That is a big jump from seven for all of 2024. Half of those new suits target token issuers. One is against a mining company. Two more name outfits that sell rigs or have crypto partnerships. The law firm Burwick Law filed three of the six cases. Its founder, Max Burwick, says private suits give investors a clear way to hold firms to account. Pomerantz LLP and Glancy Prongay & Murray led the rest of the filings. AI Cases On The Rise Based on a report , 12 AI-related lawsuits hit US courts in the same period. Last year saw 15 in total. Stanford law professor Joseph Grundfest points to “AI-washing” as the main culprit. That’s when companies overstate their AI skills to grab investor cash. Investors strike back with civil claims once the truth comes out and share prices slide. Total filings in H1 2025 for all securities cases stood at 114. That figure is almost flat compared to 115 in H2 2024. It shows that lawsuits driven by hot themes are rising fast, while overall litigation stays steady. Regulatory Pullback Drives Private Action Investors did not wait for regulators to move. Even after US agencies like the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission eased up on crypto under US President Donald Trump, suits kept coming. That pattern suggests civil actions are now part of the playbook for those who feel burned by sudden losses. Looking at the data, last year’s seven crypto suits are on course to be beaten by 2025’s total. And AI filings look set to match or exceed the 15 logged in 2024. Both areas have a small group of law firms leading the charge. Burwick Law stands out for crypto. On the AI side, a variety of firms are jumping in. What Companies Should Watch Companies working with crypto or AI must be precise in how they talk about their tech. Overblown claims or careless wording on blockchain ties or machine-learning breakthroughs could invite civil suits. Clear, honest disclosures are the best defense. Legal experts warn that private lawsuits can pick up where regulators leave off.

Analyst Eyes September-October Window,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-etf-approval-incoming-analyst-eyes-september-october-window/,"A fresh move by the SEC could clear the path for the first US spot ETFs tracking altcoins like XRP. Traders and investors are watching closely as new rules aim to speed up approvals by late 2025. This change comes just months after in-kind creation and redemption for crypto ETPs won the regulator’s blessing. Related Reading: Don’t Blink: 1,000 XRP Could Be The Best Move You’ve Made—Expert New Listing Standards Open Door According to the recent filing of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, any coin with at least six months of futures trading on a platform such as Coinbase’s derivatives exchange can qualify for an exchange-traded product. The six-month rule replaces a longer review process that could stretch into 240 days. Instead, exchanges can use a 75-day window once they file a rule change. This shift aims to simplify the path for an XRP ETF and similar products. The SEC’s “Listing Standards” for crypto ETPs is out via new exchange filing. BOTTOM LINE: Any coin that has futures tracking it for >6mo on Coinbase’s derivatives exchange would be approved (below is list).

Based on reports from crypto lawyer Bill Morgan, this change lets authorized participants create or redeem ETF shares using actual cryptocurrency rather than cash. The revision slashes settlement costs and lines up crypto products with how gold and other commodity ETPs work. Market makers can now back ETFs with real tokens, cutting out extra steps. XRP ETF Odds Climb Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has put the chance of an XRP ETF approval at 85% for September or October 2025. He notes that once the six-month futures threshold hits for assets like XRP, Dogecoin and Solana, the path becomes much clearer. Prediction markets back his view, showing odds near 86% even after procedural delays. Balchunas and his team have tracked every filing and rule tweak. They say these updated listing standards are the last major barrier. With futures already trading for multiple altcoins, issuers need only get the final green light from the SEC. That could happen by early fall, he suggests. Related Reading: XRP Traders Pull Back $2.4B—Brace For Impact Or Buy The Dip? Ripple Lawsuit And Deadlines A key hurdle remains the legal fight between Ripple and the SEC. Based on reports, both sides may drop appeals ahead of an August 15 status report deadline. If that happens, it would remove a major overhang on XRP ETF applications. The SEC has already extended Franklin Templeton’s review through the end of 2025, but this new filing hints those long waits might wrap up sooner. Legal experts like former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel believe a dismissal of appeals would clear one of the last big obstacles. Then only final SEC sign-off would stand between issuers and live trading.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase says it’s adding ResearchCoin ( RSC ), the native asset of a science-based research blockchain co-founded by Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong, to its suite of crypto products. “Coinbase will add support for ResearchCoin on the Base network… Trading will begin on or after 9AM PT on 31 July 2025, if liquidity conditions are met. Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our RSC-USD trading pair will launch in phases.” News of the addition preceded a spike in price for the asset, as RSC went from a low of $0.385 on July 25th to a high of $0.762 on July 31st. ResearchCoin has since stabilized and is trading for $0.741 at time of writing, a 10.7% increase during the last 24 hours. In its official whitepaper , the developers of the project say they created it as a means of improving science research and communication. “ResearchCoin has been created to incentivize participation in a highly collaborative and entirely open access platform, ResearchHub. This first of its kind token serves to galvanize a community of academics and nonacademics in support of ResearchHub’s goal of creating an all-encompassing forum for the communication of academic research. The downstream benefits of the success of such a community are significant: with adoption, silos that currently exist in the world of research are eliminated. As a result of this improved communication, the pace of research and the application of research are accelerated.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

That indication represents a possible uptick of as much as 233% above the $33-per-share offering price. A few days earlier, Figma raised its price range to $30–32 per share, selling 12.47 million shares itself while investors like Index Ventures, Greylock Partners, and Kleiner Perkins sold 24.46 million more. On Tuesday, the IPO gave Figma a market value of about $16.1 billion, according to an earlier report by Cryptopolitan . Adding employee stock options and RSUs bumps that up to roughly $18.5 billion, and including Dylan Field’s unvested shares pushes it past $19 billion. As Bloomberg reported , this milestone tops the more than $20 billion valuation Figma had anticipated in its canceled 2023 acquisition by Adobe Inc. Huge demand for Figma’s IPO, first big software debut since SailPoint The offering received orders exceeding supply by over 40 times, leaving more than half of subscription requests unmet, and marking the first significant software IPO in the US since SailPoint Inc.’s debut in February. Figma’s core platform enables designers to build web and mobile application interfaces, and it has since extended its portfolio to support coding workflows and collaborative projects. Figma charges by user tier. In 2023, it added Dev Mode to streamline designer-developer collaboration, and it recently launched Figma Make, an AI tool that turns simple prompts into working prototypes. After going public, Field said, “we have to continue to sprint, to push hard, and we can’t let the public markets distract us.” He said the IPO shines a light on design’s importance and “This is a time where we can create tremendous value for our community, our customers, and I think the public market is the right place to do it.” Revenue in the first quarter rose 46% versus the same period last year. Observers highlight whether Figma can catch on beyond designers. Sequoia Capital partner and board member Andrew Reed noted that developers, product managers, and marketing professionals have begun adopting the platform. Sequoia’s initial investment in Figma came in 2019, coinciding with widespread shifts toward browser-based design tools. Figma competes with AI rivals with plans for deeper integration Competing AI-centric design platforms such as Lovable and Bolt have seen rapid adoption this year, prompting Figma to prioritize deeper AI integration. Moreover, Field said that Figma plans to pursue substantial M&A opportunities. He also said, “It has to be an amazing team, an amazing asset, and it needs to fit our culture.” The transaction also helped US IPO proceeds beyond $21 billion year-to-date, excluding SPACs, surpassing the roughly $20.2 billion raised in the comparable period of 2024, according to Bloomberg data. Industry analysts attribute part of the strong uptake to the auction-style subscription mechanism, in which investors specify both share quantities and limit prices. Field controls the company with Class B shares, which give him 15 votes each—enough for 74.1% of the total voting power. He and Evan Wallace, who met at Brown University, launched Figma in 2012; Field left after about 2½ years to take a Thiel Fellowship. In the quarter ending March 31, Figma made $44.9 million from $228 million in revenue. But despite growing revenue in 2024, higher costs caused a $732 million loss for the year.

French Hill Urges Senators To Advance Crypto Market Structure Legislation According to the Wednesday statement , Hill is pushing for members of the U.S. Senate to advance crypto policy to U.S. President Donald Trump’s desk. “Now that the GENIUS Act is law and the CLARITY Act received overwhelming bipartisan support in the House, the Senate must expeditiously work to deliver such critical market structure legislation to President Trump’s desk,” Hill said. “I’m pleased to see the Working Group’s strong support of the CLARITY Act and look forward to continued collaboration with my Senate colleagues and the Trump administration to make the President’s full vision a reality.” White House Issues Key Digital Assets Report Hill’s comments come just one day after the White House unveiled its landmark crypto report , “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” pursuant to Trump’s January 2025 executive order, which established a crypto working group.

This strategic decision, centered around a substantial Mill City Ventures SUI acquisition , signifies a bold step into the digital asset landscape and could reshape perceptions of institutional engagement with cryptocurrencies. It’s a fascinating development that begs a closer look at what it means for the future of finance. What Does the Mill City Ventures SUI Acquisition Entail? Mill City Ventures recently disclosed that it successfully raised an impressive $450 million through a private placement. But where did these significant funds go? According to a report by The Block, the entirety of this capital was strategically deployed to acquire a staggering 76,271,187 SUI tokens. This massive acquisition was not conducted on a public exchange but rather through an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction directly with the Sui Foundation. This method of acquisition is particularly noteworthy, as it offers unique advantages and insights into the evolving landscape of institutional crypto investments. Sizeable Investment: $450 million represents a substantial commitment, underscoring Mill City Ventures’ serious intent in the digital asset space. Direct Transaction: The OTC nature of the deal with the Sui Foundation bypasses public exchanges, often preferred by institutions for large-volume transactions to minimize market impact. Strategic Asset: SUI, as the native token of the Sui blockchain, is a relatively new but high-potential Layer 1 blockchain, making this a forward-looking investment. Why is SUI an Attractive Asset for Institutional Investors? SUI, the native token of the Sui blockchain, has quickly garnered attention since its mainnet launch. Developed by Mysten Labs, a team with strong ties to Meta’s Diem project, Sui is designed for high performance, low latency, and scalability, aiming to power the next generation of Web3 applications. Its object-centric model and parallel execution capabilities make it particularly appealing for gaming, DeFi, and social applications. For an entity like Mill City Ventures, investing in SUI could be driven by several factors: Technological Innovation: Sui’s unique architecture promises superior throughput and developer experience, positioning it as a strong contender in the Layer 1 race. Growth Potential: As a relatively new blockchain, SUI offers significant upside potential if its ecosystem grows and adoption increases. Diversification: For a non-bank lending company, adding a high-growth digital asset like SUI to its portfolio offers diversification beyond traditional financial instruments. Strategic Alignment: The acquisition could signal Mill City Ventures’ belief in the long-term viability and disruptive potential of blockchain technology in finance. Understanding Over-the-Counter (OTC) Transactions in Crypto The choice of an OTC transaction for the Mill City Ventures SUI acquisition is a key detail. Unlike buying and selling on public exchanges, OTC deals involve direct transactions between two parties, often facilitated by an OTC desk or broker. This method is frequently favored by institutional investors for large trades due to several benefits and considerations: Feature OTC Transactions Exchange Transactions Market Impact Minimal; large orders don’t directly affect public order books. Significant; large orders can cause price slippage. Pricing Negotiated price, often a fixed rate for the entire volume. Market-driven, subject to real-time fluctuations. Privacy Higher degree of privacy; transaction details not immediately public. Publicly recorded on the blockchain (for crypto) and visible on order books. Liquidity Can facilitate large trades even in illiquid markets. Dependent on available liquidity on the exchange. Counterparty Risk Present; mitigated by reputable OTC desks. Minimal; exchanges act as intermediaries. The OTC route ensures that Mill City Ventures could acquire such a substantial amount of SUI without causing significant price volatility on public exchanges, which would likely have driven up their cost. This method also allows for more customized terms and direct negotiation, which is crucial for deals of this magnitude. What are the Broader Implications for the Crypto Market? The Mill City Ventures SUI acquisition is more than just a single transaction; it’s a powerful signal. It underscores a growing trend of traditional financial institutions exploring and embracing digital assets. This move by a Nasdaq-listed company suggests a maturation of the crypto market and increasing institutional confidence. Validation for SUI: Such a large institutional investment provides significant validation for the Sui blockchain and its native token, potentially boosting its credibility and attracting further interest from both retail and institutional investors. Bridging TradFi and Crypto: This acquisition exemplifies the ongoing convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). As more established players enter the space, it can lead to greater liquidity, stability, and regulatory clarity. Shifting Investment Strategies: Companies like Mill City Ventures are looking beyond traditional asset classes for growth and diversification, recognizing the potential of high-growth blockchain technologies. This could encourage other traditional firms to follow suit. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional participation often brings heightened regulatory attention. While this can be challenging, it can also lead to clearer guidelines, fostering a more secure environment for future investments. Challenges and Considerations for Such Large-Scale Crypto Investments While the Mill City Ventures SUI acquisition presents exciting opportunities, it also comes with inherent challenges and considerations. Investing in cryptocurrencies, even for large institutions, carries risks that differ from traditional asset classes. Volatility: The crypto market is known for its extreme price volatility. A $450 million investment in SUI is exposed to significant fluctuations, which could impact Mill City Ventures’ financial performance. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite growing clarity, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and evolving across different jurisdictions. Future regulations could impact the value or usability of the acquired SUI. Custody and Security: Managing such a large quantity of digital assets securely requires robust custody solutions and cybersecurity measures to protect against hacks or loss. Integration Challenges: Integrating digital assets into a traditional finance company’s balance sheet, accounting practices, and risk management frameworks can be complex. Market Perception: While potentially positive, the market’s reaction to a traditional company holding a significant crypto position can be unpredictable, influencing investor sentiment. Mill City Ventures, as a non-bank lending and special finance company, likely possesses the financial acumen and risk management frameworks to navigate these complexities. However, their experience will undoubtedly serve as a case study for other firms contemplating similar ventures. A New Era of Financial Convergence? The strategic Mill City Ventures SUI acquisition marks a significant milestone in the ongoing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. It demonstrates a growing appetite among established financial entities to not just observe but actively participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This isn’t merely about buying tokens; it’s about acknowledging the fundamental shift that blockchain technology is bringing to finance. As more institutions like Mill City Ventures commit substantial capital to digital assets, we can anticipate a future where crypto assets are increasingly viewed as legitimate, investable instruments within diversified portfolios. This convergence promises to unlock new liquidity, foster innovation, and potentially redefine how value is stored, transferred, and managed globally. The journey is still in its early stages, but moves like this indicate that the path forward is becoming clearer, paving the way for a more interconnected financial world.

Both alleged crypto criminals will be required to wear ankle monitors for the duration of their confinement. Eric Adams’ Security Detail Under Scrutiny Duplessie and Woeltz were indicted last month on charges, including unlawful imprisonment, assault, and kidnapping, after the unidentified barefoot victim flagged down a traffic officer shortly after escaping captivity. The man told authorities he was lured from his home country, Italy, to a luxury SoHo townhouse on May 6 and held against his will by Duplessie and Woeltz. The duo allegedly bound, shocked, cut, and threatened the man with a gun in an attempt to access his Bitcoin holdings . Both defendants have pleaded not guilty, claiming the victim was allowed to move freely and even party during the alleged captivity. “Victims of abuse are not always going to act the way we expect them to,” prosecutor Sania Khan said in a recent hearing. Mayor Eric Adams’ name has also been drawn into the scandal after two officers—members of his private security detail—were placed on modified duty for driving the victim from the airport to his captors’ home.
