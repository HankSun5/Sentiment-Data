Individuals interested in joining the growing mining industry must invest in a specialized computer system, steady internet, reliable energy supply, and a good amount of skill to manage the process. Related Reading: Why One Analyst Says Now’s The Time To Buy XRP—Before It Hits $14 As such, miners often turn to credit facilities to fund their operations. Today, mining costs continue to grow, with some experts saying that costs have skyrocketed to $49,500 as of the second quarter. CoinShares reports that the second quarter data is $2,300 more than the first quarter when mining costs average $47,200. The investment company further explained that the miners’ cash expenses average $85,900, and prediction costs amount to $96,100. Failing to secure a credit line is now a common complaint among BTC miners, while others say rising interest rates worsen their situation. BTC Miners Fail To Capitalize On Recent Price Rallies Bitcoin mining is inextricably linked to the digital asset’s extreme volatility. For example, many of our miners failed to capitalize on the rumors of Bitcoin ETFs circulating in late 2023. In January 2024, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved the applications of at least 11 ETFs, pushing Bitcoin to breach the $70k level. The sudden increase in the asset’s valuation only showed that the mining industry is sensitive to these price movements, especially after the halving of rewards took effect. Today, many mining analysts are looking at models that can anticipate the asset’s continuing increase in hash rate. Current models used by most miners expect the rate to hit 765 EH/s. Time For BTC Mining To Embrace Alternative Energy Sources? One of the complaints against BTC mining is that it hurts the environment due to the massive energy requirements, not to mention the carbon footprint it emits. Experts say that if miners use alternative energy sources, we can reduce our carbon footprint by 63% by 2050. Miners should be ready to embrace these alternative energy sources since expenses grow as the hash rate increases. Related Reading: Solana DeFi Momentum Soars With $5.7 Billion Locked In Q3 As Costs Rise, Some Bitcoin Miners Turn To AI Since mining efficiency is starting to fall, many miners are looking for ways to augment their revenues. For example, many experienced miners are holding tokens instead of mining them. Others turn to AI-related solutions as a potential source of revenue. It’s safe to say that the BTC mining industry is entering a new phase. When planning and moving forward, miners and other stakeholders must consider the challenges, from costs to compliance to competition. As costs continue to increase, miners must find solutions and options to remain profitable.

BTC is holding steady above the $68,000 mark, a critical level that has shifted from resistance to a solid demand zone. Analysts see this level as essential for maintaining bullish momentum, especially with high-stakes events on the horizon. Key data from Coinglass reveals a notable drop in Bitcoin’s open interest, suggesting that many investors are closing their positions amid the uncertainty surrounding the election and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Thursday. This decline in open interest reflects a cautious market stance as traders anticipate the election outcome and its potential influence on broader financial markets and Bitcoin’s trajectory. Related Reading: Solana Likely To Target $200 ‘If It Holds Current Support’ – What To Expect With BTC managing to hold above this demand zone, the coming days will be crucial for confirming its direction. A sustained hold could strengthen BTC’s outlook, setting it up for a potential breakout. Conversely, increased selling pressure tied to market reactions could put this level to the test. The week ahead could be a defining moment for Bitcoin’s price action as macro events unfold. Bitcoin Investors Preparing For This Week Bitcoin is gearing up for what could be the most defining week of this market cycle. Approaching all-time highs, BTC is facing heightened volatility as two critical events unfold: the U.S. presidential election and the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates. These events are poised to impact Bitcoin and global financial markets, potentially shaping global trade policies and economic stability. Recent data from Coinglass highlights that investors are bracing for a turbulent week as open interest in Bitcoin dropped significantly, with many traders opting to close their long and short positions before the election. This retreat in open interest signals caution, as the crypto market anticipates significant volatility stemming from the election results and the Fed’s rate decision. Coinglass shared an analysis on X, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s price could experience extreme swings regardless of who wins the election, likening it to a “wild rollercoaster.” This week is crucial for Bitcoin and the broader global economy, with analysts suggesting that the election could set the tone for international economic policies and trade relations in the years to come. The Fed’s rate decision, scheduled just days after the election, adds additional uncertainty, as it could dictate monetary policy direction and market liquidity. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Reveals Buying Opportunities At Lower Prices – Details With BTC teetering near historic highs, investors are closely watching these events to learn about market direction. Whether Bitcoin breaks to new heights or experiences a pullback largely depends on the unfolding economic landscape. For now, Bitcoin remains on edge, with investors poised for a week that could define its trajectory for the months ahead. BTC Testing Crucial Liquidity Bitcoin is trading at $68,800 after falling short of breaking its all-time highs last week. This week promises heightened unpredictability for BTC’s price action, driven by major events in the global economy. Key levels will be essential to watch: if Bitcoin can maintain support above $68,000, it will likely set the stage for another attempt to surge past its record high. However, volatility may test this support, potentially shaking out “weak hands” before any significant upward momentum. Should BTC dip below $68,000, further pullbacks could follow, allowing institutional buyers to accumulate before a renewed push. If Bitcoin successfully breaks above its $73,794 all-time high, it will enter a price discovery phase, where the lack of resistance can trigger a rally fueled by FOMO (fear of missing out) among investors. This upward momentum in a price discovery zone often leads to rapid price increases as more buyers enter the market.

A CryptoQuant analyst known as CoinLupin recently provided an analysis on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, focusing on Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a metric often used to gauge Bitcoin’s value compared to its on-chain fundamentals. With macroeconomic factors creating uncertainty in the crypto markets, CoinLupin shared insights on the significance of MVRV for evaluating Bitcoin’s current market position. Related Reading: Mt. Gox Stirs Market with 500 Bitcoin Transfer to Unknown Wallets—What’s Next for BTC? MVRV And Historical Cycle Peaks The MVRV ratio, currently around 2, indicates that Bitcoin’s market value is approximately double its on-chain realized value, reflecting the average price paid by all asset holders. CoinLupin explained that the key lies in observing trend changes within the MVRV ratio over time rather than fixating on this absolute value. Using the 365-day Bollinger Band for MVRV along with the 4-year average—a common reflection of Bitcoin’s cyclical trends—the analyst noted that the MVRV ratio is currently above the long-term average and recently exceeded its 365-day moving average. According to CoinLupin, this suggests that Bitcoin’s upward trend remains intact. CoinLupin elaborated on the potential significance of Bitcoin’s MVRV levels, particularly regarding historical cycle peaks. In previous cycles, Bitcoin has typically peaked when the MVRV ratio is between 3 and 3.6. While Bitcoin’s current MVRV of 2 does not yet approach this peak range, the upward trend in the MVRV indicates that the market may still have room for growth if historical patterns hold. Should the Realized Value (RV) remain constant, CoinLupin’s analysis projects that Bitcoin would need a price increase of around 43% to 77% to reach an MVRV level between 3 and 3.6. This translates to a potential price target range of $95,000 to $120,000, provided market conditions support upward momentum. However, the analyst also noted that the Realized Value could increase as new buying interest emerges, potentially pushing peak valuations beyond these estimated levels. Bitcoin Market Performance After several weeks and days of building momentum to surge past the $70,000 resistance, Bitcoin has again fallen below this price mark, indicating that there might not be enough momentum yet to move further to the upside. So far, the asset has declined by nearly 1% in the past week. However, BTC currently trades for $68,306, recording a slight increase in price by 1% as its 24-hour high remains at $69,317. Interestingly, despite the slight dip in price in the past weeks, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has registered an increase over this period.

BTC is showing signs of weakness and upsides might be capped near the $69,200 level. Bitcoin started a fresh decline from the $70,000 zone.

There is a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $68,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could struggle to recover above the $69,200 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Faces Hurdles Bitcoin price failed to start a fresh increase and extended losses below the $70,500 zone. There was a move below the $70,000 and $69,200 support levels. The price even declined below $68,000 and tested $66,800. A low was formed at $66,836 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the $67,500 resistance. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $71,576 swing high to the $66,836 low. Bitcoin price is now trading below $70,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $68,200 level. There is also a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $68,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first key resistance is near the $69,200 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $71,576 swing high to the $66,836 low. A clear move above the $69,200 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $70,000. A close above the $70,000 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $71,200 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $72,000 resistance level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $69,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $67,400 level. The first major support is near the $66,800 level. The next support is now near the $66,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $65,500 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level.

Bitcoin ETFs Surpass One Million BTC Milestone According to a chart shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez on X, the cumulative BTC holdings in Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded one million BTC within this short period. To recall, after a lot of deliberation, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year in January. To say that Bitcoin ETFs have proven to be a resounding success won’t be an overstatement. Related Reading: Record-Breaking Day: Spot Bitcoin ETF Trading Exceeds $3 Billion As BTC Eyes Record Peak Bitcoin ETFs have recorded a cumulative total net inflow of $24.15 billion to date. Martinez added that the total value of BTC held by these ETFs currently stands at approximately $70 billion. From a price perspective, BTC has jumped from about $41,900 on January 8 to its current price of $68,941, marking an increase of almost 65%. During this period, BTC reached an all-time high (ATH) of $73,737 in March. With over a million BTC now held in Bitcoin ETFs, roughly 5% of the total 21 million BTC supply is tied up in these financial products, reinforcing Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative. Notably, asset manager BlackRock’s IBIT spot BTC ETF leads the market, holding approximately $30 billion net assets. Grayscale’s GBTC follows with $15.22 billion, and Fidelity’s FBTC ranks third with $10.47 billion in net assets. The growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs is also highlighted in a recent CoinShares report, which found that digital asset investment products attracted inflows of over $2.2 billion last week. CoinShares attributed the recent surge in crypto product inflows to the possibility of a Republican victory in the upcoming US presidential election on November 5. Interestingly, higher inflows were seen at the beginning of the week, while outflows emerged toward the end as Democratic candidate Kamala Harris’s odds of winning improved. At the time of writing, decentralized prediction markets platform Polymarket shows Harris a 41.6% chance of winning the presidency, while Republican candidate Donald Trump remains the favorite with a 58.5% chance. Trump Win To Benefit Crypto, Experts Opine While voter opinion on other policies might be split more evenly, the overall consensus as far as crypto is concerned seems to be that a Trump victory may benefit BTC and other digital assets. Related Reading: Trump’s Vision: America To Reign As Crypto And Bitcoin Epicenter, Latest Statement Reveals Earlier this month, JPMorgan stated that retail investors increasingly view BTC as a ‘debasement trade’ to protect their assets’ purchasing power amid inflation and that a Trump win could provide ‘additional upside’ to BTC. That said, Kamala Harris, Biden’s current vice president, is reportedly taking a fresh approach to digital assets, in contrast to the current administration’s perceived cautious stance. Whether this will boost her popularity among crypto-focused voters remains to be seen. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $68,941, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin dominance stands at 56.7%.

ETH is consolidating and might struggle to recover above the $2,500 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh decline from the $2,550 resistance zone. The price is trading below $2,480 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,445 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a recovery wave if it surpasses the $2,445 and $2,500 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Extends Losses Ethereum price struggled to stay above $2,500 and started a fresh decline like Bitcoin. ETH declined below the $2,450 and $2,420 levels. It tested the $2,350 support zone. A low was formed at $2,357 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the $2,385 resistance zone. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,583 swing high to the $2,357 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,445 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,445 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $2,470 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,583 swing high to the $2,357 low. The main resistance is now forming near $2,500. A clear move above the $2,500 resistance might send the price toward the $2,550 resistance. An upside break above the $2,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,620 resistance zone. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,445 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,380 level. The first major support sits near the $2,350 zone. A clear move below the $2,350 support might push the price toward $2,285. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,220 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,150.

SOL price is consolidating and might struggle to recover above the $165 resistance. SOL price started a fresh decline after it struggled near the $175 zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $170 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $162 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward movement if it stays above the $155 and $150 support levels. Solana Price Extends Losses Solana price struggled to clear the $180 resistance and started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $175 and $172 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below $165 and tested the $155 support zone. A low was formed at $155 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $173 swing high to the $155 low. Solana is now trading below $162 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $160 level. The next major resistance is near the $162 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $162 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The main resistance could be $165 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $173 swing high to the $155 low. A successful close above the $165 resistance level could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $172. Any more gains might send the price toward the $180 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $165 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $155 level. The first major support is near the $150 level. A break below the $150 level might send the price toward the $135 zone. If there is a close below the $135 support, the price could decline toward the $124 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 50 level.

Cartwright’s New Allocation Strategy In its announcement, Cartwright, specializing in defined benefit and hybrid pension schemes, emphasized the significance of incorporating Bitcoin into retirement plans. The firm recently advised its first scheme on a 3% Bitcoin allocation, which aligns with its long-term investment strategy while prioritizing “robust risk management” at both the asset and scheme levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Risk-To-Reward Ratio Is ‘Too Good To Pass Up’ – Top Analyst Sets $6,000 Target Sam Roberts, Cartwright’s director of investment consulting, highlighted the growing trend among trustees to seek new solutions that can future-proof their pension schemes amid economic uncertainties: This Bitcoin allocation is a strategic move that not only offers diversification but also taps into an asset class with a unique asymmetric risk-return profile… Integrating Bitcoin into a pension scheme’s investment strategy is a bold step that reflects the forward-thinking nature of the trustees involved. Roberts underscored that while Bitcoin presents significant potential upside, it also requires careful management of associated risks. “Our approach ensures that schemes can benefit from the significant potential upside while limiting the potential downside,” he explained. Bitcoin In Pension Plans Steve Robinson, Cartwright’s head of investment implementation, elaborated on the operational procedures for Bitcoin investments. He noted that these procedures have been tailored to maximize the security of the asset while enabling swift profit-taking: Our commitment to engaging with emerging innovative technologies ensures that trustees remain at the cutting edge of investment solutions. By combining a secure custodial solution with mechanisms to capitalize on profits quickly, Cartwright aims to make Bitcoin accessible to risk-averse pension schemes. The low minimum investment threshold will reportedly allow a wider range of pension schemes to participate, contrasting with traditional investment ideas that often require substantial capital.

The firm said it is also optimistic that this strategic move will inspire other institutional investors in the UK to follow suit and explore the benefits of BTC. Robinson concluded that this approach will provide long-term value to scheme members while reducing the reliance on employer contributions, ultimately enhancing the sustainability of pension funds in an evolving economic landscape. Despite these moves by pension funds worldwide to invest in Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $67,760 at the time of writing, reflecting the volatility experienced in recent days ahead of the anticipated US presidential election on November 5.
