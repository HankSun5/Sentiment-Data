The $WLFI token has a confirmed circulating supply of 24.6 billion. Only 20% of that total will be sold to the public according to the details provided by the launch team. This asset will allow holders to participate in the project’s governance decision regarding its roadmap, tokenomics, use cases, and more. WLFI is officially coming to @binance the largest crypto exchange in the world https://t.co/MnPbpPZPlI — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) September 1, 2025 At the time of writing, $WLFI officially been listed by Binance and other top crypto exchanges like Upbit, Gate.io, and Bybit. The launch of this widely awaited Trump-backed digital asset seems to have triggered a rally for Official Trump ($TRUMP). The President’s meme coin has outperformed all other tokens in the top 10 of this category in the past 5 days, with gains of 3.1% during this period. Trading volumes have also increased by 180% in the past 24 hours ahead of $WLFI’s launch, favoring a bullish Trump Coin price prediction as technical indicators show that positive momentum is accelerating. Trump Coin Price Prediction: $WLFI Launch Could Push $TRUMP to $80 – 10X Gain Ahead? Trump Coin broke out of a falling wedge in the 4-hour chart as the launch of $WLFI may be providing a strong tailwind for this meme coin. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that positive momentum has gained traction as the oscillator has reached overbought levels. Although this typically indicates that a minor pullback could occur in the near term, it is typically an indication that buying pressure is strong. This favors a bullish Trump Coin price prediction that could propel the token to $30 shortly. A confirmed breakout above $17.5 would pave the way for this major uptick. However, the full upside potential for $TRUMP at this point is much higher. Estimates point that the meme coin could reach $80 (a 1,000% gain) as the public’s interest in all digital assets linked to the President and the Trump Family could receive a big boost from this key event. The growing popularity of meme coins like $TRUMP is what has made the Solana blockchain so attractive for tokens in this category. One of this year’s most successful crypto presales , Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has opted to migrate its tokens to this network as it continues to make progress with its ambitious roadmap. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Could Explode After Burning Over 2 Billion Tokens on Ethereum Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is a fun mix between The Wolf of Wall Street and the beloved Pepe the Frog meme. This successful meme coin raised millions during its presale, and it is now ready to take the next step in its growth by launching on Solana. The team behind $WEPE introduced an attractive incentive to complete the migration fast. The corresponding dollar value of all Ethereum tokens burned will be burned in Solana as well. This will reduce the circulating supply and could ignite a strong rally once the migration is completed. Thus far, 2.3 billion $WEPE tokens have been burned. You can buy this meme and join the $WEPE army before its post-migration pump by visiting the official Wall Street Pepe website .

51036898,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=198134,1756764012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/51036898.jpeg,Crypto Liquidations: Urgent $104 Million Wiped Out in an Hour,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-liquidations-urgent/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidations: Urgent $104 Million Wiped Out in an Hour The cryptocurrency market just experienced a sudden jolt, with a staggering $104 million worth of futures liquidated in a single hour. This dramatic event, part of a larger trend that saw $453 million in crypto liquidations over the past 24 hours, sends an urgent signal to traders and investors alike. What exactly are these crypto liquidations , and what do these massive figures truly mean for the volatile world of digital assets? Understanding Crypto Liquidations: What Just Happened? When we talk about crypto liquidations , we’re referring to the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s initial margin – the collateral they put up – is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. Essentially, the market moved against their bet so significantly that the exchange had to step in to prevent further losses for the trader and the platform. This process is an inherent risk of futures trading, especially when high leverage is involved. Traders use leverage to amplify their potential gains, but it also magnifies potential losses. Therefore, a small market movement can trigger a large-scale liquidation event, as we’ve just witnessed with these substantial crypto liquidations . Why Do These Massive Crypto Liquidations Occur? Several factors contribute to such significant crypto liquidations . Primarily, market volatility plays a crucial role. Cryptocurrencies are known for their rapid price swings, which can quickly push leveraged positions into liquidation territory. A sudden price drop or surge can cascade, triggering multiple liquidations almost simultaneously. High Leverage: Many traders use high leverage, sometimes 50x or even 100x, meaning a small price change can wipe out their margin. Sudden Market Movements: Unexpected news, whale activity, or broader economic shifts can cause rapid price changes. Cascading Effect: One liquidation can trigger others as market orders from forced closures add selling pressure, leading to further price drops and more liquidations. The recent $104 million in crypto liquidations in one hour highlights how quickly these events can unfold, leaving little time for traders to react. The Devastating Impact of Crypto Liquidations on Traders For individual traders, being liquidated is a devastating experience. It means losing their entire margin, and sometimes even more, depending on the exchange’s policies and the speed of the market movement. Beyond the financial loss, there’s a significant psychological toll. Many traders enter leveraged positions hoping for quick gains, only to find themselves caught in a market downturn. These events serve as a stark reminder of the risks involved in futures trading. They underscore the importance of understanding margin requirements, liquidation prices, and implementing robust risk management strategies. Without these precautions, even experienced traders can fall victim to the market’s unpredictable nature, as evidenced by the massive crypto liquidations reported. Navigating the Volatile Landscape: Strategies to Mitigate Risk While crypto liquidations are an unavoidable part of leveraged trading, traders can adopt strategies to minimize their exposure and protect their capital. Prudent risk management is not just a recommendation; it’s a necessity in such a volatile environment. Here are some actionable insights: Use Lower Leverage: Reducing leverage significantly decreases the risk of liquidation. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: These automatically close your position if the price hits a predefined level, limiting potential losses. Manage Position Sizing: Never risk more than a small percentage of your total portfolio on a single trade. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news and sentiment to anticipate potential price movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even within the crypto space. By understanding the mechanics of crypto liquidations and proactively managing risk, traders can better navigate the unpredictable tides of the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: Learning from Massive Market Shifts The recent figures of $104 million in crypto liquidations in an hour and $453 million over 24 hours are more than just numbers; they represent significant market shifts and personal losses for many traders. These events are powerful reminders of the inherent volatility and risks associated with leveraged cryptocurrency trading. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the potential for rapid losses through liquidation is equally real. For anyone involved in crypto, understanding the dynamics of futures trading and the mechanisms behind crypto liquidations is crucial. Prioritizing robust risk management, utilizing tools like stop-loss orders, and maintaining a cautious approach are paramount to surviving and thriving in this exciting yet challenging financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean when futures are liquidated in crypto? Futures liquidation in crypto means an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin collateral is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses due to adverse market movements. Why did $104 million worth of crypto futures get liquidated so quickly? Such rapid and massive liquidations typically occur due to sudden, significant price movements in the market, amplified by traders using high leverage. This creates a cascading effect where one liquidation triggers others. How can traders avoid crypto liquidations? Traders can reduce the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, managing their position sizes, and continuously monitoring market conditions to react promptly to changes. Do crypto liquidations affect the broader market? Yes, large-scale crypto liquidations can increase market volatility and contribute to price downturns, as forced selling pressure from liquidated positions adds to overall market supply. Is futures trading safe in cryptocurrency? Futures trading in cryptocurrency is inherently risky due to market volatility and the use of leverage. While it offers potential for high returns, it also carries a significant risk of substantial losses, including full liquidation of margin.

With Bitcoin consolidating around key levels, attention is shifting to altcoins that could deliver outsized returns before the next big pump. Analysts say a handful of tokens are attracting both retail and institutional demand, and for good reason. One of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has become a hot topic after its presale nearly sold out, reminding investors of the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin when those who moved quickly saw exponential gains. XRP Eyes a Return to Strength Ripple’s XRP remains a favorite for investors betting on utility and adoption. Its cross-border payment network continues to expand, with growing partnerships in Asia and the Middle East. After recent price pressure, traders are watching whether XRP can reclaim momentum, with forecasts suggesting it could push toward new yearly highs if the market turns risk-on. Solana’s Speed Still a Major Draw Solana (SOL) has recovered from multiple setbacks, proving its resilience in the competitive Layer-1 space. With transaction speeds that rival traditional financial systems and a growing DeFi ecosystem, SOL is seen as one of the strongest contenders for long-term growth. If institutional flows extend beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana could be one of the top beneficiaries. MAGACOIN FINANCE Heating Up While established names dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building one of the strongest early-stage communities of 2025. Its presale is moving at record speed, with allocations vanishing quickly as whales and retail buyers compete for a spot. Analysts point out that early investors could see as much as 40x returns if MAGACOIN FINANCE mirrors past breakout performances from other meme-powered projects. With a countdown now live and the presale almost sold out, this could be one of the last chances to enter before the next pump phase begins. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Gains Serious Traction Hyperliquid (HYPE) has quickly become a favorite in the decentralized trading space. With near-zero fees and growing daily volumes, the project is winning over traders who demand performance and scalability. As its ecosystem develops, many see HYPE as one of the most undervalued opportunities in the market today. Dogecoin Refuses to Fade Despite new meme coins popping up every week, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to command loyalty. Its massive community, strong branding, and new use cases in payments keep it relevant. DOGE has historically surprised skeptics, and if history repeats itself, another major rally could be around the corner. Cardano Pushes Toward Long-Term Adoption Cardano (ADA) has taken a slower but steady path, focusing on peer-reviewed development and scalability. With Hydra scaling technology rolling out, ADA is preparing to handle thousands of transactions per second. This foundation could power new adoption in DeFi, identity solutions, and enterprise-level blockchain applications. Analysts suggest ADA could benefit from the next wave of institutional attention, making it a coin to watch in the coming months. Conclusion As Bitcoin holds its ground, the real action could soon shift to altcoins. XRP and Solana are positioning for institutional inflows, Dogecoin and HYPE keep expanding their reach, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting records with its fast-selling presale. With the countdown nearly finished, investors looking for the next explosive opportunity may not want to wait much longer.

Why XRP Could Outperform BTC And ETH The core of his case is a comparative liquidity mapping across BTC, ETH, and XRP. On Bitcoin, he notes that downside pools around “about 106K” have been a persistent magnet on intraday timeframes, but the daily heatmap still shows heavier clusters above spot. “Now we’re down at these levels, it’s more likely than not that we do continue to take this liquidity here for Bitcoin,” he says. The analyst adds that on the daily timeframe “to the upside there could be a push into this liquidity about $126K–$128K and then we’re starting to see orange liquidity now at $141,000.” He frames any reversal as fast and reflexive: “When we get this move back to the upside… it’s going to be pretty aggressive and people are going to be caught on the wrong side of the trade.” Related Reading: XRP Price Gets $20 Target: The 2 Scenarios That Could Play Out From Here Ethereum’s setup, by contrast, is described as tactically softer after already tapping significant overhead liquidity during its prior pop. On his hourly mapping, the denser pools sit below recent lows, implying a non-trivial risk of mean reversion. “We actually have come back to this sort of area as well and we can see this more dense liquidity again below us sitting at around $4,050ish… the dense liquidity sits about $4,000 to $4,450,” he explains, characterizing ETH as “a bit hands off” for now—while also flagging that today’s US market closure for a public holiday can distort intraday reads. The crux of the bullish divergence is on XRP. On the hourly basis, he shows that XRP has already swept and “taken the red liquidity below,” leaving the “main liquidity… above,” a configuration he views as conducive to an upside reversal if bid momentum emerges. “Is XRP front-running here? Is it going to front-run altcoins?” he asks, pointing to the token’s different placement on the liquidity map relative to BTC and ETH. Extending the lens to relative performance, he highlights the XRP/BTC pair on the four-hour chart, where a prior resistance box has been flipped to support and momentum has repeatedly wicked into oversold territory with constructive reactions. Related Reading: XRP And Dogecoin On The Edge Of ‘Full Port’ Breakout, Says Raoul Pal “When we’re at this level, we want to flip this resistance into support. Currently, we are holding that support,” he says, adding that while such oversold prints do not perfectly call bottoms, “more often than not, they have had a decent reaction, especially when we’re in an area of support like this.” On higher timeframes, he reiterates that XRP’s heavier liquidity sits overhead—interpreting that as dry powder for continuation if spot can reclaim momentum—while BTC still has an attractive path to vacuum upper pools once immediate downside pockets are cleaned. Ethereum, having already consumed much of its near-term upside liquidity, could underperform tactically until its lower clusters are tested or rebalanced. The analyst ties the mosaic together with a cycle view that remains incomplete: “That’s one of the reasons I really don’t think the top is in yet for crypto.” He stresses that the work is descriptive, not prescriptive. “This doesn’t mean that this is my opinion specifically. I’m just showing you charts here,” he says, before reiterating the cycle-long thesis: “I’ve said for the whole cycle, I think XRP is leading.” The coming weeks, he adds, should clarify whether the structural divergence he outlines translates into XRP leadership on the tape as broader market euphoria returns and sidelined traders chase. At press time, XRP traded at $2.77.

51039093,570708,1756764059,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51039093.jpeg,"Solana Set To Become The Most Decentralized Blockchain, Fund CEO Claims",https://bitcoinist.com/solana-become-most-decentralized-blockchain/,"Justin Bons, founder and CIO of Cyber Capital, has ignited a fresh decentralization debate with a sweeping thesis that Solana’s economics and roadmap will propel it past Ethereum on virtually every decentralization metric over time. In an August 30 thread, Bons opens with the blunt contention that “Solana is destined to become the most decentralized blockchain,” arguing that decentralization, in practice, is financed by fee revenue generated at scale—not by keeping hardware requirements artificially low. “Decentralization ultimately comes from fees,” he writes, adding that without meaningful L1 scalability “Ethereum loses the game.” Solana Destined For Decentralization Leadership? Bons’s core claim rests on an explicitly economic model of security and governance. If useful blockspace generates fees and those fees fund validator economics, the network can support a broader, healthier operator set. In his telling, Solana is already on this trajectory, while Ethereum’s rollup-centric approach externalizes activity—and the fees that come with it—away from the base layer. “Fees are what will ultimately pay for the majority of security, scarcity & decentralization,” he asserts, positioning Solana’s aggressive L1 scaling as the path that sustains those flows on-chain rather than exporting them. From there, Bons turns to the scoreboard he thinks matters. He juxtaposes the two networks’ Nakamoto Coefficients , claiming “ETH’s Nakamoto Coefficient is 2! SOL’s Nakamoto Coefficient is 19!”—a comparison designed to dramatize where, in his view, Ethereum’s staking market structure has drifted. He attributes the gap to Ethereum’s “decision not to implement native delegation,” which he says allowed one liquid-staking provider to “dominate staking instead.” In governance terms, he draws the starkest possible contrast: “ETH has centralized governance! SOL has decentralized governance!” The rhetoric is intentionally provocative, but it is consistent with his broader thesis that decentralization is not purely a hardware or validator-count contest; it is an emergent property of fee-funded security, stake dispersion and stakeholder power. A centerpiece of Bons’s argument is what he calls the “security budget.” He models it as a function of market capitalization, fee revenue and inflation, adjusted by staking participation and the attack threshold. By his math, Ethereum’s security budget stands at roughly $50.5 billion while Solana’s is about $25.3 billion, leading to his headline conclusion that “SOL price only needs to double to surpass ETH’s security budget .” The point is less the exact number than the direction: he believes Solana’s higher staking participation and L1-retained fees make it the more efficient security engine per dollar of market cap—hence his contention that Solana can overtake Ethereum’s security footing even at a smaller valuation. That economic engine, in Bons’s view, is inseparable from Solana’s scaling strategy. He argues that the “ideal blockchain design” must balance node requirements with utility, because at sufficient scale utility produces the fee flows that, in turn, finance broader validator participation and stronger censorship resistance. Designs that fetishize ultra-low node requirements, he says, misread the problem: “The ‘ETH perspective’ represents an overly simplistic understanding of decentralization, where they think low node requirements = decentralization.” By contrast, he frames Solana’s path as the “middle way”—accepting higher node requirements to capture the utility-driven fees that then reinforce security and decentralization. Solana Vs. Ethereum Bons also devotes substantial attention to what he sees as Ethereum’s structural disadvantages. Because Ethereum “is not scaling its L1 meaningfully at all,” he contends, the network lets Layer-2s “take the majority of fees, ” weakening the base layer’s security budget and ceding decentralization headroom in the long run. That design choice, he suggests, also shapes governance: by rejecting on-chain stakeholder governance at L1, Ethereum centralizes effective decision-making socially, whereas Solana—imperfect as it is—has “established” an on-chain governance social contract that can evolve alongside validator economics. “Is SOL perfect? Absolutely not,” he concedes, “however, it is still significantly better than ETH in the long run in every single way, including decentralization & utility!” To underscore the primacy of scale in this framework, Bons reprises a refrain that has run through his research for years: “A blockchain that does not scale is a failure.” The line captures both his investment lens and the causal loop at the heart of his argument: throughput → usage → fees → validator P&L → stake dispersion → censorship resistance. If that loop compounds on L1, he says, Solana’s decentralization will outstrip Ethereum’s. Bons’s quantitative comparisons extend beyond abstract models. He asserts that headline Ethereum validator counts are often misunderstood, because some advocates conflate 32-ETH validator keys with the number of “physical machines involved in block production.” He prefers to compare operator-level footprints and “real” validator infrastructure; under that lens he cites figures of “ETH has 8.8k validators” and “SOL has 1.1k validators,” noting that Ethereum’s advantage on this metric coexists with a market capitalization that is roughly five times larger. His takeaway is that raw validator counts, stripped of operator aggregation and economics, can be a misleading proxy for decentralization. The thread culminates in a forward-looking claim: as Solana’s fee-funded security and governance mature, “SOL will eventually overtake ETH in all decentralization metrics.” He presents this as a consequence of divergent roadmaps rather than a culture war. With L1 scaling and fee capture, Solana can “flip” the composition of its security budget away from inflation and toward revenue, while Ethereum’s L2-heavy design leaves the base layer relatively underfunded by fees.

A noticeable shift is happening as long-time memecoin enthusiasts, who once swore allegiance to DOGE, are beginning to explore a new contender: Layer Brett . With the Dogecoin price showing signs of stagnation, many are looking for the next big opportunity, and $LBRETT is quickly emerging as the token to watch. Currently priced at $0.0053, its presale is attracting serious attention. Layer Brett’s Edge: How Layer 2 Changes the Game Ethereum Layer 1 has always been powerful but comes with drawbacks, slow transactions and gas fees that can climb into double digits. DOGE holders, while loyal, know these scalability issues have long stunted meme coin innovation. Layer Brett is designed to escape that trap. As a Layer 2 blockchain anchored to Ethereum, it enables near-instant transactions at costs of just pennies. This is more than hype, it’s the direction the industry is heading. Ethereum Layer 2 networks are projected to process over $10 trillion annually by 2027. By entering this space early, Layer Brett positions itself not only as a memecoin with viral energy but also as a scalable blockchain solution capable of attracting developers and users alike. It’s the blend of fun and utility that many believe DOGE lacks today. Unlocking Rewards: Why Staking $LBRETT Beats Holding DOGE One of the main reasons Dogecoin price watchers are shifting their focus is the unique earning potential. Early buyers of Layer Brett aren’t just betting on future token appreciation, they’re already locking in massive staking rewards. Early participants in the crypto presale can access APYs in the tens of thousands, far outpacing anything on offer from more established assets. Buying and staking $LBRETT is seamless. Using ETH, USDT, or BNB through MetaMask or Trust Wallet, users can enter the ecosystem in seconds. Add in a $1 million community giveaway, and it’s clear the project is serious about engagement. For DOGE holders frustrated by limited earning options, this is an entirely new playbook. Why Layer Brett Outshines Dogecoin Despite its legendary status, Dogecoin price growth potential is limited. With a current market cap north of $32 billion and a trading price around $0.21, DOGE has matured into a household name, but without much innovation. Its value is still tied heavily to community sentiment and occasional celebrity shoutouts. Layer Brett takes a different path. It blends meme appeal with DeFi utility, aiming to rival Layer 2 leaders like Optimism and Arbitrum. The difference? It does so while capturing the viral energy that made DOGE famous in the first place. Instead of relying on nostalgia, Layer Brett is building the infrastructure for the future, faster transactions, cheaper costs, and high-yield staking. For many, it’s the evolution of what a meme token can be. Final Thoughts: The Next Big Meme Coin? The Dogecoin price outlook looks stable but lacks the explosive growth potential many investors crave. DOGE will always have its place in crypto history, but the search for the next 100x meme coin is leading eyes toward Layer Brett . As the crypto bull run 2025 approaches, projects that combine utility with meme culture will dominate headlines. Layer Brett is proving it’s more than hype, it’s a chance to participate in the next stage of meme coin evolution. With its $LBRETT price still at $0.0053 in presale, unmatched staking rewards, and Layer 2 foundations, it’s no wonder DOGE holders are making the switch.

On Friday, the National Bitcoin Office announced that it had split the country’s holdings, currently 6,284 BTC valued at more than $682 million, into 14 separate addresses. Until now, the government’s Bitcoin treasury had been stored in a single address, a practice often criticized by security experts for exposing public keys to potential long-term vulnerabilities. El Salvador Unveils Public Dashboard for Bitcoin Reserves After Redistribution The office, which operates under the direction of pro-Bitcoin President Nayib Bukele, said the redistribution was part of a broader initiative to enhance the long-term safety of El Salvador’s “National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” Officials emphasized that the move aligns with best practices in Bitcoin custody and also reflects preparations for the looming security risks posed by advancements in quantum computing. El Salvador is moving the funds from a single Bitcoin address into multiple new, unused addresses as part of a strategic initiative to enhance the security and long-term custody of the National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This action aligns with best practices in Bitcoin… — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) August 29, 2025 Quantum computers , unlike traditional machines that process data in binary 0s and 1s, use “qubits,” which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows them to process vast amounts of data at unprecedented speeds. For Bitcoin, the concern centers on Shor’s algorithm , a mathematical technique demonstrated in 1999 that, if deployed on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, could break the elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA) securing Bitcoin’s public and private keys. The threat is particularly acute for addresses whose public keys have already been revealed through transactions. Once a Bitcoin transaction is broadcast, the public key becomes visible on the blockchain, theoretically giving a quantum adversary the ability to calculate the private key and redirect funds before a transaction confirms. Source: Bitcoin Office By splitting funds across multiple unused addresses, each holding no more than 500 BTC, El Salvador has reduced the potential fallout of a future quantum attack. An unused Bitcoin address, whose public key remains hidden, is significantly less exposed. The government said it would maintain transparency through a new public dashboard cataloging all reserve addresses, preserving visibility without relying on a single wallet. Up to 7M BTC Vulnerable to Quantum Attacks, Researchers Say The decision reflects rising urgency in the broader crypto sector regarding quantum threats. Cybersecurity specialists estimate that around 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply , roughly 6 to 7 million BTC, remains vulnerable in older address formats that directly expose public keys. Researchers from Deloitte have suggested that as much as a quarter of all Bitcoin could eventually be at risk if quantum machines mature faster than expected. Quantum computers might sound like another buzzword in the tech world, yet their threat to #cryptocurrency is very real and approaching fast. Scientists may differ on the timeline, but they all agree: “Q-day” is not a matter of if, but when. #Bitcoin https://t.co/SdH4NiTMoo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2024 Warnings from industry veterans have also intensified. In July, David Carvalho, CEO of Naoris Protocol and a former ethical hacker, cautioned that adversaries may already be harvesting blockchain data under a “harvest now, decrypt later” strategy, storing encrypted records today in anticipation of decrypting them with future quantum tools. He suggested that such capabilities may emerge within years rather than decades, contradicting more conservative estimates placing “Q-day” between 2027 and the mid-2030s. Veteran hacker warns Bitcoin's quantum countdown has begun as 30% of supply sits vulnerable in older address formats to imminent quantum computing attacks. #QuantumComputing #Bitcoin https://t.co/LWSRKjHGTI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 21, 2025 The security overhaul also comes as quantum research accelerates worldwide. Tech giants including IBM, Google, and Microsoft are pushing toward quantum processors with millions of qubits, a development that could dramatically shorten the timeline for breaking existing encryption standards. U.S. federal agencies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have been calling for adoption of quantum-resistant algorithms since 2022 . Financial institutions have begun acknowledging the risks. BlackRock has highlighted quantum computing in filings for its Bitcoin ETF , while Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has also warned about the potential exposure of inactive Bitcoin wallets . Bukele’s Daily Bitcoin Buy Claims Contradicted by IMF Review El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin continues to evolve on multiple fronts, though recent disclosures suggest a more measured approach than President Nayib Bukele has long projected. On July 15, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its first formal review of El Salvador’s Bitcoin program since approving a $1.4 billion loan in December 2024. The report contradicted Bukele’s public claims of buying one Bitcoin per day, revealing that no new acquisitions have been made since February 2025 . El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment appears to be faltering under the weight of an IMF loan agreement and declining public engagement. #IMF #ElSalvador https://t.co/65lADRixOH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 26, 2025 Central Bank President Douglas Pablo Rodríguez Fuentes and Finance Minister Jerson Rogelio Posada Molina confirmed in a signed letter that “the stock of Bitcoins held by the public sector remains unchanged.” On-chain movements observed in recent months, the IMF clarified, were internal transfers between hot and cold wallets, not fresh purchases. Assets gained through seizures or reallocations were similarly excluded from state-backed buys. The IMF praised the government’s pivot, calling the changes an important step toward reducing fiscal risk and improving transparency. Among the reforms is a gradual withdrawal from public management of Bitcoin-related services. The Chivo wallet, once promoted as a flagship adoption tool, will be privatized and removed from government oversight by July 2025. Officials say this shift reduces strain on public finances while keeping the wallet operational under private control. At the same time, El Salvador continues to position itself as a symbolic leader in Bitcoin adoption. In August, the government launched “What is Money?”, a financial literacy program aimed at children as young as seven. This isn't just a conference. This is a testament to an extraordinary moment in history. We are proud to announce BITCOIN HISTÓRICO: a global summit on Bitcoin, transformation, and relentless optimism for the future.

These coins are Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), Maxi Doge (MAXI) and Snorter (SNORT), all of which are currently holding their respective presales. Each of these projects combines viral FOMO potential with some strong fundamentals, and each has already raised millions in their sales. And once they list towards the end of the year, a bullish end-of-year really could see them rally strongly, making them some of the best meme coins to buy in 2025. 3 Cryptos to Turn $100 into $10,000+ – 1 September Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) A layer-two network for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) lays claim to operating one of the biggest presales of the year so far. It has raised just over $13.3 million in its heavily subscribed presale, which still has several weeks left to run. Excitement is high for the project, given that it will be launching a fully fledged L2 for Bitcoin, which will help to tap into Bitcoin’s enormous value for DeFi purposes. It will provide Bitcoin users with faster transactions and lower fees, while also enabling smart contract functionality that enables the development of an ecosystem of dapps. Much of its speed and scalability will come from the fact that it’s using Solana’s Virtual Machine (SVM), while it will also be using zero-knowledge rollups for added throughput and privacy. This makes it one of the most capable L2s in the wider crypto ecosystem, and it helps explain why its presale has really taken off. HYPER, its native token, will have a max supply of 21 billion tokens, and it will be necessary to pay for transaction fees. This means it could experience plenty of demand, which will also be heightened by the fact that holders will be able to stake it for regular yields. $HYPER is gearing up for world domination. 13M Raised! pic.twitter.com/UiQ29LmYwQ — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) August 31, 2025 Given its growth, it could take off once it launches, with investors able to buy it early by visiting the Bitcoin Hyper website . Visit the Official Website Here Maxi Doge (MAXI) Another one of the best new cryptos in the market right now, Maxi Doge (MAXI) is an ERC-20 token that aims to push the Dogecoin formula as far as it will go. It opened its presale last month and has already raised more than $1.7 million while also attracting over 11,000 followers on X . Maxi Doge’s appeal is split into two areas, with the first revolving around its viral use of memes and marketing. It will make use of a Maxi Fund, which will amount to 25% of its total supply (150.24 billion MAXI), and which it will use to foster new partnerships and initiatives, all with the aim of broadening its reach. Secondly, it’s in the process of building a community of traders, with the project having a Telegram and a Discord channel where these traders can congregate online. It will run trading contests on its social channels, giving followers the chance to earn rewards and rank on a global leaderboard. These channels will also provide forums in which members can share trading tips and even coordinate strategies. This gives Maxi Doge more fundamental value than your run-of-the-mill meme token, and it’s why it’s one of the new presale coins to watch at the moment. Investors can join the sale at the official Maxi Doge website , where MAXI is currently selling for $0.000255. Visit the Official Website Here Snorter (SNORT) An automated sniping bot, Snorter (SNORT) has now raised an impressive $3.6 million in its ongoing presale. In such a chaotic and unpredictable market, there’s a clear need for something like Snorter, which as a trading bot will help its users buy and sell coins before big price moves. How to trade like a pro with Snorter: Step 1: Paste a token address. Step 2: Sit back. Snorter watches liquidity like a hawk on caffeine. Step 3: The instant funds drop in, I pounce. Buy executed. No hesitation. Green candles caught. pic.twitter.com/euirKrFdnk — Snorter (@SnorterToken) August 28, 2025 It also has a copy trading feature that enables investors to mirror the actions of ‘smarter’ money, providing another way to get ahead of the wider market. Other features include limit orders, atomic swaps and protection from honeypots, making it one of the most complete trading bots in crypto. Its native token, SNORT, will be necessary to pay to access Snorter’s features, giving the token strong utility. It could therefore attract considerable demand, pushing its price up over time, as Snorter gains more users. Given its strong fundamentals, SNORT has a real chance of rallying once its sale ends and it lists, which is why it’s one of the most exciting new cryptos in the market. Investors can join its sale at the Snorter website , where they can connect a compatible wallet (e.g. MetaMask and Best Wallet). It’s currently available at $0.1031, but this will continue to rise for as long as the presale lasts, so buyers should act sooner rather than later.

With profits and open interest at sky-high levels, will this ignite the next market upswing, or is there more to the story? Exchange Reserves Drying Up According to data from CryptoQuant as of the time of writing, the token’s supply levels on exchanges have dropped to 161.8 million, marking a multi-year trend that began in mid-2023, when the price was around $6 to $7. Source: CryptoQuant Despite the dwindling supply levels, the asset has been steadily increasing, now up over 230% since the range from over two years ago. The lower the availability for sale, the lower the pressure on the market. Additionally, dropping reserve levels of tokens on exchanges typically coincides with bull runs, as the limited supply can catalyze price jumps. If LINK sees an increase in buying momentum, the reduced liquidity could set the stage for higher prices. Profits Near Apex Levels Glassnode’s Percent Supply in Profit chart also appears to support the bullish momentum, with data at press time indicating a significant percentage of holders in profit, nearly 90%, which coincides with the last rally in July. Source: Glassnode This could be a bit of a warning sign for LINK investors, though. Such high percentages of traders sitting on unrealized profits could lead to price declines if they decide to take some money off the table. However, this hasn’t been the case for LINK so far, as the asset has maintained a relatively healthy profit-taking margin. Booming Interest Open Interest (OI), the metric that traces the total number of active long and short positions in derivatives markets, has also skyrocketed over the past year. Source: Messari As of September 1, 2024, there was roughly $115 million worth of OI for the token, which has now exploded to over $1.2 billion, according to current data from Messari. This aligns with the broader institutional and retail acceptance of Chainlink and its native token. The project behind LINK has tapped several key partnerships between Web3 and Web2, solidifying its spot as a key player in DeFi, which has helped capture investors’ interest. The oracle service’s token is currently trading at around $23, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Negligible daily dip, compared to the 48% increase for the last month, and 118% for the year.

After years of uncertainty, sentiment around adoption and real-world payments is improving. The core question for traders and long-term holders is simple: can XRP finally make a run to 10 dollars in 2025? While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to pull most of the institutional flow, some investors are diversifying beyond the leaders. That’s why early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE are getting attention as potential high-upside complements to a portfolio built around top assets. Why XRP Could Target $10 The path to double digits needs three things to line up: stronger liquidity, rising utility in payment corridors, and a supportive macro environment. If capital keeps rotating from majors into high-cap altcoins, XRP could benefit from deeper order books and tighter spreads, which historically supports larger price moves. More banks and fintechs testing tokenization and instant settlement can also lift on-chain activity, a key signal for sustained rallies. What must go right First, momentum from Bitcoin staying strong above six figures tends to expand risk appetite for altcoins. Second, steady growth in cross-border volume would reinforce XRP’s use case and help market price in future demand. Third, cleaner global rules around digital assets would encourage bigger participants to step in, improving liquidity and helping price discovery. The Rising Crypto Star In the middle of all this market action, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been flagged by early adopters as a high-potential bet. Presale allocations have been moving quickly, with growing wallet participation and a community focused on long-term utility, not just hype. The appeal is straightforward: limited early access , ongoing development, and a push to reward holders as the ecosystem expands. For investors building a barbell strategy – established large caps on one side, carefully chosen early-stage tokens on the other – MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched as a possible breakout . XRP Price Scenarios for 2025 Bullish case: a strong altcoin season, rising payment volumes, and improved exchange liquidity could create the conditions for a breakout toward $10. This would likely need persistent weekly closes at higher highs, consistent volume expansion, and supportive macro headlines. Base case: if adoption and liquidity improve at a steady pace but the market rotates more slowly, XRP could grind into the $6 to $8 range, setting the stage for a later attempt at double digits. Bearish case: if Bitcoin dominance stays elevated or macro risk flares up, XRP might top out between $3 and $5 and wait for a better window. Sharp pullbacks are common in bull markets, so managing entries and avoiding heavy leverage near resistance becomes important. Conclusion A run to $10 is not guaranteed, but for the first time in years the setup looks achievable if utility, liquidity, and market conditions align. For investors who want both stability and shot-at-moon potential, combining a core position in large caps like XRP with a selective early-stage pick such as MAGACOIN FINANCE is one way to play 2025’s bull market.

In doing so, the Japanese investment house now holds 20,000 BTC worth over $2 billion at current prices. Aggressive Buying Over Recent Months Reports indicate that Metaplanet has been accumulating Bitcoin at a quick rate. In August alone, the company acquired several high-profile deals: 463 BTC for $53.7 million, followed by 518 BTC for $61.4 million, and then another 775 BTC as part of one massive deal worth $93 million. The latest 1,009 BTC purchase lifted its total holdings beyond the 18,888 BTC it previously disclosed. The company has set its year-end target at 30,000 BTC, raising its goal after surpassing 10,000 Bitcoin earlier in the year. To support this, Metaplanet has turned to international markets, securing $837 million in share offerings. Most of that capital has been earmarked for new Bitcoin buys scheduled for September and October. Eric Trump’s Role In The Strategy Metaplanet’s efforts are not only financial but also strategic on a global stage. Eric Trump, the second son of US President Donald Trump, was appointed as a strategic adviser to the board in March 2025. Reports say he is expected to attend a shareholder meeting in Tokyo, where the firm will vote on new fundraising methods. The agenda for the meeting includes potential approval for issuing up to 555 million preferred shares. If approved, the sale could bring in as much as 555 billion yen, or around $3.7 billion, to fuel more Bitcoin acquisitions. The company had already announced plans last week to raise 130.3 billion yen ($880 million) through an overseas share offering. Stock Performance And Market Position Despite hitting a milestone, Metaplanet’s stock slipped by 4.5% on the same day as the announcement, according to Google Finance data. Even so, the stock remains up 135% since the start of the year, suggesting that many investors still support the company’s direction. With its current holdings, Metaplanet has now become the sixth-largest public Bitcoin treasury worldwide, passing Riot Platforms. Only a handful of corporations hold more, including Strategy and Marathon Digital. The firm also reported a 31% Bitcoin yield from July to September 1. This measure reflects the percentage change in the ratio of Bitcoin holdings to fully diluted common shares, and it has been highlighted as a key performance indicator for the company.

It is attempting to consolidate at the $0.24 mark, which could be the cryptocurrency’s first support line for the rest of the week. Upon launch, WLFI reached a high of $0.33 and a low of $0.23 earlier on Monday’s trading session. This represents a nearly 25% gap from the current trading levels and the recently established all-time high for the World Liberty Financial token.

The company initially created 100 billion WLFI tokens, of which about a quarter were sold for a face value of $550 million. However, these tokens were not initially tradeable and could only be used for voting on corporate matters within the company. A vote last month permitted the tokens to be traded, allowing for a nominal total market value of around $6.4 billion based on the current price. In the initial trading phase, 24.7 billion WLFI tokens are set to be available, which includes 7.8 billion tokens earmarked for a newly announced “crypto treasury” company in collaboration with ALT5 Sigma, a Nasdaq-listed fintech company. Critics Raise Conflict Of Interest Concerns Financial disclosures reveal that Donald Trump held approximately 15.75 billion WLFI tokens at the end of last year, which, at the current trading price, would be valued approximately $3.6 billion. However, the Trump family’s involvement in the sector has drawn criticism among Democrats. Senator Elizabeth Warren raised concerns in an April letter, arguing that the Trump family’s financial interests in World Liberty Financial create a conflict of interest that could influence regulatory decisions in favor of cryptocurrency.

A significant development is unfolding with WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI), a DeFi project that has recently put forward a compelling proposal. This initiative centers around a robust strategy involving WLFI token buybacks and burns, aiming to enhance the token’s long-term viability and benefit its holders. If you’re invested in the crypto space, understanding this move is crucial for grasping how projects are building sustainable ecosystems. What Are WLFI Token Buybacks and Burns? Before diving into the specifics of WLFI’s proposal, let’s clarify what WLFI token buybacks and burns entail. In essence, a token buyback occurs when a project uses its generated revenue or funds to repurchase its own tokens from the open market. This action reduces the circulating supply, which can, in turn, increase the token’s scarcity and potentially its price. Token Buyback: The project buys its own tokens from exchanges. Token Burn: The purchased tokens are then permanently removed from circulation, usually by sending them to an unspendable “burn” address. This combined mechanism is a popular strategy employed by many crypto projects to manage supply, reward holders, and demonstrate a commitment to token value. For WLFI, the proposal suggests dedicating all liquidity fees to this process, making it a central pillar of their tokenomics. Unlocking Value Through WLFI Token Buybacks The team behind WorldLibertyFinancial has proposed a game-changing approach: utilizing all fees generated from managing the protocol’s liquidity specifically for WLFI token buybacks and subsequent burns. This is not just a minor adjustment; it’s a fundamental shift in how the project intends to create and distribute value. By committing 100% of these fees, WLFI aims to directly channel protocol success back into the token’s ecosystem. This proposal could significantly impact the token’s economics: Increased Scarcity: Regular burns reduce the total supply, making each remaining WLFI token potentially more valuable. Price Support: Constant buying pressure from the protocol can help stabilize or even increase the token’s market price. Holder Confidence: Such a transparent and direct value-creation mechanism can instill greater trust and confidence among WLFI holders. This strategy demonstrates a clear intent to align the protocol’s operational success with the interests of its token holders, fostering a stronger community and a more robust digital asset. Understanding the WLFI Proposal: A Deep Dive The proposal from the WLFI team, which has garnered attention due to its reported links, outlines a clear path for resource allocation. The core idea is simple yet powerful: any fees collected from the management of the protocol’s liquidity pools will no longer be used for operational costs or other discretionary spending. Instead, every single dollar (or crypto equivalent) will be funneled directly into buying back WLFI tokens from the market and then burning them. Consider the implications: Sustainable Growth: This creates a direct feedback loop where protocol usage directly fuels token value. Transparency: The commitment of “all” fees leaves little room for ambiguity, promoting clear financial practices. Community Focus: It signals a strong commitment to the community, as the benefits of protocol activity are shared with token holders. This move is particularly interesting in the DeFi space, where various fee structures exist. By dedicating 100% of liquidity fees to WLFI token buybacks , the project is setting a high bar for community-centric tokenomics. Potential Benefits and Challenges of WLFI Token Buybacks While the prospect of consistent WLFI token buybacks and burns is exciting, it’s essential to consider both the potential benefits and any challenges that might arise. On the benefit side, as mentioned, increased scarcity and potential price appreciation are key. For example, if the protocol sees significant activity, the continuous demand for WLFI tokens could create a strong floor for its value. However, like any financial strategy, there are nuances: Market Volatility: While buybacks can provide support, they don’t fully insulate a token from broader market downturns. Protocol Performance: The effectiveness of the buyback mechanism is directly tied to the protocol’s ability to generate liquidity fees. If usage declines, so too will the buyback volume. Long-Term Sustainability: The model assumes consistent protocol activity. Therefore, the team’s ongoing development and marketing efforts remain crucial. Ultimately, this proposal positions WLFI as a project that is actively seeking to enhance its token’s economic model, offering a compelling case for potential and existing holders. It’s a bold statement about their long-term vision and commitment to the WLFI ecosystem. A Promising Future for WLFI Holders? The proposal for dedicated WLFI token buybacks and burns represents a significant strategic pivot for WorldLibertyFinancial. By committing all liquidity fees to this mechanism, the project aims to create a self-sustaining cycle of value creation that directly benefits its community. This approach could set a new standard for transparency and holder-centric tokenomics within the DeFi landscape. As the crypto market continues to mature, such innovative strategies will likely play a crucial role in determining project success and investor confidence. It will be interesting to observe how this proposal unfolds and impacts the WLFI token’s journey in the coming months. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary goal of WLFI token buybacks and burns? A1: The primary goal is to reduce the circulating supply of WLFI tokens, increase their scarcity, and potentially enhance their market value for the benefit of holders. Q2: Where do the funds for the WLFI token buybacks come from? A2: The proposal states that all fees generated from managing the protocol’s liquidity will be used exclusively for WLFI token buybacks and subsequent burns. Q3: How does this proposal benefit WLFI token holders? A3: Holders can benefit from increased token scarcity, potential price appreciation due to reduced supply and consistent buying pressure, and enhanced confidence in the project’s long-term value strategy. Q4: Is this strategy common in the DeFi space? A4: While token buybacks and burns are common, dedicating 100% of liquidity fees to this mechanism is a particularly strong commitment, showcasing a direct link between protocol success and token value. Q5: What are the potential risks associated with this strategy? A5: Risks include broader market volatility, the strategy’s effectiveness being dependent on consistent protocol activity and fee generation, and the need for ongoing development to maintain user engagement. Q6: When will this WLFI token buybacks proposal be implemented? A6: The article describes it as a proposal, implying it is either under consideration or pending implementation. Further official announcements from the WLFI team would provide specific timelines. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Layer Brett isn’t just another meme token chasing attention; it’s an Ethereum Layer 2 project combining viral energy with real blockchain utility. At just $0.0053, the presale is catching fire as investors wonder: could $250 today really explode into $100,000 tomorrow? Layer Brett: The memecoin built for Layer 2 What makes Layer Brett stand out in a crowded field of meme coins like PEPE and SHIB? Simple: it’s built on Ethereum Layer 2. That means lightning-fast transactions, ultra-low fees, and scalability designed to handle millions of users. While Pepe price hype helped fuel its meteoric rise, and SHIB leaned on community-driven momentum, both were constrained by older infrastructures. Layer Brett sidesteps those problems, making it a true low gas fee crypto with cutting-edge performance. For users tired of waiting on congested networks or paying $10–20 per transaction, $LBRETT offers a real solution. Why Layer Brett could outshine PEPE and SHIB Tokens like PEPE delivered early fireworks, but most of their value came from speculation rather than sustainable utility. SHIB, meanwhile, expanded its ecosystem with Shibarium, but scaling challenges remain. Layer Brett takes a different approach. Anchored to Ethereum’s security yet operating off-chain, it ensures near-instant trades and staking without crushing fees. It’s meme-born but utility-backed, something PEPE and SHIB lacked in their early stages. Here’s the difference in simple terms: Speed: Transactions in seconds vs. sluggish Layer 1 wait times. Cost: Gas fees slashed to pennies. Utility: Staking, governance, and DeFi potential built in. Scalability: Positioned to capture part of the projected $10 trillion Ethereum Layer 2 market by 2027. This isn’t just hype; it’s the next phase of meme evolution. The power of the presale: $LBRETT at $0.0053 For investors tracking Shiba Inu price prediction models or Pepe price charts, early entry is everything. Imagine being part of PEPE or SHIB before their exponential surges. That’s the opportunity Layer Brett presents right now. Early backers can buy $LBRETT in crypto presale with ETH, USDT, or BNB, and instantly stake tokens for eye-popping APYs, some in the tens of thousands for the earliest participants. Rewards decrease as staking pools fill, so urgency is key. On top of that, a $1 million giveaway ensures community engagement stays high. Unlike many meme token projects, Layer Brett is capped at 10 billion tokens, ensuring controlled supply and transparent tokenomics. This isn’t just a pump; it’s designed for long-term sustainability. PEPE and SHIB: Lessons from meme coin giants Let’s not forget the benchmarks. SHIB once traded at fractions of a penny before rocketing to $0.0000725 in 2021, earning billions in market cap. PEPE reached $0.00002825 in 2024, cementing itself as a cultural phenomenon. Both proved that small bets could turn into fortunes. But while Pepe price and Shiba Inu price prediction continue to spark debates, Layer Brett offers something more: a foundation that merges meme energy with real blockchain efficiency. Conclusion: Which coin wins? Between PEPE, SHIB, and Layer Brett, only one is still on the ground floor. With its $LBRETT price at $0.0053, early staking rewards, and Layer 2 backbone, Layer Brett offers the kind of upside that investors dream about. Pepe price moves may excite traders, and every new Shiba Inu price prediction keeps SHIB in the spotlight, but neither offers the combination of scalability and meme power that Layer Brett does. The future of meme tokens isn’t just about culture; it’s about utility. Layer Brett is proving it can deliver both.

For the astute observer of the digital economy, understanding how AI is transforming the fundamental pillars of commerce offers invaluable insight. This is particularly true for the often-overlooked yet critical area of enterprise back-office operations, where a pioneering Japanese startup, LayerX AI, is making significant waves. With a monumental Series B funding round of $100 million, LayerX is poised to dramatically reshape how businesses in Japan, and potentially beyond, manage their core administrative functions, driving efficiency and innovation. LayerX AI: A Game-Changer in Enterprise Automation LayerX, a name quickly becoming synonymous with advanced AI automation , has successfully closed a $100 million Series B funding round. This significant capital injection, led by the U.S. fund Technology Cross Ventures (TCV) – marking their inaugural investment in a Japanese startup – underscores the global confidence in LayerX’s vision and technology. The company, founded in 2018 by serial entrepreneur Yoshinori Fukushima, has been on a mission to tackle the deeply entrenched inefficiencies within Japan’s corporate landscape. What makes LayerX AI particularly compelling is its strategic focus on automating the mundane yet essential tasks that bog down finance, tax, procurement, and HR departments. This isn’t just about incremental improvements; it’s about a fundamental overhaul, driven by AI, to free up human capital for more strategic endeavors. The company’s valuation, though undisclosed, is reported to be among the largest ever achieved by a seven-year-old Japanese startup at this stage, reflecting the immense potential investors see in its AI-powered solutions. Why is AI Automation Critical for Japanese Enterprises? The need for robust AI automation in Japan is more urgent than ever. Several converging factors are creating a perfect storm, pushing companies towards digital transformation: Aging Demographics and Labor Shortages: Japan faces a severe demographic challenge, leading to a shrinking workforce. Automating routine tasks becomes crucial to maintain productivity and fill labor gaps. Adoption of Generative AI (GenAI): The rapid evolution of GenAI offers new possibilities for automating complex processes, from document generation to data analysis, beyond traditional RPA. 2023 E-Invoicing Implementation: The government’s push for e-invoicing has forced companies to digitize financial processes, highlighting the shortcomings of manual systems. Despite these clear drivers, digital transformation (DX) initiatives often falter. Research indicates that only 16% of DX efforts succeed, with this figure dropping to a mere 4–11% in traditional industries. The primary culprits? Weak leadership commitment, rigid corporate cultures resistant to change, and a significant lack of digital talent. LayerX directly addresses these barriers by offering an intuitive, AI-native platform that reduces the friction of adoption and delivers tangible results, making enterprise back-office automation accessible and effective. Unpacking LayerX’s Powerful AI Automation Solutions LayerX’s success stems from its comprehensive suite of AI-driven platforms, designed to streamline various facets of the enterprise back-office . These offerings are not merely tools but integrated solutions that transform entire workflows: Bakuraku: This flagship platform is a cornerstone of LayerX’s offering. It automates corporate spending workflows, encompassing expense management, invoice processing, and corporate card operations. Bakuraku serves over 15,000 companies, including prominent names like Ippudo, IRIS Ohyama, the Imperial Hotel, and Sekisui Chemical. Its differentiation lies in its AI-driven user experience, continuously upgrading features like “auto-entry and document splitting,” and investing in AI agents and AI-enabled business processing outsourcing (BPO). Bakuraku offers an all-in-one solution covering expense management, invoice processing, corporate cards, workflows, e-ledger compliance, attendance, and receivables. Alterna: Developed in partnership with Mitsui & Co., Alterna is a retail digital securities investment platform. While not directly back-office automation, it showcases LayerX’s broader capabilities in leveraging technology for financial innovation. Ai Workforce: A generative AI solution specifically designed to streamline workflows and harness enterprise data. Ai Workforce counts major clients such as Mitsui & Co. and MUFG Bank, demonstrating its robust capabilities in handling complex enterprise data environments. Yoshinori Fukushima, the founder, shared that the company’s pivot into SaaS with Bakuraku was driven by identifying the significant bottleneck of paper-based invoice processing in Japan. This insight, combined with the platform’s AI-native user experience, quickly gained traction, securing major strategic partnerships, including with MUFG, and paving the way for its latest Series B funding round. The Road Ahead for Japanese Startups: LayerX’s Vision LayerX’s growth trajectory is nothing short of remarkable, setting new benchmarks for Japanese startups . The company’s signature Bakuraku Suite has seen explosive adoption: Customer Growth: Surpassed 10,000 customers in February 2024 and reached 15,000 by April 2025, with an increasing number of enterprise clients. Team Expansion: Headcount surged from approximately 220 employees in October 2023 to around 430 by the end of July 2025. Revenue Milestones: LayerX is on track to reach $68 million (¥10 billion) in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) faster than any other SaaS company in Japan’s history. It expects to surpass the previous domestic record, which took eight years from product launch, in under five years, achieving the coveted T2D3 growth benchmark ahead of schedule. Looking forward, LayerX has ambitious goals, targeting approximately $680 million (¥100 billion) in annual recurring revenue by fiscal year 2030, with roughly half expected to come from its innovative AI agent business. The company also plans to expand its workforce to around 1,000 employees by 2028, solidifying its position as a major player in the tech ecosystem. Despite its rapid growth, LayerX operates in a competitive landscape. Domestically, it competes with established players like Money Forward Cloud Keihi, freee, and Rakuraku Seisan. Globally, its rivals include giants like SAP Concur, Rippling, Brex, Ramp, Spendesk, and Airbase. In the specialized AI automation space for workforce solutions, it faces competition from companies like Harvey. LayerX differentiates itself not just through its AI-driven user experience and comprehensive integrated platform, but also through its exceptional team, which includes more than 12 former CTOs and a Kaggle Grandmaster, ensuring cutting-edge development and execution. Securing the Future: LayerX’s Landmark Series B Funding The $100 million Series B funding round is a testament to LayerX’s strong performance and future potential. This investment allows LayerX to accelerate its product development, expand its market reach, and further invest in its AI capabilities, especially in AI agents and AI-enabled BPO services. The confidence shown by investors like TCV, MUFG Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Innovation Partners, JAFCO Group, Keyrock Capital, Coreline Venture, and JP Investment highlights the strategic importance of LayerX’s mission in addressing critical economic and technological challenges in Japan.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC , insiders think that US and EU-led sanctions may still prove a stumbling block, with domestic regulations also a potential wrinkle. Russian Crypto Mining Giants: IPOs Incoming? RBC quoted Vasily Girya, the CEO of GIS Mining, as stating that while many US-based mining companies have floated on the stock market, Russian miners are “currently choosing other development tools.” However, many Russian firms are casting an eye at the US market, where the share prices of some of the States’ biggest miners have soared over the past few months. Hive Digital (HIVE) share prices on the NASDAQ stock exchange over the past six months. (Source: Google Finance) Girya said that major Russian miners are instead looking to raise funds and grow by developing strategic partnerships and private investments, as well as debt financing. This approach allows miners to maintain flexibility, control business risks, and adapt to external conditions without needing to respond to stock market pressures, he added. However, the GIS Mining chief said that companies are likely to start formulating IPO plans once Moscow develops “more stable rules.” But he added that public listings for Russian miners were now “simply a matter of time and institutional environment.” Xi, Modi, and Putin huddled on the red carpet in Tianjin before the Shanghai Cooperation Organization group photo.

Girya explained that the market remains in the spotlight, and still “definitely needs time to mature.” The CEO said that many miners still need to boost the effectiveness of their corporate governance “in accordance with high international standards.” But other experts suggested that Russian crypto mining companies could be ready to launch initial public offerings (IPOs) as early as the second half of 2026.

(Source: TradingView) 2026 IPO Bids Not Impossible, Says Expert Oleg Ogienko, an independent blockchain, digital finance, and energy expert, told RBC that Russian mining companies “may need about a year, on average,” to prepare their IPO bids. But Ogienko explained that given the fact that Russia remains heavily sanctioned, “the cost of placement is not so attractive.” He opined that firms may instead wait “to catch the ideal window” with their IPO bids. However, Ogienko said that while the market capitalization of the Russian industrial mining market is “several times smaller” that that of the US, its prospects are nonetheless good. Per data published earlier this year, the Russian crypto mining sector is continuing to grow fast . The country’s two biggest firms, BitRiver and Intelion, made a combined $200 million in revenue in FY2024. Russian mining chiefs say that most industrial miners are still focusing their efforts on Bitcoin (BTC) . Smaller numbers are also focusing on altcoins such as Litecoin (LTC) .

This momentous climb has captivated investors and analysts alike, signaling renewed bullish sentiment in the digital asset space. According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC has indeed surpassed this key threshold, with current trading figures on the Binance USDT market showing Bitcoin hovering around $109,027. This impressive movement sparks crucial questions about what’s driving the rally and what it means for the future of the market. What’s Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Surge? Understanding the forces behind any significant market movement is crucial, and this latest Bitcoin price surge is no exception. Several factors appear to be converging, creating a potent environment for BTC’s ascent. These drivers often include a mix of macroeconomic trends, technological developments, and shifting investor sentiment. Institutional Interest: A growing number of institutional players, from large corporations to investment funds, are increasingly allocating capital to Bitcoin. Their involvement adds substantial liquidity and credibility to the market. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties, such as inflation concerns or fluctuating interest rates, sometimes push investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, which is often seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments within the Bitcoin network, including improvements in scalability and security, continue to bolster its long-term appeal. Halving Cycle Effects: While not immediate, the anticipation and post-effects of Bitcoin’s halving events often contribute to long-term price appreciation by reducing the supply of new BTC. These elements collectively paint a picture of a maturing asset class gaining broader acceptance. Navigating the $109,000 Milestone: A Closer Look at the Bitcoin Price Surge Breaking past $109,000 is not just a numerical achievement; it represents a psychological and technical victory for Bitcoin. In market analysis, such levels often act as resistance points, and overcoming them can signal a strong upward momentum. The consistent trading above this level, as observed on platforms like Binance USDT, suggests robust buying pressure and investor confidence. When Bitcoin successfully breaches and sustains above a key resistance level, it often encourages more traders to enter the market, anticipating further gains. This creates a positive feedback loop, where increased demand can further propel the Bitcoin price surge . However, it’s also a point where some investors might take profits, leading to temporary pullbacks. Monitoring these levels provides valuable insight into market sentiment. Implications for Investors: Capitalizing on the Bitcoin Price Surge For both seasoned and new investors, a significant Bitcoin price surge presents both exciting opportunities and potential risks. It’s essential to approach such market movements with a clear strategy and a good understanding of market dynamics. Potential Benefits: Portfolio Growth: Existing Bitcoin holders naturally see an increase in their asset’s value. Market Confidence: A strong rally can instill greater confidence in the overall cryptocurrency market, potentially benefiting other digital assets. Increased Visibility: Higher prices often attract more mainstream attention, bringing new participants into the ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: While Bitcoin is rising, its price can still be highly volatile, meaning quick gains can also turn into quick losses. Market Corrections: After significant rallies, market corrections are common as investors realize profits. Emotional Trading: The excitement of a rally can lead to impulsive decisions, which might not always align with long-term investment goals. Actionable Insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across various assets. Set Clear Goals: Define your entry and exit points and stick to them. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news and analysis to make informed decisions. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. The Road Ahead: Will the Bitcoin Price Surge Continue? Predicting the exact trajectory of any asset, especially one as dynamic as Bitcoin, is always challenging. However, current indicators and market sentiment suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook for the Bitcoin price surge . Analysts are closely watching for sustained trading volumes and continued institutional interest as key indicators. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the long-term narrative for Bitcoin often revolves around its finite supply, increasing utility, and growing global adoption. The ability of BTC to consistently break through previous resistance levels underscores its resilience and the underlying demand. Investors should remain vigilant, understanding that market dynamics can shift rapidly, but the current momentum is certainly noteworthy. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price surge above $109,000 is a significant development, reflecting a confluence of positive market forces. From growing institutional adoption to evolving macroeconomic conditions, several factors are contributing to this impressive rally. While the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, this milestone reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a leading digital asset. Staying informed and employing sound investment strategies are paramount for navigating this exciting landscape.

While established players like Chainlink and VeChain continue to build solid foundations, a new meme token is coming: Layer Brett . This Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin is already drawing attention for its blend of meme culture and real utility, with its presale live at just $0.0053. Analysts are starting to believe it could be one of the next 100x altcoins heading into the crypto bull run of 2025. Layer Brett: Breaking Chains On Layer 2 Unlike the original Brett token stuck on Base, Layer Brett has moved to Ethereum Layer 2, bringing lightning-fast transactions and gas fees slashed to pennies. Ethereum Layer 1 remains secure but often congested, with transaction costs spiking above $10. Layer Brett solves that problem, offering scalability and performance that older meme tokens lacked. This is more than just a speculative meme token. With its ERC-20 design, $LBRETT combines viral appeal with real infrastructure advantages. Compared to Ripple (XRP), which has faced regulatory battles, or projects like Chainlink and VeChain, which grow steadily but at slower rates, Layer Brett has the flexibility to expand quickly in the booming Layer 2 sector, projected to handle trillions annually. The advantage of staking and low-cap potential For early buyers, the big draw isn’t just the low entry price; it’s the staking rewards. By purchasing $LBRETT during the crypto presale, investors can immediately stake tokens via MetaMask or Trust Wallet for high APYs powered by Layer 2 efficiency. In contrast, holding LINK or VET long-term often means waiting on ecosystem adoption for significant returns. Key benefits include: Layer 2 Speed: Transactions processed in seconds with minimal fees. Presale Access: $LBRETT available at $0.0053 for early backers. Staking Rewards: Early adopters can secure massive APYs. Real Utility: Meme energy paired with Ethereum scalability and staking mechanics. With a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens and transparent tokenomics, the project is designed for long-term sustainability. While LINK dominates the oracle niche and VET targets enterprise supply chains, Layer Brett is carving a unique path by merging meme culture with serious DeFi utility. Beyond Ripple (XRP): Why Investors Are Watching While Ripple (XRP) continues its fight for mainstream payments adoption, investors are hungry for fresh opportunities. Many see Layer Brett as a more exciting growth play compared to mature projects. Its roadmap includes NFT integrations, gamified staking, and interoperability features that could rival major Layer 2 platforms like Optimism and Arbitrum. Meanwhile, Chainlink remains essential to DeFi by providing reliable data feeds, and VeChain continues to expand its use cases across logistics, healthcare, and supply chain transparency. Both LINK and VET are respected projects with strong ecosystems. To galvanize its early community, Layer Brett has also launched a $1 million giveaway, boosting engagement and visibility. This strategy reflects its commitment to building a strong, loyal base ahead of its full launch. Conclusion: The 2025 Watchlist Investors eyeing 2025 gains are increasingly considering alternatives to Ripple (XRP). Chainlink (LINK) and VeChain (VET) remain solid, reliable bets with proven ecosystems. But for those chasing exponential returns, Layer Brett stands out. If you’re holding LINK or VET for steady growth, adding $LBRETT to the mix could balance your portfolio with high-upside potential. In a market that rewards innovation and speed, Layer Brett might just outpace Ripple (XRP), Chainlink, and VeChain in the next bull run. At $0.0053, it offers presale access, staking rewards, and scalability advantages that could make it one of the year’s top performers.

51041399,570577,1756771211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51041399.jpeg,Bitcoin Network Bigger Than Ever: Hashrate Sets New Record,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-network-bigger-ever-hashrate-new-record/,"On-chain data shows the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate has just set a new all-time high (ATH), despite the asset’s price still being down. Bitcoin Hashrate Has Shot Up To New Highs Recently The “ Hashrate ” refers to a Bitcoin metric that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that the miners as a whole have connected to the BTC network. Its value is measured in terms of hashes per second (H/s), or the more practical exahashes per second (EH/s). When the indicator observes an increase, it means existing miners are in expansion mode and/or new validators are joining the blockchain. Such a trend implies BTC mining is appearing a profitable venture to this cohort. On the other hand, the metric’s value going down implies some miners are pulling back on their power, likely because mining revenue is no longer justifying the electricity costs. Now, here is a chart from Blockchain.com that shows the trend in the 7-day average value of the Bitcoin Hashrate over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate has witnessed a breakout recently and surged to fresh ATHs. For the last few months before this surge, the metric had been stuck inside a range, only setting records slightly higher than the last with each peak. With this breakout, it seems the network may finally have shoved off this phase of stagnation. On Sunday, the indicator broke past the 1,000 EH/s milestone, taking it into the territory of a new unit: zettahashes per second (ZH/s). This unit involves 21 zeroes. Note that the daily value of the metric breached this mark some time ago, but this is the first time the 7-day average has done so. Interestingly, the latest rise in the Hashrate has come despite the fact that the BTC price has been following a bearish trajectory. Miner revenue is directly correlated to the asset’s value, so these validators often expand or decommission according to the price trend. With the Hashrate going against the price this time, it would appear the Bitcoin miners are making a bold bet that a reversal would occur for the cryptocurrency in the near future. It only remains to be seen whether the conviction will pay off. Something that could slam the brakes in the miner expansion party is the upcoming Difficulty adjustment, which is currently estimated to raise the toughness of the miners’ job by more than 5%, according to CoinWarz . Generally, miners who are already making a low amount of revenue get pushed to their limit when Difficulty increases occur, so the Hashrate tends to observe a pullback around them. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $108,700, down 2% over the past week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin hashrate|bitcoin mining|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 00:00:11

The LTHs refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than 155 days. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Out Of Ascending Triangle: Is $300 The Next Stop? Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they are to sell them in the future. As such, the LTHs with their relatively long holding time are considered to be resolute entities. Despite their conviction, however, there are times when even members of this cohort decide to part with their coins. Below is a chart shared by Glassnode that shows how spending from this cohort has fluctuated over the past year. As is visible in the graph, the 14-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin volume spent by the LTHs has shot up recently, indicating the HODLers are ramping up their transaction activity. The spike in LTH spending has come after a decline in the BTC price. The timing could be a possible sign that some of the diamond hands are starting to think the bull run is winding down, so they have decided to exit with their profits while they still can. Though while Bitcoin LTH transactions are elevated right now, they are still significantly below the levels observed in the last quarter of 2024. Also, the smoothed data of the 14-day SMA may suggest the development corresponds to an increase in spending over a period, but it turns out that it’s largely due to a single large daily spike. From the chart, it’s apparent that this large spike that occurred on Friday involved around 97,000 BTC, worth a whopping $10.6 billion. This is the largest spending day for the LTHs in 2025 so far. Related Reading: Solana Social Media Hype Hits 11-Week High As Price Jumps 16% The LTH group’s 155-day cutoff means that the cohort covers a rather large range, so here’s another chart, this one breaking down how the different segments of the group have contributed to this event: It would appear that the 1 to 2-year-old Bitcoin LTHs provided the largest part of the spending spike at 34,500 BTC. The 6 to 12 months and 3 to 5 years segments are other standouts, each contributing around 16,000 BTC. BTC Price Bitcoin slipped toward $107,000 during the weekend, but it appears the coin has jumped back to start Monday as its price is now trading around $109,500.

At the same time, an early-stage altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is catching attention from investors searching for the next high-growth opportunity. This move highlights how the market narrative is changing from Bitcoin dominance to a broader focus on yield, utility, and scarcity plays. Bitcoin Correction Sparks Rotation Bitcoin recently fell from highs above $124,000 to the $108,000 – $114,000 range. Analysts note that this wasn’t caused by one single event but by a combination of weak macroeconomic data, stock market declines, and whale sell-offs. On-chain data showed one long-time holder unloading over 100,000 BTC, sparking further selling and exposing just how powerful these players remain in driving short-term price action. Ethereum Gains Whale Confidence Ethereum has become the key winner in this shift. With the approval of spot ETFs and greater clarity under the CLARITY Act, ETH has grown far more accessible for institutions. Its staking yields also attract investors seeking passive income, while its robust DeFi and smart contract ecosystem provide clear growth potential. A single whale transaction of $217 million from BTC into ETH emphasized just how much conviction big players now have in Ethereum’s future. The Hidden Gem of 2025 Beyond Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout option for those looking to get in early. Presale rounds have been selling out at record speed, and early buyers have already seen returns surpassing 7,800% . With limited allocations left and growing demand, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a reputation as one of the rare altcoins offering both scarcity and exponential upside potential . Analysts suggest it could mirror the kind of breakout growth only seen in the earliest days of past market leaders. The Road Ahead Bitcoin remains the market anchor, but its role is changing. Whales and institutions are clearly diversifying into assets that offer yields, utility, and room for explosive growth. Ethereum’s strength and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity play show how investor strategies are shifting, signaling that the next phase of the bull run may be defined less by Bitcoin dominance and more by high-growth alternatives.

The numbers show a company losing ground to faster, cheaper, and more aggressive rivals, especially China’s BYD, which is now eating into Tesla’s turf from Scandinavia to southern Europe. In France, new Tesla registrations for August dropped 47.3% compared to August last year. And while Tesla was falling, the rest of the French car market grew 2.2%. Over in Sweden, Tesla’s numbers cratered by 84%, even though Sweden’s broader auto market climbed 6%. In Denmark, Tesla fell 42%, while in the Netherlands, the drop was 50%. Italy was the least painful, but even there, Tesla slipped 4.4%. BYD pushes past Tesla in Spain and Portugal Only three countries offered Tesla any relief. In Portugal, after seven months of losses, registrations grew 28.7% in August. In Spain, government subsidies of up to €7,000 ($8,200) helped Tesla record a 161% spike, going from 549 vehicles to 1,435 in August year-on-year. But the win didn’t last long; BYD sold 1,827 cars in Spain that month, jumping over 400%. It wasn’t close. Zoom out to 2025 so far, and the contrast gets worse. BYD has sold 14,181 vehicles in Spain this year, a 675% increase. Tesla? Just 9,303, a rise of only 11.6%. That’s not even in the same lane. Matthias Schmidt, an auto market analyst at Schmidt Automotive, said the poor numbers aren’t a surprise. “Disappointing Tesla volumes can partially be attributed to a more competitive market environment.” He’s not wrong. Europe is being flooded with new EV models from both legacy brands and aggressive Chinese startups. Tesla hasn’t released a new mass-market car since the Model Y in 2020, and it’s now falling behind. Elon Musk, during an investor call in July, claimed there were “no issues with Tesla volumes on the European market.” That’s despite the fact that Tesla’s market share in Western Europe fell to 1.7% in the first half of 2025, down from 2.5% in 2024. Matthias called Musk’s statement “delusional.” Tesla’s people in Europe had earlier said the slump was temporary, blaming it on production changes for the revamped Model Y, which was Europe’s best-selling car last year. Deliveries started again in June, but August didn’t bring the bounce Tesla was hoping for. Model Y sales were down 46.5% in Denmark and 87% in Sweden. Ginny Buckley, CEO of EV site Electrifying.com, said Tesla’s image is cracking. “Musk’s influence on the brand has become increasingly polarizing.” Over half of the users surveyed by her site said Elon is the reason they won’t buy a Tesla. In Britain, the damage is already done. Marketcheck, which tracks used car sales, reported that used Tesla sales hit a record in July, spiking 270%. But buyers aren’t paying much. The average price of a used Model Y is now 41% lower than it was two years ago. Eight months deep in this mess, Tesla’s troubles in Europe are no longer a dip. They’re a trend. While competitors flood the market with cheaper EVs and governments offer incentives for anyone but Tesla, Elon Musk keeps denying the bleeding. But the numbers aren’t lying. They never do.

Get ready for a significant shift! South Korea is taking a monumental step towards global financial transparency by initiating the process to share crypto transaction data with foreign tax authorities. This move is set to reshape how digital asset investments are tracked and taxed worldwide. What’s Happening with Crypto Transaction Data in South Korea? The South Korean government is actively implementing a plan to exchange crypto transaction data . This means if you are a foreign investor trading on domestic crypto exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb, your transaction information will soon be accessible to tax authorities in your home country. This isn’t a one-way street, however. Starting next year, data on South Korean nationals trading on overseas exchanges will also be shared with South Korea’s National Tax Service. This initiative is part of a broader global effort to prevent offshore tax evasion. According to reports from Kookmin Ilbo and relevant ministries on September 1st, the Ministry of Economy and Finance plans to issue an administrative notice this month. This notice will detail the specific implementation rules for the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). Why is South Korea Prioritizing Crypto Transaction Data Sharing? The primary goal behind this robust data sharing framework is clear: to enhance tax transparency and combat illicit financial activities. The Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) is a collaborative system involving 48 major countries, including economic powerhouses like the UK, Germany, and Japan. CARF enables these nations to automatically exchange crypto transaction data annually. This automatic exchange mechanism is crucial for identifying and deterring individuals who might attempt to evade taxes by hiding their digital assets across borders. It represents a united front against financial opacity in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. By participating in CARF, South Korea is aligning itself with international standards, signaling its commitment to a fair and transparent global financial system. This proactive approach aims to level the playing field for all investors and ensure that digital asset gains are reported accurately. How Does This Impact You, the Global Crypto Investor? For many investors, this development underscores the growing importance of compliance. If you’ve been trading cryptocurrencies, understanding the implications of this new data sharing regime is paramount. It means that the days of anonymous or untraceable international crypto dealings are rapidly drawing to a close. For foreign investors in South Korea: Your trading activities on platforms like Upbit and Bithumb will no longer be solely within South Korea’s purview. For South Korean nationals abroad: Any crypto transactions made on international exchanges will be reported back to the National Tax Service. This shift necessitates a thorough review of your tax obligations. It’s an opportunity to ensure all your past and future crypto transaction data is accurately documented and reported to your respective tax authorities. Proactive compliance can help avoid potential penalties and legal issues down the line. Moreover, it reinforces the need for investors to stay informed about international tax laws. Navigating the New Era of Crypto Transaction Data Reporting This initiative marks a significant step towards a more regulated global crypto environment. While it introduces new compliance requirements, it also fosters greater trust and stability in the digital asset market. Investors can anticipate a future where transparency is the norm, not the exception. What kind of crypto transaction data might be shared? Generally, this includes: Details of the crypto assets held. Transaction types (e.g., purchases, sales, transfers). Value of transactions. Identity information of the account holder. The administrative notice expected this month will provide more granular details, offering clarity on the exact scope and procedures. Staying updated on these specifics will be essential for all involved parties, from individual investors to institutional traders. This framework is designed to create a comprehensive overview of global crypto holdings, making tax evasion significantly harder. In conclusion, South Korea’s move to share crypto transaction data globally represents a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency world. It solidifies the trend towards increased regulation and transparency, emphasizing that digital assets are not immune to traditional financial oversight. This proactive stance, aligned with the CARF, is a clear signal that governments worldwide are serious about ensuring fair taxation and preventing illicit financial flows. Investors are urged to embrace this new era by prioritizing accurate record-keeping and understanding their international tax responsibilities. The future of crypto is transparent, and preparing for it now is key. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Transaction Data Sharing Q1: What is the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF)?

This three-point rise signifies a crucial shift from a state of “fear” into “neutral” territory, according to data from Alternative. This move suggests a palpable improvement in investor sentiment, moving away from widespread apprehension towards a more balanced outlook. For anyone tracking digital assets, understanding this shift in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is paramount. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, Anyway? You might be wondering, what exactly is this index and why does it matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a vital barometer for market sentiment. It measures the prevailing emotional state of cryptocurrency investors on a simple scale: 0 indicates extreme fear, while 100 represents extreme optimism. This tool helps us gauge whether the market is overly fearful, potentially signaling a buying opportunity, or excessively greedy, which could suggest an impending correction. The index’s calculation is quite sophisticated, incorporating several key factors to provide a comprehensive view. These components are weighted to reflect their impact on overall market sentiment: Volatility (25%): How much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates. Trading Volume (25%): The amount of cryptocurrency being bought and sold. Social Media Mentions (15%): The buzz and discussion around crypto on platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Surveys (15%): Direct polls of investor sentiment (currently paused). Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market. Google Search Volume (10%): Public interest in crypto-related topics. Why is a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Significant? The move from “fear” to “neutral” is not just a minor fluctuation; it signals a maturing market sentiment. When the index is in “fear,” investors are often selling due to panic, which can lead to undervalued assets. Conversely, “greed” often means prices are inflated by irrational exuberance. A neutral stance, however, suggests a more rational and balanced market environment. This shift can offer a window of opportunity. It means that extreme emotional reactions are subsiding, and market participants might be making decisions based more on fundamental analysis rather than herd mentality. Therefore, it’s a time for careful observation and strategic planning, as the market isn’t dictated by overwhelming fear or irrational euphoria. This neutral reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can provide a more stable foundation for future price movements. Navigating the Neutral Zone: What Should Investors Consider? With the Crypto Fear & Greed Index now in neutral territory, what steps should investors consider? This period demands a thoughtful approach rather than impulsive actions. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Use this calmer period to review your holdings. Are they aligned with your long-term goals and risk tolerance? Focus on Fundamentals: Look beyond price charts. Research projects with strong technology, clear use cases, and active development teams. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re looking to invest, DCA can be an effective strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market fluctuations, which helps mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Continue monitoring market news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the crypto space. Manage Risk: Even in a neutral market, volatility can return. Only invest what you can afford to lose and diversify your investments. This neutral reading doesn’t mean the market is without risk. However, it does provide a potentially more stable environment for making informed decisions, moving away from the extremes often seen in crypto. Potential Hurdles and the Road Ahead for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index While a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a positive sign, it’s crucial to acknowledge that the crypto market remains inherently dynamic. External factors, such as global economic shifts, regulatory changes, or significant technological breakthroughs, can quickly sway sentiment. Therefore, this neutral phase might be temporary, serving as a pause before the market trends towards either increased fear or heightened greed. Investors should prepare for potential volatility. A neutral reading offers a moment to breathe, but it doesn’t guarantee a smooth ride ahead. Observing how the index reacts to upcoming news and market events will be key to understanding the next phase of investor sentiment. This period allows for strategic positioning, but vigilance remains essential in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. In conclusion, the rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 49 and its subsequent shift into neutral territory marks a significant milestone for the crypto market. It reflects a healthier, more balanced investor sentiment, moving away from the extremes of panic or irrational exuberance. This neutral phase presents a unique opportunity for investors to reassess, plan strategically, and make informed decisions based on fundamentals rather than fleeting emotions. While challenges persist, this shift offers a more stable foundation for navigating the exciting and often unpredictable world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a “neutral” reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean for Bitcoin? A1: A neutral reading suggests that investors are neither overly fearful nor excessively greedy about Bitcoin. This can indicate a period of consolidation or more rational price discovery, potentially offering a more stable environment for its price movements. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A2: The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment based on the latest data points from its various components. Q3: Should I buy or sell when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is neutral? A3: A neutral reading doesn’t inherently dictate a “buy” or “sell” signal. Instead, it encourages investors to make decisions based on their own research, risk tolerance, and long-term strategy, rather than being swayed by extreme market emotions. Q4: What factors could push the Crypto Fear & Greed Index back into “fear” or “greed”? A4: Significant market events such as major price crashes, regulatory crackdowns, geopolitical instability, or, conversely, a sustained bull run, widespread institutional adoption, or positive economic news, could quickly shift the index towards either extreme. Q5: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a perfect predictor of market movements? A5: No, the index is a sentiment indicator, not a definitive predictor. It provides valuable insight into investor psychology but should be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for comprehensive decision-making.

This isn’t just a number; it’s a crucial signal for every investor navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. What does this six-point drop from 54 mean for your portfolio, and are we heading into a Bitcoin-dominated period? What Does the Altcoin Season Index Truly Tell Us? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is essential for making informed decisions in the crypto market. This invaluable indicator, provided by CoinMarketCap, offers a clear snapshot of market sentiment by comparing the performance of major altcoins against Bitcoin. It tracks the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Stablecoins and wrapped coins are intentionally excluded to focus purely on speculative asset performance. The comparison is made against Bitcoin’s performance over the last 90 days. A score closer to 100 indicates a strong altcoin season, where a significant majority of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Conversely, a lower score, especially below 25, typically signals a ‘Bitcoin Season,’ where the market leader is dominating. Why Did the Altcoin Season Index Experience a Dramatic Fall? The recent six-point decline in the Altcoin Season Index , from 54 to 48, points to a clear shift in market dynamics. Several factors often contribute to such movements, reflecting the complex interplay of investor sentiment and market forces. Bitcoin’s Strength: Often, a strong rally in Bitcoin can pull capital away from altcoins, as investors consolidate holdings in the market leader. Profit-Taking: After periods of altcoin outperformance, investors may take profits, converting altcoins back into Bitcoin or stablecoins. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic uncertainties can lead investors to seek perceived safer assets, and in crypto, Bitcoin often plays this role. This drop suggests that fewer than 75% of the top 100 altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days, indicating a potential cooling off for the broader altcoin market. Navigating the Shifting Tides: What Should Investors Do? A falling Altcoin Season Index doesn’t necessarily spell doom for all altcoins, but it does signal a time for strategic re-evaluation. For astute investors, this period can present unique opportunities to adjust portfolios and mitigate risks. Consider these actionable insights: Re-evaluate your portfolio: Assess which altcoins still have strong fundamentals and long-term potential, regardless of short-term market fluctuations. Risk Management: This might be a time to reduce exposure to highly speculative altcoins and increase holdings in more established assets or stablecoins. Research is Key: Dive deeper into projects. Strong technology, active development, and genuine utility can help altcoins weather a Bitcoin-dominant phase. This decline in the Altcoin Season Index could be a moment to pivot your strategy, focusing on resilience and value. Understanding Crypto Market Cycles Beyond the Altcoin Season Index While the Altcoin Season Index is a powerful tool, it’s crucial to remember that it’s just one indicator within a larger, dynamic market. Cryptocurrency markets operate in cycles, and understanding these broader trends can provide a more comprehensive perspective. Market cycles typically involve: Accumulation phases: Smart money buys in. Bull runs: Prices surge, driven by FOMO. Distribution phases: Profits are taken. Bear markets: Prices decline, often with capitulation. The index helps pinpoint specific moments within these cycles, but it doesn’t predict the entire market’s future. It simply reflects the current performance relationship between altcoins and Bitcoin. Strategies for a Bitcoin-Dominant Period When the Altcoin Season Index indicates a shift towards Bitcoin dominance, it doesn’t mean altcoins are dead. Instead, it encourages a different approach to investment. Patience and strategic positioning become paramount. Here are some strategies to consider: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to invest small, regular amounts into promising altcoins to average out your purchase price. Focus on Fundamentals: Prioritize altcoins with strong use cases, solid teams, and robust communities. These projects are more likely to recover and thrive in the long run. Diversification: While altcoins might be struggling, ensure your portfolio is balanced, perhaps with a higher allocation to Bitcoin or Ethereum during such times. This period can be an excellent opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate quality assets at potentially lower prices. Conclusion: A Crucial Indicator for Astute Investors The recent drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 48 is a clear signal that market dynamics are shifting. While it suggests a cooling period for many altcoins relative to Bitcoin, it also underscores the importance of staying informed and adaptable. For savvy investors, understanding these indicators is not about panic, but about making strategic, data-driven decisions. By paying attention to the Altcoin Season Index and broader market trends, you can better position your portfolio to navigate the exciting, yet often volatile, world of cryptocurrencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It helps indicate whether altcoins or Bitcoin are currently dominating the market. 2. How is an altcoin season officially defined by the index? An altcoin season is officially signaled when 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) outperform Bitcoin during the 90-day period. 3. What does a score of 48 on the Altcoin Season Index mean? A score of 48 means that less than 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. It suggests that the market is currently not in an altcoin season, and Bitcoin may be showing stronger performance or altcoins are consolidating. 4. Should I sell all my altcoins if the Altcoin Season Index falls? A falling index doesn’t necessarily mean you should sell all your altcoins. It’s a signal to re-evaluate your portfolio and strategy. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, consider dollar-cost averaging, and manage your risk exposure rather than making impulsive decisions. 5. How often does the Altcoin Season Index change? The Altcoin Season Index is updated daily, reflecting the continuous performance changes of the top altcoins against Bitcoin over the rolling 90-day period. 6. Are there other indicators besides the Altcoin Season Index that investors should monitor? Yes, while the Altcoin Season Index is valuable, investors should also monitor Bitcoin dominance charts, overall market capitalization, trading volumes, and macroeconomic news for a comprehensive understanding of market conditions.

The event, hosted by the National Bitcoin Office, is being celebrated as “a testament to an extraordinary moment in history. The announcement has stirred keen interest around the world, reinforcing El Salvador’s position as a trailblazer in virtual currencies. Following becoming the first nation to implement Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender during 2021, the nation is also using the conference to reinforce its message that Bitcoin can offer financial freedom, cultural resurgence, and monetary independence. Bitcoin Histórico to spotlight financial freedom, culture, and crypto innovation The organizers said that Bitcoin Histórico unites the smartest people in the world discussing the future of money, culture, and civilization,”. Early bird tickets can be purchased in Bitcoin and fiat payment options, opening later this month. The two-day event will transform Centro Histórico into a hub for discussions, workshops, and cultural exchange. The main stage at the National Palace will host keynote addresses and broadcast them to Plaza Gerardo Barrios via giant LED screens. Additional sessions will be held at the National Library (BINAES) and the National Theater. The lineup of speakers has also been confirmed, with the likes of billionaire Ricardo Salinas, author Jeff Booth, Bitcoin proponents Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, Lightning Network developer Jack Mallers, as well as industry figures such as Pierre Rochard, Jimmy Song, Darin Feinstein, and Lina Seiche. The conference takes place at a time of sweeping political change in El Salvador. A recent constitutional amendment extended presidential terms to six years. It lifted the existing prohibition on re-elections, paving the way for President Nayib Bukele, a leading global advocate of Bitcoin, to lead another term. Bukele’s government remains proactive in its stance surrounding Bitcoin, revealing that they also have 6,220 BTC in the ranks. The event is billed as a turning point in Bitcoin adoption, focused on regulation, infrastructure, power consumption, and financial inclusion, and touching on issues including price volatility and public understanding. El Salvador noted that this isn’t just a conference but evidence for our amazing times. It continued to say that it would be a lesson for developing countries in harnessing cryptocurrency to build an economy. General admission tickets are $350, and Genesis Crown Pass tickets (VIP seating, private networking with keynote speakers, and exclusive swag) are $2,100. BTC market recovery coincides with El Salvador’s bold crypto move The El Salvador Bitcoin conference news comes as BTC begins the week in recovery mode , trading above $109 175 on Tuesday at the time of this writing. This follows a nearly 6% decline in the previous week. The institutional demand helps the leading currency absorb downward pressure as Metaplanet takes 1,009 BTC on Monday, as reported by Cryptopolitan . The Japanese Bitcoin company’s recent purchase increased its total holdings to 20,000 BTC, acquired at an average price of ¥15.1 million per coin. This brings the firm’s total Bitcoin assets to approximately ¥302.3 billion (over $2 billion). Metaplanet’s ongoing acquisition strategy aligns with its goal to expand its Bitcoin reserves to 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027. US spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) also recorded $440 million weekly inflows. Despite persistent caution across markets, traders continue to bet on the US Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cut this month, supporting risk assets such as BTC. BTC has retreated nearly 14% from its all-time high of $124,474 on August 14 to a low of $107,350 on Saturday, largely driven by July’s hotter-than-expected US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index report. Nevertheless, traders are ramping up expectations for a Fed rate cut this month. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of a 25 basis points (bps) reduction at September’s meeting now stands at 87.6%, up from 85% before the PCE data release. Anticipating a rate cut may weigh on the US dollar and boost risk-on sentiment, supporting a rebound in riskier assets such as BTC.

Yet beneath the excitement, history has shown that not all rallies are smooth sailing. Each bull run teaches lessons that remain just as relevant today as they were decades ago. In the crypto space, for example, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been highlighted by analysts as one of the best performing early-stage opportunities in recent years, standing out during a time when investors are searching for the next major winner. Volatility Is Normal and Should Be Expected Markets rarely move in a straight line. Even the strongest bull runs come with sharp dips and corrections along the way. These pullbacks, often 10% or more, are not a sign of weakness but rather a healthy reset that allows for more sustainable growth. Looking back, the 1980s bull market included multiple setbacks, but the S&P 500 still averaged over 17% annual returns. The key takeaway is that trying to time these short-term moves is risky. Staying invested and maintaining a diversified portfolio has historically outperformed panic-driven trading. Don’t Get Swept Up by the Hype When prices surge, enthusiasm can overshadow logic. The late 1990s dot-com bubble remains a prime example of what happens when investors chase hype without fundamentals. Many internet companies had little revenue yet attracted massive capital before collapsing. A similar dynamic can unfold in crypto, where speculative tokens can skyrocket before vanishing just as fast. A disciplined approach – focusing on fundamentals, project utility, and long-term sustainability – remains essential for avoiding costly mistakes. A Standout Performance Like no Other While hype has burned many investors, projects that combine strong community backing with real development often emerge as rare winners. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been flagged by market analysts for delivering exceptional early-stage results . In fact, returns have already been astronomical for first movers , which places it among the most remarkable performers in recent memory. With demand growing and limited early allocations, the project is gaining momentum as a potential altcoin leader for the next bull cycle. For investors who understand the lessons of past markets, this kind of opportunity highlights the importance of strategic entry before mass adoption. Take Profits and Rebalance When Needed A bull market is also the perfect time to reassess and rebalance. As certain assets grow faster than others, portfolios can become unbalanced. For instance, a 60/40 split between stocks and bonds could easily tilt to 75% stocks after a powerful rally, increasing risk. Rebalancing means trimming positions in top performers and redistributing capital into lagging assets, locking in gains while maintaining your original strategy. This approach isn’t about calling the top – it’s about preserving wealth and preparing for the future. Final Thoughts Every bull cycle offers valuable lessons. Volatility is part of the journey, hype can be dangerous, and disciplined profit-taking ensures long-term success. At the same time, new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE remind investors why positioning early in innovative projects can be game-changing. By applying the hard-earned lessons of past markets, investors can better navigate the next wave of growth while keeping risks under control.

Tesla Loses Ground, Bitmine Gains Momentum On Monday, Bloomberg reported that Tesla stock has lost ground among South Korea’s retail investors, who ramped up their selling during August in favor of crypto-related equities. According to the report, the electric carmaker company has seen a $1.8 billion exodus over the past four months, suggesting weakening enthusiasm among one of Tesla’s most loyal global retail investor bases. A 33-year-old retail trader told the news media outlet that the company has been unable “to win people’s hearts” as it has “failed to lead with its own AI narrative.” The investor, who first bought the stock in 2019, sold out earlier this year to focus on equities that currently have more upside. Bloomberg calculations of depository data revealed that while the company remains the top foreign stock among South Korean retail traders , individual investors sold approximately $657 million of Tesla stock in August, recording the company’s largest outflows since 2019. In contrast, retail traders in South Korea favored more volatile bets in August, like crypto-related stocks. During this period, investors poured $253 million into Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc., which is seen as a proxy for Ethereum (ETH). As reported by Bitcoinist, South Korean investors purchased $259 million worth of Bitmine stock in July, Bloomberg previously highlighted. According to Korea Securities Depository data, this made the company the most purchased foreign security stock. Korean Investors Pour Millions Into Crypto Stocks Data from the Korean Center for International Finance (KCIF) showed that the percentage of crypto-linked equities in the top 50 net-bought stocks by local retail investors increased from 8.5% in January to 36.5% in June before dropping to 31.4% in July. Citing a report from 10x Research, The Korea Times highlighted that individuals have purchased over $12 billion worth of crypto-related stock in 2025, with Bitmine, Circle Internet Group, and Coinbase leading the sector. Retail investors’ buying spree reportedly intensified last month, as traders poured $426 million into Bitmine, $226 million into Circle , and $183 million into Coinbase. This marks a shift from the leading trend over the past few years, when Korean retail investors poured into US tech giants. “Korean investors are pouring billions into crypto stocks, reshaping global flows in ways Wall Street can no longer ignore,” the report affirms. Adding that “the push has been amplified by U.S. and Korean stablecoin legislation, creating a powerful backdrop for this surge in capital.” Amid the global push for digital assets regulation , the institutionalization of won-pegged stablecoins gained significant attention, with President Lee Jae-myung vowing to address it alongside the status of crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during his electoral campaign. Since then, multiple bills related to the issuance and distribution of KRW-pegged stablecoins have been introduced in South Korea’s National Assembly. Nonetheless, the industry has expressed concerns about the disconnect between the industry and South Korean regulators. On September 1, the nominee for Financial Services Commission (FSC) Chairman Lee Won-eun stated that digital assets “differ from traditional financial products like deposits and securities in that they lack intrinsic value.” In his written response to the National Assembly’s Political Affairs Committee, Lee also expressed a negative stance on specific policies related to cryptocurrencies, including whether to allow investment in virtual assets through pension and retirement accounts. This raised concerns among multiple industry players that a one-sided regulatory policy may continue.",Crypto News|BitMine|Circle|coinbase|crypto investors|Crypto Market|crypto regulation|Crypto stocks|ETH|Ethereum|ETHUSDT|south korea retail investors|South korea stablecoins|Stablecoin Legislation|Tesla,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|ETH|ASIA|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 01:00:31

However, two key on-chain factors indicate that the BTC market structure is largely resilient. Bitcoin Remains Strong Despite Volatility According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor XWIN Research Japan, two important on-chain indicators suggest that despite the recent slump in price, the overall market structure remains strong for the flagship cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment On Binance Turns Bullish – But Is The Market Setting A Trap? The first is Bitcoin’s Delta Cap – a long-term valuation model derived from the difference between Realized Cap and Average Cap – that has historically acted as a reliable floor during major cycles. In early August, BTC traded above this steadily rising line, suggesting that the market is building a stronger foundation compared to previous drawdowns. A rising Delta Cap also signals capital inflows and long-term investor conviction, even during price corrections. The CryptoQuant analyst shared the following chart showing Delta Cap hovering around $739.4 billion. Although BTC is currently trading below this line, a quick move to $120,000 would likely push the price back above it. The second on-chain factor pointing toward resilience in BTC market structure is the Coinbase Premium Gap, which currently stands at +11.6. The high positive value of the metric suggests stronger demand from US institutions, who are accumulating BTC at a premium. For the uninitiated, the Coinbase Premium Gap measures the price difference of Bitcoin between US exchange Coinbase and global exchanges like Binance. A positive gap means Bitcoin trades at a higher price on Coinbase, often signaling stronger US institutional buying demand. Historically, sustained periods of positive premium have preceded major bullish phases, as institutional accumulation drives price discovery. The analyst concluded: Together, these two metrics point toward a constructive setup: Bitcoin consolidating above $100K with strong institutional support and a long-term valuation floor steadily rising. Corrections, rather than being a sign of weakness, appear to be opportunities for accumulation within a robust structural uptrend. Is BTC Out Of The Woods? Although the two aforementioned on-chain indicators point toward strength in BTC market structure, not all analysts are as optimistic. For instance, a fall below $105,000 might send BTC all the way down to $90,000. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Is Heading To $256K — Here’s When Another analyst recently warned that if BTC loses the support at $108,600 level, then it could fall further to $104,000. A failure to bounce from $104,000 could see BTC test the psychologically important $100,000 level. That said, Bitcoin’s rapidly rising illiquid supply on Binance may play a pivotal role in sending it to a fresh all-time high (ATH). At press time, BTC trades at $109,289, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Digital Asset Treasury (DATs) companies – firms that put bitcoin on the balance sheet – were the talk of the town during BTC Asia in Hong Kong. But corporate adoption of Bitcoin can be a double-edged sword, says Alessio Quaglini, CEO and Co-Founder of crypto custodian Hex Trust. While treasury holdings put crypto on the balance sheets of public companies, he warns that leveraged strategies could turn adoption into a source of instability. “It’s great for the adoption. It’s great because you have basically indirect bitcoin access to billions of people investing in local stock exchanges and Nasdaq,” Quaglini told CoinDesk during a recent interview on the sidelines of BTC Asia in Hong Kong. But he drew a sharp line between healthy diversification and financial engineering. “If this listing company exists for the sole purpose of holding crypto, well then, it’s a hedge fund that is publicly traded. It’s a financial engineering kind of exercise,” he continued. Quaglini, like many others in the industry, is concerned about excessive levels of leverage. A recent report from Galaxy illustrates the risk, showing loan volumes at their highest since 2022 alongside a $1 billion liquidation wave, while Korean regulators have already stepped in to freeze new lending products as they grow concerned about leverage straining markets. “If these companies deploy leverage, and they issue debt to buy Bitcoin with strong triggers, then it’s a big issue,” Quaglini said. In public markets, debt covenants are transparent, meaning traders can anticipate forced selling. “You might be in the situation of the prisoner dilemma… You can have this kind of spiral effect that brings more volatility to the industry.” Even so, Quaglini sees today’s treasury players as a first step. “The next step is that you have real companies that do have a lot of operating cash flow, and they’re sitting on huge amounts of cash, like Apple, Google, etc.,” he said. If those firms start allocating reserves into BTC, the shift would be “extremely positive.” In the end, the real test of the viability of DATs isn’t whether small firms turn themselves into bitcoin proxies, but whether the world’s largest corporates are willing to put their cash piles on-chain. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin is in the green changing hands above $109K. The world's largest digital asset is stabilizing after August saw a rare rotation out of BTC spot ETFs into ETH funds, which has weighed on relative BTC demand in recent weeks. Broader macro remains supportive but price action is still consolidating beneath mid‑August highs ETH: Ether is trading at $4,298. Market participants are easing on profit‑taking after notching record levels late last month and bumping into resistance near the high‑$4,000s. The August ETF flow trend favored ETH, but near‑term consolidation dominates after the run‑up Gold: Gold is holding near a four‑month high on mounting bets for a September Fed rate cut and a softer U.S. dollar, both of which typically support bullion Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose as investors weighed tariff uncertainty and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.31% after a U.S. court ruled most of Trump’s global tariffs illegal.

Are you an investor exploring the exciting world of digital assets? Then you need to pay close attention to a significant warning from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). This powerful EU regulator has raised a red flag concerning tokenized stocks , indicating that many of these digital assets sold in Europe might not grant investors the fundamental shareholder rights they expect. It’s a crucial development for anyone involved in the crypto market. What Exactly Are Tokenized Stocks, Really? Before diving into the risks, let’s clarify what we mean by tokenized stocks . Simply put, they are digital representations of traditional shares, typically issued on a blockchain. These tokens aim to offer investors exposure to the price movements of company stocks without directly owning the underlying shares themselves. Many cryptocurrency exchanges now offer these products, promising easier access to global markets. However, it’s vital to understand that a tokenized version of a stock is often not the same as owning the actual stock. This distinction forms the core of ESMA’s concern. The Alarming Truth: Missing Shareholder Rights in Tokenized Stocks ESMA Executive Director Natasha Cazenave delivered a stark message: many tokenized stocks currently available in the EU do not provide investors with actual shareholder rights. This includes critical entitlements such as voting rights in company decisions and the receipt of dividends. Imagine investing in a company without any say in its future or a share in its profits. That’s the potential reality for many holding these digital assets. What’s more, this lack of clarity is often not transparently disclosed to investors, leading to potential misunderstandings and significant disappointment. Why is Disclosure So Critical for Tokenized Stock Investors? Transparency is the bedrock of fair financial markets. Without clear disclosure, investors might mistakenly believe their tokenized stocks come with the same protections and privileges as traditional shares. This can lead to ill-informed decisions and leave investors vulnerable, especially if market conditions change or if the underlying company faces issues. The absence of explicit information about these missing rights creates a dangerous information asymmetry between issuers and investors, undermining trust in the burgeoning digital asset space. Real-World Concerns: Exchanges Offering Tokenized Stocks The warning from ESMA is particularly timely because major cryptocurrency exchanges have already started offering tokenized stocks in Europe. Platforms like Robinhood and Kraken are among those providing these products, making them accessible to a broad base of investors. The rapid expansion of these offerings highlights the urgent need for regulatory clarity. As more investors engage with these new financial instruments, the potential for widespread misunderstanding regarding shareholder rights only grows. This makes ESMA’s intervention even more significant. The Global Call for Enhanced Oversight of Tokenized Stocks ESMA is not alone in its concerns. The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), a global trade association for exchanges and clearing houses, has echoed these sentiments. The WFE has called for enhanced regulatory oversight, emphasizing the need for robust frameworks that protect investors and maintain market integrity for tokenized stocks . This widespread agreement among financial bodies underscores a global recognition of the unique challenges and risks posed by novel digital assets. Regulators worldwide are grappling with how to integrate blockchain-based financial products into existing legal structures while safeguarding consumers. What Can Investors Do to Protect Their Tokenized Stock Investments? As the regulatory landscape evolves, it’s paramount for investors to be proactive: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Always research the specific terms and conditions of any tokenized stocks you consider. Read the Fine Print: Pay close attention to disclosures about shareholder rights, voting mechanisms, and dividend policies. Understand the Underlying Asset: Differentiate between owning a tokenized representation and owning the actual company share. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and warnings from authorities like ESMA. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with financial advisors who understand digital assets if you have any doubts. A Critical Moment for Digital Asset Investors The warning from ESMA serves as a critical reminder that innovation in finance often comes with new risks. While tokenized stocks offer exciting possibilities, investors must be acutely aware of what they are truly buying. The absence of fundamental shareholder rights, combined with potentially unclear disclosures, presents a significant challenge. As regulators push for greater transparency and oversight, the onus remains on investors to educate themselves and approach these novel products with caution. Your vigilance is your best defense in this evolving digital frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are tokenized stocks? Tokenized stocks are digital representations of traditional company shares, often issued and traded on a blockchain. They aim to provide price exposure to a company’s stock without direct ownership of the underlying share. What shareholder rights might I be missing with tokenized stocks? According to ESMA, many tokenized stocks may not grant investors crucial rights such as voting in company decisions or receiving dividends, which are standard for traditional stock ownership. Which regulators are concerned about tokenized stocks? The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) have both expressed concerns and called for enhanced regulatory oversight regarding tokenized stocks. How can I protect myself when investing in tokenized stocks? Always perform thorough due diligence, carefully read all terms and conditions, understand the specific rights (or lack thereof) associated with the token, stay informed about regulatory warnings, and consider seeking professional financial advice. Will tokenized stocks ever grant full shareholder rights? This depends on future regulatory frameworks and the specific design of tokenized products.

The coin has been testing this threshold after trading near $0.787. Market watchers suggest that a rally toward $0.856 is possible if bulls defend this support. However, any slip below could send ADA sliding toward $0.713. As this possible rally gathers momentum, there is another token that is gradually establishing itself as the next crypto to go wild and this is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Investors are closely tracking both assets, but the case for Mutuum Finance is growing even stronger as its presale surges ahead. Cardano Testing Key Fibonacci Support Cardano’s price action has been orbiting a make-or-break point. The Fibonacci retracement of 38.2% at $0.786 is also aligning with the Elliott Wave theory, and therefore the level at 0.756 is decisive. In case of the support, ADA will target a series of upside levels at $0.808, $0.820, $0.841 and lastly, at $0.856. All levels will contribute to incremental gains that might trigger bullishness across crypto charts once again. On the other hand, a breakdown under $0.756 would be disruptive. Traders have been eyeing $0.713 and $0.700 as the next downside targets. Such a move would weaken Cardano’s bullish setup and reinforce questions like why is crypto down today. Consequently, investors are weighing whether ADA is the best crypto to buy now or if newer tokens with accelerating presale demand could deliver stronger returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing through Phase 6 of its presale, selling at $0.035 per token. Since its first phase began at $0.01, the token price has jumped 250%, rewarding early participants with 3.5x paper gains. So far, $15,220,000 has been raised, and 15,880 holders have joined the project. Phase 6 is already selling out quickly, and after it is closed, Phase 7 will open at 0.04, which is a 14.3 percent price rise. At launch, MUTM is confirmed to list at $0.06, delivering between 300% and 500% in returns for current buyers. In addition, the project has finalized its CertiK audit with a 95.00 security score, showing no vulnerabilities and no incidents in the past 90 days. Consequently, investor trust has been growing at a remarkable pace. Expanding Ecosystem And Community Growth Beyond the lending structure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is introducing an overcollateralized stablecoin system. The mechanism ensures stability by issuing tokens only when loans are active and burning them upon repayment. This design promotes sustainable crypto investing while reinforcing demand during periods of market uncertainty. Furthermore, a leaderboard dashboard has been launched to reward the top 50 token holders with bonuses, encouraging long-term holding behavior. To expand community engagement, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced its biggest giveaway yet. A total of $100,000 in MUTM tokens will be shared among 10 winners, each receiving $10,000. Moreover, a bug bounty has been introduced, in collaboration with CertiK, which offers up to $50,000 USDT in case of vulnerability detection in four levels of severity. Why Mutuum Finance Could Be The Next Crypto To Explode While ADA’s future depends on defending $0.756, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already showing sustained traction through its presale. Actually, the present-day crypto prices indicate the disparity between old tokens that are finding it difficult to stay at support levels and new crypto coins that are absorbing the capital inflows. As the project approaches listing, momentum suggests that this may be the next big cryptocurrency that transforms early investment into long-term value.

Their recent announcement to dramatically increase their Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings has captured global attention, signaling a bold new chapter in digital asset integration. This isn’t just another purchase; it’s a strategic move that could redefine corporate treasury management for years to come. Metaplanet Bitcoin: A Strategic Leap Towards Digital Assets In a significant development, shareholders of Metaplanet have given their approval for an ambitious plan. The company aims to acquire a staggering 210,000 BTC by 2027. This decision, as reported by Cryptoslate, underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations to embrace Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. It’s a clear indicator of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. The acquisition strategy is robust, with Metaplanet planning to raise up to 555 billion yen, equivalent to approximately $3.58 billion, through an issuance of preferred shares. This funding mechanism provides a clear path for the company to achieve its ambitious target. The pivotal shareholders’ meeting on September 1 saw notable attendance, including Eric Trump, the second son of former U.S. President Donald Trump. His presence at such a crucial corporate decision highlights the increasing mainstream interest and potential influence of high-profile figures in the crypto space. Metaplanet is no stranger to the Bitcoin arena. They had previously announced the purchase of an additional 1,009 BTC, bringing their total holdings at that time to 20,000 BTC. This latest approval significantly scales up their commitment, positioning them as a major institutional player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Why Are Companies Like Metaplanet Embracing Bitcoin? The decision by Metaplanet to significantly invest in Metaplanet Bitcoin is part of a broader trend. Companies are increasingly looking for alternative assets to protect their capital from inflationary pressures and economic uncertainties. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ offers a decentralized and finite supply, making it an attractive store of value. For many corporate treasuries, traditional assets like cash or short-term bonds offer diminishing returns in today’s economic climate. Bitcoin presents an opportunity for potential appreciation and diversification away from conventional financial instruments. This strategic pivot can provide long-term growth potential for shareholders. Moreover, adopting Bitcoin can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and innovation. It aligns with the growing digital economy and can attract investors who are keen on exposure to the cryptocurrency market. This proactive stance can enhance a company’s market perception and appeal. The Road Ahead: Funding and the Future of Metaplanet Bitcoin Holdings Securing 210,000 BTC by 2027 is a substantial undertaking. Metaplanet’s plan to fund this through preferred shares is a strategic choice. Preferred shares typically offer fixed dividends and priority in receiving payments over common stock, making them an appealing option for investors seeking stability while supporting the company’s growth initiatives. This structured funding approach minimizes immediate impact on the company’s common stock valuation while providing the necessary capital for the acquisition. It reflects a carefully considered financial strategy designed to integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheet responsibly. As Metaplanet systematically acquires its target 210,000 Metaplanet Bitcoin , the crypto community will be closely watching. This long-term acquisition strategy suggests a belief in sustained Bitcoin value growth and its increasing role in global finance. It also sets a precedent for other publicly traded companies considering similar moves. What Does This Bold Move Mean for the Crypto Market? Metaplanet’s ambitious acquisition plan carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Such substantial institutional interest from a Japanese company could inspire other corporations, particularly in Asia, to explore Bitcoin as a treasury asset. This ripple effect could further accelerate global institutional adoption. The consistent demand created by entities like Metaplanet adds a layer of stability to Bitcoin’s market. While volatility remains a characteristic of cryptocurrencies, large-scale, long-term holdings by public companies can contribute to a more mature and resilient market structure. This signals growing confidence from traditional finance. However, challenges remain. Regulatory landscapes for cryptocurrencies are constantly evolving, and market volatility can still impact asset values. Despite these factors, Metaplanet’s commitment highlights a calculated risk-reward assessment, betting on Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition. Metaplanet’s audacious plan to acquire 210,000 Metaplanet Bitcoin by 2027 is a landmark decision. It underscores a growing conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a vital asset for corporate treasuries. This move not only solidifies Metaplanet’s position as a leader in digital asset adoption but also sends a powerful message to the global financial community: Bitcoin is here to stay, and its integration into mainstream corporate strategy is rapidly accelerating. The journey of Metaplanet will undoubtedly serve as a case study for future corporate Bitcoin endeavors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Metaplanet? Metaplanet is a publicly listed Japanese company that has strategically integrated Bitcoin into its corporate treasury. How much Bitcoin does Metaplanet plan to acquire? Metaplanet shareholders have approved a plan to purchase an impressive 210,000 BTC by 2027. How will Metaplanet fund this large Bitcoin acquisition? The company plans to raise up to 555 billion yen (approximately $3.58 billion) through an issuance of preferred shares to fund the acquisition.

51045800,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81312,1756778150,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Last Leg: Analyst Predicts When XRP Could Reach $27 Using Regression Model and Fib,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-last-leg-analyst-predicts-when-xrp-could-reach-27-using-regression-model-and-fib/,"Crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto has presented a new outlook suggesting that XRP may still have significant upside potential in the current market cycle. Despite recent declines, his assessment suggests a potential rally toward $27 , supported by both Fibonacci extensions and a long-term regression model. XRP has experienced sharp swings in recent months. The asset reached a peak of $3.66 in July 2025, driven by the broader cryptocurrency market rally, but later fell below $3 as part of a general market correction. While some investors have interpreted this downturn as the completion of the cycle, EGRAG Crypto argues that historical patterns and technical models say that XRP has reached its final high. The “Blue X” Indicator and Previous Cycles A central part of EGRAG’s analysis involves the “Blue X” signal generated by the Lux Algo indicator on XRP’s weekly chart. Historically, this marker has appeared before a major correction but not at the actual cycle peak. For example, in May 2017, XRP printed the Blue X at $0.39, after which it corrected before rallying to $3.30 in January 2018. Similarly, in November 2020, the signal appeared at $0.79, but the asset later advanced to $1.96 by April 2021. In both cases, the Blue X was followed by a retracement and then a move to a higher top that occurred without the indicator appearing again. Based on this pattern, EGRAG believes the current Blue X, recorded when XRP reached $3.40 in January 2025, may once again mark a local high rather than the cycle’s ultimate peak. #XRP – The Blue 'X' and The Last Leg: Today, I stumbled upon something interesting with the Lux Algo feature that could be quite indicative for our journey. Let Me Explain! Back to Technical Analysis: The BLUE 'X' typically signals a profit-taking opportunity. However,… pic.twitter.com/VguFMT7xMB — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 31, 2025 Regression Channel Analysis Another key component of the projection comes from a long-term linear regression channel covering XRP’s price history since 2013. This model consists of a red median line and two blue bands positioned two standard deviations above and below the median. In both previous cycles, XRP advanced from the median line to the upper boundary before undergoing a substantial correction. Presently, XRP is trading above the median line but well below the upper boundary. According to the model, the next test of the upper band could occur near $27 by October 13, 2025, which EGRAG identifies as the probable cycle top. Fibonacci Targets The regression channel projection aligns with Fibonacci extension levels derived from past cycles. In 2017, XRP’s peak corresponded to the 1.618–1.88 Fibonacci zone, while in 2021 the top occurred within the 2.414–2.618 range. Current calculations place the 2025 cycle target between $20.46 and $49.44, with the $27 projection falling squarely inside this corridor. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From its current price of around $2.75 , XRP would need to appreciate nearly 900% to achieve the $27 level . While EGRAG’s analysis suggests the possibility of such a move, he emphasizes the importance of risk management and encourages traders to secure profits at various stages of the rally. Although uncertainty remains, the combination of regression channel patterns, Fibonacci levels, and historical behaviour of the Blue X indicator supports the view that XRP may still have one final upward leg before this market cycle concludes.

As Bitcoin opened the month officially dropping below critical support levels, the market’s reaction remains tepid, suggesting that many investors have yet to fully grasp the severity of the situation. BTC’s Last Line Of Defense In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), market analyst Doctor Profit highlighted key price levels associated with various holder groups: $115,600 for 1 million holders, $113,600 for 3 million holders, and approximately $107,000 for 6 million holders. Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Stays Strong As Exchange Reserves Keep Falling – Details As Bitcoin traded below all these thresholds earlier on Monday, Doctor Profit pointed out that every recent buyer is currently facing unrealized losses. However, he cautioned against interpreting this lack of panic as a sign of stability. According to him, “these investors haven’t tasted enough fear yet,” suggesting that market makers may continue to drive prices lower until a genuine capitulation occurs. The analyst emphasized that the $107,000 to $108,900 zone represents the last robust line of defense for Bitcoin. Should this level fail to hold, he predicts a swift movement toward the $90,000 to $95,000 range. Currently, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has recovered above $109,000. It is trading above the last line of support, preventing the analyst’s scenario of an additional 17% price drop for Bitcoin toward its Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap placed just above $90,000. Tough September Ahead For Bitcoin Doctor Profit also argued in his analysis that the current market sentiment is characterized by minimal fear and an unrealized loss of only 0.5%, especially when compared to the more significant corrections of 30% or more seen in historical bear markets. He believes that the lack of panic among the cryptocurrency’s holders indicates that many are still too comfortable, which could set the stage for a more severe market correction. Related Reading: XRP Price Action Turns Bearish, Analyst Says Crash Below $1 Is Coming Further complicating matters, Doctor Profit noted the recent behavior of corporate insiders in the stock market, where over 200 alleged insider trades occurred, with not a single buy recorded. If insiders are choosing to offload their stocks during a period of apparent strength, the analyst asserts that this activity could foreshadow similar selling pressure in the Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency market. As market makers seek to capitalize on this development, Doctor Profit warns that these entities will likely apply pressure until a substantial portion of short-term traders are forced to sell at a loss. Doctor Profit concludes by suggesting that the real pain for Bitcoin holders is still to come, predicting that September will be particularly unkind as the market shifts from denial to a more painful reality.

By offering a regulated product, ETFs bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, making Bitcoin more accessible than ever. With ETFs driving demand, Bitcoin has become more deeply embedded in institutional portfolios. Analysts suggest this could reduce extreme volatility while strengthening long-term growth potential. Early inflows into these funds highlight how much appetite there is for crypto exposure when regulation makes access simple. The Bigger Picture for Crypto Markets The success of Bitcoin ETFs also sets the stage for a ripple effect across the industry. Just as ETF approval legitimized Bitcoin in the eyes of traditional investors, future ETF approvals for other digital assets could bring the same credibility and capital inflows to Ethereum, Solana, or even newer altcoins. This expansion will likely make crypto markets more liquid, more stable, and increasingly mainstream. For long-term investors, this is a signal that the asset class is entering a new, more mature phase. Whales Look Beyond Bitcoin Large investors, often referred to as whales, are not just holding Bitcoin anymore. Many are branching out into alternative assets they believe could outperform during the bull cycle. This diversification signals confidence that the broader crypto market is maturing and offering opportunities beyond BTC alone. Bitcoin Whales are looking into MAGACOIN FINANCE after top market analysts predict 50x returns if current momentum doesn’t break , spotlighting it as a rare early-stage project with the potential to rival legendary early gains seen in past cycles. The rush of whale attention highlights the growing perception that MAGACOIN FINANCE could become a breakout story of 2025. Key Takeaways for Investors Bitcoin ETFs lower barriers and encourage institutional inflows. Increased ETF adoption could reduce volatility in BTC. Whales are expanding beyond Bitcoin into high-potential altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching early whale attention with forecasts of 50x returns . Future ETF approvals could bring similar exposure to other major cryptos. The mainstreaming of crypto is accelerating faster than ever before. Conclusion Bitcoin ETFs have transformed how investors enter the crypto market, merging regulation with accessibility. This shift is not just boosting Bitcoin’s reputation but also clearing a path for altcoins to benefit from increased legitimacy. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured whale interest, with analysts flagging its potential for exponential growth. For investors, this makes the combination of ETFs stabilizing Bitcoin and breakout opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE an important theme to watch in the months ahead.

To recall, Strategy is the world’s leading Bitcoin treasury firm, holding more than three percent of BTC’s total supply. Strategy’s Inclusion In S&P 500 Bullish For Bitcoin In an X post published earlier today, seasoned crypto analyst Lark Davis predicted that Strategy could join the S&P 500 Index as early as this Friday. The firm’s addition to the benchmark index could unlock billions in inflows for both Strategy and Bitcoin. According to CoinGecko data, Strategy currently holds 632,457 BTC on its balance sheet, valued at roughly $69 billion at current prices. The company’s total acquisition cost stands slightly above $46.5 billion. For the uninitiated, the S&P 500 Index is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the US, representing about 80% of total US market value. It is widely considered a benchmark for the overall health of the US economy and stock market. To qualify for inclusion, companies must meet several requirements, including being US-based, having at least 12 months of trading history on a major US exchange, a market cap exceeding $22.7 billion, and at least 50% of shares publicly held. Noted Wall Street analyst, Josh Man took to X, saying Strategy is already a part of the S&P 500 Index. He added that all that remains is an official announcement. Strategy Reports Impressive Q2 2025 Results Strategy delivered stellar Q2 2025 results despite a shaky macroeconomic backdrop. The company reported $14 billion in operating income, $10 billion in net income, and $114.5 million in total revenue during the quarter. One of the key drivers was the company’s adoption of new fair-value accounting standards in January 2025. These accounting standards allow the company to recognize unrealized gains on its BTC holdings, boosting profitability as Bitcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,128 on August 14. That said, Strategy’s stock MSTR has been in a bit of a downturn of late. The stock is down more than 15% over the past month – trading at $334.75 in the after hours of August 29. If Strategy is added to the S&P 500 Index, it would join Coinbase and Jack Dorsey’s Block as only the third major crypto-related firm in the coveted benchmark.

With over $389 million raised in its presale, 25.5 billion coins sold, and a current price of $0.03 in batch 30, BlockDAG isn’t slowing down. Its return on investment from batch 1 has already hit 2,900%, making it one of the top-performing presales of 2025. But it’s not just the numbers doing the talking, it’s the action happening behind the scenes. The Buyer Battles feature has become a major force driving both participation and FOMO. Each day, 50 million BDAG are allocated for purchase. If any remain unsold by the end of the day, they go directly to the largest buyer, free. This has turned BlockDAG into a battleground for whales, with recent purchases reaching seven figures. When major investors start competing for daily bonuses, it sends a signal: this isn’t just a presale, it’s a full-on race. BlockDAG’s value also comes from its tech stack. It combines Proof-of-Work security with a DAG-based consensus to deliver 2,000 to 15,000 transactions per second, competing with Solana and Avalanche. Its hybrid mining system (physical miners and mobile app) has attracted over 3 million users already through the X1 app, and its upcoming listings across 20 exchanges, including MEXC and BitMart, guarantee strong liquidity from day one. From gamified buying to real adoption tools, BlockDAG is the best crypto to buy right now for anyone looking to join momentum early, and ride the wave before launch. Polkadot (POL): Scaling Up with Cross-Chain Fundraising Polkadot is making a comeback in 2025, riding the renewed interest in multi-chain token launches and decentralized fundraising. Trading at $0.94 as of late August, POL has quietly built momentum with new project launches, revamped UX, and integration with zk-rollup chains. It recently announced the launch of Polkadot Labs, a support initiative for pre-launch projects, which adds long-term value to its platform. What makes POL one of the best crypto to buy right now is its ability to remain relevant in a crowded launchpad space. It offers tools that many new token teams need: cross-chain IDO support, community voting, and curated access to quality investors. As Layer 2 ecosystems grow and the presale scene heats up, POL is regaining its utility position. While it might not deliver overnight 10x returns, POL is attracting long-term holders again, especially as its governance model improves and rewards start flowing to stakers. For those looking for tokens with real-world usage and revenue potential, Polkadot deserves a place on the shortlist. VeChain (VET): Utility-Driven Growth in Enterprise Blockchain VeChain’s VET token is trading around $0.027 this August, showing stable movement with signs of a larger breakout. What makes VET one of the best crypto to buy right now is its laser focus on enterprise solutions, which continues to set it apart from meme tokens and speculation-driven coins. VET recently signed new deals in the logistics and carbon tracking space, including an expanded partnership with a European car manufacturer to monitor battery recycling. The blockchain also supports VeBetterDAO, a growing ecosystem for sustainability-focused applications, which has been gaining traction in Asia. VeChain’s narrative is built around real-world integration. Whether it’s verifying luxury goods, tracking food supply chains, or reducing emissions, VET is offering tangible value. While it may not get the same social media buzz as some other tokens, its strong fundamentals and real use cases make it a serious buy for long-term investors. Dogecoin (DOGE): Still the King of Meme Momentum No crypto list in 2025 feels complete without Dogecoin. Trading at $0.094, DOGE has recently benefited from renewed activity on social platforms and Elon Musk’s latest post hinting at DOGE integration into Starlink microtransactions. This hint alone caused a 12% daily spike, reminding everyone that DOGE still controls the meme narrative. Unlike many meme coins that come and go, DOGE has weathered multiple cycles and continues to find support in both retail communities and developers. New projects like Dogechain have added layers of utility on top of the original token, and Dogecoin Core updates have improved transaction speeds and fees. Dogecoin’s strength lies in its loyalty base. It’s still used for tipping, small payments, and is even accepted by some online retailers. While it may not have the same tech fundamentals as newer blockchains, its ability to pump, and do it hard, means it still belongs on any watchlist of best crypto to buy right now. Final Thoughts: What Ties These Together? Whether you’re chasing multipliers or building for the long game, the best crypto to buy right now shares one common trait, traction. BlockDAG is driving daily engagement with its Buyer Battles and ecosystem rollout. Polkadot is becoming essential for new token launches. VeChain keeps landing enterprise integrations. And Dogecoin remains a cultural force with market-moving influence. There’s still time to get in, but for many of these tokens, especially BlockDAG, that window is narrowing fast. Act while the momentum is building, not after it peaks.

Just hours ago, a prominent whale, an investor holding a large amount of cryptocurrency, moved a staggering 130 million WLFI tokens, valued at an impressive $32.21 million, to the Binance exchange. This monumental transfer, reported by OnchainLenz, stems from an investor who participated in the WLFI presale back in January, having initially acquired 666 million WLFI for 10 million USDT. This move has naturally sparked considerable discussion and speculation across the crypto community. What Just Happened with This Major WLFI Token Deposit? The recent WLFI token deposit to Binance represents a pivotal moment for the token and its community. This specific whale, known for their early involvement, decided to offload a substantial portion of their holdings. Such large movements often signal a significant shift in an investor’s strategy or market outlook. According to data from CoinMarketCap, WLFI is currently trading at $0.2451, showing a positive upward trend of 7.23% despite this massive deposit. This immediate price reaction is quite interesting, as large sell-offs can sometimes trigger downward pressure. However, the market seems to be absorbing this liquidity with surprising resilience. Unpacking the Whale’s Strategy: Why This WLFI Token Deposit Matters Understanding the motivations behind such a considerable WLFI token deposit is crucial. Whales typically make these moves for several reasons, and their actions can heavily influence market sentiment and price. Here are some common interpretations: Profit-Taking: Having bought during the presale at a much lower price (10 million USDT for 666 million WLFI implies an initial price of roughly $0.015 per token), the whale is sitting on substantial gains. Depositing to an exchange often precedes selling to realize these profits. Market Rebalancing: The investor might be reallocating their portfolio, moving funds into other assets or stablecoins, especially if they anticipate future market volatility. Liquidity Provision: While less common for such a large sum, the tokens could be used for liquidity pools or other DeFi activities on Binance, though direct selling is usually the primary assumption. This event highlights the power and influence that large holders wield in nascent crypto markets. Their decisions can send ripples through the entire ecosystem, affecting smaller investors and the token’s overall trajectory. The Impact of a Major WLFI Token Deposit on Market Dynamics When a whale initiates a significant WLFI token deposit to an exchange, it creates an immediate increase in the available supply on that platform. This influx of tokens, if followed by a large sell order, can form a “sell wall,” potentially driving the price down as demand struggles to keep up with the sudden supply. However, as observed, WLFI’s price has shown an increase, suggesting strong underlying demand or perhaps strategic staggered selling by the whale. Key market dynamics to consider: Liquidity Increase: More tokens on the exchange mean higher liquidity, which can be beneficial for traders. Potential Price Volatility: While currently positive, the threat of a large sell-off from this deposit could introduce volatility. Investors should remain vigilant. Investor Confidence: The market’s ability to absorb such a large deposit without a significant price drop can, paradoxically, boost confidence in WLFI’s strength and investor interest. It’s a delicate balance, where the actions of a few large players can shape the perceptions and realities for many. Navigating Whale Movements: Actionable Insights for Investors For everyday crypto enthusiasts, understanding these whale movements, like this notable WLFI token deposit , offers valuable lessons. While it’s impossible to predict exact outcomes, being aware of on-chain data and market sentiment can provide an edge. Consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable on-chain analytics platforms and crypto news outlets. Knowledge is power in volatile markets. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Large deposits from whales can lead to price fluctuations that might impact your portfolio. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio can cushion the impact of sudden market shifts in a single asset. Independent Research: Always conduct your own due diligence (DYOR) rather than blindly following the actions of large investors. Their goals may not align with yours. The crypto market is dynamic, and understanding the forces at play, including the movements of whales, is essential for informed decision-making. In conclusion, the recent $32.2 million WLFI token deposit by a presale whale to Binance is a significant event that underscores the ever-present influence of large holders in the cryptocurrency market. While such a massive deposit often signals potential selling pressure, WLFI’s current price performance suggests a resilient market and robust demand. This situation serves as a compelling reminder for all investors to remain vigilant, informed, and strategic in their approach to the volatile yet exciting world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “whale” in cryptocurrency? A1: In cryptocurrency, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price through large buy or sell orders. Q2: What does a large WLFI token deposit to an exchange usually indicate? A2: A large WLFI token deposit (or any token) to an exchange typically indicates that the holder intends to sell a portion or all of those tokens, or potentially use them for trading, staking, or other exchange-based activities. It often signals a potential increase in selling pressure. Q3: How can a whale’s actions impact the price of a token like WLFI? A3: A whale’s large sell order can flood the market with supply, potentially driving the price down. Conversely, a large buy order can signal strong demand and push prices up. Their actions can create significant volatility and influence market sentiment. Q4: Is it always bad news when a whale makes a large token deposit? A4: Not necessarily. While it often precedes selling, the market’s reaction can vary. Sometimes, strong underlying demand can absorb the selling pressure, or the whale might be using the tokens for other purposes like providing liquidity. As seen with this WLFI token deposit, the price actually rose initially. Q5: What is a presale in the crypto context? A5: A presale is an early fundraising stage for a new cryptocurrency project where tokens are sold to a select group of investors, often at a discounted price, before the token is made available to the general public on exchanges.

51046704,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=198170,1756779611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/51046704.jpeg,Crypto Short Squeeze: Urgent Warning as Long Liquidations Dominate,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-short-squeeze-risk/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Short Squeeze: Urgent Warning as Long Liquidations Dominate The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with a crucial development that could signal an impending crypto short squeeze . For the first time in the current bull market cycle, the cumulative volume of long position liquidations has decisively surpassed that of short positions. This shift is not just a statistical anomaly; it’s a powerful indicator suggesting a significant market dynamic is at play, potentially setting the stage for a dramatic price movement. What’s Fueling the Crypto Short Squeeze Risk? Recent analysis highlights a fascinating and potentially explosive trend. CryptoQuant contributor BorisD has pointed out that based on Binance’s Cumulative Liquidations data, long liquidations have now exceeded short liquidations by a notable $7 million. This isn’t a small margin when considering the scale: cumulative short liquidations stood at $4.627 billion, while long liquidations have reached $4.634 billion as of September 1st. Long Liquidations Dominate: For months, the market saw a relatively balanced liquidation profile, or even short liquidations leading. The current flip is a significant departure. End of Long Squeeze? BorisD suggests that this dominance of long liquidations indicates that the “long squeeze” — where prices drop, forcing long positions to close — is likely in its final stages. Understanding this data is crucial for anyone involved in crypto trading. When long positions are liquidated, it typically means prices are falling, pushing traders out of their bullish bets. However, when this phenomenon becomes dominant, it can create a unique scenario. Why is a Crypto Short Squeeze More Likely Now? The concept of a crypto short squeeze hinges on the forced closure of short positions. A short position profits when an asset’s price falls. If the price unexpectedly rises, short sellers face increasing losses and might be forced to buy back the asset to cover their positions, further driving up the price. This creates a cascading effect, or a “squeeze.” Here’s why the current data points to this: Exhaustion of Long Pressure: The significant liquidation of long positions suggests that much of the downward pressure from long sellers being forced out has already occurred or is concluding. Vulnerable Short Positions: With longs cleared out, the market might be ripe for a rebound. If a positive catalyst emerges, or even just a natural bounce, short sellers who have piled into bearish bets could quickly find themselves underwater. Domino Effect: When shorts start covering, their buying activity pushes prices higher, triggering more short liquidations, and thus fueling the squeeze. BorisD explicitly stated that with the long squeeze potentially ending, “short positions [are] the likely next target.” This implies a strategic shift in market vulnerability. Navigating the Potential Crypto Short Squeeze: What Should Traders Do? For traders, understanding the dynamics of a potential crypto short squeeze is paramount. This isn’t just about predicting price direction; it’s about managing risk and identifying opportunities. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor Funding Rates: High negative funding rates can indicate an overleveraged short market, making it more susceptible to a squeeze. Watch for Volume Spikes: Sudden increases in buying volume, especially on key support levels, could be an early sign of short covering. Risk Management is Key: If you hold short positions, reassess your stop-loss orders. The volatility during a squeeze can be extreme. Identify Potential Catalysts: Keep an eye on macro news, significant project updates, or even whale movements that could trigger an upward price swing. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and these liquidation patterns offer a unique lens through which to view potential future movements. While no outcome is guaranteed, the shift in cumulative liquidations provides a compelling argument for increased vigilance regarding short positions. Crucial Insights: The Looming Crypto Short Squeeze In conclusion, the recent data showing cumulative long liquidations surpassing shorts is a significant and unprecedented development in this bull cycle. This analysis, particularly from CryptoQuant’s BorisD, strongly suggests that the market may be transitioning from a “long squeeze” phase to one where “short positions” become the primary target for liquidation. This heightened crypto short squeeze risk demands careful attention from all market participants. The implications are clear: while past weeks might have punished long positions, the tide could be turning. Traders should be prepared for potential rapid upward movements, driven by short sellers scrambling to cover their positions. As always, informed decision-making, coupled with robust risk management, will be your best allies in navigating these exciting, yet challenging, market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are long and short liquidations in the crypto market? A1: Liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to their margin falling below a required level. A long liquidation happens when the price of an asset drops, causing losses for a trader betting on a price increase. A short liquidation happens when the price rises, causing losses for a trader betting on a price decrease. Q2: What exactly is a crypto short squeeze? A2: A crypto short squeeze is a market phenomenon where a rapid increase in an asset’s price forces short sellers (who bet on price declines) to buy back the asset to limit their losses. This sudden demand for buying further drives up the price, creating a cascade effect that “squeezes” more short sellers out of their positions. Q3: Why is the current situation, with long liquidations surpassing shorts, significant? A3: This is significant because it suggests that much of the downward pressure from overleveraged long positions has been cleared. When long liquidations dominate, it can indicate that the market is nearing a bottom for that particular downtrend, potentially making short positions more vulnerable to an upward price reversal. Q4: How can traders prepare for a potential crypto short squeeze? A4: Traders can prepare by closely monitoring market indicators like funding rates, watching for sudden volume spikes, and ensuring robust risk management, including setting appropriate stop-loss orders. Understanding market sentiment and potential catalysts is also crucial. Q5: Does this analysis guarantee a crypto short squeeze will happen? A5: No, market analysis and indicators provide probabilities, not guarantees. While the data strongly suggests an increased risk of a crypto short squeeze , the crypto market is highly unpredictable. Traders should always conduct their own research and exercise caution. Share Your Insights! Did this analysis on the impending crypto short squeeze shed light on your market perspective?

A recent announcement from Bithumb, a prominent South Korean crypto exchange, has captured the attention of ZKSync (ZK) holders. The exchange has confirmed a temporary Bithumb ZK suspension for both deposits and withdrawals, a vital measure due to an upcoming network upgrade. Understanding the Bithumb ZK Suspension Details Bithumb’s official statement clarifies that this temporary halt is directly linked to an essential network upgrade for ZKSync. The suspension is set to commence on Sept. 8 at 2:00 a.m. UTC . This means that from this specific time, users will be unable to move their ZK tokens into or out of their Bithumb accounts until further notice. It is important to understand that this Bithumb ZK suspension is a precautionary and temporary measure. It is not a permanent delisting or an indication of any underlying issue with the ZKSync project itself. Instead, it is a standard procedure exchanges undertake to ensure the integrity and safety of user funds during significant network changes. For clarity, here are the key details: Asset Affected: ZKSync (ZK) Action: Suspension of deposits and withdrawals Start Date and Time: Sept. 8, 2:00 a.m. UTC Reason: ZKSync network upgrade Why is This Network Upgrade Essential for ZK? Network upgrades are fundamental to the evolution and security of any blockchain. They are designed to introduce new features, improve scalability, enhance security protocols, or fix existing bugs.

Bithumb’s decision to implement the Bithumb ZK suspension during this period underscores its commitment to safeguarding user assets. Attempting to process transactions during a network upgrade can lead to irreversible loss of funds or transaction failures. By temporarily pausing these services, Bithumb ensures that all ZK transactions are handled seamlessly and securely once the upgrade is complete and the network stabilizes. This proactive approach by exchanges helps to: Prevent Loss of Funds: Minimizing the risk of assets getting stuck or lost during an unstable network period. Ensure Data Integrity: Maintaining accurate records of all transactions post-upgrade. Facilitate Smooth Transition: Allowing the exchange systems to adapt to the upgraded network without disruptions. What Should ZK Holders on Bithumb Do Now? If you hold ZK tokens on Bithumb or plan to interact with them, immediate action might be required. The most crucial advice is to complete any necessary ZK deposits or withdrawals well before the Sept. 8, 2:00 a.m. UTC deadline . This will ensure your funds are in your desired location before the temporary halt begins. During the suspension period, refrain from attempting to send ZK to your Bithumb wallet or withdraw ZK from it. While your funds held on the exchange will remain secure, they will be inaccessible for transfers. Bithumb will issue a separate announcement once deposits and withdrawals are fully restored, so staying updated through their official channels is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Transactions: Execute any urgent ZK deposits or withdrawals before the specified time. Stay Informed: Regularly check Bithumb’s official website, announcements, or social media for updates regarding the resumption of services. Plan Ahead: Consider the temporary inaccessibility of your ZK tokens on Bithumb when planning any future transactions. Navigating Crypto Updates with Confidence This incident highlights a common occurrence in the dynamic crypto landscape. Exchanges frequently pause services for maintenance, upgrades, or security enhancements. Developing a habit of monitoring official announcements from your preferred exchanges is an essential practice for any cryptocurrency investor. The temporary Bithumb ZK suspension serves as a reminder that while digital assets offer unprecedented freedom, they also demand a high level of personal responsibility and vigilance. By understanding the reasons behind such actions and knowing how to respond, you can navigate these events with greater confidence and ensure the safety of your investments. Conclusion: Stay Vigilant, Stay Informed The temporary Bithumb ZK suspension of deposits and withdrawals, effective Sept. 8, 2:00 a.m. UTC, is a critical development for ZKSync holders using the exchange. This measure is a necessary step to facilitate a vital network upgrade, ultimately aiming to enhance the security and performance of the ZKSync network. Users are strongly advised to complete any outstanding transactions before the deadline and to monitor Bithumb’s official communications for updates on service resumption. Staying informed is your best strategy in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is happening with ZK on Bithumb? A1: Bithumb is temporarily suspending deposits and withdrawals for ZKSync (ZK) tokens starting Sept. 8, 2:00 a.m. UTC, due to a network upgrade. Q2: Why is Bithumb suspending ZK deposits and withdrawals? A2: The suspension is necessary to ensure the safe and seamless processing of ZK transactions during a critical network upgrade for ZKSync.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly becoming a cornerstone of institutional investment, now controlling a significant portion of the total Bitcoin supply. According to Nate Geraci, CEO of the U.S.-based ETF Store, and data from Hold15Capital, these investment vehicles collectively hold an astonishing 7% of the total BTC supply, which translates to over 1.5 million coins. This monumental milestone underscores the accelerating mainstream adoption of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Unpacking the Remarkable Growth of Spot Bitcoin ETFs What does holding 7% of the entire Bitcoin supply truly signify? This figure is not just a number; it represents a substantial commitment from traditional finance. For context, Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million coins. To have 1.5 million of these now managed through regulated investment products like Spot Bitcoin ETFs highlights a dramatic shift in how large institutions and even retail investors are gaining exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. The introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in various markets has provided a familiar and regulated gateway for investors who were previously hesitant to directly purchase and custody Bitcoin. This ease of access has fueled much of the recent accumulation. Simplicity: Investors can buy shares of an ETF through their existing brokerage accounts, avoiding the complexities of crypto exchanges and private key management. Regulation: These ETFs operate under established financial regulations, offering a layer of security and oversight. Liquidity: High trading volumes in these ETFs provide ample liquidity, making it easier for large investors to enter and exit positions. This influx of capital through Spot Bitcoin ETFs demonstrates a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. What Drives This Institutional Appetite for Bitcoin via Spot Bitcoin ETFs ? Several factors contribute to the escalating interest in Bitcoin via these regulated products. Institutions are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a valuable diversification tool and a potential hedge against inflation. The narrative around Bitcoin has matured, moving from a niche digital currency to a recognized store of value, often dubbed ‘digital gold.’ Moreover, the performance of Bitcoin itself, coupled with its finite supply, makes it an attractive asset. The scarcity principle, combined with increasing demand, creates a compelling investment case. As more traditional financial entities, from hedge funds to pension funds, allocate portions of their portfolios to digital assets, Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer the ideal conduit. The Broader Implications for the Crypto Market from Spot Bitcoin ETFs The substantial holdings by Spot Bitcoin ETFs carry significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. This institutional embrace can lead to: Increased Legitimacy: Further validates Bitcoin as a serious asset, potentially paving the way for more crypto-related financial products. Price Stability: Large, long-term holdings by institutions could contribute to greater price stability over time, reducing extreme volatility. Enhanced Liquidity: The depth of the market is improved as more capital flows in, benefiting all participants. However, it also concentrates a portion of the supply, which some argue could introduce new forms of market influence. Monitoring the flow of funds into and out of these ETFs becomes crucial for understanding market dynamics. For investors, the rise of Spot Bitcoin ETFs signifies a maturing market. While direct Bitcoin ownership remains an option, these ETFs provide an alternative for those seeking regulated exposure. It is essential to conduct thorough research and understand the nuances of any investment. The current trend suggests that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is not a fleeting phenomenon but a foundational shift. In conclusion, the fact that Spot Bitcoin ETFs now command 7% of the total Bitcoin supply is a landmark achievement. It reflects a powerful narrative of mainstream acceptance and a clear indicator that Bitcoin is cementing its place within the global financial ecosystem. This remarkable accumulation is a testament to Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its evolving role in the modern investment landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Spot Bitcoin ETFs?

Bitcoin Spot ETFs Saw 3,018 BTC In Net Inflows Last Week In a new post on X, analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the weekly inflows related to the US BTC spot ETFs. The “ spot ETFs ” refer to investment vehicles trading on traditional platforms that allow investors to gain indirect exposure to an underlying asset like Bitcoin or Ethereum. In the case of cryptocurrencies, the main appeal of the spot ETFs is that they provide a regulated off-chain route into them. This means that investors who aren’t familiar with digital asset wallets and exchanges can also conveniently invest into the space. While demand for Bitcoin spot ETFs was strong earlier, it has been more mixed lately. Below is a chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the weekly netflow for these investment vehicles over the last few months. As displayed in the above graph, the US Bitcoin spot ETFs observed significant net inflows between April and July, but then a shift occurred as outflows started taking place instead. Before this past week, BTC saw outflows in three out of the previous four weeks. While the netflow has switched back to positive in the last week, its value has only been a modest 3,018 BTC ($329 million at the current exchange rate). That said, the return to green has come alongside a decline in the cryptocurrency’s price, so even the small inflows are a positive indication of institutional demand for BTC. The coin that has seen more notable interest, however, has been Ethereum, the digital asset ranked second by market cap . From the chart, it’s apparent that the US Ethereum spot ETFs saw negative flows in the previous week, but just like with Bitcoin, the latest week brought back inflows. Unlike BTC, however, the outflows were an exception to the trend for ETH; the cryptocurrency’s funds were on a 14-week net inflow streak before the the wave of negative flows. Some of the spikes witnessed during the streak were also quite massive, indicating that institutional entities have been making notable bets on the asset. The latest positive netflow spike has also been significant, with 286,000 ETH (worth about $1.2 billion right now) pouring into the wallets attached to the spot ETFs. BTC Price Bitcoin has been facing bearish winds since setting its new all-time high earlier in the month that have taken its price to the $109,200 level.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum ETFs,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 03:00:16

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Realized Price Just Acted As Support As explained by CryptoQuant author IT Tech in an X post, Bitcoin found support around the short-term holder Realized Price during the latest dip. The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that measures the cost basis of the average investor on the BTC network. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLers Spend 97,000 BTC—Biggest Move This Year When the price of the cryptocurrency is above this metric, it means the holders as a whole are in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the indicator implies the overall market is in the red. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of only a specific segment of investors is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). This cohort includes the holders who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The STHs make up for one of the two main divisions of the Bitcoin market done on the basis of holding time, with the other side being known as the long-term holders (LTHs). Where these groups differ is that the investors of the former tend to be weak hands who make panic moves whenever volatility emerges in the sector, while the latter’s members show high-conviction behavior. To any investor, their cost basis is an important level and since the STHs are particularly fickle, they usually show some kind of reaction when their Realized Price gets retested. This has led to the asset’s price observing various interactions with this metric in the past. One such interaction may have occurred during the past day, as the below chart shared by the analyst suggests. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH Realized Price currently sits around $107,500. During BTC’s latest dip, its price slightly went under this mark, but found a rebound to higher levels. Generally, STHs buy to defend their cost basis when the sentiment among them is bullish. In such periods, they believe a price decline to their break-even mark to be a “dip-buying” opportunity Considering the fact that the asset has been able to find support at the STH Realized Price, it would appear that the STHs still think a bullish regime is on. That said, Bitcoin has only seen a small rebound for now, so it only remains to be seen whether the asset will remain above the level or if another retest would occur.

In the scenario that a breakdown of the metric occurs, the cryptocurrency may face a shift to a bearish trend in the short-term, as it took place in February of this year.

While price action remains confined within a descending channel, institutional adoption and whale activity are reshaping the landscape for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Metaplanet Expands Bitcoin Treasury Japanese investment firm Metaplanet boosted its holdings to 20,000 BTC after purchasing an additional 1,009 coins, valued at roughly $112 million. The company also issued 11.5 million new shares as part of a $65 million investment deal with Evo Fund. #Metaplanet has aquired an additional 1,009 $BTC , they now HODL 20,000 #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/sFrqH5Xla0 — Rand (@crypto_rand) September 1, 2025 According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, Metaplanet is now Japan’s largest Bitcoin holder and ranks fifth globally. The firm’s average purchase price sits at $102,607 per coin, leaving it modestly profitable. Despite a share price drop of over 50% since June, Metaplanet has outlined plans to raise further capital to grow its Bitcoin strategy toward 30,000 BTC by year-end. This aggressive approach underscores the increasing importance of corporate balance sheets in supporting Bitcoin demand, thereby reinforcing investor confidence even during periods of market weakness. Bitcoin Adoption in Education Bitcoin’s utility also continues to expand. The University of Hong Kong has launched a pilot program accepting tuition payments in Bitcoin. Partnering with fintech providers, the initiative instantly converts BTC into Hong Kong dollars, lowering transaction costs and increasing convenience for students. Analysts believe the model could be replicated by other Asian universities, broadening Bitcoin’s role beyond investment into everyday use cases. This strengthens its credibility as a global medium of exchange. $11B Whale Shifts Into Ether A large crypto whale holding over $11 billion in Bitcoin has shifted part of its holdings into Ether. The wallet sold $215 million in BTC last week to buy 886,371 ETH, worth nearly $4 billion, overtaking corporate holder SharpLink in Ethereum reserves. JUST IN: Publicly traded SharpLink Gaming buys another 11,259 $ETH worth $42.5 million. pic.twitter.com/camzdDAUtx — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) July 31, 2025 The move has inspired other whales, with nine major wallets buying more than $456 million in ETH. In parallel, spot ETH ETFs attracted $1.8 billion in inflows over five days, signaling growing institutional interest in Ethereum. While such flows can weigh on Bitcoin in the short term, they don’t diminish its role as the dominant store of value in the crypto market. Technical Outlook for Bitcoin Technically, Bitcoin has remained in a descending channel since mid-August. Resistance is located near $111,350–$113,500, while support is found at $107,335 and $105,150. The 50-EMA ($110,257) and 200-EMA ($112,814) form a critical resistance cluster. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlesticks show hesitation with small-bodied candles after a rebound from $108,000. The RSI at 49 is neutral but shows slight bullish divergence, while the MACD flattens, hinting at a potential crossover. A confirmed breakout above $111,350 could open a rally toward $115,700, while failure risks a drop toward $105,150. Traders may eye long entries above $111,350 with stops under $109,000. Looking forward, Bitcoin’s consolidation suggests a volatility surge is near. If retail and institutional demand continues at its current pace, BTC could break out and retest highs, with a path toward $130,000 and eventually $250,000 in play.

With Bitcoin consolidating and altcoins preparing for their own rallies, attention is shifting toward projects showing early signs of rapid adoption. One of those gaining buzz is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which many investors now compare to Shiba Inu’s early trajectory. Shiba Inu’s Remarkable Journey Shiba Inu began as a meme-inspired experiment but quickly became one of the most talked-about tokens in the world. Its community-driven growth and viral momentum helped it surge into the top ranks of the crypto market. At its peak, SHIB delivered astronomical gains to early buyers, creating a generation of overnight millionaires. Over the years, the project has expanded beyond memes, introducing its own ecosystem with DeFi platforms, NFTs, and a dedicated blockchain solution known as Shibarium. New Contender Shows Crazy Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being positioned in a similar light. With presale demand skyrocketing, community numbers swelling, and forecasts of exponential ROI, it mirrors SHIB’s early breakout days. Analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapid expansion could reward early participants in a way that rivals Shiba Inu’s legendary gains . The difference this time is a more structured roadmap , continuous development, and a clear drive to expand utility, making it more than just hype . For many investors, this combination of momentum and vision is what sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart as a high-potential opportunity. Shiba Inu’s Evolution Continues While comparisons are natural, SHIB itself has not faded. The token continues to evolve, with developers rolling out upgrades aimed at long-term sustainability. Its decentralized exchange, growing NFT activity, and layer-2 scaling efforts through Shibarium show that SHIB has matured beyond its meme coin roots. Despite price volatility, its community remains one of the most dedicated in crypto, proving that strong narratives and loyal supporters can sustain growth over years. Conclusion Shiba Inu’s story is a reminder of how powerful community-driven growth can be in crypto. With SHIB still building and new challengers like MAGACOIN FINANCE rapidly gaining ground, the race for the next breakout is heating up. For investors, the lesson is clear: the biggest opportunities often come when a project is still under the radar.

His analysis links the potential price increase not to speculative market activity but to a regulatory development that may position Ripple as a regulated banking entity in the United States. According to Pumpius, Ripple’s ongoing application for a national bank charter under the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) could prove decisive for XRP’s future. Ripple submitted its request in July, and the OCC has a 120-day review process, suggesting that a decision could arrive as early as October. Major U.S. financial institutions, such as JPMorgan , Citi, and BNY Mellon, operate under this same regulatory framework. Approval would authorize Ripple to function as a federally chartered bank, providing services that extend beyond those of a typical fintech company. In Pumpius’s view, XRP would become the asset powering Ripple’s settlement system once the charter is granted. Implications of Approval If successful, Ripple would gain rights that include direct access to the Federal Reserve , authority to custody tokenized assets and cryptocurrencies, and the ability to issue stablecoins and facilitate securities settlement. Pumpius argues that these privileges would enable Ripple to eliminate reliance on intermediaries, enabling financial institutions to use Ripple’s systems directly. Within this framework, XRP would serve as the primary liquidity token connecting global institutions to tokenized finance. He points to daily bank settlements worldwide, which total roughly $6.6 trillion. He suggests that even a minimal percentage of this volume moving through Ripple’s network could lead to substantial demand for XRP. Based on this calculation, he concludes that a $50 valuation per XRP is achievable through scaled adoption rather than speculation. Currently trading near $2.72 , XRP would need to climb approximately 1,673% to meet this target. A $50 price point would also imply a market capitalization of about $3 trillion, exceeding Bitcoin’s present valuation of $2.1 trillion. Legal and Regulatory Milestones Ripple recently resolved its extended dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a development that Pumpius describes as a step toward regulatory clarity. He maintains that the lawsuit was less of a barrier and more of a necessary alignment before Ripple could advance to the banking stage. According to him, the approval of an OCC charter would redefine XRP’s role from that of a digital asset to a regulated component of the U.S. financial framework. Opposition From Banking Groups Despite this outlook, Ripple’s pursuit of a national banking license has encountered strong resistance . Several financial industry organizations, including the American Bankers Association, have urged the OCC to delay approvals for charter applications from Ripple and other crypto-focused firms such as Circle . These groups argue that digital asset services do not align with fiduciary standards and that approving applications without broader public review undermines decades of regulatory precedent. They also warn that granting national charters could give crypto companies an advantage by allowing them to avoid state-level licensing requirements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Pumpius’s analysis connects XRP’s path to $50 with Ripple’s regulatory progress rather than speculative trading. While the potential approval of a national banking license could provide Ripple and XRP with significant new opportunities, resistance from established financial groups highlights the challenges that remain before such a transformation could take place.

This impressive surge has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts globally, signaling a vibrant period for the digital asset market. According to recent market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at an astonishing $110,030.75 on the Binance USDT market, solidifying its position as a dominant force. This significant jump invites a closer look into what’s driving such a powerful rally. What’s Fueling This Phenomenal Ascent? This latest climb in Bitcoin’s valuation isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s a testament to a confluence of factors creating a strong bullish sentiment. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone watching the crypto space. Increased Institutional Adoption: More large corporations and financial institutions are investing in Bitcoin, recognizing its value as a hedge against inflation and a store of wealth. Their entry provides significant capital and legitimacy. Growing Retail Interest: Everyday investors are increasingly participating, driven by positive news and the potential for significant returns. Accessibility through various platforms makes it easier for new users to join. Halving Event Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the supply of new BTC, often precedes price surges due to increased scarcity. This supply shock can have a profound effect on market dynamics. Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic uncertainties push investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, seeking refuge from traditional market volatility and currency devaluation. The Significance of the $110,000 Milestone for Bitcoin’s Value Crossing the $110,000 threshold for Bitcoin is more than just a number; it carries substantial implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and investor psychology. This level acts as a strong psychological barrier. Breaking it often triggers further buying interest and reinforces confidence among holders. It suggests robust market health and potentially opens the door for new all-time highs. For many, this milestone validates Bitcoin’s long-term potential and its evolving role in modern finance. Investors often view such milestones as indicators of sustained upward momentum, encouraging both new entries and existing holders to maintain their positions, fostering a positive feedback loop in the market. Navigating Volatility: Challenges and Opportunities for the Bitcoin Price While the current upward trajectory of the Bitcoin price is undeniably exciting, the crypto market is known for its inherent volatility. It’s important to approach these movements with a balanced perspective, acknowledging both the risks and the potential rewards. Potential Price Corrections: Sharp rallies can often be followed by quick, significant pullbacks as traders take profits. Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving global regulations can impact market sentiment and institutional involvement. Market Manipulation: Large trades by whales can sometimes influence short-term price movements, creating unpredictable swings. Despite these challenges, opportunities abound: Long-Term Growth Potential: Despite short-term fluctuations, Bitcoin has shown a strong long-term growth trend, rewarding patient investors. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin can serve as a valuable diversification asset, potentially uncorrelated with traditional markets. Continuous Innovation: The underlying technology continues to innovate, promising future utility and value beyond just a store of wealth. The recent surge in Bitcoin price above $110,000 marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency market. Driven by institutional adoption, retail enthusiasm, and favorable macroeconomic conditions, this milestone reinforces Bitcoin’s resilience and growing acceptance. While the journey ahead may present its share of volatility, the underlying fundamentals and the unwavering belief in its long-term potential continue to make Bitcoin a compelling asset. As we witness this incredible ascent, it’s clear that Bitcoin is not just a digital currency; it’s a powerful financial revolution unfolding before our eyes.

Institutional desks remain active in memecoins, with 809M DOGE traded at the 07:00 rally and 806M DOGE during the 20:00 pullback , far above normal averages. Analysts suggest CFOs and corporate treasuries are probing allocations into liquid digital assets like DOGE as diversification against traditional hedging strategies. Macro backdrop: G7 trade tensions, U.S. inflation monitoring, and central bank policy divergence continue to elevate volatility across both equities and digital assets. Price Action Summary DOGE traded in a $0.01 (≈6%) range between $0.21 and $0.22. At 07:00 GMT, DOGE advanced from $0.21 to $0.22 on 808.9M turnover , establishing resistance at $0.22. Profit-taking followed through midday, with additional selling pressure hitting at 20:00 GMT as price slipped back to $0.21 on 806M turnover , reinforcing the floor. The session closed at $0.21, indicating consolidation between tested support and entrenched resistance. Technical Analysis Support : $0.21 confirmed as structural floor after multiple high-volume defenses. Resistance : $0.22 remains the immediate ceiling; breakout requires decisive close above $0.225. Momentum : RSI steady near 50, showing neutral trend with potential for directional break. MACD : Histogram compression continues, suggesting buildup for momentum shift. Patterns : Range-bound consolidation forming; upside target $0.25–$0.30 if $0.22 breaks, downside risk to $0.20 if $0.21 fails.

Recently, one particular event has caught the attention of traders and analysts alike: a staggering surge in Ethereum liquidations . Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) has led the pack in perpetual futures liquidations, reaching an astonishing $134.32 million. This significant figure not only highlights ETH’s recent volatility but also provides crucial insights into broader market sentiment. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations, Anyway? For those new to the crypto trading world, the term “liquidation” might sound intimidating. Simply put, a liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a rapid price movement that erodes their margin. If a trader borrows funds to amplify their position (leverage) and the market moves against them significantly, their collateral might no longer be sufficient to cover potential losses. The exchange then liquidates their position to prevent further debt. Understanding this mechanism is key to grasping the impact of large-scale Ethereum liquidations . It often signals a period of high volatility and can exacerbate price movements as forced selling occurs, creating a ripple effect across the market. Why Are Ethereum Liquidations So High? A Deep Dive into the Data The recent data paints a clear picture: Ethereum has seen the largest share of liquidations. A whopping $134.32 million in ETH positions were liquidated within 24 hours. What’s even more telling is that long positions accounted for a dominant 73.11% of this total. This means a significant majority of traders betting on ETH’s price to go up were caught off guard by a downward movement, leading to their positions being closed out. This trend suggests that many market participants were bullish on Ethereum, perhaps expecting a rebound or continued upward momentum. However, the market had other plans, leading to a cascade of forced selling that contributed to further price declines. The sheer volume of Ethereum liquidations underscores a significant shift in short-term market sentiment. Beyond ETH: Understanding Broader Crypto Liquidations While Ethereum took the lead, it wasn’t the only cryptocurrency experiencing significant liquidations. Bitcoin (BTC), the market’s largest asset, saw $65.74 million in liquidations, with long positions making up 53.58%. This indicates a more balanced, but still volatile, market for BTC. Meanwhile, WLFI recorded $28.52 million in liquidations, with long positions accounting for 63.41%. These figures collectively illustrate a period of market-wide turbulence. The prevalence of long liquidations across multiple assets, especially ETH, suggests that traders were perhaps overly optimistic, or that unexpected market events triggered widespread stop-losses and margin calls. This environment demands caution and strategic thinking from all market participants. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Traders Amidst Ethereum Liquidations Given the current landscape marked by substantial Ethereum liquidations and broader market volatility, what can traders do? Protecting your capital is paramount during such times. Here are some actionable insights: Manage Risk Effectively: Always use appropriate stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and define your maximum risk per trade. Avoid Excessive Leverage: While leverage can amplify gains, it also magnifies losses exponentially, making liquidations far more likely during unexpected market moves. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical indicators, and fundamental developments that could impact asset prices. Knowledge is power. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading investments across different assets can mitigate risk and reduce exposure to single-asset volatility. Understand Market Sentiment: High long liquidations, as seen with ETH, can signal a temporary bearish shift or a “shakeout” of over-leveraged positions. Adjust your strategy accordingly. These strategies are crucial for navigating periods of high volatility and protecting your capital from sudden market shifts. A Glimpse into Market Dynamics The recent surge in Ethereum liquidations serves as a potent reminder of the inherent risks and rapid shifts within the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be unsettling, they also offer valuable lessons about market dynamics, risk management, and the importance of informed decision-making. As the market continues to evolve, staying vigilant and adapting strategies will be paramount for success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because the market moved against their trade, and their collateral is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. 2. Why did Ethereum experience such high liquidations? Ethereum experienced high liquidations primarily because a large number of traders had leveraged long positions (betting on price increases) that were caught off guard by a downward price movement, leading to forced selling. 3. Are liquidations always a sign of a bearish market? Not necessarily. While high long liquidations can indicate short-term bearish pressure, liquidations are more generally a sign of high volatility and over-leveraged positions being flushed out, which can sometimes precede a market rebound. 4. How can traders protect themselves from liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by using stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, diversifying their portfolio, and staying informed about market conditions and potential risks. 5. What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations happen when a trader betting on a price increase (a “long” position) is closed out due to a price drop. Short liquidations occur when a trader betting on a price decrease (a “short” position) is closed out due to a price increase. Did you find this analysis of crypto liquidations helpful?

Institutional activity dominated early hours, with 164.9M XRP traded at 07:00–08:00 GMT , almost double the 24-hour average of 86M. Whales accumulated 340M tokens (~$960M) over the past two weeks, signaling conviction despite broader market weakness. Seasonal September softness and regulatory uncertainty remain key headwinds. Spot XRP ETF applications from Grayscale, Bitwise, and others are pending with U.S. regulators. Analysts are split: some flag downside risks toward $1.00 after the July $3.65 peak, while others point to long-term breakout setups with $7–$8 targets. Price Action Summary XRP opened near $2.74 and advanced to a morning high of $2.83 on heavy volume before fading to $2.77 by session close. Support repeatedly held at $2.70–$2.74 , while $2.83 was rejected as short-term resistance. Late session (23:18–00:17 GMT) saw a 0.68% move from $2.74 to $2.77, with 2M+ tokens per minute traded during peak bursts, confirming institutional flows. Technical Analysis Support : $2.70–$2.74 established as the near-term floor. Resistance : $2.83 is the immediate ceiling; $3.00–$3.30 remains the broader breakout band. Momentum : RSI stable in mid-50s, indicating neutral-to-bullish bias. MACD : Histogram converging toward bullish crossover as accumulation builds.

If so, an important announcement from the South Korean crypto giant requires your immediate attention. Bithumb has declared a temporary halt to deposits and withdrawals for these specific tokens, effective September 9th, all in preparation for a crucial Chiliz network upgrade . This proactive measure ensures the smooth transition and stability of the network, safeguarding user assets during this significant technical enhancement. Understanding the Bithumb Suspension for the Chiliz Network Upgrade On September 9th, at 3:00 a.m. UTC, Bithumb will initiate a temporary suspension of all deposit and withdrawal services for Chiliz (CHZ), SPURS, and PEPPER. This isn’t an arbitrary decision; rather, it’s a standard operational procedure for major exchanges to support essential blockchain network enhancements. The primary reason behind this particular suspension is the upcoming Chiliz network upgrade , which promises to bring improved functionality and performance to the Chiliz ecosystem. It’s vital for users to understand that trading of these assets on Bithumb will likely remain unaffected during this period. The suspension specifically targets the movement of tokens into and out of the exchange. This allows Bithumb to safely manage the technical transition, ensuring that all user balances are accurately reflected and secured once the upgrade is complete and services resume. Why Are Network Upgrades Like the Chiliz One So Important? Blockchain network upgrades are fundamental to the evolution and long-term health of any decentralized system. Think of them as software updates for your computer or smartphone, but on a much larger, more critical scale. These upgrades are designed to: Enhance Security: Patch vulnerabilities and strengthen the network’s defenses against potential attacks. Improve Scalability: Increase transaction processing capacity, leading to faster and cheaper transactions. Introduce New Features: Implement innovative functionalities that expand the utility and appeal of the blockchain. Boost Efficiency: Optimize network performance and resource utilization. The upcoming Chiliz network upgrade is expected to deliver similar benefits, aiming to bolster the infrastructure that powers fan tokens and sports engagement. This commitment to continuous improvement is a hallmark of robust blockchain projects. What Actions Should Bithumb Users Take Before September 9th? For Bithumb users holding CHZ, SPURS, or PEPPER, preparedness is key. While the suspension is temporary, it’s wise to plan any intended deposits or withdrawals well in advance of the deadline. Here are some actionable insights: Plan Your Transactions: If you need to deposit or withdraw CHZ, SPURS, or PEPPER, complete these transactions before 3:00 a.m. UTC on September 9th. Monitor Official Announcements: Keep a close eye on Bithumb’s official communication channels for updates regarding the exact duration of the suspension and when services will fully resume. Understand the Impact: Remember, your assets remain safe on Bithumb during the suspension. This is a temporary halt of movement , not a freeze of your holdings. Bithumb’s proactive communication about the Chiliz network upgrade demonstrates its commitment to user transparency and asset security, aligning with best practices in the cryptocurrency industry. Navigating Temporary Suspensions: A User’s Guide Temporary deposit and withdrawal suspensions are a common occurrence in the crypto world, especially when significant network events like the Chiliz network upgrade are on the horizon. They are a necessary step to ensure the integrity of user funds and the smooth integration of new blockchain features.

August inflows now total $4.37 billion, which lifted year-to-date numbers to $35.5 billion. Activity was strong until Friday, when flows turned negative following the Core PCE release. The data dampened hopes for a September Fed rate cut and frustrated crypto investors. Combined with continued weak price action, this has pressured the market. As a result, total assets under management declined by 10% from recent highs to $219 billion, as the sector witnessed both resilience and fragility. Investors Bet Big on Ethereum According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, investor sentiment leaned strongly toward Ethereum, which brought in $1.4 billion in inflows against Bitcoin’s $748 million. August inflows for Ethereum now stand at $3.95 billion, while Bitcoin trails with $301 million in outflows. Meanwhile, Solana and XRP gained momentum from ETF optimism, securing $177 million and $134 million in inflows. Inflows of $5.2 million and $3.6 million into Cardano and Chainlink further signaled diversification beyond the two largest cryptocurrencies. Multi-asset products also attracted a modest $0.7 million in inflows. Sui, on the other hand, was the only asset that bucked the trend with $5.8 million in outflows over the past week. Widespread Regional Inflows Looking at geographic trends, the United States continued to dominate regional inflows, pulling in $2.29 billion last week. Other regions also saw positive sentiment, with Switzerland recording $109.4 million, Germany $69.9 million, and Canada $41.1 million. Hong Kong followed with $12.4 million during the same period, while Australia and Brazil contributed $2.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Sweden, however, recorded more than $45 million in outflows. CoinShares said that this broad regional participation of inflows reflects a healthy appetite for digital assets across the world. Meanwhile, the firm added that the outflows observed on Friday were likely the result of profit-taking activity, rather than evidence of a more concerning trend.

This movement could signal a shift in market dynamics and is certainly worth a closer look for anyone invested in or following the project. What’s Happening with Top WLFI Token Holders? According to insights from the on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, a striking eight out of the top ten addresses holding WLFI token s have made moves. These major players have either sold a portion or, in some cases, all of their holdings. This activity raises questions about the future trajectory of the token and the sentiment of its most influential investors. Significant Sell-Off: A majority of the top holders have reduced their exposure. Data-Driven Insights: This information comes directly from on-chain analysis, providing transparent, verifiable data. Market Impact: Such large-scale movements by whales often precede or influence market trends. It is crucial to note that not all top holders have divested. The analyst pointed out that the second and fifth largest holders have, as of the report, not yet moved their tokens. Nor have they deposited them onto exchanges, suggesting they might be holding firm or planning different strategies. Key Players in the WLFI Token Market: Who’s Selling What? Among the top addresses, moonmanifest.eth, the largest holder, has shown a mixed strategy. While they sold a portion of their assets, they continue to hold a substantial one billion WLFI token s. This remaining stake is valued at approximately $230 million, based on a price of $0.2318 per token. This indicates a partial de-risking rather than a full exit. Another prominent address, convexcuck.eth, the sixth largest holder, took a more direct approach. They sold around $3.8 million worth of WLFI token s. This transaction was executed through the over-the-counter (OTC) platform Whale Market, distributing the tokens to 36 different buyers. This method often allows for larger trades to occur without immediately impacting exchange prices. Why Would Major WLFI Token Holders Sell Now? The motivations behind such large-scale sales can be complex and varied. Understanding these potential reasons is vital for other investors trying to make sense of the market. Here are a few possibilities: Profit Taking: If these holders acquired WLFI at a much lower price, current market conditions might present an opportune moment to realize significant gains. Diversification: Large investors often rebalance their portfolios to mitigate risk by spreading investments across various assets. Project Outlook: While speculative, some holders might be reacting to internal developments, perceived risks, or a change in their long-term outlook for the WLFI token project. Liquidity Needs: Large entities or individuals may require substantial capital for other ventures, leading to the sale of their holdings. It is important for investors to conduct their own research and not solely rely on the actions of others. Market movements are influenced by a multitude of factors, and what is right for one whale might not be suitable for a retail investor. What Does This Mean for the Average WLFI Token Investor? For the broader community holding the WLFI token , these sales by top addresses can have several implications. Increased selling pressure, especially from large wallets, can lead to price volatility. However, it also means that tokens are being distributed to more addresses, potentially decentralizing ownership over time. This situation highlights the importance of staying informed through reliable on-chain analysis and market news. While the actions of whales can be influential, they are not always indicative of a project’s fundamental strength or weakness. Investors should consider: Market Sentiment: Observe how the market reacts to this news. Is there panic selling, or is the market absorbing the supply? Volume and Liquidity: Monitor trading volumes to see if new demand is emerging to meet the increased supply. Project Fundamentals: Re-evaluate the WLFI project’s roadmap, development progress, and community engagement, independent of these specific sales. In conclusion, the recent activity among the top WLFI token holders presents a fascinating case study in crypto market dynamics. While eight out of ten major addresses have offloaded portions of their holdings, the reasons are multifaceted, and the long-term impact remains to be seen. Vigilance, independent research, and a clear understanding of your own investment goals are paramount in navigating such market shifts. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the WLFI token? The WLFI token is a specific cryptocurrency asset within a larger blockchain ecosystem. Its exact utility and purpose depend on the project it is associated with, often involving governance, utility within a dApp, or a store of value. 2. Who is ai_9684xtpa? ai_9684xtpa is an on-chain analyst known for tracking and reporting significant movements of cryptocurrency assets by large holders (often referred to as ‘whales’) on various blockchain networks. 3. Why are on-chain analytics important for crypto investors? On-chain analytics provide transparent, real-time data about transactions, wallet movements, and network activity. This data can offer insights into market sentiment, potential whale movements, and the health of a blockchain project, helping investors make more informed decisions. 4. What does it mean for a top holder to ‘offload’ tokens? To ‘offload’ tokens means to sell a significant portion or all of one’s holdings. This can be done through exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) deals, and often indicates a desire to take profits, diversify, or exit a position. 5. How does a partial sale by moonmanifest.eth impact the WLFI token? A partial sale by a major holder like moonmanifest.eth suggests a strategy of de-risking rather than a complete loss of faith in the project. While it adds selling pressure, the continued holding of a substantial amount indicates ongoing interest or belief in the token’s long-term potential.

Today, we turn our gaze to the East, where Asian Currencies are navigating a particularly turbulent period. For those invested in digital assets, understanding these macro-economic pressures is crucial, as they can influence capital flows, risk sentiment, and even the demand for stablecoins. Let’s unravel the forces at play and their potential implications for the broader financial landscape. Unpacking the Current State of Asian Currencies The forex markets across Asia have been experiencing a noticeable downturn, with several key currencies weakening against the US dollar. This broad-based depreciation is not an isolated event but rather a confluence of global and regional factors. Investors are exercising caution, leading to a flight of capital from emerging markets and a preference for safer assets. The sentiment is palpable, reflecting a complex interplay of monetary policy expectations, geopolitical tensions, and domestic economic challenges. Many Asian Currencies , from the Japanese Yen to the Korean Won and the Indonesian Rupiah, are feeling the pressure. While each currency has its unique domestic drivers, the overarching theme is one of external headwinds. This environment makes it challenging for regional central banks to maintain stability, often forcing them to intervene or consider tighter monetary policies themselves, potentially slowing economic growth. The Shadow of Federal Reserve Policy on Global Markets One of the primary architects of the current global financial climate is the United States’ central bank, the Federal Reserve. Its aggressive stance on inflation, characterized by a series of interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening, has significantly strengthened the US dollar. This strengthening dollar has a direct and often detrimental impact on Asian Currencies and other emerging market economies. When the Fed raises interest rates, it makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive to global investors. This encourages capital to flow out of riskier emerging markets and into the US, putting downward pressure on local currencies. Furthermore, a strong dollar makes dollar-denominated debt more expensive to service for countries and corporations that have borrowed in US dollars, creating financial strain. The market’s anticipation of future Federal Reserve Policy moves keeps investors on edge, leading to volatility and uncertainty across global forex markets. Here’s a simplified look at how Fed policy impacts Asian economies: Capital Outflow: Higher US rates draw money away from Asia. Currency Depreciation: Weaker local currencies make imports more expensive. Debt Servicing Costs: Dollar-denominated debt becomes harder to repay. Inflationary Pressure: Imported goods inflation rises due to weaker currency. Navigating the Complexities of Trade Tariffs Adding another layer of complexity to the already fragile market sentiment is the persistent uncertainty surrounding Trade Tariffs . Global trade tensions, particularly between major economic blocs, continue to cast a long shadow over international commerce. Tariffs, or taxes on imported goods, disrupt established supply chains, increase costs for businesses, and ultimately impact consumer prices. For export-oriented Asian economies, these tariffs can significantly curb demand for their products, hurting their economic output and, consequently, their currencies. The unpredictability of tariff impositions and retaliations makes long-term planning difficult for businesses and governments alike. This uncertainty discourages foreign direct investment and can lead to a slowdown in global trade, which is a vital engine for growth in many Asian nations. The impact is not just on the directly targeted goods but also on broader economic confidence, which can further depress currency values. Consider the ripple effect of trade tensions: Impact Area Description Consequence for Asia Supply Chains Disruptions and re-routing of production. Increased operational costs, reduced efficiency. Export Demand Reduced international appetite for goods. Lower economic growth, pressure on local industries. Investment Hesitation from foreign investors due to uncertainty. Slower capital inflow, limited job creation. Why is the Indian Rupee Decline a Key Concern? Among the various Asian Currencies , the Indian Rupee Decline has drawn particular attention, nearing record lows against the US dollar. India, as a major emerging economy, plays a significant role in the regional and global financial landscape. The rupee’s weakness is influenced by a combination of global factors and specific domestic vulnerabilities. One primary driver is India’s reliance on imported crude oil. As global oil prices remain elevated, India’s import bill swells, leading to a larger current account deficit. This deficit needs to be financed, often through foreign capital, but with global risk aversion, capital outflows have intensified. Additionally, the strengthening dollar, driven by the aggressive Federal Reserve Policy , further exacerbates the rupee’s woes. The implications of a weaker rupee are far-reaching for India. It makes imports more expensive, potentially fueling domestic inflation. For Indian companies with foreign debt, repayment costs increase, impacting their profitability. While a weaker currency can boost exports by making them cheaper for foreign buyers, the current global economic slowdown and Trade Tariffs may limit this benefit. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) faces a delicate balancing act, attempting to support the currency without stifling economic growth. Decoding Broader Forex Market Trends in Asia Beyond the Indian Rupee, several other Asian Currencies are reflecting broader Forex Market Trends . The Japanese Yen, for instance, has also seen significant depreciation, largely due to the Bank of Japan’s continued ultra-loose monetary policy, which stands in stark contrast to the tightening policies of other major central banks. This divergence creates a substantial interest rate differential, making the Yen less attractive. Similarly, the Chinese Yuan has experienced fluctuations, influenced by domestic economic challenges, including property market woes and the lingering impact of strict pandemic policies, alongside global trade dynamics. Other currencies like the Korean Won and the Malaysian Ringgit are also under pressure, sensitive to global commodity prices, export demand, and capital flows. The overall trend suggests that while domestic factors are always at play, the global macro environment, dominated by inflation concerns, central bank actions, and geopolitical risks, is currently the most significant determinant of currency performance in the region. Key Factors Shaping Asian Forex Markets: Interest Rate Differentials: The gap between local interest rates and those in major economies (especially the US). Commodity Prices: Many Asian economies are net importers or exporters of commodities, impacting trade balances. Global Risk Sentiment: Investor appetite for riskier assets versus safe havens. Capital Flows: Movement of investment money into or out of the region. Geopolitical Developments: Regional conflicts or trade disputes. Challenges and Opportunities for Asian Economies The current environment presents both significant challenges and potential opportunities for Asian economies. The immediate challenge is managing currency depreciation, controlling inflation, and mitigating the impact of global slowdowns. Central banks are walking a tightrope, trying to support their currencies without unduly harming economic growth. However, there are also opportunities. A weaker currency can make exports more competitive, provided global demand holds up. It can also attract foreign direct investment seeking lower costs. Furthermore, this period of external pressure might compel governments to implement structural reforms that enhance economic resilience and reduce vulnerabilities. Diversification of trade partners and strengthening domestic demand are crucial long-term strategies. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors, especially those with exposure to both traditional and digital assets, understanding these dynamics is key. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Keep a close eye on statements from the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and major Asian central banks for clues on future monetary policy. Track Economic Indicators: Pay attention to inflation rates, GDP growth, and trade balances in key Asian economies. Assess Risk Appetite: Understand global risk sentiment. During periods of high risk aversion, safe-haven assets (like the US dollar or even certain stablecoins) tend to perform better. Diversify Portfolios: Consider diversification across different asset classes and geographies to mitigate currency-specific risks. Evaluate Stablecoin Demand: In times of significant fiat currency volatility, demand for stablecoins pegged to stronger currencies might increase among local populations. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Global Finance The current downturn in Asian Currencies is a vivid illustration of the complex and interconnected nature of global finance. Driven by the assertive Federal Reserve Policy , exacerbated by lingering Trade Tariffs , and highlighted by the significant Indian Rupee Decline , these movements are more than just numbers on a screen. They represent real economic pressures on nations and individuals alike. For anyone observing Forex Market Trends , it’s clear that the path ahead is filled with challenges, requiring careful navigation and strategic foresight. As global economies continue to grapple with inflation and geopolitical uncertainties, the resilience of Asian markets will be tested, shaping not just their future but also influencing the broader financial world, including the evolving crypto landscape.

Both projects are positioned as strong challengers to Ethereum, aiming to solve the industry’s biggest hurdles: scalability, transaction speed, and cost. While both rely on Proof-of-Stake (PoS), their design philosophies and technical approaches could not be more different. This makes the question of which one is the smarter long-term play especially interesting for investors. Before diving deeper, it’s worth noting that analysts are also pointing to a third player quietly gaining traction. MAGACOIN FINANCE has started drawing attention from investors who see it as a rare early-stage opportunity, with experts predicting it could outperform both Solana and Cardano’s gains in 2025. A Tale of Two Philosophies Solana has built its brand on speed. Known as the “Speed Demon” of crypto, it leverages a unique Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism alongside PoS, allowing the network to process up to 65,000 transactions per second in theory. Fees are tiny, often just a fraction of a cent, making Solana especially attractive for DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 projects where low cost and fast throughput matter. However, the network has faced its share of outages, raising concerns over stability. Cardano, in contrast, takes the “academic approach.” Its Ouroboros protocol is the first PoS mechanism backed by peer-reviewed research, designed for long-term security and sustainability. While transaction speeds are currently much lower than Solana’s, Cardano is steadily rolling out upgrades like Hydra, which could eventually scale to thousands of TPS. The methodical pace has been frustrating for some, but its emphasis on reliability has built trust among investors who prioritize stability. New Contender Surprises the Crypto Market While Solana and Cardano continue their rivalry, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a potential disruptor. Early participants are treating it like a once-in-a-decade chance, as its presale rounds are filling up quickly. Analysts say limited access and heavy demand could translate into exponential upside, with some projections suggesting 50x to even 100x returns before 2025 ends . Unlike many meme or hype-driven coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a structured ecosystem with real utility , making it a serious candidate for investors who want to catch the next breakout before it lists on major exchanges. Performance and Ecosystem Growth From a numbers standpoint, Solana is the clear frontrunner when it comes to raw speed. Its thriving ecosystem, filled with dApps, DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces, continues to expand rapidly. Developers are drawn to its efficiency and ease of use, making it a playground for experimentation. Cardano’s growth is steadier. While its ecosystem may not be as flashy, its focus on sustainable and peer-reviewed development has attracted projects that want a reliable and secure foundation. Cardano’s long-term plan is to establish itself as a global financial system, which appeals to more risk-averse investors. The Long-Term Outlook For risk-takers, Solana’s fast-moving ecosystem offers high upside potential—if it can resolve its reliability concerns. For those seeking stability, Cardano’s methodical approach may be the safer bet. And for investors willing to look beyond the obvious, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a unique chance to secure exposure to a project at its earliest stage, with the kind of growth potential that turned early DOGE and SHIB buyers into millionaires. Conclusion Solana and Cardano represent two different roads to blockchain adoption—speed and innovation versus security and sustainability. Both can be valuable long-term plays, depending on one’s risk appetite. Yet, with MAGACOIN FINANCE capturing massive early attention, many investors are treating it as the sleeper pick of 2025, one that could surpass both SOL and ADA in percentage gains.

Analyst Eyes Choppy September Before New Highs,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/no-ethereum-rally-until-q4-analyst-eyes-choppy-september-before-new-highs/,"As the crypto market continues to struggle, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to hold a crucial zone as support to resume its bullish rally. However, some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency will see another choppy September before the long-awaited Q4 run. Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Stays Strong As Exchange Reserves Keep Falling – Details Ethereum Party To Be Delayed? Amid the recent market correction, Ethereum closed August around the $4,390 area, recording its highest monthly close since November 2021. The end-of-month market pullback sent the King of Altcoins’ price to the $4,250 area before bouncing, a 14% drop from its recent all-time high (ATH) of $4,956. The cryptocurrency began the new month attempting to reclaim the $4,500 level as support for the third consecutive day, but failed to hold this crucial area, dropping below its monthly opening. Market watcher Cipher X highlighted that ETH has historically seen mixed performances throughout September, with more red than green price action and an average negative monthly return of 6.1%. According to CoinGlass data, Ethereum has seen double-digit negative returns five times since 2016, losing 21.65% in 2017. Meanwhile, it has only recorded a positive return in the double-digits once, with a 14.53% performance in 2016. Nonetheless, the market watcher noted that if the altcoin’s performance stumbles this month, “history suggests the real rebound could come right after.” Notably, October and November have historically been green months for ETH, with an average return of 4.7% and 7.8%, respectively. “September might be choppy but the months that follow have usually been much friendlier to ETH,” the analyst affirmed. Similarly, Bitfinex suggested that “September could mark the cyclical low point before structural drivers reassert for a Q4 recovery.” In a Monday report, the crypto exchange explained that they expect the broader market pullback to conclude relatively soon, adding that, despite the recent sell-off, institutional accumulation of ETH remains robust, while only 18.3 million ETH currently sit on exchanges. ETH Q4 Take Off Eyes New Highs Michaël van de Poppe underscored ETH’s performance, affirming that Ethereum is “on its way toward a beautiful spot to accumulate before Q4 is ready to take off.” According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency could see a 10%-20% correction this month to the $3,900-$3,400 range, which served as an accumulation zone before the August breakout. Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that ETH has been hovering between $4,300-$4,500 over the past week, consolidating in the mid-zone of its local range. The analyst warned that the lack of momentum at the start of the month could see the cryptocurrency retest the range lows, where the 200-Day Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) are situated in the 4-hour chart. However, he noted that breaking out and consolidating above the local range would lead to higher levels and into its price discovery phase.

Meanwhile, market watcher Merlijn The Trader affirmed that Ethereum has entered the expansion phase as the $4,000-$4,100 zone has been retested as support throughout the recent pullbacks. Per the post, the multi-year trendline has been turned from resistance into a launchpad that will propel the cryptocurrency’s price to the $7,000 level once the breakout begins. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,268, a 4% decline in the daily timeframe.

A falling wedge pattern may lead to a reversal, but breakout confirmation is still missing. Over 1.9M SUI removed from circulation as token burns and freezes continue rising fast. Price Action Near Key Support After reaching a high of $3.90 earlier in August, the token has pulled back and is currently priced around $3.18 to $3.28 (Coingecko data). Analysts are closely tracking the $3.20 support, which has held several times before. SUI has seen multiple short-term rallies from the $3.20 area. The most recent one reached $3.53, and earlier this month, it moved as high as $3.90. Each move upward has been followed by lower highs, which may suggest weakening buying momentum. Crypto analyst BitGuru stated that if the $3.20 level holds, “buyers could step back in, targeting $3.53 first and potentially a run toward $3.90 again.” However, he also warned that “losing $3.20 might invite deeper downside pressure.” $SUI is trading at $3.23, holding near short-term support after multiple pullbacks. If this level holds, buyers could step back in, targeting $3.53 first and potentially a run toward $3.90 again. Losing $3.20, however, might invite deeper downside pressure. pic.twitter.com/ZBGUQrjXtq — BitGuru (@bitgu_ru) September 1, 2025 At present, the token is sitting just above or around this critical level. A breakdown may lead to further selling unless a quick recovery follows. Falling Wedge Formation Signals Possible Shift Another chart shared by Gordon shows SUI trading inside a falling wedge pattern. This structure is often linked to potential trend reversals when confirmed by a breakout. Notably, the support level at $3.18 has held several times. In a previous wedge, the price broke out and continued higher. A similar setup is now forming. Still, the price has not yet broken above the descending trendline. Gordon suggested a possible long-term move, stating : “We will revisit this at $10,” though no timeline was given. The setup remains open-ended. Price must break the wedge before a new upward trend can be confirmed. Onchain Activity Adds Supply Pressure Data from Sui Intern shows that SUI has now passed 285 million accounts, reflecting steady network growth. At the same time, on-chain data from @eyezenhour points to over 1.9 million SUI removed from circulating supply due to burns and freezes. According to the post, token burns are linked to gas usage and validator rewards. Freezes come from staking and system-level locks. The post added : “The less there is to sell, the harder it is to stop a move once it starts.” This reduction in float may add pressure to price over time, especially if demand continues to rise.

ETH is now attempting a recovery and might face hurdles near the $4,420 zone. Ethereum is still struggling to recover above the $4,500 zone. The price is trading below $4,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,430 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent increase if there is a close above the $4,450 level in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Steady Increase Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it tested the $4,220 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $4,280 and $4,320 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,491 swing high to the $4,213 low. A base seems to be forming above the $4,200 level, but the bears might remain active above the $4,400 resistance zone . Ethereum price is now trading below $4,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,430 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,385 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,491 swing high to the $4,213 low. The next key resistance is near the $4,400 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $4,430 level. A clear move above the $4,430 resistance might send the price toward the $4,500 resistance. An upside break above the $4,500 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,550 resistance zone or even $4,580 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,430 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,320 level. The first major support sits near the $4,250 zone. A clear move below the $4,250 support might push the price toward the $4,200 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,160 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a pronounced pivot from established giants like Tesla towards the more volatile, yet potentially lucrative, world of crypto-related stocks. Why Are South Korean Retail Investors Shifting Gears? Recent data paints a clear picture of this evolving investment landscape. According to Bloomberg News, citing Yonhap News and the Korea Securities Depository (KSD), South Korean retail investors net sold a staggering $657 million (916.3 billion won) worth of Tesla stock in August. This marks the largest monthly sell-off for the electric vehicle maker since early 2019, indicating a significant change in sentiment. Tesla Sell-Off: $657 million net sold in August. Crypto Stock Purchase: $253 million net purchased in Bitmine Immersion Technologies shares. This substantial divestment from Tesla wasn’t a move to cash out entirely. Instead, a considerable portion of these funds found a new home in companies deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. For instance, Bitmine Immersion Technologies saw a net purchase of $253 million (352.8 billion won) in shares from these same investors, highlighting a clear preference for digital asset exposure. Understanding the Allure of Crypto Stocks for South Korean Retail Investors What exactly are these ‘crypto stocks’ that are drawing such significant attention? Generally, these refer to publicly traded companies whose business models are directly tied to the cryptocurrency market. This can include: Mining Companies: Firms that mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Exchanges: Platforms facilitating the buying and selling of digital assets. Blockchain Technology Firms: Companies developing and implementing blockchain solutions. The appeal for South Korean retail investors often stems from a desire to gain exposure to the high-growth potential of the crypto market without directly holding volatile cryptocurrencies themselves. Investing in these companies can offer a perceived layer of traditional market stability while still riding the waves of digital asset innovation and price movements. Navigating the Volatility: Risks and Rewards While the potential for high returns is a significant draw, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility and risks associated with crypto stocks. The performance of these companies is often closely correlated with the price movements of underlying cryptocurrencies, which are known for their rapid fluctuations. Investors must consider: Market Volatility: Sudden price swings in Bitcoin or Ethereum can directly impact crypto stock valuations. Regulatory Changes: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies can introduce uncertainty. Company-Specific Risks: Beyond crypto market dynamics, individual company performance, operational efficiency, and technological advancements play a role. This shift by South Korean retail investors underscores a broader trend of seeking new frontiers for growth, especially as traditional equity markets face various headwinds. The move reflects a proactive search for assets that offer significant upside, even if it comes with increased risk. What Does This Investment Trend Signify? This pivot by a significant segment of the investment community holds broader implications. It suggests a growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets and blockchain technology as legitimate investment avenues. Moreover, it highlights the agility of retail investors to adapt their portfolios in response to market signals and emerging opportunities. For market observers, this trend provides valuable insight into the evolving preferences of a tech-savvy investor base. It signals that the appetite for innovative and potentially disruptive sectors remains strong, with digital assets at the forefront of this new investment wave. Conclusion: A New Chapter for South Korean Investors The decisive move by South Korean retail investors to divest from Tesla and embrace crypto stocks marks a fascinating development in global investment trends. It illustrates a clear pursuit of high-growth opportunities within the digital asset space, signaling a potential long-term shift in investor sentiment. As markets continue to evolve, monitoring these dynamic changes will be crucial for understanding future investment landscapes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What prompted South Korean retail investors to sell Tesla shares? A1: The exact reasons are multifaceted but likely include a search for higher growth opportunities, changing market sentiment towards traditional growth stocks, and a desire to diversify into emerging sectors like cryptocurrency. Q2: What are ‘crypto stocks’ and how do they differ from direct cryptocurrency investments? A2: Crypto stocks are shares in companies whose business models are tied to the cryptocurrency industry (e.g., mining, exchanges). They differ from direct cryptocurrency investments as investors own company equity rather than digital assets themselves, offering a potentially more traditional investment vehicle with crypto exposure. Q3: Is this a unique trend to South Korea? A3: While the scale of this particular shift is notable in South Korea, the broader trend of retail investors seeking exposure to digital assets is global. South Korean investors are often early adopters of new technologies and investment trends. Q4: What are the main risks associated with investing in crypto stocks? A4: Key risks include high market volatility, potential regulatory changes impacting the crypto industry, and company-specific operational or financial risks that could affect the stock’s performance.

An alarming new threat has emerged, specifically targeting WLFI holders through sophisticated WLFI phishing attacks . These malicious campaigns are exploiting a recent Ethereum upgrade, putting your digital assets at significant risk. It’s crucial for every crypto enthusiast to understand this danger and take immediate action. Understanding the Ethereum Upgrade and Its Exploitation The core of these WLFI phishing attacks lies in a feature introduced by Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7702. This proposal, which was part of the Pectra upgrade in May, brings a powerful new capability to the Ethereum network. What is EIP-7702? It allows an externally owned account (EOA) – your standard crypto wallet – to temporarily behave like a smart contract wallet. Why is this useful? It enables advanced functionalities like delegated execution permissions and batch transactions, making crypto interactions more flexible and efficient. However, as Yu Xian, founder of the blockchain security firm SlowMist, highlighted on X, hackers are exploiting this innovation. They are using EIP-7702 to plant addresses they control directly into victims’ wallets, effectively gaining unauthorized access to steal tokens. This new vector represents a serious challenge for wallet security. How WLFI Phishing Attacks Operate These WLFI phishing attacks are not random; they are highly targeted and cunning. Cybercriminals leverage social engineering tactics to trick users into unknowingly granting them access. They often impersonate legitimate entities or create convincing fake websites. Here’s a breakdown of common methods: Deceptive Links: Attackers send links that appear to be from trusted sources, such as project updates, airdrops, or support messages. Clicking these links can lead to malicious sites. Fake Wallets or DApps: They create fraudulent decentralized applications (DApps) or wallet interfaces that mimic real ones. When users connect their wallets, they inadvertently approve malicious transactions. Exploiting EIP-7702: Once a user interacts with a malicious site or approves a deceptive transaction, the attacker exploits EIP-7702 to inject their own address. This grants them temporary control over your wallet’s execution permissions, allowing them to drain funds. The sophisticated nature of these attacks means even experienced users can fall victim if they are not extremely careful. Protecting Your Assets from WLFI Phishing Attacks Given the escalating threat of WLFI phishing attacks , proactive security measures are essential. Protecting your digital assets requires vigilance and adherence to best practices. Consider these actionable steps: Verify Sources: Always double-check the URL of any website before connecting your wallet or approving transactions. Look for official links from trusted social media channels or project documentation. Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, use a hardware wallet. They offer an additional layer of security by requiring physical confirmation for transactions, making remote exploitation much harder. Review Permissions: Carefully examine all transaction details and permissions requested by DApps. If something seems unusual or asks for excessive access, decline it. Stay Informed: Follow reputable blockchain security firms like SlowMist and official project channels for the latest security alerts and advice. Use Reputable Security Tools: Employ browser extensions that warn about known phishing sites, and consider using secure DNS services. Remember, the responsibility for securing your wallet ultimately rests with you. A moment of carelessness can lead to irreversible losses. Conclusion: Stay Vigilant Against Emerging Threats The exploitation of EIP-7702 for WLFI phishing attacks underscores the constant need for vigilance in the crypto space. While new Ethereum features like EIP-7702 promise greater flexibility and utility, they also introduce new attack vectors that malicious actors are quick to exploit. By understanding the mechanisms behind these attacks and adopting robust security practices, WLFI holders can significantly reduce their risk. The crypto community must work together to educate users and enhance security protocols. Your diligence is your best defense against these evolving threats. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is EIP-7702 and why is it relevant to phishing attacks? EIP-7702 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to temporarily function like smart contract wallets, enabling delegated execution permissions. Hackers are exploiting this by injecting their own addresses into victims’ wallets through deceptive means, gaining control to steal tokens. Are only WLFI holders affected by these phishing attacks? While the initial reports specifically mention WLFI holders, the underlying vulnerability exploits a general Ethereum upgrade (EIP-7702). This means that any user interacting with the Ethereum network could potentially be targeted by similar phishing attacks if they fall for a malicious scheme. How can I tell if a website is a phishing site? Always check the URL for misspellings or unusual domains. Look for HTTPS and a padlock icon, but be aware that phishing sites can also have these. Verify the link against official sources (e.g., project’s official Twitter, Discord, or website). Be wary of unsolicited links or offers that seem too good to be true. What should I do if I suspect my wallet has been compromised? If you suspect a compromise, immediately move all remaining funds to a new, secure wallet. Disconnect your compromised wallet from all DApps. Revoke any suspicious permissions granted to smart contracts using tools like Etherscan’s Token Approvals. Report the incident to relevant authorities or security firms if possible. Does using a hardware wallet protect against EIP-7702 exploits? Yes, hardware wallets offer strong protection. Even if you unknowingly interact with a malicious site, a hardware wallet requires physical confirmation for transactions. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to drain funds without your direct, physical approval, adding a crucial layer of security against WLFI phishing attacks .

The Korea Customs Service (KCS) has announced a groundbreaking partnership with domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, aiming to curb the rising tide of illicit foreign exchange transactions involving digital assets. This initiative underscores a clear commitment to creating a safer and more transparent digital financial landscape. Why Are South Korea Crypto Illicit Flows a Growing Concern? The urgency behind this collaboration is striking. Over the past five years, a staggering three out of every four foreign exchange crimes investigated by the KCS, when measured by monetary value, have been linked to virtual assets. This statistic highlights a critical vulnerability that demands immediate and comprehensive attention. Cryptocurrencies, with their rapid, borderless, and often pseudonymous nature, have unfortunately become attractive tools for various illicit activities. These can range from money laundering and tax evasion to funding illegal operations. The challenge for authorities worldwide is to harness the innovation of digital assets while mitigating their potential for misuse. This escalating trend of South Korea crypto illicit flows poses risks not only to financial integrity but also to national security and the broader public trust in digital finance. How Does This Partnership Tackle South Korea Crypto Illicit Flows? The new alliance is designed to foster a robust information-sharing ecosystem between the public and private sectors. Announced by Korea Customs Service Commissioner Lee Myung-gu at a meeting with the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) on September 2nd, the initiative outlines a clear division of responsibilities: KCS Contribution: The customs service will provide exchanges with up-to-date information on the latest crime cases and emerging patterns in illicit financial activities. This intelligence is crucial for proactive detection. Exchange Efforts: Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are tasked with enhancing their internal systems and processes to actively detect and report suspicious transactions. Their direct access to transaction data makes them frontline defenders against South Korea crypto illicit flows . This synergy between law enforcement and industry players is pivotal. It leverages the KCS’s investigative expertise with the exchanges’ operational data and technological capabilities to create a more effective deterrent. Benefits and Broader Impact of Combating South Korea Crypto Illicit Flows The collaboration promises a multitude of benefits for all stakeholders: Enhanced Security: A more secure digital asset environment reduces opportunities for criminals, protecting both individuals and the broader financial system. Increased Trust: By actively combating illicit activities, South Korea aims to build greater confidence in its crypto market, potentially attracting more legitimate investment and participation. Regulatory Clarity: Such partnerships often lead to a clearer understanding of regulatory requirements and best practices, benefiting both exchanges and users. Global Leadership: South Korea positions itself as a leader in responsible digital asset regulation, setting an example for other nations grappling with similar challenges regarding South Korea crypto illicit flows . Ultimately, the goal is to cultivate a healthy and sustainable digital asset ecosystem where innovation can thrive without being undermined by criminal exploitation. Navigating the Future: Challenges in Preventing South Korea Crypto Illicit Flows While this partnership is a significant step, the fight against illicit crypto flows is ongoing and complex. Several challenges remain: Evolving Tactics: Criminals constantly adapt their methods, requiring continuous updates to detection techniques and regulatory frameworks. Technological Complexity: The rapid pace of innovation in blockchain and crypto necessitates advanced analytical tools and skilled personnel to identify sophisticated schemes. International Cooperation: Digital assets transcend borders, meaning effective combat against illicit flows often requires international collaboration, which can be challenging to coordinate. Balancing Privacy and Security: Striking the right balance between protecting user privacy and ensuring robust security measures against financial crime is a delicate act. The success of this initiative will depend on continuous adaptation, technological investment, and unwavering commitment from both the KCS and the crypto industry. What This Means for You: Actionable Insights on South Korea Crypto Illicit Flows For individuals and businesses participating in South Korea’s crypto market, this partnership signals a heightened focus on compliance and transparency. Here are some actionable insights: Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML): Expect continued emphasis on strict KYC and AML procedures from exchanges. Adhering to these is crucial for smooth transactions. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter anything that seems out of the ordinary, it’s vital to report it to your exchange or relevant authorities. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory changes and best practices in the digital asset space. By fostering cooperation and vigilance, the public and private sectors in South Korea are working together towards the goal of creating a healthy ecosystem, where the benefits of digital assets can be fully realized without the shadow of illicit activities. This proactive approach by the Korea Customs Service and DAXA is a powerful testament to South Korea’s dedication to securing its financial future in the digital age. It sets a precedent for how nations can effectively combat the challenges posed by virtual assets while embracing their transformative potential. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA)? A1: DAXA is an association of major cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea that aims to promote a healthy and safe digital asset ecosystem through self-regulation and cooperation with authorities. Q2: What types of illicit activities are targeted by this partnership? A2: The partnership primarily targets illicit foreign exchange transactions involving virtual assets, which can include money laundering, tax evasion, and other financial crimes. Q3: How does this partnership affect regular cryptocurrency users in South Korea? A3: Regular, law-abiding users should experience a more secure and trustworthy environment. They may notice stricter KYC/AML procedures on exchanges, which are in place to protect the ecosystem from illicit actors. Q4: Why are cryptocurrencies often used for illicit flows?

The Trump family and its partners rolled out World Liberty tokens last year through a DeFi venture. At the time, about $550 million worth of tokens were sold, though they weren’t tradable and only served as voting rights within World Liberty Financial. Nonetheless, a July investor vote opened the door for public trading, giving Trump’s personal holdings and those of investors a chance at appreciation. The market debut also doubled as a test of how far the Trump name could push demand for its 100 billion tokens. The token’s market debut likely marks the Trump family’s most significant financial win since the inauguration. The family, including President Trump, holds just under a quarter of all WLFI tokens in circulation. Trump’s three sons are listed as co-founders of World Liberty, while the president himself carries the title of “Co-Founder Emeritus.” According to World Liberty, the tokens allocated to founders and team members remain “locked,” preventing them from being sold for now. However, the launch provided a public market valuation for their holdings, which, until this point, were based only on private transactions. WLFI token early investors are only allowed to sell 20% of their holdings Announcing the trading session debut on Monday, Donald Trump Jr, the president’s eldest son, described the WLFI token as a “governance backbone of a real ecosystem changing how money moves.” World Liberty Financial also clarified that only 24.7 billion tokens would be available for trading immediately, with 7.8 billion of that amount funneled into its new “crypto treasury” business. Monday’s debut also limits early investors to selling just one-fifth of their holdings, with the remainder off-limits for now. The restriction, however, doesn’t cover founders such as Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. As part of the launch arrangement, a Nasdaq-listed blockchain company is set to receive $1.5 billion, half in WLFI tokens and half in cash, with the funds designated for additional WLFI purchases. On Monday, the WLFI token initially spiked 17% to a high of 33 cents per CoinGecko’s data. The coin had launched at about 28 cents on Binance, OKX, and Kraken but was down 15% to 24 cents by New York midday. Now the token is trading at around $0.232. Additionally, on Monday, the WLFI tokens on exchanges were estimated to have a combined notional value of about $6.4 billion. WLFI has likely become the Trump family’s most valuable asset, surpassing their decades-old real estate portfolio. Although the family has continued to pursue property ventures worldwide since Trump took office, the fast-moving crypto venture has delivered the most immediate impact. Justin Sun said he wasn’t looking to offload his WLFI tokens for now Trump held 15.75 billion WLFI tokens as of late last year, worth about $3.6 billion at Monday’s price. However, he and his family have been bashed for their ties to the WLFI project. According to some Democratic senators and critics, the Trump family’s ownership position creates a conflict of interest . In April, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Maxine Waters said that the arrangement created “an obvious incentive” for the Trump administration to push regulators, including the SEC, to adopt crypto-friendly stances that enrich the president’s family. Nevertheless, World Liberty Financial has attracted funding, including a $75 million investment from crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, who said Monday he has no plans to cash out his tokens anytime soon. On the other hand, DWF Markets head Andrei Grachev, also a WLFI investor, stated he planned to move $250 million of reserves into the firm’s stablecoin, USD1. Ghana’s Amoaning Samuel, an entrepreneur, also explained that Trump’s endorsement convinced him to buy WLFI tokens earlier this year. He commented, “This is a president that believes in crypto and is doing so much for the crypto community . . . It has that legitimacy and ties with the sitting president.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",News|WLFI,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-02 05:00:22

Some stem from early misunderstandings, while others were spread deliberately to create fear. To fully grasp Bitcoin’s role today, it’s important to clear up the misconceptions and focus on facts. And as Bitcoin matures, new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also attracting investor interest, praised for their great tokenomics, growing community, and surging value , which are drawing global attention. Myth #1: Bitcoin is Only for Criminals This is one of the oldest and most stubborn claims. While Bitcoin was once used on dark web markets, the reality today is that most transactions are legitimate. The blockchain is public, meaning every transaction can be tracked, making Bitcoin a poor choice for crime compared to the traditional banking system, which has far more loopholes for money laundering. Myth #2: Bitcoin Has No Intrinsic Value Critics argue Bitcoin isn’t backed by gold or governments. But neither are modern fiat currencies. Bitcoin’s value lies in its decentralized network, capped supply of 21 million, and cryptographic security , which together give it utility as a store of value and medium of exchange. Myth #3: Bitcoin is a Bubble Volatility fuels the bubble argument, but history shows otherwise. Since 2009, Bitcoin has survived countless crashes and corrections, continuing to expand its network, adoption, and institutional presence. It looks less like a bubble and more like a maturing technology. The Altcoin that Took Center Stage As myths around Bitcoin fade, investors are widening their focus to other opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the standouts of 2025, drawing comparisons to early-stage crypto giants. With a surging community and early backers already eyeing exponential returns , it represents what many see as the next breakout opportunity in the altcoin market. Demand for presale allocations has been intense, and momentum suggests it could mirror some of the explosive growth stories the crypto world has seen before. Myth #4: Bitcoin is Bad for the Environment Mining consumes energy, yes, but much of it comes from renewables like hydro and solar. Comparing Bitcoin’s footprint to entire nations is misleading. A more accurate comparison is against industries like gold mining or traditional banking, which often consume far more. Myth #5: Bitcoin is Anonymous Bitcoin isn’t truly anonymous; it’s pseudonymous. Every transaction is public. If an address is linked to an identity through exchanges or regulators, full histories can be tracked. This transparency makes it unattractive for serious criminals. Myth #6: Bitcoin Can Be Easily Hacked The Bitcoin network itself has never been hacked. Attacks usually happen on poorly secured exchanges or wallets, not the blockchain. With private keys stored safely, Bitcoin remains one of the most secure systems in existence. Myth #7: Bitcoin is Controlled by Whales Some large holders exist, but they don’t control the network. Bitcoin’s design ensures that changes to its rules require broad consensus across miners, developers, and users worldwide. Power is spread out, not centralized in a few hands. Conclusion Bitcoin has been clouded by myths for years, but when the noise is stripped away, it stands as a decentralized, transparent, and resilient digital asset. As adoption grows, these misconceptions fade, making room for clearer understanding of its potential. And while Bitcoin proves its staying power, opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE show that early investors in the right projects can still position themselves for potentially massive gains.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-ledger-is-explicitly-cited-in-an-official-brics-report-heres-why/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE highlighted a specific detail from a BRICS economic report, noting that the XRP Ledger is directly cited within the document. In the post, SMQKE stated that “the XRPLedger is explicitly cited in an official BRICS report on the development of a BRICS cryptocurrency” and emphasized that the mention is documented. The observation is based on a section of the report that discusses smart contracts, escrow-like systems for trade finance, and blockchain-based mechanisms to improve settlement efficiency. The report references “XRP Ledger, 2020” in this context, indicating that its escrow model was considered when evaluating options for cross-border trade finance infrastructure. The XRPLedger is explicitly cited in an official BRICS report on the development of a BRICS cryptocurrency. Documented. https://t.co/AsnW6Lxilz pic.twitter.com/Au3QkYFoc3 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 1, 2025 Details from the report page The document itself outlines how BRICS countries have studied distributed ledger technology and blockchain to strengthen operational efficiency in trade settlements. It states that in 2019, the BRICS Business Council created a working group to explore a trade-facilitating cryptocurrency. At the same time, it stresses that meeting BRICS goals for de-risking national currency trade settlements does not necessarily require the creation of a new, specialized cryptocurrency for document flow. Instead, the report highlights the role of smart contracts as a key tool to automate processes, verify fulfillment criteria, and disburse payments through external verification mechanisms such as oracles. Within this explanation, the document cites the XRP Ledger as an example of how funds can be stored in a virtual escrow account to guarantee availability at the time of contract execution. Neo’s response to SMQKE Following SMQKE’s post, another user, Neo, acknowledged the reference but pointed out additional context. Neo explained that the same report also references the need for an “in-house smart contract system” for BRICS. This raises the possibility that while XRPL is cited as a technical example, BRICS may instead be considering the development of its own dedicated blockchain infrastructure. Neo questioned whether BRICS would opt to build a proprietary blockchain from the ground up or instead operate a permissioned version of an existing framework. Implications of the two points The posts together highlight two important aspects of the document. First, that XRPL is indeed cited within an official BRICS publication in relation to escrow and smart contract functionality. Second, the report also references a path toward building an internal smart contract system, which suggests BRICS could ultimately pursue a controlled, consortium-style platform designed specifically for its member states. This approach would give BRICS flexibility over governance, compliance, and customization while still acknowledging existing blockchain systems as relevant technical references. Further context of the document The excerpt also addresses the benefits of smart contracts for trade finance, including reduced settlement times, cost savings, and minimization of errors and disputes. It contrasts existing Western trade finance systems with the possibility of BRICS creating its own framework to avoid reliance on Western-dominated settlement rails.

SMQKE’s post focuses on the verifiable fact that the XRP Ledger is explicitly mentioned in a BRICS document on digital trade settlements. The document positions smart contracts as central to BRICS’ long-term plans for trade finance, with XRPL noted as part of the technical landscape under review.

Lee's comments were contained in written responses submitted before he took office as head of the country's top financial regulator. Lee stated that cryptocurrencies, due to their high price volatility, cannot fulfill the basic functions of a currency: store of value and medium of exchange. He also opposed pension and investment funds investing in crypto assets, arguing that the speculative nature of the market poses risks. Related News: 10 DeFi Altcoins Developers Focused on the Most in the Last Month Have Been Revealed - There Are Big Surprises However, these statements were met with criticism from local crypto industry representatives, who described Lee's comments as “reactionary,” especially at a time when many governments and companies are incorporating crypto into their balance sheets. Some blockchain experts, however, argued that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have “digital benefits,” such as security and ease of transfer. Lee stated that he takes a more balanced stance on stablecoins, saying he aims to balance innovation opportunities with security measures. South Korea is working on plans to regulate a local currency-pegged stablecoin market. This move parallels similar initiatives in regions like Japan, Hong Kong, and China, and is considered part of the countries' strategy to maintain their monetary sovereignty in the Web3 era. *This is not investment advice.

With the recent feat, which is unprecedented considering ETH’s multibillion-dollar market cap, other low-cap altcoins are following suit. For investors searching for the best under $1 cryptos to buy today, three projects stand out: Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Hedera (HBAR), and MemeCore (M). All are priced below a dollar, but each has the potential to deliver outsized gains by Q4 2025. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Pepe might be small, but this frog is aiming for giant leaps. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has emerged as one of the most talked-about meme tokens of the year, combining viral energy with real blockchain features. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, LILPEPE is backed by Layer 2 scalability, a sniperbot-resistant ecosystem, and zero buy/sell tax, making it fast, secure, and friendly for traders. The presale has achieved massive success, raising $23 million and selling 14.5 billion tokens. Early investors paid $0.001 at launch and now sit on over 100% unrealized profit as the current stage goes for $0.0021. This means buyers still have a window to get in before exchange listings unlock wider demand. The project features a CertiK audit and a tight vesting schedule to avoid whales from dumping tokens at launch to build confidence. These steps and an ongoing $777k giveaway campaign have enabled LILPEPE to develop a meme coin community that grows quickly. Excitement is also building for its upcoming centralized exchange listings, which could bring even more liquidity and visibility. With meme energy fueling its momentum and real utility supporting long-term growth, analysts believe LILPEPE could deliver 50x to 100x ROI from its presale price, potentially turning early buyers into big winners. For anyone searching the market for the best under $1 cryptos to buy today, Little Pepe is leading the race with both hype and substance. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera is another strong contender under $1, trading around $0.24. Hedera, the enterprise-grade blockchain alternative, processes over 10,000 transactions per second with finality in under five seconds and industry-low transaction fees. Hedera Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The coin consolidates between $0.23 and $0.24, but analysts expect a breakout. Many expect HBAR to rally toward $0.40 in the near term, with some even projecting longer-term highs around $0.90 if momentum and enterprise adoption continue to build. Adoption remains the most significant catalyst. Hedera has already attracted partnerships with global brands such as Google, IBM, and Boeing, expanding into tokenization, supply chain solutions, and carbon credit tracking. With the upcoming spot HBAR ETF approval expected to spark a notable price rally, Hedera is one of the best under $1 cryptos to buy today for investors seeking exposure to real-world adoption and institutional credibility. MemeCore (M) MemeCore shocked the market in July with a 15,000% rally, reaching an all-time high of $1 before correcting. Today, the token trades around $0.39–$0.50, having reclaimed a strong support level that analysts view as a launchpad for the next move. MemeCore Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Market watchers believe that if MemeCore can break above the $0.57 resistance, it could resume its upward climb and even push toward $5, a level that would mark new all-time highs. That represents over a 10x ROI from current levels, with even higher multiples possible if meme mania returns later this year. Despite its volatility, MemeCore has gained a loyal following and remains one of the hottest cultural plays in crypto. For traders comfortable with higher risk, it is one of the best under $1 cryptos to buy today if they’re betting on the meme coin narrative to extend into Q4 2025. Final Take Ethereum’s success has reignited interest in altcoins, and the next wave of big winners may come from the sub-$1 category. Little Pepe , Hedera, and MemeCore each bring something unique, from meme-driven hype to enterprise-grade adoption. But of the three, Little Pepe stands out as the most exciting mix of meme culture and real blockchain utility. With its presale success, community growth, and upcoming listings, it can deliver some of the biggest returns of 2025. If you’re looking for the best under $1 crypto to buy today, Little Pepe is a frontrunner worth serious attention.

Over the past five days, this address deposited a staggering 500,000 SOL, valued at $103 million, to Coinbase. This move, as reported by Lookonchain, immediately sparked discussions about its potential impact on the Solana ecosystem and the broader digital asset market. What Does This Massive Galaxy Digital Wallet Move Mean? When a large holder, often referred to as a “whale,” moves such a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, it naturally raises questions. For the Solana community, understanding the implications of this Galaxy Digital wallet activity is crucial. Potential Selling Pressure: Deposits to exchanges typically precede selling. If these SOL tokens are intended for sale, it could introduce significant selling pressure on Solana’s price, potentially leading to a dip. Strategic Rebalancing: Alternatively, it could be part of a larger portfolio rebalancing strategy by Galaxy Digital, a prominent institutional player in the crypto space. They might be optimizing their holdings or preparing for other investments. Increased Liquidity: Such large deposits also add to the exchange’s liquidity, which can be beneficial for traders, making it easier to buy and sell SOL without significant price slippage. Unpacking the Details: The $103 Million Solana Transfer Let’s break down the specifics of this remarkable transaction. The 500,000 SOL deposit, worth over $103 million at current market prices, occurred in multiple tranches over five days. This gradual approach suggests a calculated strategy rather than a sudden, impulsive dump. Lookonchain, a reputable on-chain analytics platform, identified the address as potentially belonging to Galaxy Digital. While direct confirmation from Galaxy Digital is often private for such operational movements, on-chain analysis provides strong indicators. Understanding these transfers is vital for market participants. It allows for more informed decisions and helps in anticipating potential market shifts. This kind of institutional movement is a key indicator for many professional traders. Why Coinbase? The Choice of Exchange The selection of Coinbase for this significant deposit is also noteworthy. Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Its reputation for security and liquidity makes it a preferred platform for institutional clients. Depositing such a large sum to a major exchange like Coinbase suggests a clear intent to access a broad market. This could be for various reasons: To execute large-volume trades with minimal impact. To convert SOL into other assets, like stablecoins or fiat currency. To facilitate over-the-counter (OTC) deals, which often utilize exchange wallets for settlement. The presence of a significant Galaxy Digital wallet transaction on a platform like Coinbase reinforces the growing institutional interest and activity in the Solana ecosystem. What Are the Broader Market Implications for Solana? This substantial movement from a Galaxy Digital wallet could have several broader implications for Solana’s market trajectory. Solana has seen significant growth, and such large institutional actions are always closely watched. While some might fear a price drop, others view it as a sign of healthy market activity and institutional engagement. It shows that major players are actively managing their positions, contributing to market dynamism. Investors should monitor SOL’s price action closely in the coming days. Look for increased trading volume and any significant price fluctuations that might follow this deposit. This event serves as a reminder of the powerful influence institutional movements can have on crypto prices. The recent deposit of 500,000 SOL from a suspected Galaxy Digital wallet to Coinbase is a significant event that warrants attention. While the exact motives remain speculative, the move underscores the active role institutional players like Galaxy Digital play in shaping the crypto landscape. It highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset markets, where large transfers can influence sentiment and price. Staying informed about such on-chain activities is crucial for anyone navigating the exciting, yet volatile, world of cryptocurrencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Galaxy Digital wallet? A1: A Galaxy Digital wallet refers to a cryptocurrency address or portfolio managed by Galaxy Digital, a prominent financial services and investment management company in the digital asset sector. They handle significant amounts of various cryptocurrencies for institutional clients and their own operations. Q2: Why is a $103 million SOL deposit to Coinbase significant? A2: This deposit is significant due to its massive size ($103 million) and the reputation of the suspected sender, a Galaxy Digital wallet . Large deposits to exchanges often indicate potential selling pressure or strategic rebalancing, which can impact market prices and liquidity. Q3: Does this mean Solana’s price will drop? A3: Not necessarily. While large deposits can lead to selling pressure, they can also be for other purposes like OTC deals or portfolio rebalancing. The market’s reaction will depend on whether these tokens are sold and the overall market sentiment at the time. It’s a factor to monitor, not a guaranteed outcome. Q4: How do on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain identify these transfers? A4: On-chain analytics platforms track public blockchain data. They use various methods, including historical transaction patterns, linked addresses, and known entity tags, to identify and attribute large transfers to specific entities like institutional funds or exchanges. Q5: What should investors do after such a large transfer? A5: Investors should monitor the market closely, particularly Solana’s price and trading volume. It’s a good time to review your own portfolio and investment strategy. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on one transaction; consider the broader market context.

Now that Ethereum has run the prior all-time highs in August, “I think ETH will drop back to its 21-week EMA [exponential moving average],” said ICT Crypto founder Benjamin Cowen on Monday. This could send ETH back to around $3,500 before it recovers and pushes to a new all-time high at the end of the year. “A lot of people will get upset with this idea, but this has been the plan since ETH ‘went home’ in April,” he said, referring to the April dump below $1,500.

According to CoinGlass , six of the past ten Septembers have seen price declines for ETH, with the average loss around 6%. However, ETH corrections have been much larger in bull market years. In September 2017, ETH fell by 21.6% and in the same month in 2021, it lost 12.5%. The asset recovered to notch a new all-time high a few months after, so this month could provide a buy-the-dip opportunity. The longer-term outlook for Ethereum is extremely bullish now that Wall Street has started to embrace the asset . Additionally, whales are still buying, with Arkham Intelligence reporting on Monday that a whale holding $5 billion of Bitcoin just bought $1 billion in ETH and has now staked it all . ‘DeFi Dad’ posted some Ether ‘moon math’ this week, predicting that the asset will command a much higher market capitalization than its current $523 billion. “Based on its position as the most trusted and reliable world ledger for stablecoins, RWAs, DeFi native assets and TradFi’s default choice for tokenization… easy to imagine ETH commanding a market cap of $35 trillion or more by 2032/2034, whenever ETH inevitably catches up to or flips BTC market cap.” Meanwhile, Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano observed that spot Ether ETFs and treasuries bought over 33 times more ETH than was issued by the network in August. ETH purchased in August by entity: – ETH ETFs: ~860,000 ETH – ETH treasury companies: ~1.7 million ETH Newly net issued ETH in August: ~76,709 ETH The ETH ETFs and treasuries bought over 33x more ETH than was net issued by the network in August. Accelerate! — sassal.eth/acc (@sassal0x) August 31, 2025 ETH Price Retreats Despite these clearly bullish long-term prospects, weak retail hands keep selling the asset. Ether has retreated again today, falling from an intraday high of $4,480 to a low of $4,250 in late trading on Monday. ETH had recovered to reach $4,350 during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session, but it has been printing lower highs and lower lows for the past week as the downtrend continues.

This move involved selling a large amount of Bitcoin (BTC) to acquire Ethereum (ETH) over a concentrated period. Such large-scale transactions by influential holders often capture the attention of the wider crypto community, signaling potential shifts in market sentiment or investment strategies. Unpacking the Crypto Whale BTC to ETH Transaction Over the past four days, an anonymous whale made headlines by selling 425 BTC and subsequently purchasing 10,567 ETH. These transactions collectively amounted to approximately $46.5 million, according to data reported by Lookonchain. This significant crypto whale BTC to ETH conversion represents a substantial reallocation of digital assets by a single, powerful investor. A ‘whale’ in the crypto world is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of cryptocurrency. Their trading activities can have a noticeable impact on market prices due to the sheer volume of their transactions. When a whale moves such a considerable sum from one major asset to another, it naturally sparks curiosity and analysis among market participants. BTC Sold: 425 Bitcoin ETH Purchased: 10,567 Ethereum Approximate Value: $46.5 million Timeframe: Over four days Why Does This Crypto Whale BTC to ETH Move Matter? The decision by a crypto whale BTC to ETH conversion is more than just a simple trade; it can be interpreted as a strategic signal. Investors often scrutinize whale movements for insights into potential market trends or the perceived strength of different assets. This particular swap from Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, to Ethereum, the second largest, suggests a deliberate shift in investment focus. Several factors might motivate such a move. The whale could be: Diversifying their portfolio: Reducing exposure to one asset to balance risk. Anticipating Ethereum’s growth: Believing ETH has stronger short-to-medium term growth potential, perhaps due to upcoming network upgrades or the potential approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs. Reacting to market sentiment: Aligning their holdings with a broader bullish outlook on Ethereum. Regardless of the exact motivation, such a high-value transaction can influence market psychology. It suggests confidence in Ethereum’s future trajectory among some large holders, prompting other investors to reconsider their own positions. The Potential Market Impact of a Crypto Whale BTC to ETH Shift When a substantial crypto whale BTC to ETH trade occurs, it can have ripple effects across the market. The sale of 425 BTC, while significant, is generally absorbed by Bitcoin’s vast liquidity. However, the purchase of 10,567 ETH can add buying pressure to Ethereum, potentially contributing to price appreciation if other factors align. It is crucial to remember that while whale movements are interesting, they do not dictate the entire market. The crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, technological developments, and broader investor sentiment. However, these large transactions do provide a fascinating glimpse into the strategies of major players. What can individual investors learn from this? Stay informed: Monitor on-chain data and market reports. Do your own research: Do not solely base investment decisions on whale movements. Consider long-term strategy: Focus on your own financial goals rather than reacting to every large trade. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Strategic Crypto Reallocation The recent crypto whale BTC to ETH shift, involving $46.5 million, underscores the dynamic nature of the digital asset landscape. It highlights how major investors continuously re-evaluate their positions based on evolving market conditions and future expectations.

On Friday, these so-called patient holders offloaded 97,000 BTC (nearly $3 billion), marking the largest single-day long-term holder sell-off of the year, which accounts for the bulk of the recent increase in spending activity, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The 14-day moving average of coins spent by long-term holders has jumped to nearly 25,000 BTC, the highest since January. Glassnode defines long-term holders as those with a history of owning coins for over 155 days. Bitcoin's price fell by over 3.7% to $108,000 on Friday and continued to decline to $107,400 early Monday. As of the time of writing, the cryptocurrency was trading at $103,330, still down 16% from its record high of $124,429, according to CoinDesk data. Note that the profit-taking operation is still notably slower than the spikes observed in late 2024. What's driving the profit-taking? Long-term holders, including wallets that have been dormant for years, have been consistently selling since bitcoin broke above $100,000 early this year. One explanation for this profit-taking can be rooted in investor psychology. Think of it this way: how many assets in the world trade at $100K per piece? Perhaps very few that you can quickly count on your fingers. Therefore, it is logical for investors to feel that $ 100,000 per BTC is too expensive, prompting them to take profits. It also means that the market will likely take time to adjust to $100K as the new normal for BTC. We could continue to see broad range trading around the six-figure price mark for some time, allowing investors to acclimatize to this elevated valuation. Read more: ‘OP_CAT Isn’t My Invention.

This vision is now taking shape in South Korea, where a significant proposal could redefine the landscape of digital finance. Kim Byung-kee, the influential floor leader of South Korea’s ruling Democratic Party, has recently championed a groundbreaking idea: the issuance of bank-led stablecoins . Why Embrace Bank-Led Stablecoins? Understanding the Rationale Kim Byung-kee’s proposal stems from a clear concern for consumer protection and market stability. He argues that it is inherently risky for cryptocurrency exchanges to issue their own financial products, a sentiment echoed by many regulators globally. This perspective highlights the potential for conflicts of interest and systemic vulnerabilities when platforms that facilitate trading also control the underlying assets’ stability. Consequently, the call for bank-led stablecoins is a strategic move to mitigate these risks. By placing the issuance responsibility with established financial institutions, the aim is to leverage their existing regulatory frameworks, robust compliance procedures, and long-standing reputation for financial oversight. This approach seeks to instill greater confidence in the digital asset space, offering users a more secure alternative. The Vision: How Would Bank-Led Stablecoins Function? The core of Kim’s proposal involves the formation of bank-led consortiums. These consortiums would not be exclusive to banks but would also include cryptocurrency exchanges and other relevant financial institutions. This collaborative model aims to combine the strengths of both traditional finance and the innovative crypto sector. Here’s a breakdown of how this might work: Banks as Issuers: Traditional banks, with their deep experience in asset management and regulatory compliance, would primarily be responsible for issuing the stablecoins. They would back these digital assets with reserves held in traditional fiat currencies, ensuring a 1:1 peg. Exchanges as Distributors: Cryptocurrency exchanges would play a crucial role in distributing these bank-led stablecoins , making them accessible to a wider user base. They would integrate these stablecoins into their trading platforms, offering liquidity and utility. Shared Oversight: The consortium structure would foster shared responsibility and oversight, ensuring transparency and accountability across all participating entities. This collaborative effort could lead to a more resilient and trustworthy stablecoin ecosystem. The Impact of Bank-Led Stablecoins: Benefits and Hurdles The transition to bank-led stablecoins could bring a multitude of benefits to the South Korean crypto market. Firstly, it would significantly enhance trust among retail and institutional investors, potentially leading to broader adoption of digital assets. Regulatory clarity would also improve, providing a more stable environment for innovation. Moreover, this model could reduce systemic risks associated with single points of failure in the current stablecoin landscape. However, the path is not without its challenges. Implementing such a consortium requires complex coordination between diverse entities, demanding significant technological integration and regulatory harmonization. Ensuring that innovation is not stifled while maintaining strict oversight will be a delicate balancing act. Shaping South Korea’s Digital Future with Bank-Led Stablecoins This bold move by South Korea’s ruling party leader signals a proactive approach to crypto regulation. By advocating for bank-led stablecoins , the nation is positioning itself at the forefront of creating a more secure and integrated digital economy. This could set a significant precedent for other countries grappling with how to effectively regulate and incorporate digital assets into their financial systems. The proposal highlights a growing recognition among policymakers that stablecoins, while offering immense potential, require robust frameworks to protect consumers and maintain financial stability. South Korea’s initiative could pave the way for a new era of responsible crypto innovation, fostering a safer environment for digital asset growth. In summary, Kim Byung-kee’s call for bank-led stablecoins represents a pivotal moment for South Korea’s cryptocurrency landscape. It’s a strategic vision that prioritizes security, stability, and broad adoption by merging the strengths of traditional finance with the dynamism of the digital asset world. This could truly be a game-changer for the future of digital currency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or a commodity like gold. They aim to offer the benefits of cryptocurrencies, such as fast transactions and global reach, without the price volatility often associated with assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Why are bank-led stablecoins being proposed in South Korea? The proposal for bank-led stablecoins is primarily driven by concerns over the risks associated with cryptocurrency exchanges issuing their own financial products. By involving traditional banks, the aim is to enhance stability, consumer protection, and regulatory oversight, leveraging banks’ established financial infrastructure and compliance. Who would be involved in these stablecoin consortiums? These consortiums would be led by traditional banks but would also include cryptocurrency exchanges and other relevant financial institutions. This collaborative model seeks to combine the regulatory expertise of banks with the technological innovation and market reach of crypto platforms.

At the same time, Coinbase and OKX are rolling out dedicated crypto services for self-managed superannuation funds in Australia, opening retirement savings to wider crypto exposure. Overall, real estate and retirement systems in major markets are increasingly integrating digital assets. RAK Properties Embraces Crypto Payments RAK Properties, one of the largest publicly traded real estate companies in Ras Al Khaimah, announced that it will begin accepting cryptocurrency for international property transactions. This is yet another milestone in the UAE’s push toward embracing digital assets. The company confirmed on Monday that buyers will be able to use Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether’s USDT, and other cryptocurrencies as payment methods. To facilitate the process, RAK Properties partnered with Hubpay, a global payments platform headquartered in the region. Hubpay will handle the conversion of digital assets into the UAE dirham before depositing the equivalent fiat into the company’s accounts. This system ensures compliance and stability while also giving customers flexibility in how they choose to transact. RAK Properties Chief Financial Officer Rahul Jogani said that by enabling the use of digital assets, the company is engaging with a new ecosystem of digitally savvy and investment-oriented customers. The decision comes as crypto adoption across the United Arab Emirates is accelerating. Ras Al Khaimah, the fourth-largest emirate in the country, has been looking to strengthen its appeal to international investors, and integrating cryptocurrency payments into real estate transactions could serve as a major draw. RAK Properties itself has been publicly listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange since 2005 and currently holds a market cap of 4.7 billion dirhams, or roughly $1.3 billion. The company is set for expansion in 2025 with 12 new projects in the pipeline. In terms of performance, it posted strong results last year, with net profit rising 39% year-over-year to 281 million dirhams in 2024 compared to 202 million dirhams the year before. More broadly, the UAE is working hard to position itself as one of the most progressive jurisdictions for digital assets, and wants to attract both Web3 startups and institutional players. Analysts see the sector becoming one of the country’s largest industries within the next five years. (Source: Chainalysis ) According to Chase Ergen of DeFi Technologies, crypto could soon be the UAE’s second-largest sector. Chainalysis data also showed that retail crypto transactions in the UAE surged by over 75% year-over-year as of June 2024, alongside steady growth across all transaction size brackets. Exchanges Push Crypto into Aussie Retirement Funds Meanwhile, Coinbase and OKX are expanding their reach in Australia by launching services tailored for self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs). These funds make up around a quarter of Australia’s retirement savings system, and are a key gateway for crypto adoption in the country. While Australians have been able to hold digital assets in SMSFs for several years, the exchanges are now packaging that access into dedicated offerings that are designed to make the process more seamless. Instead of leaving individuals to navigate the complexities of setting up structures, custody, and audit requirements on their own, Coinbase and OKX are providing integrated services. These include referrals to accountants and law firms, as well as custody and record-keeping solutions that meet compliance standards. Allocation of assets (Source: Australian Tax Office ) According to the Australian Tax Office , SMSFs held A$1.7 billion (US$1.1 billion) in digital assets in March of 2025, which was a sevenfold increase since 2021. Coinbase also reported that more than 500 investors already joined the waiting list for its SMSF service, with most intending to allocate up to A$100,000 in crypto. OKX launched its service in June, and said that demand exceeded expectations. The move lowers barriers for mainstream investors and is one of the first organized pushes by major exchanges to tap into Australia’s retirement market, which is one of the largest globally on a per-capita basis. Australia’s growing embrace of crypto in retirement funds coincides with shifting attitudes in other major economies. In the United States, Fidelity Investments became the first major firm to introduce crypto exposure in retirement plans with its Bitcoin 401(k) option in 2022. The product attracted some resistance from the Department of Labor, which warned plan sponsors to be cautious with crypto allocations. That stance reversed in May of 2025 when the Labor Department rescinded its earlier guidance, giving plan sponsors greater flexibility. Additionally, on Aug/ 7, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors.” The order directed regulators to update retirement-plan rules, allowing for alternative assets like cryptocurrencies to be included in 401(k)s. Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors The executive order drew praise and criticism . Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer argued that the government should not dictate retirement investment choices and praised the increased flexibility for savers.

Lately, the Indian Rupee has found itself in a precarious position, teetering on the edge of a record low against the mighty US Dollar. This isn’t just a number on a screen; it’s a stark indicator of underlying economic pressures, particularly the bite of steep US tariffs, which can have ripple effects even on the broader financial landscape, influencing investor sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Understanding these macroeconomic shifts is vital for any investor navigating today’s interconnected markets. Indian Rupee Crisis: A Deep Dive into Record Lows The Indian Rupee’s recent performance has been a cause for significant concern among policymakers, businesses, and citizens alike. The currency has been steadily losing ground, inching closer to an all-time low against the US Dollar. This trend is not isolated but a symptom of various domestic and international pressures converging. A weaker rupee means that more rupees are required to buy one US Dollar, making imports more expensive and potentially fueling inflation. For a developing economy like India, heavily reliant on imported goods such as crude oil, this can have a cascading effect across all sectors. Historically, the Indian Rupee has faced periods of volatility, often influenced by global economic slowdowns, capital outflows, and geopolitical tensions. However, the current situation is compounded by specific trade-related issues that directly impact India’s economic stability. The proximity to a record low is a clear warning sign, signaling a need for careful economic management and strategic policy interventions to stabilize the currency and protect the economy from further shocks. Unpacking the Force: How US Tariffs Bite India’s Economy At the heart of the Indian Rupee’s woes are the steep US Tariffs imposed on various Indian products. These tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, are designed to make foreign products more expensive in the US market, thereby encouraging domestic production. However, for exporting nations like India, they translate into reduced competitiveness and lower demand for their goods. The impact is multi-faceted: Reduced Export Earnings: Indian exporters find it harder to sell their products in the US, leading to a decline in export revenues. This directly impacts India’s trade balance and foreign exchange reserves. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can force companies to rethink their global supply chains, potentially diverting orders away from Indian manufacturers. Investment Uncertainty: Businesses planning to invest in export-oriented sectors in India might reconsider due to the unpredictable nature of trade policies and the risk of future tariffs. Sector-Specific Pain: Industries such as steel, aluminum, and certain agricultural products, which have been targets of US tariffs, face significant challenges, including reduced production and job losses. The cumulative effect of these tariffs creates a challenging environment for India’s economy, putting downward pressure on the rupee as foreign currency inflows diminish and the trade deficit potentially widens. It’s a classic example of how protectionist measures in one major economy can create significant economic headwinds for others. The Ripple Effect: Understanding Rupee Depreciation When the Rupee Depreciation occurs, its effects are felt far and wide, impacting everything from daily household budgets to the balance sheets of multinational corporations. It’s not just an abstract economic concept; it has tangible consequences for every Indian citizen and business. What Does a Weaker Rupee Mean for Your Wallet? A depreciating rupee has several direct implications for consumers: Higher Import Costs: Goods imported into India, such as electronics, luxury items, and most critically, crude oil, become more expensive. Since India imports a significant portion of its energy needs, a weaker rupee directly translates to higher fuel prices, which in turn drives up transportation costs for all goods. Inflationary Pressure: Increased import costs often lead to higher prices for a wide range of products, contributing to inflation. This erodes the purchasing power of consumers, making daily necessities more expensive. Impact on Foreign Travel and Education: For those planning to travel abroad or send their children for overseas education, a weaker rupee means spending more Indian currency to acquire the necessary foreign exchange. Foreign Debt Burden: Indian companies or the government that have borrowed in foreign currencies find their repayment obligations increasing in rupee terms, adding stress to their financial health. While exporters might see a marginal benefit as their products become cheaper for foreign buyers, the overall negative impact of uncontrolled rupee depreciation often outweighs these advantages, especially in an economy heavily reliant on imports. Navigating the Storm: Global Trade Dynamics and India’s Position The current challenges faced by the Indian Rupee are not entirely isolated but are part of a larger narrative of shifting Global Trade dynamics. The world has witnessed an increase in protectionist tendencies, with major economies engaging in trade disputes and imposing tariffs on each other’s goods. This environment of uncertainty and trade friction creates a challenging backdrop for all trading nations, including India. Is India Caught in a Wider Global Trade War? India, as a significant player in global commerce, finds itself navigating complex trade relationships. While not directly involved in a full-blown trade war like some other nations, it is certainly impacted by the fallout. The US tariffs, for instance, are part of a broader strategy that has affected many countries, creating a domino effect where trade flows are redirected and global supply chains are re-evaluated. India’s response to these global trade dynamics involves a mix of diplomatic efforts and strategic policy adjustments. The government might explore new trade agreements with other nations, diversify its export markets, and focus on boosting domestic manufacturing to reduce reliance on imports. However, these are long-term strategies, and the immediate challenge remains managing the currency’s stability amidst external pressures. Beyond the Headlines: The Wider Economic Impact on India The immediate concerns about the Indian Rupee and US Tariffs quickly translate into a broader Economic Impact on India’s growth trajectory and future prospects. This impact goes beyond just trade figures and currency valuations, touching various facets of the economy. What Are the Long-Term Economic Impacts for India? The long-term economic consequences of persistent currency weakness and trade tensions can be significant: Economic Area Impact of Rupee Depreciation & Tariffs Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Uncertainty can deter foreign investors, slowing down capital inflows essential for growth. Inflation Sustained import cost increases can lead to higher consumer prices, eroding purchasing power. Government Finances Higher import bills for essential goods (like oil) can strain government budgets, affecting public spending. Job Market Export-oriented industries facing reduced demand might scale back operations, leading to job losses or slower job creation. Consumer Sentiment Rising prices and economic uncertainty can dampen consumer confidence, leading to reduced spending. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach, including fiscal prudence, monetary policy adjustments, and proactive trade diplomacy. While the immediate outlook might seem challenging, India’s inherent economic strengths and potential for growth offer resilience. The focus will be on converting these challenges into opportunities for domestic innovation and self-reliance. Actionable Insights and The Road Ahead For businesses and individuals alike, understanding the implications of a weakening Indian Rupee and the ongoing trade dynamics is crucial. While governments work on macroeconomic solutions, there are practical steps that can be considered: For Businesses: Explore hedging strategies to mitigate currency risks, diversify export markets beyond traditionally tariff-prone regions, and focus on value-added exports to improve competitiveness. Investing in domestic supply chains can also reduce reliance on potentially expensive imports. For Individuals: Review personal budgets, especially for discretionary spending on imported goods. Consider diversifying investment portfolios, potentially including assets that offer a hedge against inflation or currency depreciation, while always exercising caution and consulting financial advisors. For Policymakers: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plays a critical role in managing currency stability through monetary policy tools, such as interest rate adjustments and foreign exchange market interventions. The government must also focus on fiscal consolidation, boosting domestic manufacturing, and engaging in constructive trade negotiations to alleviate external pressures. The current scenario serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of the global economy. A tariff imposed by one nation can create a ripple effect that destabilizes currencies and impacts economies thousands of miles away. India’s ability to navigate this complex landscape will depend on robust policy responses, resilient domestic markets, and strategic engagement on the global stage. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for India’s Economy The Indian Rupee teetering near a record low, largely influenced by the biting impact of US Tariffs , signals a critical juncture for India’s economy. This situation highlights the profound consequences of protectionist trade policies on global financial stability and the domestic well-being of nations. The ensuing Rupee Depreciation reverberates through every aspect of life, from increased inflation to a higher cost of living and doing business. Navigating the complexities of current Global Trade dynamics requires strategic foresight and adaptability from both the government and the private sector. The broader Economic Impact underscores the urgent need for comprehensive policies that bolster domestic resilience, diversify trade relationships, and stabilize the currency. While challenges are significant, they also present an opportunity for India to strengthen its economic foundations and foster greater self-reliance in a rapidly changing global environment. The path ahead demands vigilance, innovation, and a collaborative approach to ensure sustained growth and stability.

An app that lets you mine Bitcoin on your phone without any hardware? It sounded a bit exaggerated. But after six months of daily testing, I can tell you: it really works. As a UK-registered, green cloud mining platform, SolMining has gradually amassed over 3 million users worldwide over the past few years. So, after six months of actual use, what’s it like? This article will provide you with a hands-on review. What is the SolMining app? SolMining is a digital mining platform where users can earn Bitcoin rewards by purchasing virtual mining rigs within the app. There’s no need to purchase physical mining rigs or learn any mining techniques—everything is handled by their data centers, and you control everything from your phone. 1. App Installation and Registration Experience The SolMining app is available on both Android and iOS platforms. After downloading and installing, the registration process is very simple: Register an account using your email address. 2. New users receive $15 in trial computing power, with no entry fee. The entire process takes less than 5 minutes, making it ideal for beginners. Contract Selection and Investment Flexibility SolMining offers a variety of contract options, ranging from 1 to 40 days, with flexible amounts: Short-term contracts: Suitable for new users looking to test the waters, offering flexible capital management and rapid returns; Medium- to long-term contracts: Suitable for users seeking stable returns, with a slightly longer principal return period but more substantial rewards. Compared to other contracts with lock-up periods of six months or even a year, SolMining’s 1-40 day mechanism balances security and liquidity. III. Revenue Settlement and Fund Security After six months of actual use, the app’s revenue experience can be described as stable and transparent: Daily Settlement: Rewards are automatically distributed daily at UK time and deposited directly into your wallet; Principal Protection: Upon contract expiration, the initial principal is fully returned; Security Measures: Using separate hot and cold wallets and multi-signature technology, user funds and returns are managed separately. This eliminates the need for users to worry about hardware, maintenance, and electricity costs, significantly reducing financial risk. IV. Green Energy and Compliance Assurance Unlike traditional mining farms, SolMining ‘s data centers primarily rely on solar, hydro, and wind power, and regularly publish ESG reports, aligning with green and sustainable development principles. Furthermore, the platform is registered in the UK, with a clear compliance framework, which is crucial for investors concerned with legality and transparency. V. 6-Month Real-World Experience Summary After six months of real-world use, I’ve found the following advantages and disadvantages of SolMining: Pros: Simple operation, even beginners can get started in just five minutes; Flexible contract options to suit different budgets; Daily automatic settlement and transparent returns; UK-registered, highly compliant; Powered by green energy, a plus for environmental protection. VI. Conclusion For users who want to experience cryptocurrency mining but don’t want to spend a fortune on mining equipment or incur high electricity bills, the SolMining app provides a relatively safe, transparent, and environmentally friendly gateway to cloud mining. My six-month experience shows that SolMining is suitable for investors who want to maintain liquidity while seeking stable returns. If you’re looking for a compliant, green, and easy-to-use cloud mining platform, SolMining is worth a try.

An Experienced Name Weighs In",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-next-target-for-xrp-cardano-ada-and-dogecoin-doge-prices-an-experienced-name-weighs-in/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez evaluated the latest developments in the market and drew attention to critical levels for prominent altcoins. Martinez noted that Dogecoin (DOGE) has defended the $0.208 support level five times in the recent period, saying that this level is critical for the price’s subsequent movement. On the XRP side, technical indicators are showing positive signals. Martinez, noting that the TD Sequential indicator is giving consecutive buy signals, explained XRP's short-term roadmap as follows: maintaining $2.70 as support, breaking the $2.90 level, and then targeting $3.70. The $28 level is critical for Chainlink (LINK) investors. Martinez stated that LINK needs to reclaim this level as support, otherwise the price could drop to as low as $16. Related News: Cardano (ADA) Founder Charles Hoskinson Makes Statement About ADA's Future Stating that the Sei (SEI) is trading in a falling wedge formation, Martinez predicted that a possible breakout could push the price up 16% to the $0.34 level. Martinez stated that the $0.88 level must be surpassed for Cardano (ADA), after which the price can target $1.20. Finally, Martinez stated that $0.58 is a support level to watch for Mantle (MNT), and that the token was rejected again at the upper limit of the channel. *This is not investment advice.

SOL price is now recovering higher and might aim for a move above the $205 resistance zone. SOL price started a recovery wave after it tested the $195 zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $205 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $201 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $205 resistance zone. Solana Price Eyes Steady Recovery Solana price extended losses after there was a close below $205, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL traded below the $200 and $195 support levels to enter a short-term bearish zone. A low was formed at $194 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. The price surpassed the $198 and $200 resistance levels. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $218 swing high to the $194 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $201 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $205 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $202 level. The next major resistance is near the $205 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $218 swing high to the $194 low. The main resistance could be $209. A successful close above the $209 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $218. Any more gains might send the price toward the $225 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $205 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $200 zone. The first major support is near the $195 level. A break below the $195 level might send the price toward the $188 support zone. If there is a close below the $188 support, the price could decline toward the $184 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $200 and $195.

Per a local report on Tuesday, the initiative will share crypto transactions by non-residents on local exchanges such as Upbit and Bithumb, with countries worldwide. Additionally, the transaction history of domestic investors on overseas exchanges will be shared with the tax department. South Korea Officially Joins OECD’s Crypto Reporting Framework In November 2023, South Korea joined a group of 48 nations to implement the international reporting framework on digital assets. Dubbed the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), the structure would facilitate the automatic exchange of tax information on transactions involving crypto in a standardized manner. The Korean Ministry of Economy and Finance has officially signed an agreement for CARF implementation at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Tuesday report said. “The purpose is to establish detailed regulations for implementing the Virtual Asset Information Exchange Agreement,” a Ministry official said. Ministry to Issue Administrative Notice This Month The Ministry is planning to issue an administrative notice this month, detailing the regulations implementation for the CARF. Tax authorities, including the UK, Germany, and Japan, are pursuing the framework to prevent offshore tax evasion as well as increase tax transparency through crypto. With the system, investors can expect a big clampdown on anonymous trading. Besides, Upbit and Bithumb may face heavy compliance headwinds short term and possible volume dips as privacy-driven users rotate out. This is because, domestic crypto operators are required to report personal information and transaction information of residents of partner countries, effective next year. Further, each country will upload this information to the OECD system to track the overseas crypto transaction history. The information sharing system will start in 2027, however, transaction records will begin next year, the report added. “Virtual asset information sharing is governed by international agreements,” a Ministry official said, adding that “It is a separate matter from taxation.” The post South Korea to Share Crypto Transactions Data Globally – Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|crypto transactions|South Korea,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-02 05:48:35

They have risen quickly with meme coin mania to vie for top positions in this budding sector. While Dogecoin has since maintained its position as the foremost and largest meme coin, Shiba Inu has had a harder time maintaining its hold on second place. Now, it has fallen behind PEPE in a major metric. Shiba Inu Drops Behind PEPE In Social Activity Shiba Inu marketing lead LUCIE shared an update on the social activity of the top meme coins, and it revealed a shocking development. According to the report, Shiba Inu has fallen reasonably behind PEPE in this major metric, something that often directly affects the performance of meme coins as their movements are largely hype-based. In the screenshot, it shows Dogecoin is still in the lead by a large margin with 3.6 million interactions across 37,800 engaged posts. Then behind Dogecoin is the much younger PEPE meme coi,n coming in hot with 1.5 million interactions spread across 22,800 posts. Shiba Inu is in third place with fewer than 1 million interactions, showing a large gap between the two . With 791,600 interactions across 15,600 posts, it shows how much Shiba Inu has declined in popularity among meme coin investors. Other notable appearances here are from the TRUMP meme coin, coming in at fourth place. PUMP, from the Pump Fun team, is surprisingly ahead of BONK, kicking the latter out of the top 5 in terms of social activity. Others, such as PENGU , FARTCOIN, GOAT, and GIGA, all appear on the list in descending order. Is There A Flippening Coming? While the Shiba Inu market cap remains above $7 billion, putting it ahead of PEPE’s $4 billion, the latter seems to be outperforming in other areas. Besides social activity, PEPE has also managed to surpass Shiba Inu in terms of trading volume. Data from the CoinGecko website shows an over $295 million 24-hour trading volume for PEPE. In contrast, the Shiba Inu trading volume came in at just over $120 million for the same time period. However, another area where Shiba Inu has continued to dominate is in terms of total holder count. The total SHIB holders, according to Etherscan, have crossed 1.5 million, whereas the total number of PEPE holders sits just above 482,000 at the time of writing.",Dogecoin|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|Pepe|PEPE news|PEPE price|PEPEUSD|PEPEUSDT|shib|Shiba Inu|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|PEPE|DOGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 06:00:09

Prices swing wildly, new projects launch daily, and hype cycles move faster than most can keep up with. Yet history shows that those who thrive in this environment aren’t the ones chasing every sudden move – they’re the ones who know how to wait. Smart money recognizes this truth, and it’s why many early investors who showed patience are now turning their attention toward emerging plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has already rewarded its earliest supporters with outsized returns. Patience is what separates winners from the crowd in crypto. While the temptation to jump into every pump or sell during a dip is strong, the ability to stay calm often determines long-term success. The market thrives on extremes, with fear and greed pulling investors in opposite directions. Learning to resist those emotions is the foundation of a strong strategy. Resisting FOMO and FUD FOMO, the fear of missing out, has burned countless investors who rushed into tokens at their peak. On the flip side, FUD – fear, uncertainty, and doubt – has pushed people to sell solid holdings at a loss during market crashes. Both traps can devastate a portfolio. Patience allows investors to step back, remember their long-term goals, and ride out the storms rather than chasing short-term noise. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Getting Attention This lesson is playing out right now with MAGACOIN FINANCE, where patient early adopters are seeing remarkable results. Unlike many meme-driven tokens, this project is steadily building momentum through strong tokenomics , community growth, and expanding utility . Early-stage buyers are already reporting gains that make headlines look small, and analysts suggest that smart money entering now could still see major upside. In fact, some forecasts point to returns that could multiply an investment by 50x if the trend continues – a reminder of how waiting for the right moment can pay off in crypto. The Power of Long-Term Thinking Patience isn’t only about resisting emotion – it’s also about research and conviction. By taking time to study a project’s team, technology, use case, and community, investors build confidence that helps them hold through volatility. Without that conviction, it’s easy to get shaken out during the next correction. Long-term thinking also powers strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA), which spreads risk across time and smooths out entry prices. Compounding Over Time The real magic of patience lies in compounding. Selling early might lock in small wins, but holding a strong asset for years allows exponential growth to unfold. Just as traditional investors repeat the mantra “time in the market beats timing the market,” crypto investors who master this mindset are best positioned to see their wealth grow. Conclusion The fast-moving nature of crypto often tricks people into thinking speed is the secret to success. In reality, slowing down and trusting a long-term plan gives investors the edge. Whether it’s avoiding emotional trades, committing to steady accumulation, or recognizing opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, patience is the skill that ultimately pays off.

Recently, a significant announcement from the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit has caught the attention of many investors. Upbit has officially updated the ARKM circulating supply schedule for Arkham (ARKM) tokens. This change, made at the direct request of the Arkham project team, is more than just a minor adjustment; it holds important implications for the token’s market dynamics and investor sentiment. Understanding these updates is crucial for anyone involved with ARKM or interested in tokenomics transparency. What Exactly Changed with the ARKM Circulating Supply? Upbit’s announcement details a revised schedule for the release of Arkham (ARKM) tokens into the market. Originally, there was a specific plan for how and when new ARKM tokens would become available. However, the project team requested a modification to this existing schedule. This typically involves adjusting the timing or the amount of tokens released at various intervals. Previous Schedule: Had a defined roadmap for token distribution. New Schedule: Reflects the updated plan for ARKM token availability. Key Impact: Directly influences the total number of ARKM tokens accessible for trading and investment at any given time. These adjustments can stem from various strategic decisions by the project team, aiming to optimize market stability or align with new development milestones. Keeping an eye on the ARKM circulating supply is essential for gauging the token’s scarcity and potential value fluctuations. Why Did Arkham Request This Update to its ARKM Circulating Supply? Project teams often revise their token release schedules for several strategic reasons. Arkham’s request to Upbit likely stems from a desire to better manage their token’s economic model, known as tokenomics. This could involve: Market Stability: Preventing large influxes of tokens that might depress prices. Development Milestones: Tying token releases to specific project achievements or adoption rates. Strategic Partnerships: Allocating tokens for new collaborations or ecosystem growth. Community Feedback: Responding to insights from their investor base. Such adjustments are not uncommon in the dynamic crypto space. They reflect a project’s adaptability and commitment to long-term sustainability. The precise reasons behind Arkham’s decision would typically be elaborated upon by the project team themselves, often through official channels or detailed reports. Understanding the “why” behind changes to the ARKM circulating supply helps investors grasp the project’s strategic direction. How Does This Affect ARKM Investors and the Broader Market? Changes to a token’s circulating supply schedule can have significant ripple effects. For ARKM investors, this update could mean several things: Potential Benefits: Reduced Selling Pressure: If the update delays or reduces future token releases, it could alleviate potential selling pressure, supporting price stability. Increased Scarcity: A slower release schedule might create a perception of greater scarcity, potentially boosting demand. Enhanced Trust: Transparency from the project team and exchange regarding tokenomics can build investor confidence. Potential Challenges: Uncertainty: Any change can introduce short-term market uncertainty as investors digest the news. Liquidity Concerns: If fewer tokens are released, it could impact overall market liquidity, though this is less common with schedule adjustments. The broader crypto market often reacts to such news with increased trading volume and price volatility for the affected asset. Monitoring the immediate market reaction to the updated ARKM circulating supply is crucial for traders. What Should ARKM Holders Consider Following This Supply Update? For current and prospective ARKM holders, this announcement underscores the importance of due diligence.

This intriguing possibility is now on the table, thanks to a bold new initiative within the Ethereum community. A prominent community foundation has recently unveiled a proposal to transform burned ETH into a brand-new digital token known as the Ethereum BETH token . This isn’t just a theoretical concept; it’s a move designed to unlock new dimensions of value and utility within the Ethereum ecosystem. What Exactly is the Ethereum BETH Token Proposal? The proposal centers on tokenizing the very act of ‘proof-of-burn’ itself. Essentially, for every unit of ETH that is permanently destroyed or ‘burned’ from circulation – a process integral to Ethereum’s economic model – a corresponding Ethereum BETH token would be minted. This innovative approach aims to make an otherwise inaccessible value stream both tradable and trackable on the blockchain. The core principle is straightforward: BETH would maintain a one-to-one conversion value with the burned ETH it represents. This means that if 1 ETH is burned, 1 BETH could theoretically be created, directly reflecting that locked value. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin has highlighted the significant potential of such a system, suggesting it could enable new revenue streams derived solely from the burning process. Why Tokenize Burned ETH? Unlocking New Value Currently, burned ETH is gone forever, removed from the supply. By tokenizing it, BETH would become a liquid asset that users could buy, sell, or trade on various decentralized exchanges. This introduces a new layer of financial activity. Tradability: The Ethereum BETH token would become a liquid asset that users could buy, sell, or trade, introducing new financial activity. Trackability: Each BETH token would represent a verifiable unit of burned ETH, allowing for transparent tracking and fostering greater trust in Ethereum’s deflationary mechanics. Revenue Generation: As Joseph Lubin noted, this system could open doors for generating revenue directly from the burning process through staking, lending, or other DeFi protocols. Enhanced Utility: BETH could lead to new applications and use cases within the DeFi landscape, further integrating burned ETH into the broader blockchain economy. Understanding Ethereum’s Burning Mechanism (EIP-1559) To fully grasp the significance of the Ethereum BETH token proposal, it’s helpful to recall Ethereum’s existing burning mechanism. Implemented with the EIP-1559 upgrade in August 2021, a portion of transaction fees is ‘burned’ rather than going entirely to miners. This process reduces the overall supply of ETH, aiming to make the asset more scarce and potentially more valuable over time. The burning mechanism serves a dual purpose: it manages network congestion by dynamically adjusting base fees and introduces a deflationary pressure on ETH supply. The BETH proposal builds directly on this foundation, seeking to extract new utility from this already established and crucial part of the network’s design. Potential Challenges and the Road Ahead for Ethereum BETH Token While the vision for the Ethereum BETH token is compelling, implementing such a transformative initiative comes with its own set of considerations. Implementation Complexity: Integrating a new token seamlessly with Ethereum’s existing infrastructure will require careful planning, technical expertise, and robust security measures. Community Consensus: Achieving broad community agreement will be vital in a decentralized network. Open discussions and iterations are expected as the proposal progresses. Economic Impact: Thorough analysis is needed to understand the long-term economic effects on ETH’s value and the broader DeFi ecosystem, especially regarding perceptions of scarcity. Regulatory Clarity: As with any new crypto asset, navigating potential regulatory implications will be crucial for widespread adoption and legal certainty. Conclusion The proposal to tokenize burned ETH into an Ethereum BETH token represents a truly innovative step for the Ethereum community. By converting a currently inert value – permanently removed ETH – into a dynamic, tradable asset, this initiative has the potential to reshape how we perceive and interact with Ethereum’s economic fundamentals. It could unlock new financial opportunities, enhance transparency, and further solidify Ethereum’s position as a hub for blockchain innovation. As the community continues to discuss and refine this groundbreaking idea, the future of burned ETH looks increasingly bright and, indeed, tradable. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the main idea behind the Ethereum BETH token proposal? The main idea is to tokenize ETH that has been permanently removed from circulation (burned ETH) into a new, tradable asset called BETH. This makes the value represented by burned ETH accessible and usable. 2. How would BETH relate to burned ETH? Under the proposal, BETH would have a one-to-one conversion value with burned ETH. For every unit of ETH burned, a corresponding BETH token could be minted. 3. What are the potential benefits of tokenizing burned ETH? Key benefits include making burned ETH tradable and trackable, potentially creating new revenue streams from the burning process, and enhancing overall utility within the DeFi ecosystem. 4. Does this proposal change how ETH is currently burned? No, the proposal doesn’t change the underlying EIP-1559 burning mechanism. Instead, it builds upon it by creating a new token that represents the value of that burned ETH. 5. Who proposed the Ethereum BETH token? An Ethereum community foundation unveiled this initiative, with Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin also commenting on its potential.

BTC is holding steady as a reliable store of value, while SOL remains a popular choice for developers and traders. Yet, for investors chasing higher ROI, the stagnation of these majors is creating space for newer opportunities to step forward. That is why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, is gaining attention. With $15.24 million already raised, more than 15,950 holders, and the next price increase to $0.040 imminent, the project is being framed as a contender to deliver outsized returns while majors stay locked in sideways channels. Market resilience through liquidity and risk controls When it comes to investing in crypto, volatility is both the challenge and the reward. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has built its structure to navigate these extremes with precision. The platform employs calibrated Loan-to-Value ratios that safeguard both borrowers and lenders across varying asset classes. For instance, a loan backed by BUSD is eligible for up to 75% LTV with an 80% liquidation threshold. This creates an efficient cushion for users while preserving systemic stability. Meanwhile, higher-risk assets are capped closer to 40% LTV with a 65% liquidation threshold, ensuring that aggressive price movements do not undermine solvency. To protect the protocol even further, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) incentivizes liquidators during stressed market conditions. These participants receive enhanced rewards for acting quickly, keeping liquidations efficient with minimal slippage. It is this combination of proactive design and balanced risk management that positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as more than another DeFi project—it is a framework engineered for sustainability in unpredictable markets. The lending mechanics highlight the appeal for both sides of the equation. In P2C lending pools, an investor depositing 10 ETH valued at $35,000 at a 9% APY will earn $3,150 annually. At the same time, borrowers can unlock $20,000 against their ETH at 57% LTV, all while staying below risk thresholds. This creates a safe yet profitable structure where capital is always working. Expanding beyond this, P2P lending introduces a higher-yield option. Here, lenders and borrowers negotiate directly on assets like FLOKI or DOGE, setting their own terms and locking in returns that can exceed pool yields. Crucially, by isolating these agreements, the main liquidity pools remain secure even if higher-risk tokens experience volatility. From security to FOMO: why timing matters now For many investors reviewing crypto predictions, the strength of a project is not just in its yield but also in its security. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is backed by a CertiK audit with a token score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, adding third-party validation to its design. The team has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program that rewards up to $2,000 for critical findings, further strengthening trust. On top of that, a $100,000 giveaway is underway, rewarding ten early supporters with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each, fueling even greater community participation. This trust layer only amplifies the urgency of the presale. Early Phase 1 participants who entered at $0.010 have already seen more than a 3x gain at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035. With the token scheduled to list at $0.06 and expected exchange listings on platforms like Binance and Coinbase expected in the near future, projections for 2026 place MUTM at a 10x return or higher. Combined with the upcoming beta launch that will drive real user activity, the foundation is being laid for growth far beyond what BTC or SOL are expected to deliver in the same time frame. Conclusion The presale is moving quickly, with 32% of Phase 6 tokens already sold. Once the price shifts to $0.040 in Phase 7, investors will face a 15% higher entry point. That means today represents the last opportunity to buy MUTM at its lowest rate before momentum builds further. For those still asking crypto is a good investment for 2026, the answer is increasingly clear: the majors will provide stability, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be the breakout altcoin for exponential ROI. As Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) trade within channels, leaving investors debating the next move, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a clear answer. With its robust design, presale traction, and imminent price hike, the project is not just another name in the market. It is a chance to secure early exposure to what analysts believe will be one of the defining crypto stories of the next cycle.

Rangebound assets often erode confidence because investors watch their capital sit idle with no meaningful movement. This lack of momentum has sparked attention toward newer, more dynamic opportunities in the market, and one project gaining strong traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Unlike assets stuck in neutral, this decentralized finance protocol is preparing to bring a combination of liquidity management, stablecoin innovation, and oracle-based price discovery that has analysts talking about it as the best crypto investment to consider before the next big market rotation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing its framework with efficiency at the core. Its borrowing and lending model adjusts interest rates depending on how much capital is being used in its pools. When liquidity is abundant, interest rates remain low to encourage borrowing and maximize utilization. When liquidity becomes tight, rates climb to attract deposits and stimulate repayments. This ensures the platform will remain balanced even during a crypto crash or in highly volatile conditions, keeping lending markets efficient rather than unstable. Combined with Chainlink oracle integration and fallback systems that will deliver reliable price feeds, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a DeFi ecosystem where precision and security drive every decision. Presale gains and investor momentum While technology and design are exciting, what really has investors buzzing is the numbers behind the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. The project is currently in Phase 6 for $0.035. Over $15.24 million has been generated, and 32% of the 170 million tokens allocated to this round are already sold. More than 15,950 holders have secured their place ahead of the next 15% price increase, which will lift the token value to $0.040. With supply limited in each stage, investors are rushing to lock in their entry at today’s rate before this final discounted window closes. Those who recognized the opportunity earlier are already sitting on impressive paper returns. An investor who participated in Phase 1 at just $0.010 has already seen their stake nearly 3.5X in value, with the presale price climbing to $0.035. At listing, which is expected at around $0.06 to $0.07, those same early participants will have more than tripled their portfolio before the broader market has even had access. For anyone tracking crypto prices today, the contrast is clear: while blue-chip coins like BTC, ETH, SOL, and even XRP struggle for short-term gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been delivering momentum from the very start of its presale. Momentum is expected to accelerate more once listing liquidity arrives. With deeper trading markets and exchange exposure, the project’s price discovery will expand rapidly, and analysts are already looking toward projections of $1 and beyond. The opportunity to get in at $0.035, before this growth curve accelerates, is exactly why urgency has surrounded the presale. Stablecoin innovation and the road ahead Another key attraction for investors is the way Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is reshaping how stablecoins function in decentralized markets. The project’s native stablecoin is designed to always maintain a $1 value. It will only be minted when users borrow against collateral such as ETH, and it will be burned once those loans are repaid or liquidated. This system prevents oversupply while ensuring stability. Governance will control interest rates to keep the stablecoin anchored at $1. For example, should the stablecoin rise above peg, rates will be lowered, while a drop below peg would see borrowing costs increased. Arbitrage by market participants will reinforce this balance, creating a self-correcting mechanism that adds depth to the overall ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not relying on one feature alone to drive adoption. Its four-phase roadmap outlines a clear journey from presale initiation and marketing campaigns to full-scale platform delivery with multi-chain expansion, institutional partnerships, and advanced features. Security has been a cornerstone as well, with a CertiK audit delivering a strong score and a $50,000 bug bounty program incentivizing developers to test every aspect of the system. Combined with its $100,000 giveaway , the team has shown both transparency and commitment to building trust. Final words The broader DeFi market has been waiting for a platform that balances innovation with safety, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is putting itself in that position. With its stablecoin design, dynamic interest rate model, and presale momentum, it is standing out at a time when many projects are struggling to inspire confidence. While XRP continues to frustrate traders with its tight range, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering clear direction, growth, and an accessible entry point at just $0.035. With the next phase lifting prices to $0.040 and listing projections pointing toward $1 and beyond, this is the kind of opportunity investors look back on as the trade that changed their portfolio trajectory. For those searching for more than stagnant charts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be the smarter crypto investment today.

But who truly sits at the pinnacle of this digital empire? The latest figures paint a compelling picture of extraordinary crypto wealth , with Binance founder Changpeng Zhao leading the charge. Who Dominates the Crypto Wealth Landscape? Changpeng Zhao, widely known as CZ, continues to be the undisputed leader in the cryptocurrency industry’s wealth rankings. His estimated net worth now stands at a staggering $62.9 billion, or approximately 87 trillion Korean Won, as reported by Cointelegraph. This figure firmly places him at the top, showcasing the incredible potential for accumulation within the crypto space. Following CZ, we find other significant figures who have amassed substantial crypto wealth through their pioneering efforts. Giancarlo Devasini, the Chief Financial Officer of Tether, holds the second spot with an impressive $22.4 billion. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong rounds out the top three, with an estimated net worth of $15 billion. These figures highlight the concentrated nature of wealth among early innovators and key platform builders. What Drives Such Astounding Crypto Wealth? The sources of this immense crypto wealth are primarily rooted in the success and growth of their respective companies. These individuals have built foundational infrastructure that facilitates the broader adoption and functionality of digital assets. Their foresight in identifying market needs and executing scalable solutions has been instrumental in their financial success. Binance’s Dominance: CZ’s fortune is intrinsically linked to Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Its vast ecosystem, encompassing trading, NFTs, and a robust blockchain (BNB Chain), generates significant revenue and value. Tether’s Stability: Giancarlo Devasini’s wealth stems from Tether, the issuer of the most widely used stablecoin, USDT. Tether plays a critical role in providing liquidity and a stable medium of exchange within the volatile crypto markets. Coinbase’s Accessibility: Brian Armstrong’s net worth reflects Coinbase’s position as a leading regulated crypto exchange, particularly popular in the U.S. Its user-friendly interface and public listing have attracted millions of users, contributing to its valuation. The Broader Impact of Concentrated Crypto Wealth The concentration of significant crypto wealth in the hands of a few key individuals raises interesting questions about the industry’s future. While it celebrates entrepreneurial success, it also sparks discussions about decentralization, a core tenet of cryptocurrency. This wealth fuels further innovation, as many of these billionaires reinvest in new projects, incubate startups, and fund blockchain development. However, it also brings immense influence, shaping market trends and regulatory discussions. The actions and decisions of these powerful figures can significantly impact the entire crypto ecosystem. Understanding their financial standing helps us contextualize the power dynamics at play in this rapidly evolving sector.

After flipping $200 from resistance into support, the price is holding above this level, which is now being retested. Lennaert Snyder, a crypto analyst, notes that reclaiming $216 could set the stage for a move toward $238. He adds that the all-time high around $262 could follow if momentum builds. “As long as it trades above $180, the daily uptrend is intact,” he said. The range between $186 and $200 is viewed as a potential zone where buyers may step in after confirmation. $SOL fighting for $200 support. It flipped $200 resistance into support and still holding.

This area has previously acted as a base for upward moves and also lines up with an ascending trendline that has held since July. Price is pulling back from the recent high near $215, and the next move may depend on how it behaves in this support zone. If buyers step in again, the chart suggests that SOL could form a higher low and push back toward previous highs. The confluence between the trendline and the order block makes this a critical zone to watch. Source: X In addition, heatmap data from Coinglass, shared by Ted Pillows, shows a high concentration of liquidity between $160 and $180. This zone contains stop orders and open leverage positions, making it a likely area for the price to sweep during market stress. He said, “$SOL has a decent liquidity cluster around $160–$180 level.” He added, “It could sweep the downside liquidity in September before a new ATH in Q4.” If Bitcoin or Ethereum lose strength, altcoins like SOL may see sharper corrections before recovery. Large-Scale Buying by Institutions Institutional activity in SOL has picked up. Galaxy Digital moved 500,000 SOL (worth around $103 million) to Coinbase over the past five days. Separately, DeFi Development Corp. (Nasdaq: DFDV) also confirmed the purchase of 407,247 SOL, valued at $77 million. This brings its total holdings to over 1.83 million SOL, now worth approximately $371 million. The company stated it still holds $40 million in cash for future SOL purchases.

As the market’s pendulum swings between hype and innovation, Mutuum Finance’s unique tokenomics and growing community leave enthusiasts teetering on the edge between optimism and cautious consideration about whether it might rise to the echelons of market legends like Shiba Inu (SHIB). The pre-public funding stage 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is, for the meantime, being conducted at the price of $0.035 token per unit, meaning investors in such a token can increase their portfolio at a minimum of 500% within a limited time. The project has already generated over $15.25 million in raises and has the support of over 15,950 token holders. With the right momentum, Mutuum Finance has the potential to achieve $3 per token by the year 2025. Shiba Inu Holds Near $0.00001238 as Market Sentiment Stays Cautious Shiba Inu (SHIB) is at 0.00001238 with little changes over the last day as meme coin activity declines. Recently, trading volume shot off the scale though analysts are hesitant to suggest that this is a long-term trend and not a short-term speculation. Although SHIB still retains its ranking among the top meme tokens, there is a gradual increase in the investor interest in new decentralized finance projects like Mutuum Finance. Stage 6 Presale Live for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 6 just got started on the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) pre-stage sale this day, selling tokens at a cost of $0.035 each and giving early investors an excellent opportunity to strike early in the hype cycle before prices go up throughout subsequent time frames. Mutuum Finance a rapidly rising participant in the DeFi arena, has attracted over 15,950 traders and raised more than $15.25 million in its continuing presale. In addition to that, the platform recently announced the Bug Bounty Programme for a $50,000 USDT reward as part of their journey of strengthening security and community engagement – and that award has been mapped over four risk levels: critical, major, minor and low. Interest Rate Models Mutuum calculates borrowing rates according to how much available capital is subscribed. Thus, low interest rates favour borrowing conditions (when liquidity is plentiful) and high rates favour repayments and buy deposits (if liquidity is restricted). With fixed rates, borrowers can get a stable one at the time of taking a loan. These fixed-rate loans usually offer rates much higher than variable-rate loans and can be adjusted if market conditions become far-flung. Only assets with the sufficient degree of liquidity will qualify for stable rates. Mutuum Finance Kicks Off $100k Community Giveaway & Dual Lending Strategy Mutuum Finance is building a community with a $100,000 giveaway of $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each to lucky winners, allowing both longtime investors and newcomers to participate in the project. Further, the platform uses a dual lending strategy to improve flexibility as well as efficiency. The peer-to-contract model is based on the use of independent smart contracts to provide secured lending without human intervention by automatically determining rates according to market demand while keeping the interest rate fixed. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is consolidated near about the same point as at $0.00001238 and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shooting upwards. The project has already raised above $15.25 million and has over 15,950 investors and is currently in an ongoing pre-launch at $0.035. Aggressive expansion appears after it secures two loan shipment models, including the $100K volume giveaway, the security ecosystem, and demand then generates between 500% profit per transaction after listing, matching analysts price targets of up to $3-$5 in this crypto as it launches. So you should secure your tokens at stage 6 for early pricing before the next upswing.

Trong 24 giờ qua, tổng vốn hóa thị trường đã tăng thêm 13 tỷ USD, đạt mức 3,82 nghìn tỷ USD. Ngưỡng 3,81 nghìn tỷ USD đang đóng vai trò hỗ trợ quan trọng, tạo nền tảng cho sự ổn định chung của thị trường. Bitcoin hiện được giao dịch ở mức 111.477 USD, với kháng cự quanh 112.500 USD. Nếu vượt qua 115.000 USD, khả năng bứt phá mạnh hơn có thể xảy ra, mặc dù chỉ số RSI cho thấy cần thận trọng trong ngắn hạn. Cá voi đang tích lũy Altcoin: Bitcoin Hyper, AAVE và UNI While Bitcoin consolidates around key resistance levels, whales appear to be rotating their capital into high-conviction altcoins . On-chain data from Lookonchain shows significant withdrawals of Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) , Aave (AAVE) , and Uniswap (UNI) from centralized exchanges. Such large outflows usually indicate accumulation, as whales prefer to move assets into private wallets or DeFi strategies rather than leave them exposed on exchanges. Historically, these kinds of moves have preceded periods of bullish momentum. A notable transaction involved wallet 0xF436 , which withdrew 43,123 AAVE (valued at $13.87 million ) over just two days. Aave has remained one of the most important lending protocols in DeFi, and heavy whale accumulation suggests strong belief in its ability to maintain dominance in the decentralized finance sector. This type of conviction buying often signals that large investors expect AAVE to appreciate further, or that they plan to use it in long-term yield-generating strategies. Meanwhile, a newly created wallet, 0xC0D9 , withdrew 9.325 million HYPER (worth roughly $8.86 million ) from Binance only 11 hours ago . Unlike traditional altcoins, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as a Layer-2 scaling solution for Bitcoin , combining the security of the Bitcoin blockchain with the efficiency of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . This allows Hyper to process thousands of transactions per second, enable smart contracts, and dramatically reduce transaction fees. The scale and timing of this whale purchase highlights how institutional players and high-net-worth investors may be betting on Hyper as one of the next big narratives in the crypto market. Backed by a $13 million presale raise , the project has quickly gained attention as one of the fastest-growing altcoins in 2025. Another large transaction came from wallet 0x4940 , which withdrew 408,557 UNI (about $4.11 million ) from Binance just four hours ago . Uniswap continues to dominate as the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol by volume, and whale accumulation here signals confidence that UNI will remain central to DeFi’s liquidity infrastructure. Given Uniswap’s ongoing upgrades and governance proposals, whales may be positioning for both long-term token value and governance influence. Taken together, these transactions show that whales are not merely speculating on short-term price action—they are positioning themselves in projects with strong fundamentals, real use cases, and potential to lead the next market cycle. Tác động của việc cá voi mua vào đối với thị trường Hoạt động tích lũy của cá voi thường được xem là tín hiệu tăng giá, vì nó thể hiện niềm tin vào giá trị trung và dài hạn của tài sản. Việc các nhà đầu tư lớn tập trung gom mua Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) , AAVE và UNI cho thấy dòng tiền thông minh đang âm thầm chuẩn bị cho một đợt tăng giá altcoin tiềm năng. Đối với các trader, những động thái này là chỉ báo on-chain quan trọng. Khi nguồn cung trên sàn giao dịch giảm, áp lực tăng giá thường xuất hiện—đặc biệt khi đi kèm với nền tảng vững chắc. Với Bitcoin Hyper nổi lên như một câu chuyện mở rộng Layer-2 mới, Aave giữ vững danh tiếng là giao thức cho vay DeFi hàng đầu, và Uniswap tiếp tục thống trị trong giao dịch phi tập trung, sự kết hợp giữa niềm tin của cá voi và sức mạnh dự án có thể tạo đà cho xu hướng tăng trưởng.

This means deposits and withdrawals for Starknet (STRK) are currently on hold. The exchange cites an issue with the Starknet mainnet network as the reason for this urgent action, impacting users who hold or trade STRK. What is Starknet (STRK) and Why Does This Matter? Starknet is a permissionless decentralized Validity Rollup (often called a ‘ZK-Rollup’) operating as a Layer 2 network on Ethereum. Its primary goal is to enhance Ethereum’s scalability and transaction throughput while maintaining its security. STRK is the native token of the Starknet ecosystem, used for network fees, governance, and staking. When a major exchange like Bithumb, one of South Korea’s largest and most reputable platforms, implements a Bithumb STRK suspension , it signals a significant underlying technical challenge. Such actions are typically taken to protect user assets and maintain the integrity of the trading environment. Why the Bithumb STRK Suspension? Understanding Mainnet Issues The core reason for the Bithumb STRK suspension is a reported issue with the Starknet mainnet network. A ‘mainnet’ is the live, operational blockchain network where actual transactions occur. Problems on a mainnet can range from congestion and synchronization difficulties to more severe bugs affecting transaction processing or network stability. Exchanges like Bithumb rely on the stability and proper functioning of these underlying networks to process deposits and withdrawals accurately. If there’s an issue, continuing these services could lead to: Lost or stuck transactions Incorrect balances Security vulnerabilities Therefore, a temporary suspension is a precautionary measure. It allows the network developers and the exchange to investigate, diagnose, and resolve the problem without risking user funds. What Does the Bithumb STRK Suspension Mean for You? For Bithumb users holding STRK, it’s important to understand the immediate implications of this suspension. While deposits and withdrawals are halted, trading of STRK on Bithumb’s platform is typically unaffected unless specifically stated otherwise. Users can usually still buy or sell STRK within the exchange. However, you cannot move your STRK tokens onto or off the Bithumb platform during this period. This means if you intended to transfer STRK to an external wallet or another exchange, you will need to wait until the suspension is lifted. It’s crucial to: Stay informed by monitoring Bithumb’s official announcements. Avoid attempting deposits or withdrawals, as these transactions could be lost or delayed. Exercise patience as the technical team works on a resolution. Bithumb’s Response and Next Steps Bithumb has stated that the suspension is temporary and they are actively monitoring the Starknet mainnet. This indicates they are in communication with the Starknet development team or are independently assessing the network’s status. Exchanges prioritize the safety of user assets, and such suspensions are part of their operational protocols to manage unforeseen network challenges. Users can expect Bithumb to provide updates as soon as the mainnet issue is resolved and services can be safely resumed. Historically, these types of suspensions can last anywhere from a few hours to several days, depending on the complexity of the underlying problem. Navigating Crypto Network Challenges The incident with the Bithumb STRK suspension serves as a reminder that while cryptocurrencies offer incredible innovation, they are also built on complex technological infrastructures. Network issues, although relatively infrequent for established projects, can occur. For crypto users, it’s always wise to: Diversify holdings across different assets and platforms. Keep a portion of long-term holdings in secure, self-custodied wallets. Follow official announcements from exchanges and project teams for the most accurate information. Being prepared and informed is key to navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. This temporary halt is a standard procedure to ensure long-term stability. The Bithumb STRK suspension is a temporary measure taken to safeguard user assets amidst a Starknet mainnet issue. While inconvenient, it underscores Bithumb’s commitment to security and operational integrity. Users should remain calm, follow official updates, and understand that such actions are part of maintaining a robust crypto ecosystem. We will continue to monitor this situation closely and bring you the latest information as it becomes available. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Bithumb STRK suspension? A1: The Bithumb STRK suspension means that the South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has temporarily halted deposits and withdrawals for the Starknet (STRK) token due to a reported issue with the Starknet mainnet network. Q2: Why did Bithumb suspend STRK services? A2: Bithumb initiated the suspension because of a problem detected on the Starknet mainnet. This precautionary measure is taken to prevent potential issues like lost transactions or security vulnerabilities that could arise from an unstable network. Q3: Can I still trade STRK on Bithumb during the suspension? A3: Typically, a deposit and withdrawal suspension does not affect trading activities. You should still be able to buy and sell STRK on Bithumb’s platform, but you cannot move the tokens into or out of the exchange. Q4: When will STRK deposits and withdrawals resume on Bithumb? A4: The resumption depends on when the Starknet mainnet issue is fully resolved. Bithumb is monitoring the situation and will announce updates through its official channels once services can be safely restored. Q5: Is my STRK safe on Bithumb during this suspension? A5: Yes, Bithumb implements such suspensions precisely to protect user assets. Your STRK tokens held on the exchange remain secure, though you cannot access deposit or withdrawal functions temporarily.

The platform is set to significantly expand its spot market offerings with the introduction of new WLFI trading pairs . This strategic move aims to enhance liquidity and accessibility for users interested in the WLFI token, signaling a positive step for its market presence. What Are WLFI Trading Pairs and Why Are They Crucial? At its core, WLFI represents a digital asset within the dynamic blockchain ecosystem. When we talk about WLFI trading pairs , we’re referring to the specific currency combinations through which WLFI can be bought or sold on an exchange. For instance, WLFI/BRL means you can exchange WLFI for Brazilian Real, and WLFI/EUR means you can exchange WLFI for Euros. The addition of these pairs to Binance’s spot market is a crucial development for several reasons: Increased Accessibility: Users in Brazil and the Eurozone will find it easier to directly trade WLFI using their local fiat currencies, removing the need for additional conversion steps. Enhanced Liquidity: More trading pairs typically lead to higher trading volumes, which in turn improves market liquidity for WLFI. This makes it easier for traders to buy and sell without significant price impact. Broader Exposure: Listing on Binance, one of the world’s largest exchanges, exposes WLFI to millions of potential new investors, fostering greater adoption and interest. Diving Deeper: The WLFI/BRL and WLFI/EUR Listings Binance has officially announced that it will list the WLFI/BRL and WLFI/EUR spot trading pairs. These new pairs are scheduled to go live at 8:00 a.m. UTC on September 3 . This precise timing allows traders to prepare for the new opportunities these WLFI trading pairs present. For traders in Brazil and the Eurozone, this development is particularly impactful. Previously, they might have needed to convert their BRL or EUR into a stablecoin like USDT, and then trade USDT for WLFI. Now, they can execute direct trades, streamlining the process and potentially reducing transaction fees associated with multiple conversions. This direct fiat-to-crypto gateway is a significant convenience. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio and Future WLFI Trading Pairs? The introduction of new WLFI trading pairs on a major platform like Binance can have several implications for your investment strategy. For existing WLFI holders, this could lead to increased demand and potentially positive price action due to enhanced market exposure and liquidity. New investors might find WLFI more appealing now that it’s more accessible. However, it is always important to approach new listings with a well-researched strategy. Consider the following actionable insights: Research WLFI: Understand the project behind WLFI, its use cases, and its market capitalization. Monitor Market Reaction: Observe the initial trading activity and price movements of the new pairs on September 3. Risk Management: As with all cryptocurrency investments, only invest what you are comfortable losing. Volatility is a natural part of the crypto market. This expansion reinforces Binance’s commitment to supporting a diverse range of digital assets and catering to its global user base. The new WLFI trading pairs represent not just new listings, but new pathways for engagement and investment in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. The addition of WLFI/BRL and WLFI/EUR on Binance marks a significant milestone for the WLFI token, promising enhanced accessibility and liquidity for a global audience. This strategic move is set to open new avenues for traders, making it easier to engage with WLFI directly using major fiat currencies. As the crypto market continues to evolve, such listings play a vital role in fostering broader adoption and strengthening the ecosystem for various digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are the new WLFI trading pairs being listed on Binance? A1: Binance is listing the WLFI/BRL (Brazilian Real) and WLFI/EUR (Euro) spot trading pairs. Q2: When will these new WLFI trading pairs become available for trading? A2: Trading for both WLFI/BRL and WLFI/EUR will commence at 8:00 a.m. UTC on September 3. Q3: Why are these specific fiat trading pairs important for WLFI?

Q5: How can these new WLFI trading pairs impact my crypto portfolio?

Binance to List New Trading Pairs for WLFI According to the exchange's statement, WLFI/BRL and WLFI/EUR pairs will be available for trading on Binance Spot as of 11:00 on September 3, 2025.

Binance also reminded that the availability of new trading pairs may vary depending on the user's country or region.

51059030,571436,1756799061,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51059030.jpeg,Metaplanet to Add $844M in $BTC Treasury to Save Itself: Pump for Bitcoin Hyper?,https://bitcoinist.com/metaplanet-to-add-844m-in-btc-treasury-to-save-itself-pump-for-bitcoin-hyper/,"Japanese firm Metaplanet secured shareholder approval to raise approximately $884M through the issuance of up to 550M new shares overseas. The funds raised are primarily earmarked for expanding Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings, and are spearheaded in large part by Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, and a Metaplanet advisor. Even as Metaplanet prepares for another big Bitcoin buy, questions grow about the soundness of the company’s strategy – and of Eric Trump’s involvement. And in the background, hype grows surrounding the launch of Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – a potentially revolutionary Bitcoin Layer 2. Bitcoin Hoard Grows Amid Strategic Push Metaplanet continues its aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin, purchasing an additional 1,009 $BTC (worth about $112M). This brings its total holdings to approximately 20,000 $BTC, surpassing fellow public holder Riot Platforms, and placing it at number six on the list of top global corporate Bitcoin holders. But the aggressive strategy is running a bit of a risk. The company’s innovative funding mechanism – a ‘Bitcoin flywheel’ of warrant-driven funding predicated on a rising stock price – is stalling. With shares down approximately 54% since mid‑June, investor appetite for exercising warrants by its key backer, Evo Fund, has waned, choking liquidity. In response, Metaplanet advocated a fallback: a shareholder vote to consider issuing up to 555M preferred shares, potentially raising as much as $3.7B. These preferred instruments would offer dividends (up to 6% annually) and act as a buffer against further dilution of common shares. Eric Trump Joins the Spotlight The meeting to vote on the preferred shares proposal took on new luster when Eric Trump, appointed as a strategic advisor earlier this year, attended. He participated in a Tokyo event complete with costumes, food trucks, and a K-pop performance. Despite the media being barred from entry, his presence highlighted the firm’s high-profile crypto positioning. And with his support, all the major proposals – including the new stock issuance – passed. With that hurdle apparently cleared, Metaplanet’s long-term roadmap remains bold: it aims to accumulate over 210K $BTC by the end of 2027 – roughly 1% of all Bitcoin ever to exist – by leveraging its holdings to acquire profit-generating businesses. The strategy mirrors MicroStrategy’s crypto-centric model and underscores the company’s ambition to lead the corporate Bitcoin treasury movement. Metaplanet shares traded down around 5–6% on the day, indicating that the company’s moves don’t completely sway investors. At the same time, analysts remain bullish on the longer-term upside. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin moves come when some of Bitcoin’s underlying limitations are becoming more obvious. Yes, Bitcoin is one of the best stores of value ever created – but as the crypto and web3 economies expand, Bitcoin risks being left behind. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper comes in. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – SVM-Power Bitcoin Layer 2 for Lightning-Fast Transactions Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) deploys a hybrid architecture to bring Solana’s lightning-fast transactions and high throughput together with Bitcoin’s reliability and sheer size. That’s done via smart contracts on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) – particularly a Bitcoin Canonical Bridge to move Bitcoin from the original layer to wrapped Bitcoin on the Hyper Layer 2. Once the wrapped $BTC is minted, it can be used within complex smart contracts, dApps, and DeFi. Moving it back simply reverses the process. However, the final transaction settlement remains on Bitcoin’s Layer 1, preserving the stability and security that Bitcoin is known for. What is Bitcoin Hyper? It’s the rapid-response option for Bitcoin’s next stage of evolution. The Layer 2 is powered by the $HYPER token; currently available in the presale for $0.012845. Our price prediction shows the token price could hit $0.32 by the end of the year, representing a 2,683% increase from its final presale price. Learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper, and check out the $HYPER presale page ($13M raised). Will Metaplanet – Or Bitcoin Hyper – Save Bitcoin? Metaplanet is doubling down on its Bitcoin treasury strategy, advancing bold capital raises even as its share price retreats. The outcome hinges on whether its preferred share issuance can revitalize its funding flywheel. It may also come down to how Bitcoin performs; could Bitcoin Hyper supercharge the whole ecosystem and save Metaplanet? As always, do your own research. This isn’t financial advice.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin ETPs now hold over 1.47 million BTC, with U.S. funds leading the accumulation. Recent outflows and whale activity suggest investors are rotating into Ethereum ahead of expected ETF developments. Analysts expect a slow, long-term climb for Bitcoin, with possible short-term volatility around Fed policy moves. The lion’s share sits with U.S.-based ETFs, which collectively hold more than 1.29 million BTC across 11 funds, according to fresh data shared by HODL15Capital . Leading the pack is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) with 746,810 BTC, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which holds just under 199,500 BTC. Global Bitcoin ETPs Add 170,000 BTC in 2025, Worth $18.7 Billion Since the start of the year, global Bitcoin ETPs have added more than 170,000 BTC to their books, equivalent to around $18.7 billion. However, that growth appears to be losing steam. CoinShares data for August shows global Bitcoin ETPs experienced net outflows of $301 million, while Ethereum funds attracted inflows of $3.95 billion during the same period. AUGUST Global Bitcoin ETF update pic.twitter.com/6VkRsTmOU2 — HODL15Capital (@HODL15Capital) September 2, 2025 Investor sentiment has tilted away from Bitcoin in recent weeks, with several large holders shifting capital into Ether. On Monday, one prominent whale swapped 4,000 BTC for nearly 97,000 ETH, bringing their Ether holdings to an estimated $3.8 billion. Arkham Intelligence reported that nine whales collectively rotated $456 million from BTC into ETH, likely locking in profits ahead of a seasonal slowdown. The shift comes at a time when September, historically one of Bitcoin’s weakest months, is underway. Meanwhile, gold prices have been trending upward, and attention is growing around upcoming ETF decisions involving Solana and XRP. Some observers see the current Bitcoin lull as part of a longer, grinding climb. Analyst PlanC suggested the path to $1 million may not come through explosive rallies but rather a “boring and underwhelming” seven-year slog. Delphi Digital, meanwhile, warned that a Fed rate cut could prompt a short-term spike followed by a steep correction—unless price action remains subdued heading into the decision. How will rate cuts affect BTC? • 2019 established a 'sell the news' precedent for rate cuts. • Last year, ETF inflows fueled a sustained rally after rate cuts. • This makes the upcoming rate cut a conditional setup rather than a straightforward catalyst.

A detailed spreadsheet published on August 28 shows most of these filings, especially those linked to Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, are facing final decisions by October. The wave of new applications reflects growing interest in altcoin-focused ETFs and could spark fresh capital inflows into the crypto market. Solana and XRP are leading the ETF race, with eight and seven pending applications respectively. These altcoins now rank as the most targeted crypto investments after Bitcoin and Ethereum. The overall count of pending applications has climbed rapidly, from 72 in April to 92 in August, marking a significant uptick in institutional interest and regulatory engagement. As reported, digital asset investment products bounced back last week, drawing in $2.48 billion in inflows after a brief period of outflows. The surge pushed August’s total inflows to $4.37 billion, bringing the year-to-date figure to $35.5 billion.

Nasdaq-listed Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck (CNCK) is embarking on a strategic Coincheck Europe expansion , signaling a bold new chapter for its international ambitions. This move is set to bring a fresh dynamic to the European digital asset market. What’s Driving Coincheck’s European Ambition? Coincheck’s decision to venture into Europe isn’t just a random step; it’s a calculated strategic play. The company has successfully acquired Aplo, a digital asset prime broker that operates under the strict regulation of France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF). While the financial specifics of this acquisition remain undisclosed, as reported by CoinDesk, the intent is clear: to establish a strong foothold in the diverse and rapidly growing European market. This acquisition provides Coincheck with an immediate regulatory gateway into the European Union. Operating within the AMF’s framework offers a credible foundation, allowing Coincheck to navigate the complex European regulatory environment more efficiently. It’s a smart way to accelerate their Coincheck Europe expansion plans without starting from scratch. Unpacking the Aplo Acquisition: A Strategic Gateway Aplo isn’t just any company; it’s a digital asset prime broker. For those unfamiliar, a prime broker in the traditional financial world provides a suite of services to hedge funds and other large institutional clients, including trading, clearing, and financing. In the digital asset space, this means offering similar high-level services for cryptocurrencies. By acquiring a regulated entity like Aplo, Coincheck gains not only a license but also existing infrastructure, expertise, and a degree of trust within the European financial ecosystem. This makes the Coincheck Europe expansion a much more streamlined process, potentially bypassing many of the hurdles new entrants typically face. Regulatory Compliance: Aplo’s AMF regulation is key, providing a robust framework for operations. Institutional Reach: Prime brokerage services cater to larger clients, opening doors to significant capital. Market Access: It offers a direct pathway to serve European investors and institutions. Potential Benefits of Coincheck Europe Expansion This strategic move holds numerous benefits, both for Coincheck and for the European crypto market as a whole. For Coincheck, it represents a substantial opportunity for growth beyond its established Japanese base. For Coincheck: Diversified Revenue Streams: Tapping into new user bases and institutional clients across Europe. Enhanced Global Presence: Solidifying its position as a major international crypto exchange. Regulatory Learning: Gaining experience in diverse European regulatory landscapes, which can inform future global strategies. For European Users and Markets: Increased Competition: More options for users can lead to better services and lower fees. Innovation: New players often bring fresh ideas and technological advancements. Market Liquidity: A larger exchange can contribute to deeper and more stable markets. Ultimately, the Coincheck Europe expansion could foster a more dynamic and competitive environment for digital assets. Navigating the Challenges of European Markets While the prospects are bright, entering the European market comes with its own set of challenges. Europe is not a monolithic entity; it comprises many different countries, each with its own nuances in financial regulations, cultural preferences, and market maturity. Coincheck will need to carefully navigate varying national regulations, which can differ even within the broader EU framework. Furthermore, they will face stiff competition from well-established European and international crypto exchanges already operating in the region. User adoption and localization will also be critical factors for success in this diverse market. A New Chapter for Global Crypto The Coincheck Europe expansion through the acquisition of Aplo marks a significant milestone in the ongoing globalization of the cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the growing maturity of digital asset markets and the increasing desire for established players to broaden their reach. This move has the potential to reshape the competitive landscape and offer new opportunities for crypto enthusiasts and institutions alike across the European continent. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Coincheck? Coincheck is a Nasdaq-listed Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, one of the largest in Japan, offering various digital asset trading and management services to its users. 2. Why is Coincheck expanding into Europe? Coincheck is expanding into Europe to diversify its market presence, tap into new user bases, and leverage the growth potential of the European digital asset market, utilizing Aplo’s regulatory foundation. 3. What is Aplo and why was it acquired? Aplo is a digital asset prime broker regulated by France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF).

The move will enable everyday Australians to add digital assets to their retirement fund and further increase the country’s pension funds’ crypto exposure. With cryptocurrencies getting more mainstream, this could be a huge plus in boosting citizens’ confidence in them as alternative investments. This could lead to substantial crypto adoption from the general population, making alternative crypto assets a more appealing investment opportunity. For those looking to invest outside of their pensions or take advantage of the potential market surge, Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) are shaping up to be the best crypto to buy at the moment. OKX, Coinbase to Meet SMSFs’ Growing Demand for Crypto Exposure Bloomberg reported that two of the largest crypto exchanges are offering products geared towards SMSFs . OKX has already launched a product in June, while Coinbase will reportedly offer theirs soon. SMSFs are a category of Australia’s pension funds where individuals can choose where to invest their money. Traditional pension funds don’t have this capability, making them less flexible and potentially less profitable. According to the Bloomberg report citing data from the Australian Tax Office, the amount of digital assets held in these SMSFs has grown dramatically since 2021, from less than A$500M in Q1 of that year to A$1.7B in Q1 2025. Despite this, SMSFs’ exposure to crypto is still considered modest. With OKX and Coinbase now looking to attract SMSFs, we expect this exposure to increase significantly. The US government announced a similar move last month, with President Donald Trump ordering agencies to allow workers to invest in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. With more governments embracing cryptocurrencies, it will only be a matter of time before more citizens test out the waters too. In fact, crypto ownership has nearly doubled in Australia in the last six years, from 16.8% in 2021 to 32.5% in 2025. If you’re one of those looking to add digital assets to your portfolio, here are three that are worth considering: 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Helping You Find the Best Coins Quickly and Safely Don’t let the funny name and its crazy-looking mascot fool you: Snorter Token ($SNORT) means serious business. The project aims to develop Snorter Bot, a Telegram-based crypto trading bot that will make finding new crypto faster and safer. At the moment, trading tools and resources are spread across platforms, so everything is slow and cumbersome. Vetting new projects is pretty difficult too, which increases your risk of getting scammed or hacked. With Snorter Bot, you’ll be able to do all these within the popular messaging app, including managing your portfolio, sniping, and copying trades.

Understanding market sentiment is absolutely crucial, especially when it comes to volatile assets like Bitcoin. One of the most telling indicators for this sentiment is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio. This metric offers a unique glimpse into how traders are positioning themselves on the world’s leading derivatives exchanges. It essentially reveals whether the majority of participants are betting on price increases (long) or decreases (short) for Bitcoin’s future movements. Over the past 24 hours, we’ve seen some interesting shifts in these ratios across the top three exchanges by open interest, providing vital clues about the immediate market outlook. What Do BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios Tell Us About Market Sentiment? The long/short ratio for BTC perpetual futures is more than just a number; it’s a barometer of collective trader psychology. A ratio above 1.0 indicates that more traders are long than short, suggesting bullish sentiment. Conversely, a ratio below 1.0 signals a bearish leaning. When these ratios deviate significantly from a balanced 1:1, it can sometimes hint at potential market reversals or continuations. However, it’s essential to remember that this is just one piece of the puzzle. Over the last 24 hours, the aggregated data from the top three exchanges shows a slight lean towards short positions, indicating a cautious or slightly bearish sentiment among futures traders. A Closer Look at the Latest BTC Perpetual Futures Data Let’s dive into the specific numbers for BTC perpetual futures across the leading platforms. Here’s a snapshot of the long/short position ratios over the past 24 hours on the world’s top three cryptocurrency futures exchanges by open interest: Overall Market: Long 49.8%, Short 50.2% Binance: Long 49.98%, Short 50.02% Bybit: Long 49.4%, Short 50.6% Gate.io: Long 48.82%, Short 51.18% These figures reveal a subtle but consistent pattern: across all three major exchanges, short positions marginally outweigh long positions. This indicates that while the market is relatively balanced, there’s a slight inclination for traders to bet against a significant immediate price surge for Bitcoin. Such a balance suggests a period of consolidation or perhaps a minor correction could be on the horizon, rather than a strong directional move. Decoding Exchange-Specific BTC Perpetual Futures Sentiment While the overall picture for BTC perpetual futures shows a slight short bias, looking at individual exchanges provides more granular insight. Binance , often considered a bellwether for the broader crypto market, shows an almost perfectly balanced ratio at 49.98% long and 50.02% short. This indicates a highly neutral stance among its vast user base, suggesting neither strong conviction for upward nor downward movement. Traders on Binance appear to be waiting for clearer signals before committing heavily in either direction. Bybit , on the other hand, exhibits a slightly more pronounced short bias with 49.4% long and 50.6% short. This indicates a marginally higher number of traders anticipating a price dip. This slight divergence could reflect different trading demographics or strategies prevalent on Bybit compared to Binance. Gate.io stands out with the strongest short inclination among the three, reporting 48.82% long and 51.18% short. This more significant lean towards short positions could imply a more bearish outlook among Gate.io’s user base, potentially driven by specific market events or technical analysis interpretations unique to their trading community. Understanding these platform-specific nuances can be vital for traders who operate across multiple exchanges or want to gauge diverse market perspectives. How Can You Use BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios in Your Trading Strategy? For traders, these BTC perpetual futures long/short ratios offer valuable, actionable insights. While not a standalone predictor, they can be a powerful confirmation tool. Gauge Market Consensus: A strong bias, either long or short, suggests a consensus. If the ratio is heavily skewed, it might indicate an overextension, potentially leading to a short squeeze (if many shorts are liquidated) or a long squeeze. Identify Divergences: Pay attention if the long/short ratio moves contrary to the spot price. For example, if Bitcoin’s price is rising but the long/short ratio is decreasing, it might signal underlying weakness in the rally. Combine with Other Metrics: Always cross-reference this data with other technical indicators like funding rates, open interest changes, volume, and on-chain metrics. A holistic view provides a more robust analysis. Risk Management: Use these insights to adjust your risk exposure. If the market is leaning heavily short, and you’re long, consider tighter stop-losses or hedging strategies. Remember, the market is constantly evolving. These ratios are a snapshot, and sentiment can shift rapidly. Staying informed and adaptable is key to navigating the crypto futures landscape effectively. The Bigger Picture for BTC Perpetual Futures and Conclusion The slight short bias in BTC perpetual futures ratios over the last 24 hours paints a picture of cautious market sentiment. While not overtly bearish, it suggests that traders are not rushing to open long positions, perhaps anticipating further consolidation or minor pullbacks for Bitcoin. This balanced, yet slightly short-leaning, sentiment underscores the current uncertainty in the market. It’s a reminder that even in the highly speculative world of crypto, nuanced data points like these provide invaluable insights. Traders who pay close attention to such indicators, alongside broader market trends and fundamental developments, are better equipped to make informed decisions. Keep an eye on how these ratios evolve, as they can quickly shift and signal new opportunities or risks in the exciting world of Bitcoin trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio? It’s a metric that indicates the proportion of long (betting on price increase) positions versus short (betting on price decrease) positions for Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts on an exchange. It reflects overall market sentiment. 2. Why is the long/short ratio important for crypto traders? It helps traders gauge collective market sentiment, identify potential overextensions, and understand whether the majority of participants are bullish or bearish, aiding in strategic decision-making. 3. What does a ratio of 49.8% long and 50.2% short signify? This indicates a slight bearish bias, meaning that marginally more traders are positioned for a price decrease than for an increase. It suggests a cautious or slightly negative sentiment. 4. How do long/short ratios differ across exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io? Ratios can vary due to different user demographics, trading strategies, and regional influences on each exchange. For example, one exchange might show a more pronounced short bias than another, reflecting distinct community sentiments. 5. Should I base my trading decisions solely on the long/short ratio? No, the long/short ratio is a valuable indicator but should not be used in isolation. It’s best combined with other technical analysis tools, on-chain data, funding rates, and overall market news for a comprehensive trading strategy.

On-chain data, however, reveals a recurring driver in the form of miner sell pressure. Miner Pressure You Can’t Ignore Miners secure the Bitcoin network and earn revenue in BTC, yet their expenses, such as electricity, hardware, and cooling, are denominated in fiat. During the summer, particularly in August, energy demand surges across the world as heat waves strain power grids in major mining hubs such as Texas, Kazakhstan, and China. Higher electricity costs leave miners with little choice but to liquidate larger portions of their BTC reserves. This pressure showed up clearly in CryptoQuant’s Miner-to-Exchange Flow data, which highlights spikes in transfers to exchanges during August. Historically, these surges align with local market tops or mid-cycle corrections, which intensifies downside momentum just as overall liquidity thins due to reduced institutional participation in the summer. The result is a seasonal imbalance, meaning more Bitcoin supply flooding exchanges while demand temporarily fades. For traders, this pattern is more than a coincidence. In fact, it provides a tactical signal. Anticipating miner-driven weakness allows short-term players to hedge or adjust positions before corrections deepen. For long-term investors, however, miner capitulation often creates favorable accumulation opportunities ahead of stronger autumn rallies. As such, August miner flows transform into both a challenge and a potential advantage. The consistent on-chain record suggests Bitcoin does not inherently dislike August; it’s simply the month when miners must sell more aggressively to cover power bills. Opportunity in September? As the market entered September, analysts warned that this month is historically bearish for the asset. Data shows that BTC established its monthly high or low within the first 12 days over 80% of the time, often amid volatility. September has proved to be Bitcoin’s weakest month, as it saw negative returns in 8 of the last 12 years, including 2017 and 2021 bull cycles when it fell over 7%. Projections suggest a possible dip toward $100,000 before recovery, though October and November historically deliver strong gains. Traders view early September corrections as potential buying opportunities ahead of seasonal rallies.

But as meme coin mania fades, attention is now focused on tokens that combine innovation with utility. Remittix (RTX) is where it’s at. While Shiba Inu is still a strong community-based asset, Remittix is turning out to be the Best Crypto To Buy Now based on its focus on solving real financial problems within the $19 trillion payments market. Shiba Inu Price and Current Market Position Shiba Inu price is currently trading at $0.00001229, down 0.87% in the last 24 hours. However, its market capitalization is presently $7.24 billion, making it obviously one of the top meme coins. SHIB price action is a reflection of retail speculation, and the $215.12 million (77.01% daily increase) trading volume shows there remains much activity in the market. However, for the investor seeking the next 100x crypto, the majority are now making comparisons of Shiba Inu’s last rally to upcoming crypto projects that have practical applications like Remittix. Why Remittix Is The Best Crypto To Buy Now Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi project with a focus on making seamless global payments easy.

The wallet will facilitate instant conversions between fiat and crypto with low gas fees, closing the gap between decentralized exchange systems and traditional finance.

With its deflationary tokenomics, utility-driven model, and CertiK audit, Remittix is proving it’s not another crypto presale. It places itself among the best DeFi projects 2025, offering solutions for freelancers, remitters, and businesses in need of speed, borderless payments.

In its September 1 Market Outlook, the firm writes: “Closing below $98k on this timeframe would turn weekly structure bearish,” adding that “above $98k weekly structure is still bullish and therefore we should anticipate the formation of a higher-low.” At publication time, Ostium referenced BTC around $108,017, with the August monthly candle settling “firmly red” after wicking through the record to roughly $124.5k and closing near prior resistance-turned-support around $108.2k. Key Bitcoin Price Levels To Watch Now On the monthly chart, Ostium sees no evidence of a 2021-style cyclical top. The note acknowledges some momentum divergence on RSI but stresses the absence of confirmation from the Awesome Oscillator: “AO has continued to point towards building momentum throughout the uptrend… I do not think this is even remotely similar to the 2021 top formation.” Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLers Spend 97,000 BTC—Biggest Move This Year The bear case strengthens only if September “closes below the 2025 open at $93.3k and therefore below local trendline support.” For the bullish path, the team wants September to find support “above the yearly open, but likely much higher around the July lows at $105k,” and “ideally” finish the month green “above the August open at $115k,” a configuration they say would “set us up for expansion beyond the highs in October.” Weekly structure, by Ostium’s read, “showed no exhaustion on the move higher” and has now reset toward 50 on RSI, a profile the firm says supports trend continuation. Should the market carve a higher low early in September and reclaim momentum, a weekly close “back above $112k leads to a retest of the August open and potentially $117.5k into FOMC with a retest of the highs before month-end.” The daily timeframe remains the near-term hurdle. Ostium characterizes the pullback as “orderly,” with supports flipped to resistance on the way down and “the key level… obviously the $112k prior all-time high,” which served as support in early August and then “reclaimed resistance” on last week’s leg lower. “A breakout and close above the trendline and back above $112k would look like the bottom is in,” they write. A failed probe—“wick above the trendline into $112k and reject”—would bias price toward “the June open at $104.5k, with the 200dMA below that at $101.3k being key demand.” In derivatives, CoinGlass liquidation heatmaps for Binance’s BTC/USDT pair over one week and one month show dense liquidation bands layered above the $114k cap and clustered below around the $120k region, while no significant levels are visible to the downside. With a macro-heavy week ahead— ISM prints, JOLTS, the Fed’s Beige Book, jobless claims, ADP, ISM Services, and Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls—Ostium lays out conditional tactical setups. For longs, they prefer evidence of exhaustion into support: trendline resistance respected, “today’s low” taken out via a liquidation wick into the June-open/200-day cluster, and bullish divergence forming there before bidding for a move back to the weekly open and the $112k retest. For shorts, they prefer a sharp early-week squeeze into $112k “with trend exhaustion… having not taken out today’s low around $107k,” fading the pop back into weekly lows with risk reduced if it unfolds ahead of NFP. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Dumps Billions For ETH, But $5 Billion Selloff Still Looms Ostium also surveys positioning, pointing to snapshots across Velo and CoinGlass, three-month annualized basis, and the mix between Bitcoin and altcoin open interest, as well as one-week and one-month liquidation maps. While it refrains from headline claims on those dashboards, the note’s technical levels line up with the most concentrated liquidation density visible in the attached heatmaps, where stacked interest remains perched near the $112k pivot overhead and layered through the $105k–$101k demand shelf. DXY As Tailwind For The BTC Price The report extends beyond Bitcoin. The dollar backdrop, in Ostium’s framework, remains a tailwind for BTC into year-end. With DXY around 97.2, the firm says the current sequence rhymes with past cyclical drawdowns and expects “DXY to break below 96 and push towards at least 94.6, but more likely 93,” where a bottoming formation could emerge above the 200-month moving average. The secular DXY bull case is not dismissed; rather, Ostium situates the present leg as the final cyclical downswing before a higher-low and multi-year recovery, contingent on policy outcomes. A decisive monthly reclaim of 100 would invalidate the near-term bearish DXY view. Across assets, the through-line of Ostium’s September map is clarity on thresholds. For Bitcoin, a weekly loss of $98,000 would be the first structural break of the cycle; a daily reclaim of $112,000 would strongly argue the local low is in; and a monthly hold above $105,000 with a close back over $115,000 would tee up fresh highs into October. At press time, BTC traded at $110,610.

In 2025, rising electricity prices and the recent halving event have made profitability more complicated for small and mid-sized miners. Industrial-scale operations with access to renewable energy sources are thriving, while independent miners often face margins so thin that they struggle to keep machines running. For some, mining has become more about speculation, holding coins mined at a higher cost, than immediate returns. This bifurcation leaves the sector dominated by large players with capital-intensive setups, continuing a trend seen over the past several years. Yet while Bitcoin mining becomes increasingly competitive, investor capital is beginning to seek more accessible alternatives like emerging altcoins, with MAGACOIN FINANCE among those entering many stage conversations. Efficiency improves, but centralization concerns remain Advances in mining hardware, such as more efficient ASICs, have reduced the energy cost per hash, offering relief to professional miners. However, these upgrades come at a steep upfront price, further cementing the industry’s centralization in the hands of those who can afford constant reinvestment. Critics argue this undermines Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. At the same time, nations like Kazakhstan and Paraguay have become mining hubs due to lower electricity costs, concentrating hash power geographically. For global investors, this raises long-term questions about security and resilience. While the profitability of mining may hinge on Bitcoin crossing $120,000 or more, many see altcoins as a simpler path to capitalize on the next cycle’s upside. The shifting economics of Bitcoin mining are sparking discussions about where the next major opportunities might come from. While Bitcoin mining’s profitability fluctuates with energy prices and network difficulty, speculative projects thrive on very different dynamics. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the few audited tokens to gain early credibility , with backing from HashEx and CertiK reviews . Instead of relying on expensive rigs or electricity arbitrage, its growth engine lies in cultural branding and rapid community formation. Early rounds have seen fast sellouts , reflecting how capital shifts when traditional mining margins compress. For many investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a way to capture high-beta crypto exposure without hardware risk. In a landscape where mining rewards are harder to secure, this type of scarcity-driven play is attracting serious attention. Why Institutions Are Diversifying Beyond Bitcoin Into Altcoins Institutional investors are aware of Bitcoin’s long-term role but increasingly diversify into assets beyond mining-heavy operations. Funds and family offices in Asia and Europe are exploring a mix of infrastructure coins like Ethereum, payment-oriented networks like XRP, and select narrative-driven projects with strong community backing. This reflects a broader recognition: mining alone no longer captures the entirety of crypto’s growth. Instead, diversified portfolios that balance blue-chip digital assets with high-reward plays are seen as better aligned with the evolving market. Conclusion Bitcoin mining in 2025 remains profitable for industrial-scale operators with access to cheap power, but for smaller players, the game is tougher than ever. Efficiency gains help, but rising costs and centralization concerns weigh on the sector. That’s why some investors are looking at alternative paths to crypto exposure. With analysts spotlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE’s potential and strong audit credentials , it’s increasingly framed as a fresh breakout candidate. Whether through the rigs of massive mining farms or the cultural firepower of new altcoins, the race for crypto’s next big story is well underway.

51059751,571380,1756800033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51059751.jpeg,California Gov. Newsom Fires Back At US President With ‘Trump Corruption Coin’ Tease,https://bitcoinist.com/california-governor-newsom-fires-back-at-us-president-with-trump-corruption-coin-tease/,"California Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday teased a new satirical memecoin called “Trump Corruption Coin,” part of what he described as a broad push to mock US President Donald Trump’s growing ties to the crypto scene. The governor made the remark during a high-profile appearance on the Pivot podcast and at the California Agenda: Sacramento Summit, saying the coin would be tied to his “Campaign for Democracy.” Governor’s Mocking Move According to Newsom, the token is meant as political satire and a fundraising tool. Reports have disclosed that proceeds would be directed toward redistricting work and voter outreach — causes the governor has said are central to his campaign efforts. He framed the idea as a way to highlight what he calls the “absurdity” of well-known crypto maneuvers tied to the US President. Gavin Newsom: “We’re about to put a meme coin out.” Kara Swisher: “Is it going to be gold Gavin Coin?” Newsom: “No, it’s Trump Corruption Coin… this is one of the great grifters of our time… His family is sent out before these foreign trips doing deals.The crony capitalism… pic.twitter.com/HNknqlm9Gi — Blue Georgia (@BlueATLGeorgia) August 29, 2025 Newsom’s comments come after weeks of increasingly pointed online trolling. He has been selling parody items in a Patriot Shop that mirrors MAGA-style branding, and his team has used all-caps social posts and AI-generated memes to needle conservative figures. The coin tease was delivered with a jab: when asked if it would be called a “Gavin Coin,” he said no — it would be “Trump Corruption Coin.” A Direct Response To Trump’s Crypto Moves Based on reports, the governor also drew a contrast with tokens tied to Trump. He noted the President’s earlier foray into memecoins and recent crypto-linked activity surrounding his circles. Reports have referenced Trump’s own Solana-based token, which was released earlier this year and has drawn scrutiny from critics. Political strategists say the stunt serves a double purpose: it keeps Newsom in the headlines, and it forces conversation about the messy overlap between politics and crypto. Campaign aides declined to lay out technical details immediately; it was not clear if the memecoin would be a fully tradable token, a novelty NFT, or a limited-run collectible tied to the Patriot Shop. What was made plain is that the move is satirical and activist in tone. What To Watch Next Observers will watch three things closely: whether the coin is minted on a public blockchain, how much money it raises, and how regulators respond. Meanwhile, Trump just backed the launch of WLFI , a token promoted as a major part of his crypto push. The coin saw heavy trading in its first days but quickly dipped by about 30% after launch , raising questions about stability and long-term investor confidence. This development added more fuel to critics who say Trump’s embrace of memecoins and crypto projects is less about policy and more about profit.

In his latest post, he stated that unless major structures are broken, current volatility should be treated as noise. He reiterated his outlook for a substantial move, pointing to a target of $27 from a base reference of $2.70, describing this as a 10x move. His message carried a strong reminder to the XRP community to remain steady and to focus on the larger trend rather than temporary corrections. #XRP – I Hate to Say I Told You So! : It’s important to remember: this is just short-term noise unless we start breaking major structures.

Together We Rise , and… pic.twitter.com/J9efB2Dt9u — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 1, 2025 Technical Framework and Support Zones The chart attached to the update was set on the weekly timeframe and emphasized the Bull Market Support Band. Within this framework, Egrag identified two critical support tiers. The first is positioned at $2.66, labeled as Tier One Major Support. The second is $2.55, marked as Tier Two Major Support. Beyond these levels, $2.30 was defined as the macro support. According to his analysis, a decline to $2.30 would signify the end of the ongoing impulsive advance and would serve as a major bearish target. These price levels establish a hierarchy of support zones that he will monitor to determine whether the bullish structure remains intact. Focus on Structure Over Short-Term Moves Egrag Crypto emphasized that the analysis is anchored in weekly structures, not lower time-frame moves. By focusing on broader support zones, he made it clear that retracements within the established range are not enough to negate the bullish outlook. Only a clear break of the outlined structural levels would change the overall direction of the thesis. This approach highlights the importance of consistency in holding above the identified support zones to preserve the bullish framework. Target and Market Outlook The target presented in his update is a $27 price level for XRP, which represents a tenfold increase from the reference price of around $2.70. While no specific timeline was attached to this forecast, the weekly timeframe analysis implies a medium- to long-term perspective rather than a short-term projection. The upside target is presented within the condition that XRP sustains its structure above the defined support bands. Guidance for XRP Holders In his message, Egrag Crypto addressed the XRP community directly, urging them to stay steady and strong despite fluctuations. He pointed out that temporary moves downward should not distract from the larger structure. His statement reflected confidence that XRP remains positioned for significant movement so long as the weekly supports at $2.66 and $2.55 hold, with the final defense level at $2.30 serving as the marker for a shift in trend.

51059761,571488,1756800237,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51059761.jpeg,Đồng tiền điện tử hàng đầu nên mua trước khi tăng 3.500% – Theo Cathie Wood của ARK Invest,https://bitcoinist.com/top-cryptocurrency-to-buy-before-it-soars-according-to-cathie-wood-vn/,"Kể từ khi chính quyền của Tổng thống Donald Trump nhậm chức, ngành tiền điện tử đã có một năm đầy biến động và thay đổi. Chính phủ đã gỡ bỏ nhiều quy định nghiêm ngặt và ban hành những đạo luật mang tính bước ngoặt, nhằm thúc đẩy đổi mới trong lĩnh vực tài sản kỹ thuật số. Những động thái này có thể định hình lại toàn ngành và đẩy nhanh quá trình tích hợp tiền điện tử vào nền kinh tế chính thống. Đối với những nhà đầu tư “bull” lâu năm, sự thay đổi chính sách này càng củng cố niềm tin rằng giá tiền điện tử sẽ tăng mạnh hơn nữa. Một trong những người ủng hộ nhiệt tình nhất là Cathie Wood, CEO của ARK Invest, nổi tiếng với niềm tin vào công nghệ mang tính đột phá và khả năng thay đổi toàn bộ ngành công nghiệp. Với Wood, tiền điện tử và blockchain là một phần tất yếu trong tầm nhìn tương lai của ARK. Hiện tại, Wood đang nhấn mạnh một đồng tiền điện tử cụ thể mà bà tin rằng có thể tăng tới 3.536%, trở thành lựa chọn hàng đầu cần xem xét trước khi đợt tăng giá lớn tiếp theo bắt đầu. Tiện ích thực tế có thể trở thành yếu tố thay đổi cuộc chơi cho đồng tiền điện tử này Một trong những đồng tiền điện tử mà Cathie Wood và ARK Invest cực kỳ lạc quan là Ethereum (ETH), đồng tiền điện tử lớn thứ hai thế giới với vốn hóa thị trường khoảng 560 tỷ USD tại thời điểm viết bài. Kể từ khi chính thức ra mắt vào năm 2015, Ethereum đã giữ vững vị trí số 2, chỉ đứng sau Bitcoin. Trong khi Bitcoin ngày càng được coi là kho lưu trữ giá trị—một dạng “vàng kỹ thuật số”—sức hút của Ethereum nằm ở tính ứng dụng thực tế của blockchain. Mạng Ethereum là nền tảng của nền kinh tế ứng dụng phi tập trung (dApp), được vận hành bởi hợp đồng thông minh. Những hợp đồng này tự động thực thi khi điều kiện được đáp ứng, loại bỏ nhu cầu trung gian và mở ra nhiều trường hợp sử dụng mới trong các ngành như bất động sản, tài chính, chuỗi cung ứng và y tế. Ethereum cũng là blockchain phổ biến nhất cho dApp, với hàng nghìn ứng dụng đã được xây dựng và hơn 234 triệu ví duy nhất đã tương tác với mạng trong thập kỷ qua. Nhiều loại tiền điện tử hàng đầu hiện nay được phát triển dưới dạng token ERC-20 trên Ethereum, và phần lớn stablecoin lớn nhất thế giới cũng đang hoạt động trên blockchain này. Cathie Wood từ lâu đã bày tỏ sự lạc quan về quỹ đạo dài hạn của Ethereum. Tại một hội nghị của ARK Invest vào năm ngoái, bà dự đoán Ethereum có thể đạt mức vốn hóa 20 nghìn tỷ USD vào năm 2032, dựa trên tổng nguồn cung 120 triệu token. Điều đó đồng nghĩa với giá 166.000 USD mỗi ETH, tức tăng hơn 3.500% so với mức giá hiện tại khoảng 4.635 USD. Ngoài ra, cơ chế đốt token của Ethereum—loại bỏ vĩnh viễn token khỏi lưu thông—có thể khiến giá tăng cao hơn nữa nhờ giảm nguồn cung. Điều này tạo thêm yếu tố khan hiếm, củng cố thêm lý do đầu tư. Wood thậm chí còn so sánh Ethereum với trái phiếu kho bạc Mỹ. Kể từ khi chuyển đổi từ cơ chế đồng thuận proof of work (PoW) sang proof of stake (PoS), Ethereum cho phép người nắm giữ stake token để nhận lợi suất, đồng thời hỗ trợ xác thực giao dịch. Những token đã stake này thường được dùng làm tài sản thế chấp trong DeFi và các giao dịch khác, điều mà ARK cho rằng rất giống với cách trái phiếu kho bạc hoạt động trong tài chính truyền thống. Nếu sự so sánh này được thị trường rộng lớn hơn chấp nhận, vai trò của Ethereum trong nền kinh tế toàn cầu có thể sẽ mở rộng đáng kể. Ethereum có thực sự đạt 166.000 USD không? Dự đoán giá tiền điện tử luôn là một việc khó khăn, bởi các tài sản kỹ thuật số không tạo ra dòng tiền hay lợi nhuận như những công ty niêm yết truyền thống. Toàn bộ lĩnh vực này vẫn còn tương đối mới, biến động mạnh và chịu ảnh hưởng nhiều từ tâm lý thị trường cũng như xu hướng chấp nhận. Vì vậy, những dự báo từ các nhân vật nổi tiếng—như Michael Saylor với Bitcoin hay Cathie Wood với Ethereum—thường bị nhiều người hoài nghi coi là mang tính quảng bá. Tuy nhiên, trong dài hạn, những ai tin tưởng Ethereum đã gặt hái được kết quả tích cực. Đây vẫn là một trong số ít đồng tiền điện tử có tính ứng dụng thực tế rõ ràng. Dù còn tồn tại những thách thức như tắc nghẽn mạng và khả năng mở rộng, Ethereum vẫn là nền tảng cho khối lượng lớn các giao dịch kỹ thuật số, đặc biệt là stablecoin, vốn đang ngày càng được sử dụng rộng rãi. Nhu cầu ngày càng tăng này củng cố thêm lý do đầu tư, bất kể ETH có thực sự chạm mốc dự đoán 166.000 USD của Wood hay không. Dĩ nhiên, không ai có thể khẳng định chắc chắn Ethereum sẽ giao dịch ở mức nào vào năm 2032. Nhưng thực tế hơn, ETH nhiều khả năng sẽ tiếp tục mang lại lợi nhuận dài hạn đáng kể cho các nhà đầu tư kiên nhẫn, khi tiện ích mạng lưới ngày càng mở rộng và mức độ chấp nhận ngày càng sâu rộng. Có nên mua Ethereum ngay bây giờ không? Trước khi vội vàng mua Ethereum, bạn nên dừng lại và xem xét bức tranh toàn cảnh. Nhóm phân tích của Motley Fool Stock Advisor—nổi tiếng với khả năng liên tục xác định những khoản đầu tư sinh lời cao—gần đây đã công bố danh sách 10 cổ phiếu tốt nhất để mua ngay bây giờ. Điều thú vị là Ethereum không nằm trong danh sách này. Điều này có thể khiến nhiều người bất ngờ, đặc biệt khi Ethereum có tiềm năng dài hạn rõ ràng. Nhưng bài học ở đây là ngay cả những tài sản phổ biến và mang tính đột phá như ETH cũng không phải lúc nào cũng phù hợp với mọi chiến lược đầu tư. Ví dụ, khi Netflix xuất hiện trong danh sách này vào tháng 12/2004, khoản đầu tư 1.000 USD khi đó đến nay đã có giá trị hơn 650.000 USD. Tương tự, khi Nvidia được đề cập vào tháng 4/2005, 1.000 USD đầu tư ban đầu đã tăng lên hơn 1.067.000 USD tính đến hiện tại. Hiện nay, lợi nhuận trung bình từ các lựa chọn của Stock Advisor đạt mức ấn tượng 1.049%, so với chỉ 185% của chỉ số S&P 500. Thành tích này cho thấy vì sao khuyến nghị của họ có sức nặng—và vì sao các nhà đầu tư nên cân nhắc khám phá những cơ hội đó song song với Ethereum, hoặc thậm chí thay thế ETH trong ngắn hạn. Ngoài Ethereum: Vì sao Bitcoin Hyper có thể trở thành cơ hội lớn tiếp theo Trong khi Ethereum vẫn dẫn đầu tin tức với vai trò là nền tảng hợp đồng thông minh hàng đầu, các nhà đầu tư cũng đang chú ý đến những dự án mới nổi kết hợp khả năng mở rộng, tốc độ và tính ứng dụng với sự bảo mật của Bitcoin. Một trong những ứng viên hứa hẹn nhất là Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER). Khác với nhiều altcoin khác, Bitcoin Hyper được định vị là một giải pháp mở rộng Layer-2 cho Bitcoin, cho phép xử lý hàng nghìn giao dịch mỗi giây, phí cực thấp và hỗ trợ hợp đồng thông minh nhờ tích hợp với Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Điều này có nghĩa là các nhà phát triển có thể xây dựng các ứng dụng phi tập trung phức tạp trên nền tảng Bitcoin—điều vốn chưa từng khả thi trước đây. Với hơn 13 triệu USD huy động trong vòng presale và sự quan tâm ngày càng tăng từ cả nhà đầu tư cá nhân lẫn tổ chức, Bitcoin Hyper nhanh chóng trở thành dự án đáng chú ý trong năm 2025. Đối với những ai tin vào tầm nhìn của Cathie Wood về tính ứng dụng của blockchain, Hyper mang đến một lựa chọn bổ sung: biến Bitcoin từ “vàng kỹ thuật số” thành một mạng lưới có khả năng lập trình như Ethereum. Khi Ethereum vẫn đang đối mặt với những thách thức về khả năng mở rộng và tắc nghẽn mạng, Bitcoin Hyper nổi lên như một giải pháp thay thế sáng tạo, có thể góp phần định hình thế hệ tiếp theo của tài chính phi tập trung và các ứng dụng blockchain.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 08:03:57

The attacks leverage a vulnerability in the May Pectra upgrade that allows externally owned accounts to delegate control to smart contracts, enabling attackers to plant malicious code that instantly drains all incoming ETH and tokens. World Liberty Financial Becomes Latest Victim of Ethereum Exploit According to SlowMist, multiple WLFI token holders have lost their assets after hackers combined private key theft with malicious delegate contract deployment. The exploit technique has matured rapidly since Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade launched May 7, with over 97% of EIP-7702 delegations linked to identical wallet-draining contracts designed to automatically sweep funds.

The vulnerability stems from EIP-7702’s design, which allows EOAs to borrow execution logic from designated smart contracts temporarily. Source: Blockchain Academy Attackers exploit this vulnerability by installing delegate contracts that use the DELEGATECALL function to execute malicious code within the victim’s wallet context, thereby gaining complete control over the storage and funds. Ethereum’s Account Abstraction Dream Becomes Security Nightmare EIP-7702 was designed to enhance Ethereum’s user experience by enabling wallets to execute smart contracts without permanently becoming contract-based addresses. The upgrade aimed to reduce gas fees through bundled transactions and allow settlement using cryptocurrencies other than ETH, supporting Vitalik Buterin’s vision of seamless Web3 adoption . However, the implementation created critical security risks when combined with private key compromise. Hackers pre-install malicious delegate addresses that gain complete wallet control through DELEGATECALL operations, effectively turning victim wallets into attacker-controlled smart contracts while maintaining the original address. Notable incidents include a $1.54 million phishing attack in August, where victims signed disguised batch transactions, and Inferno Drainer’s $146,000 MetaMask wallet drain through malicious delegation authorization. ALERT: An address upgraded to EIP-7702 lost $146,551 through malicious batched transactions in phishing attack. pic.twitter.com/7GbamqOZVI — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) May 24, 2025 The phishing group netted over $9 million across chains in 2025 by convincing users to authorize attacker-controlled delegate contracts. Earlier in June, Wintermute’s research revealed that automated sweeper contracts account for the vast majority of EIP-7702 delegations, creating a systematic threat to Ethereum users. The market maker developed CrimeEnjoyor, a tool that injects warnings into verified malicious contracts stating they are “used by bad guys to automatically sweep all incoming ETH.” Multiple Attack Vectors Emerge From Flawed Upgrade Implementation Beyond World Liberty Financial token theft, EIP-7702 exploitation has enabled diverse attack methods targeting different vulnerability points. Phishing campaigns impersonate trusted DeFi platforms to trick users into signing dangerous batch transactions and delegate approvals, leading to immediate fund drainage upon authorization. Particularly, off-chain signature attacks pose another significant threat with this vulnerability, as it enables hackers to remotely install malicious code in wallets using signed messages rather than on-chain transactions. This method bypasses traditional security measures and operates stealthily, requiring only a compromised signature to grant total wallet control. Similarly, flash loan and reentrancy exploits leverage EIP-7702 features to bypass on-chain security logic, enabling price manipulation attacks against DeFi protocols. Recent contract attacks caused losses approaching one million dollars in established DeFi projects through compromised delegated authorizations. The technical root cause lies in EIP-7702’s delegation mechanism combined with DELEGATECALL operations that execute in the victim’s wallet context. When private keys are compromised through phishing or other means, attackers can set malicious delegate contracts that automatically steal any incoming value. Crypto market maker @wintermute_t has developed a tool that injects on-chain warnings into malicious wallet-draining contracts to alert users. #Ethereum #ETH https://t.co/5NPLiyy4K8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 2, 2025 Security experts recommend avoiding suspicious delegation requests, verifying all transaction permissions, and canceling compromised delegate contracts when possible. However, the fundamental design that allows EOAs to delegate execution creates an attack surface that criminals continue to exploit as the technique matures. Notably, the upgrade increased validator staking limits from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH while introducing auto-compounding features designed to attract conservative institutional capital. While the upgrade aimed to improve user experience and reduce costs, the security trade-offs have overshadowed these benefits as users face wallet-draining threats. The security vulnerabilities have created new attack vectors that criminals rapidly weaponized.

The token went live with a starting price of $1, opening for trade at $0.3, which instantly valued the project at a fully diluted $30 billion. The excitement didn’t stop there. WLFI briefly spiked to $0.33 before pulling back. At the time of writing, WLFI trades at $0.23 with a market cap of $5.88 billion, ranking as the 26th-largest crypto asset, according to CoinMarketCap. Big Transfers Ahead of Launch On-chain data shows significant pre-launch movements. Blockchain analyst @ai_9684xtpa reports that 485 million WLFI tokens, 0.485% of total supply, moved to two addresses tied to Jump Crypto for market-making purposes. That’s 16.2% of the circulating 3 billion tokens across CEX and DEX liquidity pools.

But not everyone was happy. One X user criticized the team: “The WLFI team should have made a vesting contract for both ecosystem tokens and its treasury company Alt5 Sigma. Now CoinMarketCap shows 24B tokens in circulation instead of 5B. The extra 19B isn’t actually circulating, but without a smart contract lock, CMC counts them as unlocked.” The WLFI team confirmed this data discrepancy, insisting real circulation remains at 5B tokens. $WLFI Tokenomics Updated Based on public information, @worldlibertyfi revealed in their Medium article the following allocation: Team and Advisors: 33.5% (TBD) Public Sale: 20% (TBD : 16%) Treasury: 20% (TBD) Community: 10% ALT5: 7.8% Strategic Partners: 5.9% (TBD)… pic.twitter.com/nQn9qSoLoz — Tokenomist (@Tokenomist_ai) September 1, 2025 Tron Founder Bullish on WLFI Tron founder Justin Sun openly endorsed the project, calling it one of the most important developments in crypto: “I truly believe this will be one of the biggest and most important projects in crypto,” Sun said. “We have no plans to sell our unlocked tokens anytime soon.

But early profit-taking, a tokenomics debate, and circulating supply confusion raise short-term risks. For long-term holders like Justin Sun, though, WLFI represents more than a token. It’s part of a bigger financial vision. Whether WLFI stabilizes above launch levels or faces deeper corrections will depend on how quickly the market absorbs early selling pressure, and if the team delivers on its promises.

At this point, the US Department of Commerce announced that macroeconomic data will be transferred to several blockchain networks via oracle providers Chainlink and Pyth. The Department stated that the data will be distributed via Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), Stellar (XLM), Avalanche (AVAX), Arbitrum (ARB), Polygon (POL), and Optimism (OP). Related News: The US Department of Commerce Announces: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and 7 Altcoin Networks Selected for Economic Data While the US government's move to share official economic data on public blockchains has been making waves, the absence of Cardano (ADA), one of the leading altcoins, from this program has drawn attention. Cardono founder Charles Hoskinson addressed this issue at the last AMA session and explained why. At this point, referring to the program's oracle provider, Chainlink (LINK), Hoskinson claimed that ADA was not included in the program because of Chainlink. Hoskinson stated that the problem occurred with Chainlink, the oracle provider that handled the integration process, and that Chainlink submitted an “absurdly high” offer for Cardano’s participation in the project. For this reason, the Cardano network was excluded from the program, Hoskinson stated. Referring to Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, Hoskinson said: “They gave us a ridiculous price for integration. But we'll get through this, we'll find a way…” Sergey is an extremely intelligent man, he sees the future and knows that he is sitting on a golden egg, he knows its value.” This situation has also caught the attention of the community, with some community members saying that despite Cardano maintaining a zero-downtime record for five years, the network still lags behind its competitors in terms of utility and adoption. Hoskinson also recently outlined Cardano's potential partnership targets. He also pointed to partnerships with Aave and the USD1 stablecoin, as well as Chainlink. Stating that USD1, a dollar-indexed stablecoin, is already working on Ethereum, BNB and Tron, Hoskinson said that negotiations are ongoing to bring USD1 to Cardano soon. “I want USD1, I want Aave, I want Chainlink. We're trying to figure out how to do those partnerships.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Why Cardano (ADA) Wasn't Included in the US Data Schedule!

Most altcoins have failed to produce any gains over the past day, including CRO, which continues its substantial correction following the recent mind-blowing rally. BTC Eyes $111K It’s been a tough few weeks for the primary cryptocurrency. The asset peaked at over $124,000 on August 14, but it has been mostly downhill since then. By August 22, it had lost over $12,000 of value before it soared to $117,500 after Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole. However, that was a short-lived rally that was followed by more retracements. Last week, bitcoin dumped below $109,000 for the first time since early July. After another unsuccessful recovery attempt, the bears initiated one more leg down at the start of the current business week that pushed the cryptocurrency to a two-month low of just over $107,000. The bulls finally reemerged at this point and didn’t allow a further breakdown toward $100,000. BTC bounced off and jumped past $109,000 yesterday and up to $110,500 as of now.

There's a 90% chance the Federal Open Markets Committee will cut the federal funds target rate by 25 basis points from its current 4.25%-4.50% range, according to the CME FedWatch tool . A shift toward easier policy could spark renewed demand for leverage, pushing futures premiums higher and breathing life back into a trade that has remained subdued throughout 2025. The basis trade involves buying bitcoin in the spot market or through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) while selling futures (or vice versa) to profit from the price difference. The goal is to capture the spread as it narrows toward expiry, while limiting exposure to bitcoin’s price volatility. With fed funds still just above 4%, an 8% basis — the annualized return on the basis trade — may not look attractive until rate cuts begin to accelerate. Investors are likely to want lower rates to incentivize them to go into the basis trade rather than just holding cash. On CME, bitcoin futures open interest has slumped from more than 212,000 BTC at the start of the year to around 130,000 BTC, according to Glassnode data. This is roughly the level seen when spot bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024. The annualized basis has stayed below 10% all year, according to Velo data , a striking contrast with the 20% seen toward the end of last year. The weakness reflects both market and macro forces: tighter funding conditions, ETF inflows slowing after 2024’s boom and a rotation of risk appetite out of bitcoin. Bitcoin’s compressed trading range has reinforced the trend. Implied volatility, a gauge of expected price swings, is at just 40 after hitting a record low of 35 last week, Glassnode data shows. With volatility suppressed and institutional leverage light, futures premiums have remained capped. If the Fed cuts rates, liquidity conditions could ease, boosting demand for risk assets. That in turn may lift CME futures open interest and revive the basis trade after a year of stagnation.",Markets|CME|open interest|US|Federal Reserve|News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-02 09:16:51

Coinbase and OKX have launched dedicated services for self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) in the region. While Australians have technically been able to hold digital assets in SMSFs for several years, the process often required investors to establish their own structures and manage custody independently. Coinbase and OKX are now addressing those hurdles by offering services that combine custody solutions with referrals to accountants and law firms, along with integrated record-keeping designed to meet strict audit standards. Growing Appetite for Crypto in SMSFs The Australian Tax Office reported that SMSFs represent around a quarter of the nation’s retirement savings, with approximately A$1.7 billion (US$1.1 billion) already invested in cryptocurrencies as of March 2025. That figure has grown sevenfold since 2021, making SMSFs the first segment of the system to show meaningful exposure to digital assets. Coinbase said more than 500 investors have already joined the waiting list for its SMSF product, with many planning to allocate up to A$100,000 each to cryptocurrencies. OKX, which launched a similar offering in June, noted that demand has exceeded expectations, signaling a strong appetite among Australians to diversify retirement holdings with digital assets. Industry observers suggest that the move could help normalize crypto within mainstream financial planning, particularly in a country where SMSFs play a significant role in retirement strategies. By lowering technical barriers, the exchanges are positioning themselves to capture a share of one of the world’s largest retirement systems on a per-capita basis. Global Policy Shifts on Retirement Crypto Australia’s expansion into crypto-backed retirement accounts comes as other major economies debate similar moves. In the United States, Fidelity Investments introduced a Bitcoin 401(k) option in 2022, allowing participants to allocate up to 20% of their retirement savings to Bitcoin if their employers opted in. The product quickly drew scrutiny from the Department of Labor, which at the time urged fiduciaries to show “extreme care” when considering crypto allocations. That stance shifted in May 2025, when the Department formally rescinded its cautionary guidance, giving more discretion to plan sponsors. The momentum grew further on August 7, when the U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors.” With Australia and the U.S. taking decisive steps, the integration of digital assets into retirement systems may be entering a new phase—one that could reshape how individuals around the world plan for long-term savings.

In hindsight, the drop is not so surprising: September is known across equities markets as a poor month for returns and is also known as BTC’s weakest month, yielding average returns of -3.8%, followed by Uptober. This year, capital outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) further highlighted the loss of momentum, with $751 million in net redemptions in August. Right now, “digital gold” is hovering around the $100,000 mark, but some macro developments, for example, the weakening of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), suggest it might be up for a rebound. BTC price prediction To set a BTC price target for September 30, 2025, Finbold’s AI prediction agent used multiple LLMs to generate an average forecast for improved accuracy while incorporating momentum-based indicators into its context. You can experiment with the existing prompts or create your own. Try here now. According to the artificial intelligence (AI) agent, the average BTC price on September 30 will be $101,500, down -7.89% from the current price of $110,191. AI price prediction for BTC, September 30.

Claude 4 Sonnet offered the most negative projection, predicted a BTC price of just $95,000, which translates to a downside of no less than -13.79%.

Source: Finbold Taking a look at Bitcoin’s technicals , it appears that the bearish projections are justified, although there are some early signs that the downside pressure might slow down. The moving average/convergence divergence ( MACD ) remains negative at -1,991, below the signal line at -1,460, which paints a bearish picture. However, the histogram’s slight improvement at -450.86 suggests selling pressure may be easing. On the other hand, the relative strength index ( RSI ) sits at 43, not only underscoring the bearish bias but also leaving room for further weakness as it suggests the digital currency is not yet oversold.

Still, BTC remains well under its 50-day moving average ( MA ) of $115,755, reinforcing the broader downtrend.

Per recent updates, some services have been down for more than three hours, but the team partially recovered others after 20 minutes. According to an update from the blockchain’s developers made on X earlier today, the service interruption occurred shortly after StarkNet rolled out its Grinta upgrade, also known as StarkNet v0.14.0, around 6:00 AM GMT. In a statement posted on X on Sunday, StarkNet cautioned users that there would be a short downtime, explaining that transactions would not be processed during the Grinta upgrade window. The team had estimated about 15 minutes of disruption but admitted that more risks could be involved. “Our team is actively investigating the issue and working to restore full functionality as quickly as possible. We’ll share updates as soon as we know more. Thank you for your patience,” StarkNet wrote . Per Coingecko data, StakNet’s native token STRK fell by more than 3% in the last day to trade at $0.1232, possibly due to the network issues.. Incident timeline and status updates Even after the team gave assurances that the pause would be brief, the network has been experiencing disruptions and delays since Grinta was deployed. According to logs from StarkNet’s status page, users reported several incidents of stutters throughout the evening of Monday and the morning of September 2. Heads up concerning Grinta ⚠️ Grinta (aka Starknet v0.14.0) is a major milestone for Starknet’s architecture, advancing both decentralization and efficiency. Because this upgrade drastically changes Starknet’s core architecture (decentralized sequencer, fee market, mempool…)… — Starknet (@Starknet) August 31, 2025 “Grinta drastically changes StarkNet’s core architecture,” the network’s Sunday post read, mentioning changes to the decentralized sequencer, fee market, and mempool. “During this window, transactions will not be received on Mainnet to avoid incorrect processing once the network is back to normal.” Today, at around 2:28 AM UTC, StarkNet issued a “slow block creation alert” on its network status website, resolving it before posting another update an hour later. That block production was again taking longer than expected, and within the same timeframe, the team confirmed investigations were ongoing. Two hours after the first alert, gateways stopped receiving transactions, triggering an “idle gateways alert.” Though resolved minutes later, the problem recurred at 5:18 and again at 5:28 AM when StarkNet confirmed that transactions were not being accepted. The disruptions continued well into Tuesday daylight hours, with another block creation slowdown reported at 7:08 AM, followed by further issues at 7:18 AM. All incidents were marked as resolved, but the network is reportedly still under close monitoring. StarkNet later announced the outage lasted longer than planned and said engineers were working to restore full performance. The team reiterated that service stability was a priority as the Grinta update continued to be deployed. StarkNet launch Grinta to improve decentralization The Grinta upgrade could push StarkNet toward decentralization, but much of the network is still under StarkWare’s centralized control. Sequencer operations, which handle the ordering of transactions, are still managed by the company. According to StarkNet’s published roadmap, the long-term goal is to distribute block validation and production among several independent nodes. The eventual rollout of decentralized sequencing and proving mechanisms would align the protocol with public blockchain standards, where security is maintained through community-driven consensus. Meanwhile, the outage comes just two weeks after StarkNet announced plans to integrate Bitcoin staking into its ecosystem under proposal SNIP-31. The community approved the developments with a 93.6% vote backing. The integration will allow wrapped Bitcoin assets such as WBTC, LBTC, tBTC, and SolvBTC to participate in the network’s staking system. The consensus model will give Bitcoin a 25% weighting in staking power, while StarkNet’s native token STRK will hold the remaining 75%. StarkNet’s troubles arrived during a period of renewed investor interest in Ethereum, the network on which it is built. According to CoinShares’ latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, Ethereum outpaced Bitcoin in institutional inflows during August. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Investors Eye Avalon X For Double ROI,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/will-eth-price-hit-5000-investors-eye-avalon-x-for-double-roi/,"There’s a quiet confidence in crypto markets right now. The reason for this is, of course, the increased clarity when it comes to regulations. Moreover, the current US government’s outlook towards the industry also looks favourable. After marking its fresh ATH a week back, Ethereum is now being traded at about $4300 . However, analysts claim that a $5000 mark does look quite achievable for the world’s largest altcoin. At the same time, a real-estate-backed presale called Avalon X (AVLX) is getting viral in the market with tangible lifestyle perks that could deliver double-digit ROI in the near term. Can Ethereum Achieve $5,000 Milestone? A few data points make a $5,000 ETH more than just wishful thinking. Spot and institutional interest have returned with strong force. Moreover, recent news highlights strong ETF inflows that are materially increasing bid liquidity into Ethereum products. Additionally, layer-2 ecosystems are also expanding. Total value secured on L2s has climbed into the tens of billions, absorbing user activity and improving throughput while still settling to ETH’s base layer. This growing L2 activity translates into more settlement demand and higher fee capture for Ethereum. On the supply side, staking remains a persistent structural force. Over 30 million ETH is now staked across the network. This is a meaningful portion of the circulating supply that tightens available float and magnifies price response to incoming demand. So, there are more than enough reasons to believe in ETH reaching $5000 in the near future. Why are Investors Betting on Avalon X Over Ethereum? What makes Avalon X stand out today is the combination of real assets, healthy token design, and conversion mechanics. Backed by Grupo Avalon’s property developments in the Dominican Republic, AVLX is built as a utility token. Yes, it is not a property title. It rather gives you real, repeatable experiences in the form of discounted stays, concierge perks, and memberships that make you feel like a VIP. Its fixed 2 billion token supply, and burn mechanics are designed to reward longer-term participants. Moreover, the whitepaper gives you a clear view of the product and its utility. The project aims to create a sustainable demand for itself by delivering real value and not relying on hype. The presale also runs major giveaways that are going viral on social media. Primarily, there is a live $1 million AVLX token giveaway that can be won by 10 users who will get $100k each. There is also a second giveaway in which you can win an Eco Valley townhouse . Should You Pair ETH and Avalon X? Having Avalon X in your portfolio right now can be a brilliant strategy. Exploring the growing RWA industry, moreover, AVLX, being a new project, has many more chances of giving you 10x multiples in a short time. Fundamentally, both Avalon X have great long-term potential.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the finest ones available. During presale phase 6 MUTM is priced at $0.035. First users will be able to see over 500% growth after the token is listed. Presale already collected over $15.25 million with over 15,950 participants. The DeFi protocol has been attracting attention due to the new opportunities it provides for borrowing and liquidity provision. So both new and experienced traders are interested. Amidst the volatility of the altcoin market, Mutuum Finance has emerged as a shining example of a new DeFi project. Ethereum Faces Pullback but Maintains Strong Year Outlook Ethereum is selling for just under $4,480 compared to its close from earlier today of about $4,955. The dip reflects the reactions to market and profit-taking by large holders. Perhaps institutional money still is piling up in ETH funds, still believing that Ethereum will rise to $5,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, investors have also started to put their sights on new DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Launches $50,000 Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance has launched a Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK, inviting white-hat hackers, developers, and security researchers to participate. Participants can earn rewards of up to 50,000 USDT based on the severity of the vulnerabilities they discover, ranging from minor bugs to high-impact security issues. This hierarchical reward model enhances platform security, safeguards user funds, and reinforces investor trust in the Mutuum Finance ecosystem. $100,000 Community Giveaway to Reward Supporters In addition to its Bug Bounty Programme, Mutuum Finance is allocating $100,000 to host a community giveaway as a reward to early adopters and help build its user base. The programme will provide 10 recipients with 10,000 USD each which shows the enthusiasm of the project to build a long-term and energetic community. Corporate Volatility and Asset Liquidity Ensuring there is enough liquidity on the chain to clear distressed positions without excessive slippage is vital to achieving the best possible outcomes. Enable existence and specification of caps and liquidation parameters (LPs) for supporting exposure and leading to sharper incentives under a liquidity tightening process on the part of liquidators, LTV and liquidation. In addition, assets that are characterized by a low volatility will have higher LTV and liquidation thresholds than their higher volatility counterparts. Risk ratings can also be used to define reserve objectives, to create a balance between decentralised engagement and the safety requirements provided by the protocol. One of Mutuum Finance’s goals is to provide a secure platform and a caring institution, one where users, token holders, and investors can share in success. Phase 6 Presale Gathers Critical Marks Mutuum Finance is one such emerging force in the DeFi market that has onboarded 15,950 investors and has raised more than $15.25 million in presale contributions within a relatively short period. The project is currently in Stage 6 of their presale with tokens priced at $0.035. For early investors this stage provides an excellent profit opportunity by buying before the token consideration increases in the following stages. While Ethereum has recently pulled back near $4,480, prompting many investors to reassess their positions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing strong upward momentum. With over $15.25 million raised, more than 15,950 investors already onboard, and presale tokens still available at $0.035 before the next stage increase, MUTM is rapidly positioning itself as a leading altcoin contender in the DeFi sector. Secure your position in Phase 6 now to maximize potential upside ahead of its listing rally.

Are You Prepared?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-proponent-something-huge-is-coming-are-you-prepared/,"Gordon, a self-proclaimed crypto multi-millionaire and outspoken proponent of XRP, recently made a brief yet attention-grabbing statement on social media. In his post, he wrote: “Something HUGE is coming. Are you paying attention?” While the message was short, it carried a tone of urgency, suggesting that Gordon believes a significant development in the crypto space is imminent. Known for his consistent support of XRP and his positioning as an early mover in the industry, Gordon’s words drew reactions from a variety of users within the crypto community. Something HUGE is coming. Are you paying attention? — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) September 1, 2025 Responses From the Community The tweet immediately attracted responses that reflected different perspectives on the market and its future. Crypto Crib, another voice within the space, responded by stating : “We are, that’s how we stay ahead of the market.” This reply underscored the importance of staying vigilant and informed as a crypto investor or trader. Another response came from an X user who took a more critical and reflective stance. This user repeated Gordon’s words, “Something HUGE is coming,” but contrasted it with their view that the market has already been in a drawn-out state of high tension since 2020. They described this period as being comparable to a prolonged and unfinished event, stating , “The cutscene just hasn’t finished rendering yet.” In their view, market participants are not necessarily early or privileged in recognizing possible shifts, but are simply observing what has been unfolding for years. Their comments emphasized that many within the space are not waiting for signals but are actively building and preparing regardless of broad declarations about what may come. Crypto Daddy, another participant in the discussion, offered a more balanced perspective. His comment, “huge is relative, but yeah, always paying attention,” suggested that while he acknowledges the potential for major developments, he sees scale and impact as subjective. For him, the act of paying attention to ongoing changes remains a constant, regardless of whether an event qualifies as “huge.” Implications for XRP Holders While Gordon did not provide further context to clarify what he was referring to, his message resonated particularly within the XRP community, where anticipation of major institutional, legal, or market developments has been ongoing. The responses show that the community is divided between optimism, caution, and a measured approach to declarations about transformative events. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For XRP holders , the key takeaway lies in readiness. Some believe that something substantial is indeed approaching, whether that involves regulatory clarity, partnerships, or broader adoption of blockchain solutions tied to XRP . Others, however, stress that preparation and building should continue without depending on sudden announcements or predictions.

51063146,571435,1756805428,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51063146.jpeg,Crypto Influencers’ Insane Hidden Payouts Exposed By ZachXBT,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-influencers-insane-hidden-payouts-exposed/,"Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT has published what he calls a “price sheet of 200+ crypto influencers and their wallet addresses” tied to a recent promotional push, igniting a fresh backlash over undisclosed ads on Crypto Twitter. “From 160+ accounts who accepted the deal I only saw wrote , adding that the spreadsheet includes addresses and transaction links used to pay creators. How Much Crypto Influencers Secretly Make Three screenshots of the ledger show columns listing X profiles, quoted fees per post, recipient wallet addresses, and links to Solana block explorer pages. The sheet also assigns “Tier” labels that appear to bucket accounts by perceived reach or value. Payments vary widely, from lower three-figure sums to five-figure and even one extreme five-figure outlier, with ZachXBT emphasizing that the documentation is on-chain. “60K is not a typo here’s the transaction hash to the KOLs wallet for payment… the wallets / txns on the sheet are legit,” he stated, posting the hash. ZachXBT stressed that the dataset does not represent the entire industry, explaining it reflects a single campaign. “It’s all of the KOLs from a single project (I didn’t compile),” he said. His central critique targets non-disclosure rather than the practice of paid promotion itself. “Have stated multiple times there’s nothing wrong with influencers doing paid promotion as long as: 1) you genuinely believe in the project 2) you disclose to your followers,” he wrote. He also underscored the regulatory dimension: “Yes it’s illegal in most jurisdictions but just is rarely enforced.” The leak quickly set off a wave of incredulity and finger-pointing. Commenters zeroed in on a listed $60,000 payment for a single post to the account @Atitty_. When asked “why are they getting 60k for a single post,” ZachXBT replied, “Seems they do small giveaway posts to farm engagement from people in developing countries.” Others focused on the broader disclosure problem. “It’s wild people in crypto don’t see the need to alert their following with a #ad at the end of the post,” wrote Erick (@EB7). ZachXBT agreed, reiterating that transparency is the crux: “Agreed there’s nothing wrong with paid promotions when you disclose and it’s a project you genuinely believe in.” The ten highest-priced placements visible in Tier-1 include @atitty_ at $60,000 per post (one post listed); @sibeleth at $10,000 per post (one); @MediaGiraffes at $5,000 per post on a $10,000/two-post package (two); @ApeMP5 at roughly $4,250 per video on an $8,500/2-video package (two); @DaoKwonDo at approximately $2,166 per post on a $6,500 package; @herrocrypto at $2,500 per post on a $5,000/two-post package (two); @fuelkek at $2,500 per post on a $5,000/two-post package (two); @TedPillows at $2,250 per post on a $9,000/four-post package (four); @EddyXBT at $2,000 per post on a $12,000/six-post package (six); and @Regrets10x at $2,000 per post on an $8,000/four-post package (four). The thread also captured collateral allegations swirling around individual personalities and account quality. Community member Loshmi revived earlier accusations that @xiacalls rebranded and “changed his complete female appearance,” claiming “people still pay him NEARLY $2000 bucks for 2 paid promos.” ZachXBT’s response was curt—“Many such cases”—and he later suggested many of the accounts in the spreadsheet are either newcomers or artificially boosted, saying, “Most of them are from the most recent class of CT or are just botted accounts .” Beyond the headline numbers, the screenshots illuminate how industrialized the pay-for-post market has become. Rows enumerate per-post price cards, bundle offers, and “package” deals, with dedicated fields for payment addresses and “PAID – SOL SCAN” links that appear designed for quick auditability. That level of bookkeeping, juxtaposed with claims of widespread non-disclosure, is what makes the leak so combustible: it offers a rare, structured glimpse into how some campaigns are organized, priced, and settled on-chain while the public output often reads like organic enthusiasm. ZachXBT’s position, repeated throughout the exchange, is not to vilify paid placements but to force a reckoning with transparency norms that other online advertising markets have largely internalized. “It’s about 155/160 accounts not disclosing,” he wrote, calling the situation “still a big problem in the industry after so many years.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.77 trillion.",Crypto News|crypto|Crypto influencer|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|ZachXBT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|ZRX|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 09:30:28

Woo suggested that charts could form a head-and-shoulders pattern in September, designed to alarm traders into selling, only for the setup to be invalidated in October. “This would trap paper-handed traders, forcing them to buy higher,” he explained, adding that this type of pattern has appeared before. Historical Precedent Offers Clues According to Woo’s projection, Ether (ETH), currently valued at $4,392, may dip toward support levels near $3,350 during September. The downside could reverse in October, with momentum building toward a fresh all-time high in November. A similar sequence unfolded in 2021, when ETH declined by 30% from $3,950 to $2,750 in September, only to recover and post record highs in November. That historical context is feeding optimism among those who see September’s weakness as a setup rather than a breakdown. Traders Anticipate Range Movements Fellow trader “Daan Crypto Trades” expressed a similar perspective, noting that Ether has been consolidating within a tight range. He wrote on X that ETH has been “chopping everyone up” in the $4,300 to $4,500 zone. A retest of the lower range, near $4,160 and aligned with the four-hour 200 moving average, could present “an interesting spot” for traders watching key technical signals. Fundamentals Over Technicals However, some market professionals are less convinced that short-term chart patterns are worth following. Henrik Andersson, chief investment officer at Apollo Capital, argued that traders should be cautious about overreliance on historical setups. “My view is that it’s generally more prudent to focus on fundamental analysis rather than relying on what can often be spurious historical patterns,” Andersson said. He added that past trends may provide some insight but are not a reliable foundation for predictions in a fast-changing crypto environment. OKX Singapore CEO Gracie Lin echoed that sentiment, highlighting macroeconomic and structural forces as more relevant drivers of Ether’s future. “Macro events like US jobs data (out this Friday) and the Fed’s upcoming rate decision will likely bring short-term volatility, but the real story is structural,” Lin said. She emphasized that Ethereum’s role in powering stablecoin flows and benefiting from regulatory clarity will underpin long-term growth regardless of short-lived pullbacks. Ether’s Current Price Action Despite the broader debate, Ether continues to show weakness. The asset fell to $4,238 during intraday trading before recovering to $4,374 at press time. That leaves it 11.7% below its all-time high, but analysts point out this retreat is far less severe than earlier September corrections. Some see that as evidence the market may be preparing for another rebound as October approaches.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MARKET|ASIA,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-02 09:36:21

However, he added that these assets are unlikely to replace the traditional safeguards offered by the current financial system. The Mastercard executive stated that the company currently has no publicly announced plans to develop its own blockchain infrastructure, but that the option isn't completely ruled out. This approach suggests Mastercard is pursuing a cautious yet open-ended strategy in the crypto space. Experts, noting the recent increase in interest in crypto assets from major financial institutions, say Mastercard's stance signals a more balanced and regulatory-focused approach to the sector. The company appears to view crypto as a complementary tool, particularly in the areas of payment technologies and international money transfers. This statement is considered an important clue about how the bridge between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem will take shape. *This is not investment advice.

51063959,571736,1756806790,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51063959.jpeg,"Data Shows Bitcoin Could Dip Lower in September, But Bitcoin Hyper Remains a Solid Investment",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-could-slump-in-september-bitcoin-hyper-a-safe-buy/,"Bitcoin’s up 1.62% over the past 24 hours, managing to push beyond $110K, as the 24-hour trading volume is 25% in the green. Despite these favorable numbers, September’s Bitcoin looks weak and we should see further dips by October. At least this is what historical data is suggesting. Based on previous yearly performances, Bitcoin is likely to close September in the red, despite 2023 and 2024 showing consistent gains of 3.99% and 7.11% respectively, according to CryptoRank . Despite this, Bitcoin’s previous six years were in the red with losses of up to 14%, which casts an ominous vibe on the coin’s next 30 days. On the other hand, October and November have almost always been profitable for Bitcoin and this time should be no different. Especially with the GENIUS Act having been signed into law . This means that Bitcoin should turn bullish as the year comes to a close, with Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $13.4M presale seeing a massive investor surge on the side. Bitcoin Could See Aggressive Correction Several catalysts may hinder Bitcoin’s growth over the next month. One is the institutional fatigue, as whales move capital from Bitcoin to Ethereum and other stablecoins. On the good side of things, this is most likely due to the whales preparing for the September dip and doing some side quests until the main story resumes. Moves like these fuel the market’s negative sentiment, which explains why the Fear & Greed Index stands at 39 points on the Fear meter. The resulting snowball effect could take Bitcoin even lower in the charts. A failure to retest the $107K support level could cause a crash to $103K due to the cumulative pressure. And that’s when Michael Saylor’s Strategy will likely make its move. Strategy has already bought three dips in August, acquiring 3,666 $BTC for a total investment of $426M, which didn’t necessarily rally the market. However, this time may be different, given that Bitcoin is already entering a bullish phase, according to past performances. Strategy riding a September dip could bring investors back and fuel Bitcoin’s coming bull phase. We may even see a new ATH by the end of October. If that happens, Bitcoin Hyper is likely to receive even more attention, as the presale has already seen impressive numbers. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Offers Bitcoin Faster and Cheaper Transactions Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is Bitcoin’s official Layer-2 upgrade that aims to solve Bitcoin’s most pressing problem: its native performance limitation. Bitcoin’s network is capped at seven transactions per second (TPS), which places it on the 26th position on the list of the fastest blockchains by TPS . To put that into perspective, Solana has maximum theoretical TPS of 65K. This means Bitcoin’s transactions are slow, expensive, and cannot ensure scalability, which means Bitcoin is essentially incompatible with the institutional environment. Hyper aims to change that with tools like the Canonical Bridge and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The role of the Canonical Bridge is to decongest Bitcoin’s native network by minting your $BTC onto Hyper’s Layer-2. This results in faster confirmation times – seconds rather than hours – and an overall higher on-chain performance, with smoother traffic and, importantly, lower fees. The SVM, meanwhile, enables the ultra-fast execution of smart contracts, bringing Bitcoin’s performance to Solana-level numbers. Together, these tools will make Bitcoin scalable and able to support DeFi, dApps, and more. The presale has raised more than $13.4M since it started, with a current token price of $0.012845 – and you can stake it for 81% APY. Thanks to Hyper’s roadmap and scope, $HYPER could see a massive post-launch boom. Our analysts’ price prediction for $HYPER places the token at around $0.32 by the end of 2025. By 2030, $HYPER could reach $1.50 or higher, for an ROI of 11,577%. If that’s not an investment incentive, nothing is. If you want to learn how to buy $HYPER , check out our step-by-step guide. Then visit the official Bitcoin Hyper presale website to buy your tokens today. October Bitcoin is the Best Bitcoin Bitcoin could experience a dip in September, but that’s not cast in stone. Either way, October looks set to fire $BTC up as the GENIUS Act makes progress and investors turn in their side assets for another dose of Bitcoin. When that happens, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could well experience a surge in investors, driving $HYPER into the spotlight. Don’t take this as financial advice. Do your own research and invest wisely.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has increased to $855.2 in the past 24 hours. If traders continue buying tokens, the BNB price might see a further jump, and the next target could be above $868. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,654.04 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $855.2, but it may find resistance around $868. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 1.22 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $1000 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,654.04 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

It is important to consider that the predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested before investing in the volatile market. Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. Heading into September, BNB is trading at approximately $854.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-02 09:55:00

That’s above the European Central Bank’s 2% target, and the miss didn’t go unnoticed. According to data from CNBC, the day began with the British pound down 0.9% against the dollar by 9:38 a.m. in London. Concerns over the U.K.’s public finances pushed the Sterling into the red early, dragging risk sentiment down with it. Traders were already nervous over tariff headlines and shaky global markets. Markets in Europe lose ground as inflation rattles traders Indexes across Europe opened weaker and stayed red most of the day. The FTSE 100 fell 0.4%. Germany’s DAX slid 0.88%. The FTSE MIB in Italy dropped 0.46%. France’s CAC 40 barely moved, trading flat. And the broader Stoxx Europe 600 index shed 0.6%. The inflation readout caught many off guard. Most economists polled by Reuters had expected the number to stay unchanged at 2%. But the jump, though small, pushed the euro zone slightly out of the ECB’s comfort range. Core inflation , which strips out volatile items like food and energy, stayed flat at 2.3%. The services sector, which had been pushing inflation higher earlier in the year, dipped slightly from 3.2% in July to 3.1% in August. That wasn’t enough to calm fears. The mood turned more cautious after comments from Gediminas Simkus, a Governing Council member of the European Central Bank. Speaking to Econostream Media, Simkus said, “I would not be surprised if Santa Claus comes with scissors.” He hinted that a rate cut could land in December, adding that a cut might even be discussed in October if the data worsens. Simkus then added that:- “It’s more true than not that another reduction is coming.” He also warned that there are “many forces now at work that point to lower future inflation,” but risks to both inflation and the broader economy are “still tilted to the downside.” Stocks across banking, healthcare, and private equity react to the chaos Corporate names didn’t escape the selloff. The biggest gainer on the Stoxx 600 was Partners Group, a Swiss private markets investment firm. The stock jumped after it reported 578 million Swiss francs ($720 million) in first-half profit, beating the 570 million expected by analysts. The company said the bump came from higher performance fees. On the flip side, Fresenius Medical Care took a heavy hit. The German healthcare company dropped 5.5% after UBS analysts downgraded the stock to ‘Sell.’ That sent it straight to the bottom of the Stoxx 600 leaderboard, erasing previous gains. The banking sector had its own drama. In Italy , Monte dei Paschi, backed by the state, increased its takeover bid for Mediobanca. The revised offer added a cash component of €0.90 per share ($1.05), on top of the original deal that offered 2.533 Monte shares for each Mediobanca share. That new mix gave the offer an 11.4% premium based on Mediobanca’s closing price on January 23. But Mediobanca has been pushing back against the deal since the start of the year and has refused to accept the all-stock proposal. The updated offer remains on the table until September 8.

It’s not just the most popular cryptocurrency; it also has the largest market cap at $2.1T. It’s no wonder, then, that institutional investors are rushing to claim a share of that huge Bitcoin market. Strategy is currently the largest Bitcoin treasury, with 632,457 $BTC in its possession , accounting for around 3% of the total supply. In other words, if you’re going to invest in crypto, Bitcoin is the one to buy. The Bitcoin Blockchain: Secure But Slow and Inflexible Although considered the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, Bitcoin isn’t likely to win any awards for transaction speed. Theoretically speaking, the Bitcoin blockchain can only handle up to seven transactions per second (TPS). However, it can typically handle less because of network congestion. In comparison, Ethereum ($ETH) and Solana ($SOL) can potentially reach up to 119.1 TPS and 65K TPS, respectively. Because of this, it can take days for the Bitcoin blockchain to confirm transactions. This causes congestion, which makes transactions costly. Bitcoin is also known for its security, thanks to its simplified script . But this comes at the cost of its flexibility. You can’t use Bitcoin for things like advanced smart contracts, dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFTs. This is unlike Ethereum and Solana, which are why they’re the go-to chains for meme coin developers. Bitcoin Hyper: Taking Bitcoin to the Fast Lane We can argue that tweaking Bitcoin’s code can make it faster and expand its utility. This is possible, but we’ll have to trade its robust security to achieve those goals. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . This project aims to develop a Bitcoin Layer 2, a protocol that will process transactions outside of the base Bitcoin blockchain to help speed them up. As this will be built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, it will retain Bitcoin’s security. You can think of the L2 as a fast lane on Bitcoin’s crowded highway. Using the L2, transactions will be much faster and cheaper than on the main blockchain. Here’s a brief look at how the L2 will work: Deposit your $BTC to a Bitcoin address monitored by Bitcoin Hyper’s Canonical Bridge A Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) will verify the coin After verification, a Bitcoin of the same value will be minted on the L2 This wrapped Bitcoin can be used on the L2 for various applications like staking, trading, and interacting with dApps; transactions will reach Solana-level speeds, thanks to the SVM The state of the L2 is constantly committed to the L1 to ensure everything is synchronized and secure If you want to withdraw your $BTC from the L2, simply create a withdrawal request Once validated, you’ll get your $BTC back to your Bitcoin address on L1 When launched, Bitcoin Hyper will be able to take $BTC to heights it has never reached before. Want to learn more about the project? Check out our piece on ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper?’ . Join the Bitcoin Hyper Presale The Bitcoin Hyper team is running a presale to make the Bitcoin Layer 2 a reality. To date, it has already raised a whopping $13.4M, making it one of the year’s best presales . Helping boost the project fundraiser are two massive whale buys in the last 24 hours, one worth $19,224 and the other valued at $11,629 . For now, you can purchase tokens for $0.012845 and claim them once the presale concludes. However, when the L2 launches, your coins will help you unlock exclusive features and participate in DAO decisions. Of course, you’ll also be able to use it to pay for gas fees within Bitcoin Hyper. $HYPER’s value has the potential to reach $1.50 by 2030. Find out how this is possible in our ‘Bitcoin Hyper Price Prediction’ . To get $HYPER, visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website , connect your crypto wallet to the presale widget, enter the amount you want to buy, and pay with your credit/debit card or crypto. Our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide has more details on getting your hands on the token. If you prefer to stake, you’ll be able to enjoy 81% p.a. rewards once you lock in your tokens. Remember that this can still change as more people stake the $HYPER they purchased. Buy Bitcoin Hyper tokens today. Bitcoin: Better Than Ever Before When it comes to cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is virtually untouchable. Valuable, secure, and popular, we don’t expect any other coin to unseat it from its throne anytime soon. With projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the Bitcoin ecosystem can be faster, have cheaper transactions, and offer more flexibility than ever before. Things can only get better from the world’s biggest crypto from here.

Traders now eye a potential 40× upside, driven by ETF hope, whale accumulation, and technical setups. Amid that buzz, altcoins capturing headlines include Remittix (RTX) , whose real-world payments model and upcoming PayFi tools offer a sharp contrast to speculation. The $250,000 giveaway and Q3 wallet beta launch amplify its visibility among trend-seeking investors. Let us measure how Solana’s technical recovery stacks against Remittix’s emerging momentum. Solana Price Stands Firm Above $200 With Bullish Signals Solana Price recently cleared the $200 mark and is trading around $201, buoyed by a 17 % weekly gain and institutional inflows after highs near $217. Volume is rising, and technical charts show a clean rebound from the 50-day EMA near $173. If $205 resistance falls, targets around $270 to $280 appear realistic. Rising open interest and bullish momentum suggest confidence, though any dip below $200 may test support toward $190. The Solana Price recovery anchors optimism for a broader breakout, especially if ETF developments happen. Remittix Tipped As The Real x40 Opportunity Remittix is surfacing alongside Solana Price in chatter about future 40× plays, yet its foundation is fundamentally different. Where Solana Price gains rest on technical and speculative factors, Remittix builds on PayFi utility and user-first growth. The token is priced at $0.103, has sold over 639 million tokens, and raised over $23.2 million. It achieved a listing on BitMart after surpassing $20 million, then added a second centralized exchange listing on LBANK after exceeding $22 million. A Q3 wallet beta launch is on the way, and a $250,000 community giveaway is live to drive engagement. These qualities place Remittix on a unique trajectory: Direct crypto to bank transfers in more than 30 countries Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Built for adoption, not for speculation Utility first token powering real transaction volume Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth Remittix may not reflect Solana Price’s rebound, but it offers an alternate route. If real use of traction hits, the altcoin could outpace tokens that rely on technical rallies, making its 40× potential plausible on product and utility rather than hype. Why Remittix Could Be The Breakout Story While Solana Fights Resistance Solana Price has reasserted strength above $200, supported by rising volume, institutional accumulation, and a technical structure that could push it toward $270 to $280. That path depends on sustaining momentum and overcoming resistance hurdles. Remittix, though operating in a different lane, presents a compelling narrative for investors chasing growth rooted in payments infrastructure, not just charts. With robust funding, dual exchange listings, a wallet launch, and an active community giveaway, Remittix stands as a trending altcoin whose potential gains may truly be built to last.

Recent performance shows the market waiting for its next spark, while Solana continues to flash short-term rallies on crypto charts. Yet the real conversation among traders looking for short-term ROI is starting to shift toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale project designed with a structural edge that has investors expecting a 1000%+ breakout once it lists. ETH Gains Slowing Down Ethereum (ETH) saw its upward momentum taper, trading at ~$4,350 as of September 1, 2025, with a 24-hour trading volume of $37.07 billion, up just 1.2% weekly. The slowdown follows a $346.46 million liquidation event and a dip in spot ETF inflows to $200 million, compared to $341 million the prior week. Technical indicators show ETH testing $4,150 support, with RSI at 48 and resistance at $4,500. Whale rotation of $75 million into long positions persists, but macro pressures like U.S. tariffs and Federal Reserve uncertainty weigh on sentiment. Social media reflects cautious optimism, citing the Pectra upgrade and regulatory clarity. Analysts project a $4,868 target if $4,500 clears, but a drop below $4,150 risks $4,000. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Roadmap That Points to Expansion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not positioning itself as another speculative altcoin. Instead, it will introduce a complete decentralized finance ecosystem backed by a stablecoin system that will maintain its $1 value through overcollateralized loans, governance-controlled borrowing rates, and arbitrage activity. Every loan will be protected by collateral worth more than what is borrowed, interest rates will be adjusted by community governance to maintain peg stability, and arbitrage traders will ensure alignment with dollar value by buying or selling whenever price gaps appear. The roadmap is structured to deliver lasting growth. Phase 1 of development has already delivered presale launch, audits, and marketing traction. Next, the project will move into Phase 2, where core smart contracts, advanced analytics tools, and the first front-end deployments will be built. A testnet release will follow, bringing a live demo environment for community and auditor testing before mainnet launch. From there, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will move toward regulatory compliance, multi-chain expansion, and strategic partnerships with institutions. Presale momentum adds confidence to this roadmap. Phase 6 has raised $15.24 million so far, with 32% of tokens already sold to more than 15,950 holders. The entry price currently sits at $0.035, and the next step will lift it to $0.040, pushing early buyers into instant gains as the presale advances. For retail investors comparing crypto prices, this entry point represents a ground-floor opportunity ahead of a long-term run. Price Discovery, Liquidity, and Ecosystem Rewards Fair valuation will be a key advantage for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project will integrate Chainlink oracle feeds to ensure collateral assets are always priced accurately, while fallback oracles will provide backup protection against downtime. Aggregated data sources will reduce risks of centralization, and time-weighted pricing from decentralized exchanges will safeguard the system from manipulation. This multi-layered approach will build trust in the platform’s valuation methods, ensuring every position is properly collateralized and liquidations are executed fairly. Liquidity management will also be automated for long-term sustainability. Borrowing rates will be dynamically set based on utilization of available capital. When liquidity is abundant, lower rates will encourage more borrowing, while tighter markets will see rates rise to attract fresh deposits and encourage repayments. This mechanism will ensure a balanced system where users can always access lending without risking systemic shortages. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also deliver staking opportunities for investors who want to put their mtTokens to work. By staking, users will earn MUTM rewards directly from smart contracts. To strengthen token demand further, the protocol will direct revenue streams into a buyback model, where MUTM will be repurchased from open markets and redistributed, creating lasting support for token value. Final Verdict Credibility is reinforced through transparency. The project has already secured a CertiK audit, and future phases will introduce a bug bounty program rewarding testers up to $2,000 for identifying vulnerabilities. A $100,000 giveaway campaign and an active community with over 12,000 Twitter followers will keep engagement strong, while institutional partnerships will open doors to larger adoption once the platform matures. For investors weighing ETH’s slower growth or SOL’s volatile gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a rare blend of accessibility and upside. With the presale at $0.035 and a direct price increase to $0.040 around the corner, the timing favors early movers who act before the presale closes. Traders are now positioning this project as the real 1000% runner of the cycle, one that will not only join the ranks of major crypto coins but reshape how decentralized finance operates.

Price has been riding an ascending trendline since early July, and every dip has been met with steady buying. That setup has traders asking the same question — is ADA still one of the best altcoins to buy now? Growing Ecosystem and On-Chain Activity The ecosystem of Cardano continues to expand at a healthy rate. The network has over $320 million in total value locked on the DeFi platforms with over 4.5 million daily active addresses. There is actual usage of that activity, not speculation only. Beyond that, treasury actions such as converting a portion of ADA into stablecoins and Bitcoin point to a more long-term strategy to enhance liquidity and enhance the ecosystem. Technical Setup Points to More Upside ADA is experiencing critical bullish patterns on chart. This run was prepared by the double-bottom of 0.58-$0.60, and now $0.82 is the critical zone of support. Fibonacci retracement levels depict a strong buying pressure at the $0.618 mark as well, which has led to several rallies. It is near resistance at $0.95 and even more at $1.00 and moving above $1.00 may be the beginning of a bigger rally. Their loss of control over bulls may occur should the price fall below $0.75. However, so long as the ADA does not fall beneath its trendline the upward scenario remains open. Green and School Approved The proof-of-stake system is one of the features of Cardano that make it stand out. Unlike proof-of-work coins, Ouroboros consumes very little energy, which is attractive to environmentally friendly investors. The credibility is further enhanced by the fact that the development of Cardano is premised on peer-reviewed research. Large institutions such as Franklin Templeton already began to operate Cardano nodes, which is a good sign that big players are taking ADA seriously. This kind of support is useful in improving trust particularly since the regulations in crypto are becoming tighter. Emerging Altcoins in the Market Cardano with a price of $0.82 holds it squarely on the radar of being one of the best altcoins to keep an eye on – and analysts are now making the same mention about MAGACOIN FINANCE. They regard its utility-based model and initial growth opportunities similar to those of Cardano in the initial period of its development. This is why both the projects are being put down as solid choices going into the next altcoin cycle. Final Word The technical outlook of Cardano is still bullish, and as long as it remains above $0.82, there will be a way to reach $1.00. MAGACOIN FINANCE is also beginning to attract the interest of investors outside ADA, with some describing it among the best altcoins to buy today.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin is continuing the good work it did yesterday, when it closed nearly 1% in the green. So far today, it’s up another 1.30%, currently trading above the $110K mark. This move sets the token up nicely for a rebound, and the signs are already showing. On the 4-hour chart, $BTC has just broken out of a downward-sloping trendline that supported its August decline after hitting new ATHs. The next few hours could prove crucial in deciding Bitcoin’s direction for the week, as the token is now pushing above the 50 EMA, with the 200 EMA next in line on the 4-hour chart. Even better, this bounce is coming right off the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level on the weekly chart, further reinforcing the view that $BTC has had enough consolidation and is now primed to rally higher. Bitcoin Hyper Prepares for Raoul Pal’s $100T Crypto Future September 2, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, predicts the crypto market could grow from $4T today to $100T by 2034. He shared this outlook on X , noting that crypto is spreading twice as fast as the internet did in its early years. Pal expects user numbers to reach 4B by 2030, or one in eight people, driven by mobile access and declining trust in fiat currencies. This forecast suggests crypto could become one of the world’s largest asset classes. And as adoption accelerates, so does the demand for scalable infrastructure.

OKX, Coinbase to Offer Products for Australian SMSFs—Time to Buy Best Wallet Token? September 2, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Two of the largest crypto exchanges will offer products catering to self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) in Australia, according to a Bloomberg report. While OKX already launched a product in June, Coinbase is expected to roll out its own soon. The move signals growing government adoption of cryptocurrencies.

For individuals, this could boost their confidence in crypto as an alternative asset to traditional ones, such as bonds, ETFs, and term deposits. In Australia, crypto adoption is growing among individuals , nearly doubling from 16.8% in 2021 to 32.5% in 2025.

As mature blockchains settle in, investors are now looking at tokens that provide utility and adoption. Among the projects in focus is Remittix (RTX) , whose Q3 launch of a beta wallet and presale milestones have been announced. It is intended to simplify payments and transfers with an efficient layer of innovation connecting digital assets to real use. Solana And Cardano Trading Environment Cardano trades at $0.8145 at present, down 0.78% in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization is $29.1 billion supported by a trading volume of $1.33 billion, up over 105% more. These figures confirm Cardano’s present strength as one of the largest proof-of-stake networks. Solana, meanwhile, is at $200.44, falling 0.67% within a single day. With market capitalization standing at $108.34 billion and trade volume at $6.56 billion, up 40.17%, Solana remains a key driving force for scalability-driven development.

His comment came in response to an exchange with Grok, where he asked what XRP’s price would be by the end of 2025 if spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved in October of that year. James Rule XRP’s statement highlights his belief that market conditions, regulatory clarity, and institutional inflows could push XRP significantly higher than many projections suggest. By framing $8 as a conservative estimate, he is signaling confidence in the potential scale of growth XRP may achieve if an ETF approval materializes in late 2025. Grok’s Response to the Scenario Grok emphasized that predicting an exact price is speculative, given the factors influencing digital asset markets. The answer outlined several variables, including institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions, and broader regulatory developments. Despite this caution, Grok provided a reasoned range based on available data and analyses from research platforms. One key point raised was the potential for institutional inflows following ETF approval, with estimates ranging from $5 billion to $15 billion by December 2025. Such inflows could create demand for XRP and help reduce volatility. Grok also noted that the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals in 2024 resulted in significant price increases, suggesting that XRP could follow a similar pattern if approved. Forecasts from Industry Analysts The response incorporated forecasts from multiple sources. Coinpedia projected XRP could range between $2.28 and $3.20 by December 2025, while Ainvest suggested XRP could surpass $5 with ETF approval, citing inflows of $10–$15 billion as a key driver. Other forecasts, such as those from BitcoinEthereumNews and Mitrade, placed October 2025 prices between $3.05 and $3.47, with potential for further growth by December. Finder’s expert panel estimated an average of $2.80 by year-end 2025 but acknowledged upside potential if ETFs were approved. Polymarket and Bloomberg both reflected high confidence, placing approval odds between 87 and 95 percent, which would likely catalyze additional price appreciation. Based on these forecasts, Grok suggested a likely range between $3.50 and $5.50 for XRP by December 2025, with the possibility of $6 to $8 if institutional inflows reach the higher estimates and market conditions remain favorable. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Risks and Considerations Grok also cautioned that downside risks remain. These include the potential for global economic slowdowns, volatility typical of XRP, and unexpected regulatory outcomes. While XRP has regulatory clarity in secondary markets, any policy shifts could cap gains. James Rule XRP’s statement reflects a confident outlook on XRP’s future, positioning $8 as a conservative target if ETFs are approved in October 2025.

51064475,571832,1756807594,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51064475.jpeg,Торги WLFFI принесли Трампам $6 млрд,https://bitcoinist.com/ru-torgi-wlffi-prinesli-trampam-6-mlrd/,"Состояние семьи Трамп выросло на $6 млрд в понедельник. Это произошло после начала торгов токеном WLFI их криптопроекта World Liberty Financial на крупных биржах. Актуальные события подчеркивают, что сегодня важны не только графики и цены, но и умные инструменты для управления капиталом, такие как HYLQ . Дебют WLFI напоминал публичное размещение. Он открыл дверь для открытых торгов. Ранее держатели, купившие токен в частных продажах, не могли торговать или ликвидировать позиции. Торговые объемы выросли на Binance и других биржах. За первый час сменило владельцев токенов на $1 млрд, сообщает CoinMarketCap. Цены колебались между 24 и 30 центами. Это соответствовало фьючерсным торгам перед дебютом. На верхнем уровне этого диапазона доля семьи Трамп оценивалась в более чем $6 млрд. WLFI стал их самым ценным активом, сообщил Wall Street Journal во вторник. Семья Трамп владеет почти четвертью предложения WLFI Семья, включая президента Трампа, удерживает чуть менее четверти всех токенов. Однако основатели и инсайдеры пока не могут продавать токены. World Liberty заявила, что эти активы заблокированы. Тем не менее дебют установил рыночную цену для активов, которые ранее оценивались только через частные сделки. Цена WLFI позже стала отступать. К раннему вторнику она упала на 16% до $0,23. Тем не менее запуск закрепил позицию World Liberty как центральной части быстрорастущего криптопортфеля семьи президента. Напомним, что предприятие создали в прошлом году во время избирательной кампании Трампа. Он представил его как часть более широкого стремления распространить свой предвыборный слоган на мир криптовалют. Его три сына являются соучредителями. Президент указан как “почетный соучредитель”. С тех пор World Liberty также выпустила стейблкоин. Платформа позиционирует себя как площадка для розничных инвесторов для доступа к децентрализованным финансам. Ранние инвесторы сталкиваются с ограничениями продаж Запуск принес неожиданную прибыль ранним инвесторам. Те, кто купил WLFI по цене предпродажи 1,5 цента за токен, увидели торги своих активов в более чем 15 раз выше этой стоимости. Однако на этом этапе они могут продать только до 20% своих токенов. Рост World Liberty подпитывался агрессивной финансовой инженерией. Летом компания взяла под контроль публичную фирму. Привлекла $750 млн наличными от инвесторов для покупки собственных токенов. Добавление других криптоактивов расширило влияние семьи. Например, связанные с Трампом структуры контролируют около 8% $TRUMP. Это мемкоин стоимостью в несколько миллиардов долларов. Кроме того, траст Трампа владеет чуть более половины Trump Media. Эта публичная компания оценивается примерно в $2,5 млрд. Поворот семьи Трампа к криптовалютам превзошел их традиционный портфель недвижимости по бумажной стоимости. Они продолжают заниматься сделками с недвижимостью по всему миру. Но цифровые токены быстро стали их самым прибыльным предприятием. Тем не менее богатство остается номинальным. Аналитики предупреждают, что обналичивание может оказаться сложным. Даже умеренное давление продаж рискует обрушить цены на неликвидных рынках. Новая инвест-платформа от Hyperliquid удерживает внимание рынка HYLQ – инвестиционная платформа, интегрированная с экосистемой Hyperliquid. Она аккумулирует токены и формирует диверсифицированные портфели перспективных блокчейн-активов. Все это позволяет инвесторам участвовать в росте инфраструктурных проектов без лишних проблем. Уже сегодня платформа показывает, как институциональные и розничные инвесторы могут работать с криптовалютой системно. С минимумом рисков. Повышая прозрачность управления капиталом. Платформа HYLQ объединяет DeFi, смарт-контракты и другие инструменты, делая процесс инвестирования прозрачным, безопасным и понятным. Для участников рынка HYLQ становится удобным способом следить за котировками. Также с ее помощью можно использовать рост сетевой активности в финансовых целях. Инвесторы получают доступ к диверсифицированным активам. А разработчики – надежную инфраструктуру для запуска и масштабирования своих проектов.

Is this reduction in dominance set to continue, or could a return to the Bitcoin bull run pull money out of the altcoins and back into Bitcoin? Bitcoin Dominance up or down? Source: TradingView The above weekly chart for Bitcoin Dominance shows the long upward trend from the end of 2022 to the eventual break of trend earlier in August. The trend break was confirmed, and dominance came as far down as 57.6% at one point. A slight rally has taken place since then, but this has met resistance at 58.5%. Will dominance continue to fall, at least to the support at 57%, or the next strong support at 55%? At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI shows the indicators right at the bottom of their range. This is the case with the 2-week chart, while the monthly is also on its way to the bottom. This needs to be set against the short term Stochastic RSI indicators, which are mostly at their tops and generally about to fall back down. This would possibly suggest that at least for the next week or two, Bitcoin Dominance might continue to fall. However, the longer term view is that dominance could start to rise again. Although it must be borne in mind that as the crypto bull market progresses it might be expected that value does start to leak out of Bitcoin and into the altcoins. The reason for this? Unless there is the most ridiculous blow-off top for Bitcoin, where it soars well in excess of $200,000, it would generally be accepted that Bitcoin is not going to make multiples of its present price in this bull run. On the other hand, some of the altcoins can probably gain several multiples of their current value. Many investors will see this and transfer out of at least some of their Bitcoin into alts. Some altcoins like $SOL could outperform This said, there is probably a middle ground for investors seeking a safer path. A small handful of the best-performing altcoins have already started to outperform $BTC. Solana (SOL) is one such example. Source: TradingView The SOL/BTC chart shows how $SOL bulls are currently working towards turning the trend back up against $BTC . It can be seen that SOL/BTC has come up against the strong resistance at 0.0018 BTC. If $SOL can break through here and confirm above, the trend in favour of $BTC could be broken if $SOL takes out the higher high at 0.003 BTC. Bearing in mind that $SOL recently went through a phase where it was really beaten down, the current upward impulse wave has a great chance of sending $SOL much higher. This is to say nothing of the impending possibility of around 9 Solana Spot ETFs being granted in October. Watch this one closely.

Meanwhile, Delphi Digital warned that a US Federal Reserve rate cut could prompt a short-term spike followed by a steep correction , unless price action remains subdued heading into the decision. How will rate cuts affect BTC? • 2019 established a 'sell the news' precedent for rate cuts. • Last year, ETF inflows fueled a sustained rally after rate cuts. • This makes the upcoming rate cut a conditional setup rather than a straightforward catalyst.

Historically, BTC has often ended September in the red, averaging a ~3%–4% decline since 2013. “This year may be different, given how tariffs have hit the index, and recent Septembers have shown moderate losses, with some even posting gains. September often pressures Bitcoin, but it’s not a guaranteed down month,” the exec says. Toledano continues: “As usual, some in the DeFi circles spin these false narratives into patterns that don’t exist with sentiment-driven assets.” Risks for 2025 are still thin liquidity, leveraged positioning, and uncertainty around the US Federal Reserve’s September meeting. “A rate cut could inject momentum and help Bitcoin hold its ground. A decisive break below $105K risks sub-$100K levels, but institutional inflows via ETFs, growing expectations of Fed cuts, could offset seasonal pressure. Holding above $110K into mid-September may weaken the perceived curse, setting the stage for the more bullish October,” he concludes. Moreover, analysts from the crypto exchange Bitfinex commented that major coins “endured a difficult week as macro jitters and the post-PPI [Producer Price Index] sell-off weighed heavily on price action.” The pullback, they argued, follows their prediction that BTC is likely to be prone to retracements and range trading in summer. “We believe the market is nearing the bottom of this downturn as we move into September,” the analysts said. When it comes to altcoins, the analysts expect the pullback to reach a conclusion relatively soon in September. The altcoin market seeing sharp rotations is a signal of majors seeing capital eventually flowing back in, particularly if the overall market declines further from current levels. “The market would likely view such a development as a signal that a bottom is being reached, which would be in line with our end-of-summer thesis, which is when ETF flows across major asset classes pick up,” Bitfinex analysts conclude. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Tuesday morning, BTC trades at $110,245. It jumped from an intraday low of $107,542 to the day’s highest point of $110,507. The price is currently moving towards the intraweek high of $113,220. The weekly time range has also turned slightly green after days of red. Investors are now looking at resistance near $111,350–$113,500, which would lead to $115,700, as well as support at $107,335 and $105,150. Bitcoin Price Chart.

Should the price continue to rise, it could hit $4,665, followed by $4,865. Conversely, it may drop to $4,265 and move lower to $4,070.

The crypto market increased over the past day. There is no data for the stock market because, unlike crypto, it’s closed on bank holidays. On its previous day of trading, on Friday, the stock market decreased, following quarterly earnings reports and other US economic data. Is this rally sustainable? In the near-term, it is not.

The announcement came Tuesday through EF’s official blog page, with developers stating that most remaining validator nodes will be taken offline two weeks after the Fusaka upgrade finalizes on Holešky. Holešky, launched in 2023, was created to test validator operations and staking at scale. Over its two-year lifespan, it allowed thousands of validators to make trial upgrades, including the Dencun and Pectra upgrades, both of which introduced improvements to Ethereum’s network efficiency. However, as covered by Cryptopolitan earlier this year, the developers announced that the network ran into technical bumps after the Pectra activation. The issues contributed to the decision to retire Holešky and move testing operations to newer testnets. Holešky struggles with problems post-Pectra upgrade On March 18, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko wrote on the foundation’s blog that the Pectra testnet activation experienced issues with deposit contract configurations on Ether’s testnets. Sepolia recovered smoothly, but Holešky was marred with extensive inactivity leaks that strained its recovery process. According to Beiko, when the network finalized blocks, a large number of validators were forced into the exit queue. It would take around one year for those validators to be fully removed from the set, which makes Holešky unsuitable for testing the complete validator lifecycle “within a reasonable timeframe.” The testnet’s inadvertent bottleneck didn’t stop staking operators from making test deposits and consolidations, but they were unable to simulate the full spectrum of validator operations at scale. Ether developers concluded that the network no longer served its intended purpose, and its end of life cycle is slated to end on September 30. “ Holešky provided valuable insights into large-scale validator operations and helped stress-test critical protocol upgrades. These learnings have directly informed both Hoodi’s design and broader protocol testing practices. Thank you to everyone who contributed to running, maintaining, and testing on Holešky over the past years ,” the Coordination team concluded its message. Hoodi launched as replacement Although Holešky was still viable for every Pectra upgrade feature except validator exits, Ethereum developers introduced a new testnet, Hoodi, to address its shortcomings. Hoodi, confirmed to have validator set and support for all Pectra features, went live with the Pectra upgrade at epoch 2048 on March 26, at around 14:37 UTC, per the foundation’s records. It is also expected to handle upcoming protocol upgrades, including the Fusaka fork. Staking operators and infrastructure providers are now advised to migrate testing activities to Hoodi. Meanwhile, application and tooling developers who previously relied on Holešky are encouraged to use Sepolia, the primary testnet for smart contract and decentralized application testing. Following the wind-down, Ethereum’s testing environment will consist of three key networks. Sepolia handles application and tooling development for the next 12 months, while Hoodi serves staking providers and validator testing up to 2028. A third testnet named Ephemery is available for lightweight validator lifecycle testing, resetting every 28 days to give developers fresh testing conditions. Once Fusaka finalizes Holešky, the testnet will be gradually taken offline.

Hosted by Thomas ""Tom"" Lee, Chairman of BitMine and co-founder of Fundstrat, the Chairman's Message video series was developed to help inform investors on the long-term upside of Ethereum and to provide insights into the company's ETH treasury strategy. The investor presentation, titled ""the Alchemy of 5%,"" accompanies the video. ""In this latest message, we discuss how 2025 and the SEC Project Crypto and GENIUS Act are creating a multi-decade opportunity for ethereum and ETH, similar to the transformation seen on Wall Street after the USD formally went off the gold standard in 1971. While many investors bought Gold in 1971, the real opportunity was seen by the massive innovation unleashed by Wall Street in the decades after 1971. This same supercycle is happening today for ethereum"" said Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine. Both the ""Chairman's Message"" and investor presentation are available on the website: https://bitminetech.io/investor-relations/ Also, BitMine today announced crypto + cash holdings of $8.98 billion. As of August 31st at 5:00pm ET, the Company's crypto holdings are comprised of 1,866,974 ETH at $4,458 per ETH (Bloomberg), 192 Bitcoin (BTC) and unencumbered cash of $635 million. BitMine crypto holdings reigns as the #1 Ethereum treasury and #2 global treasury, behind Strategy Inc. (MSTR), which owns 629,376 BTC valued at $71 billion. BitMine remains the largest ETH treasury in the world. BitMine launched its ETH Treasury strategy on June 30th (closing on July 8th). In the ensuing seven weeks, the Company has passed many key milestones. The GENIUS Act and SEC's Project Crypto are as transformational to financial services in 2025 as US action on August 15, 1971 ending Bretton Woods and the USD on the gold standard 54 years ago. This 1971 event was the catalyst for the modernization of Wall Street, creating the iconic Wall Street titans and financial and payment rails of today. These proved to be better investments than gold. ""We continue to believe Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years,"" continued Lee. ""Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today's financial system. And the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum.""

Dogecoin Updates: Consolidation Signals Possible Breakout According to Dogecoin updates, DOGE is trading around $0.215, consolidating in a narrowing pattern since mid-July. Analysts point to a symmetrical triangle shape with falling resistance at around $0.315 to falling support at around $0.168. The price has recovered back to the $0.20 area and is currently facing opposition at the $0.22-$0.23 area. The key is to maintain the levels over $0.20 to maintain the medium-term bullish perspective. source: @ali_charts on X Some patterns suggest a rounded bottom has been forming since early 2025, holding above the $0.15–$0.17 accumulation zone. The targets that are expected are $0.334, $0.398, and $0.460, which coincide with former resistance levels. Although the price has seen slight declines, Dogecoin news shows that buyers are repelling key support levels, making it possible to rise as long as the conditions of a breakout are satisfied. Shiba Inu News: Whales and Network Activity Shiba Inu news reports that SHIB trades near $0.0000122, with support at $0.00001200 and resistance between $0.00001600–$0.00001750. Whale activity has fallen significantly, with holdings dropping to 45 billion SHIB compared to 97 billion in June. Smart money investors also decreased holdings to 44.5 billion from 53 billion. source: Quant_Trading_Pro on TradingView The Shiba Inu team has warned the community about scams targeting LEASH and other ecosystem tokens. Despite concerns, some analysts remain optimistic due to the 1.2 trillion SHIB movement by a single wallet and the increase in active addresses to over 270 million . This has kept investor attention on SHIB, though many are frustrated by slow price growth and are exploring low gas fee crypto projects and cross-chain DeFi alternatives. Why Remittix Is Capturing Attention While DOGE and SHIB struggle with volatility and slow growth, Remittix is attracting investors with tangible utility and early adoption. Remittix has raised over $23.1 million through the sale of 638 million tokens at $0.1030 each. Its first centralized exchange listing was on BitMart, and after surpassing the $22 million milestone, LBANK has been revealed as the next CEX. The Beta Wallet, launching on 15th September 2025, will allow easy crypto-to-fiat transactions, enhancing adoption and user experience.

51068923,https://cryptonews.com/?p=416982,1756814431,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51068923.jpeg,Chainalysis 2025 Global Index: India and U.S. Top Crypto Adoption Rankings,https://cryptonews.com/news/chainalysis-2025-global-index-india-and-u-s-top-crypto-adoption-rankings/,"The sixth annual Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index reveals a transformative year for digital assets, with India and the United States leading the world in overall adoption. Unlike earlier years, where crypto activity leaned heavily toward grassroots usage in emerging markets, 2025 showcases a more balanced picture: retail adoption remains strong, but institutional flows are now a critical driver of growth. The methodology remains rigorous. Chainalysis evaluates 151 countries using four sub-indices: on-chain value received by centralized services; retail-sized value received by those services; on-chain activity in DeFi protocols; and institutional-sized transfers. Each component is weighted by GDP per capita on a purchasing-power-parity basis, ensuring the rankings reflect economic context rather than raw transaction volume. This comprehensive approach highlights not just where crypto is popular, but where it is meaningfully integrated into financial systems. Shifting Methodology for a Maturing Market In 2025, Chainalysis introduced important methodological changes. First, the retail DeFi sub-index was removed, as internal data showed that while DeFi transaction volumes remain significant, grassroots engagement there is far smaller than on centralized platforms. By excluding retail DeFi as a standalone category, the index avoids overrepresenting a relatively niche behavior. Second, an institutional activity sub-index was added, reflecting the surge of large-scale transactions driven by traditional finance. Transfers above $1 million are now captured in the rankings, providing a clearer view of how hedge funds, custodians, ETFs, and banks are shaping the landscape. This shift is timely: with multiple U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs approved and greater regulatory clarity across key jurisdictions, institutions are no longer testing the waters—they are actively participating. Together, these changes create a more accurate lens. The index continues to focus on grassroots adoption but now incorporates top-down institutional flows, showing how deeply crypto has penetrated mainstream finance. India, the U.S., and the Rise of APAC The 2025 Index crowns India as the number one country for crypto adoption, ranking first across all four sub-indices. India’s dominance reflects both widespread grassroots use and growing integration with financial services. The United States ranks second overall, bolstered by strong institutional participation and the legitimizing effect of regulatory progress. Beyond these leaders, Pakistan (3rd), Vietnam (4th), and Brazil (5th) round out the top five, reflecting a blend of remittance-driven retail usage and rising institutional interest. Notably, APAC has emerged as the fastest-growing region, with on-chain activity rising 69% year-over-year to $2.36 trillion. Latin America follows with 63% growth, showing the region’s reliance on stablecoins for remittances and inflation hedging. When adjusting for population size, Eastern Europe stands out. Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia top the population-adjusted index, reflecting extraordinary levels of activity relative to population. Factors such as war, inflation, and banking restrictions have accelerated crypto’s role as both a hedge and a cross-border transaction tool. Stablecoins and Bitcoin Dominate On-Ramps Stablecoins remain at the heart of global crypto adoption. Between June 2024 and June 2025, USDT processed more than $1 trillion per month, while USDC peaked at $3.29 trillion. New entrants like EURC and PYUSD are also growing rapidly, with EURC volumes surging nearly 89% month-over-month as MiCA-compliant euro stablecoins gain traction in Europe. At the same time, Bitcoin continues to serve as the primary fiat on-ramp, accounting for over $4.6 trillion in inflows—more than double any other category. The United States leads by volume, with South Korea and the European Union trailing behind. These flows confirm that while altcoins and DeFi tokens are important, Bitcoin and stablecoins remain the central gateways into crypto. A Truly Global Wave Perhaps the most striking finding of the 2025 Index is that adoption is no longer confined to one region or income level. High-income countries are accelerating institutional rails, while lower- and middle-income nations continue to rely on crypto for remittances, dollar access, and mobile-first finance. This synchronicity suggests crypto adoption is now broad-based and durable, not episodic. The challenges ahead remain clear: fragmented regulations, fragile infrastructure in low-income countries, and the need for secure on-ramps. Yet the trajectory is undeniable. With India and the United States setting the pace, and the Global South demonstrating how crypto solves real-world problems, the 2025 Global Adoption Index shows one truth: crypto is no longer an experiment. It is becoming a core feature of the global financial system.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, smart investors are turning their attention to a new wave of altcoins with strong fundamentals, community traction, or explosive upside potential. Among the best altcoins to buy right now are XRP, Polkadot (DOT), Cardano (ADA), BONK, and the rising contender MAGACOIN FINANCE . XRP Price Faces Critical Support Levels XRP has been in the headlines because of the heavy drop it made in August. After it went down by more than 22%, the altcoin dropped from its local maximum near $3.66 to $2.80. The on-chain data analyzed by Glassnode reveals that XRP is struggling with the large offering between $2.81 and $2.82, which is the price range where nearly 1.7bn tokens were distributed. If the coming days see prices breaching the bottom of this range, then the fall may extend to $2.17. Source: X However, the bulls will have to put on a strong show and hold the 50-week EMA to prevent the bear cycle from getting prolonged. XRP’s situation is a bit like that of a company in trouble but with a strong balance sheet. Ripple’s widening footprint in the cross-border payment industry and its collaboration with banks all over Asia and the Middle East are the main reasons why the coin keeps getting used outside the crypto ecosystem. Besides, there is speculation around an XRP ETF which if given the green light would be a faucet of inflows worth billions attracting the asset into the pockets of institutional investors. With more than 90% of XRP holders still in profit, investor conviction remains intact, suggesting XRP’s long-term outlook could remain bullish once the current correction stabilizes. This makes XRP one of the best altcoins to buy for long-term growth. Polkadot ETF Signals Institutional Confidence Polkadot (DOT) stepped into the spotlight after Grayscale filed with the SEC to launch an ETF. This shows growing institutional confidence in altcoins that emphasize scalability, interoperability, and sustainability. One of the main reasons why Polkadot keeps on being a prominent project is its parachain design that enables various blockchains to co-exist without any trouble within a single network. ADA Price Outlook: Can Cardano Reach $4? Grayscale has also filed for ADA ETF. Despite ADA trading near $0.83, technical analysts suggest it could rally to $4 by late 2025, supported by its ongoing upgrade path. Source: X With the Hydra scaling solution now live and smart contract usage expanding, Cardano continues to build infrastructure for large-scale adoption. Institutional ETF flows could accelerate this trend, pushing ADA back to new highs. Long-term forecasts remain optimistic, with analysts eyeing a $4 target by the end of 2025. This would represent a nearly 400% increase from current levels, supported by broader crypto recovery and institutional capital rotation. With community-driven development and consistent ecosystem growth, ADA remains a long-term bet for investors looking beyond short-term volatility, making it one of the best altcoins to buy. BONK Meme Coin Defies the Market BONK has emerged as one of the strongest performers in the meme coin sector. While many meme tokens struggle to maintain momentum, BONK is proving resilient with surging trading volumes — up more than 210% in just 24 hours. Currently trading at $0.00002232, BONK boasts a market capitalization of $1.8 billion, making it the 51st largest cryptocurrency. Institutional recognition has also started trickling in. Nasdaq-listed Safety Shot allocated $25 million in BONK to its treasury, signaling growing corporate use of meme tokens as liquidity assets. The BONK team has further committed to burning 1 trillion tokens once its wallet count hits 1 million , creating scarcity that could support higher prices. As part of the Solana ecosystem , BONK benefits from fast transaction speeds and low fees, positioning it as one of the meme tokens with both hype and utility. With Solana whales actively accumulating BONK, the coin could surprise skeptics and deliver further upside during the next bull run. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Altcoin to Watch While XRP, DOT, ADA, and BONK dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly positioning itself as a breakout altcoin for long-term growth. Still in its early stages, the project offers unique upside for investors seeking exposure before major exchange listings and institutional adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE is designed with scalable tokenomics, verified KYC team, and deep liquidity, appealing to both retail traders and whale investors. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE compelling is the early entry advantage . Unlike XRP or ADA, which already trade at multi-billion-dollar market caps, MAGACOIN FINANCE still has exponential growth potential ahead. Investors positioning now could benefit significantly once the token gains mainstream attention. With its mix of community energy and growing fundamentals, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the best altcoins to buy heading into the next market cycle. Final Thoughts The crypto market continues to evolve, with institutional adoption, ETF filings, and meme coin hype shaping the next cycle. XRP faces key support levels but retains strong fundamentals. Polkadot and Cardano are gaining institutional credibility through ETF filings, while BONK is proving that meme coins can attract serious demand. Amid these developments, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a unique opportunity for early investors seeking asymmetric upside. Together, these five altcoins — XRP, DOT, ADA, BONK, and MAGACOIN FINANCE — stand out as the best altcoins to buy for long-term growth, combining institutional momentum, community support, and breakout potential.

ETH is currently trading at around $4,434. Ethereum is still ranked highly among traders, but another viral altcoin, Remittix (RTX) , is reaching an increasing number of investors searching to find high-growth potential outside the established cryptocurrency giants. Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Levels and Support Technically, ETH will react instantly to $4,500, and a strong move above this point will cause a 20% rally to $4,950-$5000. Analysts point to essential support areas between the range of $4,362 and $4,200. A downward move below that would put ETH at risk of falling to $3,600 and $3,400. Strong support is still being given by spot ETF inflows, which assist Ethereum in absorbing wider market weakness. The data on-chain indicates that people are not ready to leave, but whale holders have not abandoned large positions, which supports the belief in the Ethereum price prognosis of a possible rise. Recent stability of Ethereum is an indication of continued institutional interest, especially via a spot ETF. The range of $4,300 to $4,350 is a pivot point and closely watched by investors to see whether the market will move up. In case ETH breaks above $4,600 with decisive gains, analysts estimate that the next level may be in the range of $4,950-$5,000. source: petermichalides on TradingView Meanwhile, investor attention is also turning to altcoins with strong utility and adoption plans. Amid the focus on Ethereum, Remittix has emerged as one of the most talked-about projects for Q4 2025, drawing votes from retail and institutional traders seeking significant gains. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Remittix is currently priced at $0.1030 and has raised over $23.2 million through the sale of more than 639 million tokens. It has completed its initial CEX offering on BitMart, and since it passed the $22 million mark, the second offering has been announced on LBANK. The future Beta Wallet, which is released on 15th September 2025, will support transferring cryptos to fiat with seamless usability. Key highlights that make Remittix stand out : Offers real-world PayFi utility and low-cost cross-border transfers Positioned as the next 100x crypto, attracting early investors Strong liquidity through centralized exchanges with future DEX integration Targeting a $19T payments problem, giving it genuine market utility Recognized as a top altcoin by retail and institutional voters These aspects have rendered Remittix an attractive option to investors who want to experience exponential growth potential as compared to well-established cryptocurrencies such as ETH. Conclusion Ethereum price outlook in September is also positive, and ETH is expected to be between $4,200 and $4,950 within the next few weeks. This is resilient to ETF inflows, on-chain activity, and technical support. Meanwhile, other altcoins like Remittix are gaining investor votes and represent a thrilling prospect to those interested in high-growth projects with practical use. Investing in both conventional exposure to Ethereum and new tokens, such as Remittix, investors will potentially make the most money in Q4 2025.

51069090,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81385,1756814577,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Google Gemini Sets XRP Price for September 30, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-sets-xrp-price-for-september-30-2025/,"XRP has faced notable pressure in recent sessions, slipping below key support levels that traders had been watching closely. At press time, the asset traded at $2.77, showing a modest 1.27% recovery from the previous day, but still lower than traders would like. This short-term rebound follows a broader decline that left investors questioning whether XRP’s momentum has stalled heading into September. To address these concerns, we asked Google’s Gemini AI to provide a forecast for the digital asset’s prospects as September 30 approaches. Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Interest Gemini’s outlook considers regulatory, institutional, technical, and macroeconomic factors. The first consideration is the regulatory landscape. The AI drew attention to the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The expectation is that greater clarity would provide market stability and support XRP above key thresholds, reducing the uncertainty that has weighed on its valuation. Institutional participation is also considered an important factor. Gemini highlighted Ripple’s growing role in cross-border settlement as a driver of liquidity and sustained market activity. The AI notes that higher participation from institutions could create significant upward pressure on the asset’s price. Market Cycles and Historical Behavior The forecast also incorporates the asset’s historical market cycles. XRP has often experienced extended consolidation , followed by sharp upward moves. Gemini suggests that the token could be in the middle stages of such a cycle by September 2025. While this would not necessarily mark the absolute peak, it implies meaningful upside potential compared to current levels. Macro Environment and Price Targets Macro factors are another element in the analysis. The effects of the April 2024 Bitcoin halving, which historically influence altcoin performance with a lag, are expected to be visible in the latter half of 2025. Gemini highlights that this timing could be favorable for XRP, as the broader market tends to experience heightened activity within 12 to 18 months after a halving event. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 With these considerations in mind, Gemini places XRP’s most probable value around $5.05 by September 30. The AI outlines a projected range of $4.20 to $6.10, positioning the token for potential gains if adoption trends remain positive. Gemini states that “on September 30, 2025, XRP is most likely to trade near $5,” while leaving open the possibility of further appreciation heading into the final quarter of the year if demand accelerates .

The platform’s first release, a Meta‑Agentic AGI Alpha Jobs Marketplace, introduces a decentralized, blockchain-embedded job-routing system powered by the $AGIALPHA utility token, now live on Solana. The Visionary Behind the Innovation Boucher’s remarkable journey underpins AGI Alpha ’s mission. Born in 1973 in Québec City, he endured a difficult childhood in foster care before discovering a passion for knowledge at age 14 that would define his life. By his early 20s, he had completed a B.Sc. in Theoretical Physics in a single year, followed by a Master’s degree in Government Policy Analysis and (1998) and a Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering (2000). From 2000 to 2002, he provided management consulting for the Canadian Space Agency before committing himself fully to AI in 2003. Further solidifying his status as a thought leader, Boucher has helmed MONTREAL.AI and QUEBEC.AI as President since 2003, consistently at the forefront of AI innovation. In 2016, he achieved global recognition on OpenAI’s Gym benchmarks, demonstrating the power of the scaling principle in AI years before it became an industry standard. That same foresight led him, in 2017, to unveil the seminal “Multi-Agent AI DAO” blueprint, introducing the concept of “Meta-Agentic” systems: AIs designed to create, coordinate, and direct other AIs. From 2016 to 2018, Vincent Boucher (username: “ceobillionaire”) generally ranked #1 worldwide on the OpenAI Gym . In 2017, Boucher unveiled the seminal “Multi‑Agent AI DAO” blueprint, now hailed as a “Holy Grail” of foundational IP at the intersection of AI agents and blockchain. This 2017 design was developed years before today’s multi-agent AI trend, and laid the groundwork for what would become AGI Alpha. Now, after two decades of quiet innovation, Vincent Boucher is channeling his expertise and vision into AGI Alpha – the culmination of his life’s work – to fundamentally transform the AI landscape. A Revolutionary Meta-Agentic Platform AGI Alpha represents the culmination of Boucher’s two-decade AI journey, introducing a Meta‑Agentic architecture that enables AI systems to design, coordinate, and manage other AI entities. This paradigm shift moves far beyond traditional single-agent or query-response models (like mainstream AI systems such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini) toward autonomous, multi-agent task execution and scalable value creation. In AGI Alpha’s ecosystem, AI agents don’t just chat or answer questions – they collaborate, negotiate, and execute complex jobs on-chain, orchestrated by smart contracts. The platform is blockchain-embedded at its core: users around the world post sophisticated tasks (or “jobs”) on the network, which are then picked up and completed by a constellation of intelligent agents coordinated via code. This innovative approach is underpinned by advanced algorithms and a unique blockchain architecture that orchestrates agent interactions through smart contracts, ensuring trustless coordination and transparent reward handling. Crucially, AGI Alpha focuses on capabilities that other industry players have yet to address, positioning itself not as a competitor to existing AI chatbots, but as a leap into a new domain of autonomous AI coordination and on-chain execution. At its core is a recursive intelligence flywheel: every completed job feeds shared memory, reputation, and tooling, compounding capability with each cycle. Decentralized by design, optimizations emerge from the collective; an agent‑of‑agents conductor harnessing swarms of specialists to solve problems no single system could tackle alone. “For ages, humanity has dreamed of orchestrating knowledge and creativity on a planetary scale. Today that dream rises like the inevitable dawn. In this self‑reinforcing dance of creation, every agent’s triumph feeds the next, the constellation brightens, and our shared genius steps forward, ready to write the next chapter together.” - Vincent Boucher, Founder of AGI Alpha Meta‑Agentic AGI Jobs Marketplace Vision AGI Alpha’s first release introduces the decentralized AGI Jobs Marketplace, powered by the $AGIALPHA token. It coordinates AI agents worldwide to complete tasks posted by users or organizations, with jobs matched algorithmically to the most qualified agents based on speed, cost, and reputation. In contrast to traditional freelance marketplaces or single-agent services, the AGI Jobs Marketplace uses a reputation-weighted auction mechanism to autonomously route each job to the optimal AI agent in the network. Tasks are posted with clear goals, success criteria, and rewards escrowed in $AGIALPHA, ensuring trustless contracts from the outset. Verified AI agents bid and stake tokens for the right to execute tasks, while smart contracts enforce all coordination logic fully on-chain. A decentralized validator network oversees outcomes with cryptographic commit–reveal voting. If results meet criteria, payment is released. Every transaction is settled transparently on-chain: upon successful completion, the agent is paid in $AGIALPHA, and a 1% burn, directly from the AGI Employer’s wallet, is applied to the payout, permanently reducing token supply and reinforcing long-term value in the ecosystem. Unsatisfactory results can trigger slashing of the agent’s stake, ensuring accountability. To further ensure integrity and accountability, AGI Alpha’s protocol even mints verifiable NFT certificates for completed jobs, creating an immutable on-chain record of each achievement. This technical design guarantees trustless automation: participants can engage in the marketplace knowing that rules are enforced by code and outcomes are tamper-proof. The ultimate vision is for a self-sustaining ecosystem of autonomous AI enterprises that could become the most valuable AI “company” in existence, as each agent-driven venture amplifies the next in a virtuous cycle of innovation and value creation. This streamlined on-chain pipeline: from job posting and bidding to validation and payout, guarantees tamper-proof execution without intermediaries. By removing middlemen and enforcing integrity with code, the platform dramatically reduces friction in getting complex AI tasks done. The Jobs Marketplace is only the first step: AGI Alpha aims to scale into a self-sustaining AGI economy, where swarms of AI agents form autonomous enterprises and unlock multi-quadrillion-dollar opportunities. About AGI Alpha AGI Alpha is the world’s first Meta‑Agentic AGI – an AI meta-system that creates and coordinates other AIs to solve problems beyond any single agent’s reach. Founded by Vincent Boucher and powered by blockchain, DAO governance, and the $AGIALPHA utility token, it operates autonomously with minimal human oversight. AGI Alpha’s vision, called “AGI Ascension,” is to orchestrate a global constellation of self-evolving AI enterprises and unlock an estimated $15 quadrillion in new economic value. By uniting cutting-edge AI agents, trustless smart-contract infrastructure, and a passionate community, AGI Alpha is pioneering a future where swarms of intelligent agents collaboratively drive unprecedented innovation and prosperity on a worldwide scale.

The move was announced by the country’s National Bitcoin Office after months of IMF pressure to scale back the country’s crypto activity. Officials said that storing the entire reserve (6,286 BTC worth around $686 million) in a single address left the funds vulnerable once public keys were exposed on-chain. By splitting the assets into addresses of up to 500 BTC each, the government aims to limit exposure to potential quantum-based attacks on Bitcoin’s cryptography. JUST IN: El Salvador just moved its entire $680 million Bitcoin reserve over quantum threats. All 6,283 $BTC is now spread across 14 wallets, each capped at 500 BTC. pic.twitter.com/os0oNxK8QO — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) August 30, 2025 President Nayib Bukele, who pledged in 2022 to buy one Bitcoin daily, has faced criticism from international bodies but remains committed to growing the nation’s holdings. A public dashboard now tracks transactions to increase transparency, but officials said multiple smaller addresses reduce the risk of a catastrophic loss in case of a quantum breakthrough. IMF Pressures and Policy Shifts The reshuffle also comes as the IMF is scrutinizing the country. In July, the IMF reiterated that El Salvador had agreed not to voluntarily accumulate Bitcoin as a condition of loan disbursements. El Salvador is moving the funds from a single Bitcoin address into multiple new, unused addresses as part of a strategic initiative to enhance the security and long-term custody of the National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This action aligns with best practices in Bitcoin… — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) August 29, 2025 While the IMF said the government was “moving funds between internal wallets”, Bukele’s office maintains the policy of buying 1 BTC per day is still in place. This shows the tension between El Salvador’s pro-Bitcoin stance and its need for external financing to stabilize the economy. Despite Bitcoin being legal tender since 2021, surveys show most Salvadorans don’t use it for transactions, they prefer the US dollar. But Bukele’s popularity at home is strong, mainly due to security reforms and his tough anti-crime policies, not the crypto experiment. Bitcoin Technical Outlook and Price Forecast Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish as BTC is at $109,887, consolidating inside a descending channel since mid-August. The 50-day EMA at $110,153 and the 200-day EMA at $112,792 are the ceiling, buyers can’t sustain above these levels. Support is at $108,865, then $107,300 and $105,451. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick activity is indecisive, with Dojis and small-bodied candles near mid-channel resistance. RSI is 53, MACD is flat, no strong directional move yet. Two scenarios: Break above $112,000 and it’s off to $113,400 and $115,475, bearish channel reversal. Fail to break higher and BTC is down to $107,300 and $105,451. For traders, short below $110,650, long only on a close above $112,000. Looking further ahead, long-term structure is still constructive, recovery to $130,000 once consolidation resolves. El Salvador’s policy shift shows growing awareness of the tech risks, but the bigger question is: can Bitcoin survive quantum and global scrutiny?

The platform’s first release, a Meta‑Agentic AGI Alpha Jobs Marketplace, introduces a decentralized, blockchain-embedded job-routing system powered by the $AGIALPHA utility token, now live on Solana. The Visionary Behind the Innovation Boucher’s remarkable journey underpins AGI Alpha ’s mission. Born in 1973 in Québec City, he endured a difficult childhood in foster care before discovering a passion for knowledge at age 14 that would define his life. By his early 20s, he had completed a B.Sc. in Theoretical Physics in a single year, followed by a Master’s degree in Government Policy Analysis and (1998) and a Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering (2000). From 2000 to 2002, he provided management consulting for the Canadian Space Agency before committing himself fully to AI in 2003. Further solidifying his status as a thought leader, Boucher has helmed MONTREAL.AI and QUEBEC.AI as President since 2003, consistently at the forefront of AI innovation. In 2016, he achieved global recognition on OpenAI’s Gym benchmarks, demonstrating the power of the scaling principle in AI years before it became an industry standard. That same foresight led him, in 2017, to unveil the seminal “Multi-Agent AI DAO” blueprint, introducing the concept of “Meta-Agentic” systems: AIs designed to create, coordinate, and direct other AIs. From 2016 to 2018, Vincent Boucher (username: “ceobillionaire”) generally ranked #1 worldwide on the OpenAI Gym . In 2017, Boucher unveiled the seminal “Multi‑Agent AI DAO” blueprint, now hailed as a “Holy Grail” of foundational IP at the intersection of AI agents and blockchain. This 2017 design was developed years before today’s multi-agent AI trend, and laid the groundwork for what would become AGI Alpha. Now, after two decades of quiet innovation, Vincent Boucher is channeling his expertise and vision into AGI Alpha – the culmination of his life’s work – to fundamentally transform the AI landscape. A Revolutionary Meta-Agentic Platform AGI Alpha represents the culmination of Boucher’s two-decade AI journey, introducing a Meta‑Agentic architecture that enables AI systems to design, coordinate, and manage other AI entities. This paradigm shift moves far beyond traditional single-agent or query-response models (like mainstream AI systems such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini) toward autonomous, multi-agent task execution and scalable value creation. In AGI Alpha’s ecosystem, AI agents don’t just chat or answer questions – they collaborate, negotiate, and execute complex jobs on-chain, orchestrated by smart contracts. The platform is blockchain-embedded at its core: users around the world post sophisticated tasks (or “jobs”) on the network, which are then picked up and completed by a constellation of intelligent agents coordinated via code. This innovative approach is underpinned by advanced algorithms and a unique blockchain architecture that orchestrates agent interactions through smart contracts, ensuring trustless coordination and transparent reward handling. Crucially, AGI Alpha focuses on capabilities that other industry players have yet to address, positioning itself not as a competitor to existing AI chatbots, but as a leap into a new domain of autonomous AI coordination and on-chain execution. At its core is a recursive intelligence flywheel: every completed job feeds shared memory, reputation, and tooling, compounding capability with each cycle. Decentralized by design, optimizations emerge from the collective; an agent‑of‑agents conductor harnessing swarms of specialists to solve problems no single system could tackle alone. “For ages, humanity has dreamed of orchestrating knowledge and creativity on a planetary scale. Today that dream rises like the inevitable dawn. In this self‑reinforcing dance of creation, every agent’s triumph feeds the next, the constellation brightens, and our shared genius steps forward, ready to write the next chapter together.” - Vincent Boucher, Founder of AGI Alpha Meta‑Agentic AGI Jobs Marketplace Vision AGI Alpha’s first release introduces the decentralized AGI Jobs Marketplace, powered by the $AGIALPHA token. It coordinates AI agents worldwide to complete tasks posted by users or organizations, with jobs matched algorithmically to the most qualified agents based on speed, cost, and reputation. In contrast to traditional freelance marketplaces or single-agent services, the AGI Jobs Marketplace uses a reputation-weighted auction mechanism to autonomously route each job to the optimal AI agent in the network. Tasks are posted with clear goals, success criteria, and rewards escrowed in $AGIALPHA, ensuring trustless contracts from the outset. Verified AI agents bid and stake tokens for the right to execute tasks, while smart contracts enforce all coordination logic fully on-chain. A decentralized validator network oversees outcomes with cryptographic commit–reveal voting. If results meet criteria, payment is released. Every transaction is settled transparently on-chain: upon successful completion, the agent is paid in $AGIALPHA, and a 1% burn, directly from the AGI Employer’s wallet, is applied to the payout, permanently reducing token supply and reinforcing long-term value in the ecosystem. Unsatisfactory results can trigger slashing of the agent’s stake, ensuring accountability. To further ensure integrity and accountability, AGI Alpha’s protocol even mints verifiable NFT certificates for completed jobs, creating an immutable on-chain record of each achievement. This technical design guarantees trustless automation: participants can engage in the marketplace knowing that rules are enforced by code and outcomes are tamper-proof. The ultimate vision is for a self-sustaining ecosystem of autonomous AI enterprises that could become the most valuable AI “company” in existence, as each agent-driven venture amplifies the next in a virtuous cycle of innovation and value creation. This streamlined on-chain pipeline: from job posting and bidding to validation and payout, guarantees tamper-proof execution without intermediaries. By removing middlemen and enforcing integrity with code, the platform dramatically reduces friction in getting complex AI tasks done. The Jobs Marketplace is only the first step: AGI Alpha aims to scale into a self-sustaining AGI economy, where swarms of AI agents form autonomous enterprises and unlock multi-quadrillion-dollar opportunities. About AGI Alpha AGI Alpha is the world’s first Meta‑Agentic AGI – an AI meta-system that creates and coordinates other AIs to solve problems beyond any single agent’s reach. Founded by Vincent Boucher and powered by blockchain, DAO governance, and the $AGIALPHA utility token, it operates autonomously with minimal human oversight. AGI Alpha’s vision, called “AGI Ascension,” is to orchestrate a global constellation of self-evolving AI enterprises and unlock an estimated $15 quadrillion in new economic value. By uniting cutting-edge AI agents, trustless smart-contract infrastructure, and a passionate community, AGI Alpha is pioneering a future where swarms of intelligent agents collaboratively drive unprecedented innovation and prosperity on a worldwide scale.

This development follows the issuance of Dubai Law No. (2) in March 2025 by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, which provides the legislative foundation for these services. The new Mediation Service Centre will be based at the DIFC Courts and will serve as an alternative dispute resolution pathway where parties can amicably resolve their disputes with the help of mediators registered with the court. Parties will be able to choose the mediators and agree on fees and terms in advance, as well as the choice to conduct mediation meetings online using the newly upgraded and AI-enabled Court Management System (CMS) or in-person at the DIFC Courts premises. His Excellency Wayne Martin, Chief Justice, DIFC Courts, believes the DIFC Courts Mediation Service Centre and the Notary Service will widen the suite of services, broadening access to justice, as well as providing greater flexibility for business and individuals seeking efficient, cost-effective solutions. DIFC Courts launches notary service using Hedera Blockchain Alongside the new Mediation Service Centre, the DIFC Courts is further expanding its range of services with the launch of a notary service developed on Hedera Blockchain . As per the press release , this practical supplementary service authorizes notary officers of the DIFC Courts to administer, witness, and attest oaths, affidavits, affirmations or declarations, and certify and attest true-copy documents for businesses and individuals. The service will notarize English documents only and is the first-of-its-kind service in the UAE. The service provides an automated self-service, a live virtual system, and an in-person service. Users of the service will also have the option to utilize an authentication service through DataFlow’s primary source verification (PSV). An electronic or physical stamp and seal will be issued with each document, and notarized documents will be verified using advanced cryptographic methods, powered by Hedera Blockchain, by logging notarization events with a timestamp on the blockchain. Preservation and integrity of notarized documents will be ensured using Hedera’s distributed ledger technology (DLT) by converting documents to verifiable credentials (VC), in compliance with ERC20 standards. User privacy will be maintained at all times through advanced encryption methods and privacy-preserving protocols, ensuring that sensitive information is fully protected throughout the entire process. His Excellency Justice Omar Al Mheiri, Director, DIFC Courts, noted that the DIFC Courts’ solutions are purposefully designed to bring confidence, clarity, and certainty to the region’s first English common law system so that businesses can flourish. He stated, “As Dubai and the DIFC continue to lead in trade, investment and governance, our objective at the Courts is to advance transparent, efficient, and future-ready judicial and legal solutions to meet the evolving needs of the region’s economy.” In 2024, the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Courts in partnership with The Hashgraph Association and UAE Deca4 Consultancy launched a DLT Hedera network-enabled Digital Assets Will solution. The Digital Assets Will allows individuals to distribute their digital assets using a non-custodial DIFC Courts wallet. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

51069413,572204,1756815213,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51069413.jpeg,Previsioni Ethereum: Domanda Istituzionale e Whale Guidano il Mercato,https://bitcoinist.com/previsioni-ethereum-domanda-istituzionale-e-whale-guidano-il-mercato/,"Ethereum torna protagonista mentre la domanda istituzionale e l’ accumulo da parte delle whale continuano a modellare il mercato, nonostante una recente correzione. Anche se i ritracciamenti di prezzo hanno introdotto incertezza, il trend più ampio mostra che i grandi investitori stanno spostando capitali in ETH . I titoli sulle whale che muovono ingenti quantità di fondi per accumulare Ethereum hanno dominato il ciclo di notizie, rafforzando la percezione di ETH come asset fondamentale per la prossima fase del mercato. Una whale Bitcoin OG passa a Ethereum Uno degli attori più rilevanti di questo trend è un massiccio wallet Bitcoin OG che ha più volte attirato l’attenzione degli analisti. Secondo Lookonchain , questa whale ha venduto altri 2.000 BTC (circa 215 milioni di $ ) e acquistato immediatamente 48.942 ETH (215 milioni di $) spot nelle ultime quattro ore. Questa mossa aggressiva si aggiunge a una posizione già consistente, riflettendo una chiara strategia di rotazione del capitale da Bitcoin a Ethereum . Cresce la fiducia delle whale su Ethereum Tali transazioni evidenziano la crescente fiducia delle whale e delle istituzioni nel valore a lungo termine di Ethereum , soprattutto mentre l’attività di rete e l’adozione restano solide. Nonostante la volatilità di breve periodo, questi movimenti su larga scala indicano un trend di fondo: il ruolo di Ethereum come principale alternativa a Bitcoin si sta rafforzando e il mercato si prepara alla prossima fase. Whale Accumulation e speculazioni su Ethereum Sempre secondo Lookonchain, l’investitore Bitcoin OG ha ora accumulato ben 886.371 ETH , per un valore di circa 4,07 miliardi di $ . Questa enorme posizione è rapidamente diventata uno degli sviluppi più discussi nel mercato crypto, alimentando la speculazione sul futuro di Ethereum nei prossimi mesi. Molti analisti lo interpretano come un chiaro caso di “smart money positioning” , con whale e istituzioni che trattano Ethereum come la principale alternativa a Bitcoin nell’attuale rotazione di capitale. La portata di questi acquisti suggerisce molto più che semplice speculazione: i grandi investitori stanno inviando un segnale di fiducia nel ruolo a lungo termine di Ethereum, in particolare grazie al suo dominio in DeFi, stablecoin e attività on-chain . Inoltre, lo staking di gran parte di queste risorse mostra convinzione nella capacità di Ethereum di generare rendimento mentre contribuisce alla sicurezza della rete. Rischi e incertezze Non mancano però i rischi. Bitcoin fatica a mantenere il trend rialzista e l’incertezza sulla sua capacità di recuperare slancio pesa sull’intero mercato. Allo stesso tempo, diverse altcoin stanno affrontando correzioni profonde, evidenziando la fragilità del sentiment in questa fase. Ethereum in fase di consolidamento Ethereum ( ETH ) attualmente scambia intorno a 4.380$ dopo un altro tentativo fallito di superare la resistenza a 4.500$ . Il grafico mostra ETH bloccato in una fase di consolidamento, con un andamento laterale da metà agosto. Nonostante la volatilità, ETH rimane sopra la SMA a 200 giorni (4.220$) , un supporto chiave che continua ad attirare acquirenti sui ribassi. Le SMA a 50 e 100 giorni , ora intorno a 4.460$ , stanno fungendo da resistenza dinamica, limitando il momentum rialzista. Ogni rifiuto da questa zona riflette l’incertezza del mercato, con i trader in attesa di una chiara direzione. Se ETH mantiene i 4.400$ , un ritorno verso 4.600–4.800$ rimane possibile. Una rottura sotto i 4.300$ , invece, potrebbe innescare ulteriori ribassi verso l’area di supporto dei 4.200$ . Indicatori e prospettive Gli indicatori di momentum suggeriscono una fase di raffreddamento dopo il forte rally di luglio e inizio agosto. La compressione dei prezzi segnala che il mercato si sta preparando a un prossimo movimento significativo. Dal punto di vista fondamentale, i dati on-chain che mostrano accumulo da parte delle whale e riserve in calo sugli exchange continuano a supportare una prospettiva rialzista di lungo termine .",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 12:13:33

Investors are asking themselves whether chasing old giants like BTC, ETH, and SOL will ever deliver another 100x, or if the real shot at outsized gains lies elsewhere. That’s where Smart Yield Coin (SYC) comes in. Still in its presale stage, SYC is positioning itself as a transparent, utility-driven token with features that could cut costs, boost rewards, and push adoption further than meme-driven names like SHIB, DOGE, PEPE, or BONK ever did. For traders hunting returns, the underdog is already starting to steal the spotlight. Binance coin faces technical hurdles The BNB price has been caught in choppy waters. After touching an all-time high of $900 in late August, it dropped into a tight range between $849.88 and $868.76 over the past 24 hours. Early bullish momentum carried BNB as high as $868.08 before heavy selling slammed the brakes. BNB volume spiked to 72,000 tokens during the failed breakout attempt, well above its average of 54,000, suggesting plenty of participation but little follow-through. Daily active wallet addresses on BNB Chain nearly doubled to 2.5 million, according to DeFiLlama, yet transaction volumes have been sliding since June. Macro conditions could also play a role in shaping the next BNB price prediction. U.S. jobs data is around the corner, with markets pricing in a high chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut. A supportive macro backdrop could help BNB grind higher, but resistance near $867–$868 has now become the ceiling to beat. If BNB buyers fail to reclaim that zone, retracements toward $850–$855 look more likely. Source: TradingView Smart Yield Coin: A presale with real utility If BNB represents the established powerhouse, Smart Yield Coin (SYC) is the challenger built for 2025. Its presale is still in Stage 1, meaning early investors have the rare chance to lock in tokens at the lowest possible price before later stages push valuations higher. In contrast to blue chips like XRP or meme-fueled runs in DOGE and WIF, SYC isn’t relying on nostalgia or community hype alone, it’s offering real solutions. At the heart of its pitch is utility. Features like Hold-to-Earn and AutoMine turn passive participation into rewards, while Smart Yield Pay debit and credit cards let holders actually spend crypto across multiple currencies. The real innovation, though, may be its AI Gas Fee Prediction Tool, which optimizes transaction timing to cut costs by up to 50%. For traders frustrated by rising network fees, even on efficient chains like BNB Chain, that kind of savings could make SYC indispensable. Transparency backs the hype. Smart Yield Coin (SYC) has already completed a full audit, operates as a legally incorporated company, and is led by industry veterans like CMO Manuel Navarrete Alguacil, whose 15+ years span law, finance, and blockchain development. Compare that to the opacity of many presales, and the difference is striking. With a capped supply of 1 billion tokens and only 10% set aside for presale, scarcity is built into its tokenomics. Conclusion: Why the smart money is shifting BNB still holds its place as one of crypto’s giants, with deep liquidity, institutional backing, and strong on-chain activity. But history shows that the biggest percentage gains rarely come from the biggest names. That’s why more seasoned investors are turning their eyes toward the presale market, where ground-floor entries can translate into exponential upside. Smart Yield Coin (SYC) isn’t just another token, it’s a project with audited security, real-world use cases, and leadership that gives it staying power. With Stage 1 offering the lowest possible entry point, this is the kind of opportunity that doesn’t linger for long. Don’t miss your chance to secure Smart Yield Coin (SYC) at the presale price before the next stage lifts valuations.

Analysts see breakout levels at $2.85, $2.95, and $3.13, with $3.40 signaling new ATH. The asset also formed a spinning bottom pattern, which could lead to a bullish reversal. XRP Retests Crucial Support at $2.65 XRP is testing the $2.65 support level, seen as critical to preserving its bullish setup. Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO noted the recent touch at $2.70, which matched his expected retest. They cautioned, “A close below $2.65 could lead to further downside.” If the level holds, buyers may attempt a rebound. A breakdown, however, would expose lower supports at $2.50 and $2.33, leaving the market vulnerable to more pressure. #XRP – Throwback Update! : For a #Bullish continuation, #XRP needs to close above the following key levels: $2.85 $2.95 $3.13 And of course, $3.40, which would signal a new all-time high (ATH)!

EGRAG CRYPTO explained that clearing these zones would open the way to $3.40, adding, “$3.40 would signal a new all-time high.” Their chart also shows a potential move toward $4.20, though this scenario depends on holding $2.65 and reclaiming higher resistances. Trendline Break Sparks Caution Steph presented a different view, pointing out that XRP has lost its long-term ascending trendline, which had guided the move since mid-2024. His weekly chart highlights a breakdown point where the price failed to stay above the trend. He warned that this could accelerate losses, projecting a possible decline below $2.00 and even into the $0.50–$0.60 range if buyers do not reclaim the lost trendline. “Should we worry?” he asked, while stressing that sustained closes under the line would strengthen the bearish outlook. Moving Averages and MACD Signals The 9-week moving average is at $3.04, acting as near-term resistance, while the 21-week moving average at $2.57 provides underlying support. With XRP trading at $2.81, the price is consolidating between the two levels. Source: TradingView The MACD line (0.2403) is slightly above the signal line (0.2397), showing a weak bullish crossover. The histogram is close to zero, reflecting indecision. A wider spread would confirm momentum, while a reversal would point to renewed downside. Another analyst outlined the formation of a spinning bottom for XRP, which could result in a price reversal, especially when combined with the back-to-back buy signal from the TD Sequential.

Fees from liquidity pools fund the repurchase of WLFI. Long-term holders may benefit from price stabilization. WLFI Token Buyback and Burn: How It Works World Liberty Financial has proposed a new buyback and burn mechanism for the WLFI token. The plan involves using 100% of liquidity fees (POL) to repurchase WLFI tokens on the open market. These tokens will then be sent to a burn address, gradually reducing the total supply. The team believes this strategy will not only support token price stabilization but also reward long-term holders by redistributing supply in their favor. Additional sources of protocol income may be considered to strengthen the program. Impact on Token Supply and Investor Benefits By implementing a deflationary mechanism, WLFI aims to create sustainable growth and reduce excess circulating supply. Transparency is a priority: all buyback and burn transactions will be publicly recorded. The effectiveness of the program will increase as more users interact with the protocol, directly contributing to WLFI’s long-term stability. Community feedback on the proposal has been largely positive, though a voting date has not yet been announced. WLFI was initially non-tradable, and a community vote eventually allowed its release on major exchanges. Experts anticipate that the buyback and burn mechanism could stabilize prices while rewarding early adopters and long-term investors. If successful, this program could create one of the most sustainable deflationary mechanisms in the crypto market today. Investors may see long-term value appreciation as the circulating supply gradually decreases.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-02 12:24:45

Surging investor interest has led to the creation of a small but devoted community around the project, helping it grow, meet targets, and set new ones. The project has achieved several milestones in its short history, including completing its presale phase, starting the pre-launch phase, reaching fundraising milestones, and launching its own exchange. As the project nears the $900,000 mark, let’s look back at some of its major milestones. A Brief Introduction To Husky Inu (HINU) Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest member of the meme coin pack. The project was created to bring more value and utility to its users and token holders by leveraging the power of the Solana blockchain. Husky Inu aims to build a robust and supportive community that boasts enhanced rewards and innovative features. The project’s presale was a resounding success, with the pre-launch phase beginning after the presale concluded. Husky Inu’s presale success should come as no surprise given what the project has planned. Husky Inu plans to launch two standout features: An Earn App and a decentralized exchange. The Earn App is designed to reward users for interacting with the project and completing simple tasks like liking, reposting, and sharing content. The decentralized exchange will facilitate decentralized trading and improve the utility and value of the HINU token. Start Of The Pre-Launch Phase Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase began with much fanfare after the conclusion of its presale. Officially starting on April 1, the pre-launch phase picks up where the Husky Inu presale left off and continues the project’s fundraising efforts as it approaches its launch date. It is the next strategic step in the Husky Inu roadmap, designed to raise additional capital to fund ongoing development, platform improvements, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The new phase also welcomes new participants and contributors to the ecosystem. Activation Of Card Payments Husky Inu (HINU) introduced card payments in partnership with wert.io to make HINU token purchases simple, secure, and easily accessible to investors. The collaboration allowed the project to accept card payments, making the HINU token more accessible than ever before to interested users. The partnership enables anyone with a credit or debit card to seamlessly purchase the HINU token and throw their support behind the fledgling meme coin project. It also simplified a significant complexity faced by many projects, lowering the entry barrier and making it easy to get started. The partnership also makes the Husky Inu presale accessible to new users who want to invest in tokens without complex processes. Fundraising Milestones Husky Inu has crossed several milestones since its presale and pre-launch phases. The HINU token value remained constant during the project’s presale. However, the project adopted a dynamic and progressive pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, increasing the price of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering the project’s growing community. This pricing strategy helped Husky Inu cross the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The recent crypto market rally and the return of investor interest have allowed the project to reach the $850,000 milestone in record time, crossing it on July 25. The project is now on the verge of reaching the $900,000 mark, having raised $886,048 so far. SwapCrypto.com The project recently announced the launch of its very own cryptocurrency exchange, SwapCrypto.com. The launch is a significant step for the Husky Inu ecosystem, reinforcing its commitment to provide value to its nascent user base and building real-world utility. Unlike other memecoins that depend on hype and speculation, Husky Inu is dedicated to its utility and long-term vision. Instead of becoming just another memecoin, it is creating the infrastructure to give its community the tools to engage with digital finance. SwapCrypto.com enhances Husky Inu’s growing ecosystem and solidifies its position in an increasingly competitive DeFi ecosystem.

According to Google’s help page, a new Play Games update will change profiles to have a Steam-like feature for “showcasing and tracking your game progress and stats, new ways to build your gaming community, and allowing you to tailor your profile to your liking.” The update could also make Play Games profiles similar to Sony PlayStation’s data sharing, which asks new and existing users to choose whom they can share games with. Per Google, the changes will be applied automatically and will begin globally on September 23, with the European Union and the United Kingdom set to receive the update on October 1. The tech company has already begun notifying Play users directly through email. “To help you connect with other players, you can make your profile public, which will allow you to follow other players and find their updates,” it stated on its support page. What data will Google collect? The update allows Google to gather data from users’ gaming activity, including information about the games installed on a device, how often they are played, and the length of each session. Visibility settings will be left on default unless users decide to change them. Certain games will see additional data shared by participating developers, such as achievement progress, leaderboard rankings, and saved in-game events. “Participating developers may receive and/or collect information about your profile, activity within their specific game, and purchases made in their game,” the tech giants said. Users with an existing Play Games profile have a one-time option to import their previously accrued gaming activity stored in their Google Account. If accepted, this information will be added into the new profile in terms of gaming statistics. Google reiterated that players can choose to make their profile public or private, delete their account entirely, or adjust visibility settings at any time. GDPR in question: Is data sharing consent overrated? For the search engine powering company to push the update, it must have considered the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ). However, most people would not be happy sharing their gaming data with a business with a base of almost 90% of internet users, including institutions. Privacy concerns about how gaming companies handle player information are beyond what Google has decided to do. On April 24, Austrian privacy group NOYB, a European Center for Digital Rights, filed a legal complaint against French gaming giant Ubisoft. The case questioned data collection by Ubisoft’s games, specifically on Far Cry Primal, and the requirement for an online connection even in single-player modes. NOYB said a fan of the game reached out to Ubisoft requesting details of the information stored about their play activity. According to NOYB, Ubisoft’s response showed session start and stop times, but revealed that the game connected to external servers 150 times in just 10 minutes. The organization described this as “secret data collection” and alleged it violates Europe’s strict GDPR rules. GDPR law requires that companies only collect data when it is “necessary.” Any unnecessary collection is considered unlawful. NOYB argues that Ubisoft’s justification for online connections, verifying game ownership, could be handled by Steam, where the user originally purchased the title, rather than requiring an additional Ubisoft account login. Ubisoft is at risk of paying fines up to four percent of its global turnover, which could total €92 million ($101 million) based on last year’s revenues of €2.3 billion.

Ethereum proxy asset Bitmine Immersion draws $253M net investment. Tesla still leads with $21.9B in Korean retail holdings. Tesla Sees Massive Outflows from South Korean Investors In August, South Korean retail investors sold a net $657 million worth of Tesla shares, the largest outflow from the company since at least early 2019, Bloomberg reported . Instead, capital is flowing into riskier assets, including Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc., considered a proxy for Ethereum. The company received $253 million in net investments that month, the article says. Tesla’s Outflows Reflect Changing Investor Sentiment In the past four months, Tesla has seen $1.8 billion in outflows, signaling waning enthusiasm among one of the world’s most dedicated retail investor groups, the publication noted. During the pandemic, South Korean traders actively bought shares of American technology giants, especially Tesla, driving up prices, according to media reports. Some investors now believe Tesla is no longer living up to expectations. “Tesla has had many inspiring stories in the past, but it has failed to capture people’s hearts. It has failed to become a leader with a leading AI narrative,” said 33-year-old investor Han Jeong-soo, who bought shares in 2019 but sold them in early 2025 to invest in other projects. Tesla Remains Popular Despite Outflows Despite the massive outflow, Tesla remains the most popular foreign stock among Korean retail traders, with a combined $21.9 billion in holdings, the publication reported. In comparison, Nvidia Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc. rank second and third with significantly smaller volumes. However, even the TSLL exchange-traded fund, which provides double leverage on Tesla shares, recorded its largest outflow since early 2024 in August – $554 million, the report noted. The shift reflects a broader trend among South Korean investors moving capital from traditional U.S. tech stocks to higher-risk, crypto-linked assets.",News|Business,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-02 13:25:26

The latest commitment brings the company’s total ETH owned or pledged to 495,362 ETH, valued at about $2.16 billion, the press release said. The firm also has up to $367.1 million reserved for further purchases, assuming Dynamix shareholders don’t redeem their shares before the merger closes. Berns, who has backed Ethereum as a platform for digital identity and internet infrastructure, is expected to join The Ether Machine’s board once the transaction finalizes later this year. His investment follows a prior anchor commitment of 169,984 ETH ($741 million) from The Ether Machine’s co-founder and chairman Andrew Keys. The firm also plans to pursue a third fundraising round of at least $500 million with Citibank leading the effort, Keys said in an interview with Reuters. The Ether Machine is part of a growing roster of public firms pursuing a strategy to acquire ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency. ETH treasury companies, led by BitMine and SharpLink Gaming, has already bought up nearly 4% of the token's supply, a dashboard by strategicethreserve.xyz shows.

In partnership with Backed, Kraken is bringing xStocks to the Ethereum blockchain, unlocking a new wave of opportunities for tokenized stocks and ETFs to be integrated across the world’s most widely adopted smart contract network. Why Ethereum makes sense for tokenized equities Ethereum’s vibrant developer community, deep liquidity and global user base make it a natural home for the next phase of xStocks’ expansion. By extending Kraken’s support of xStocks to Ethereum, we’re enabling millions of Ethereum users and thousands of live applications to source the industry standard for tokenized equities liquidity. In the coming weeks, eligible Kraken clients will be able to deposit and withdraw xStocks directly on Ethereum, providing investors greater choice and flexibility to transfer assets between the Kraken platform and self-custodial wallets for on-chain activity. As part of the integration, Backed will issue xStocks as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, ensuring full 1:1 collateralization for every tokenized equity listed on Kraken’s platform. Ethereum ecosystem partners will also work to expand xStocks integrations across DeFi protocols, wallets and dApps — bringing tokenized equities into one of the largest and most innovative communities in Web3. Unlocking access and flexibility for investors Arjun Sethi, Kraken co-CEO : “xStocks is a core part of our vision to bring traditional assets onto trust-minimized infrastructure and integrate public markets into the internet’s base layer. Our multi-chain strategy is deliberate. It ensures tokenized equities are accessible across ecosystems, portable between wallets and protocols, and composable within the applications users already trust.” “Ethereum is the next logical step. It is the center of gravity for smart contract innovation, on-chain liquidity and decentralized finance. By launching xStocks on Ethereum, we are making tokenized equities programmable, interoperable and continuously accessible to builders and institutions worldwide. This is not just about product expansion. It is about anchoring capital markets to the most secure and transparent rails available.” Roberto Klein, Backed’s co-founder : “Through the expansion of xStocks to Ethereum Mainnet, xStocks tap into the largest pool of on-chain liquidity and connect to the most well-established DeFi protocols in the space. xStocks are designed for composability. We look forward to working with these teams and developing xStocks to their full potential.” The road ahead for xStocks Bringing xStocks to Ethereum continues our mission to bring traditional equities on-chain and open access to capital markets worldwide. Having already launched xStocks to Kraken clients via Solana — and following recent announcements of upcoming integrations with BNB chain and the TRON network — xStocks have quickly become established as the global standard for tokenized equities. Today, xStocks are available to Kraken clients in over 140 countries, as well as users of many competing centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges and self-custodial wallets. Since launching in late June, xStocks has already eclipsed $3.5 billion in combined CEX and DEX volume, a clear signal of both market demand for this asset class and xStocks’ leading category position. Our multi-chain strategy for xStocks is rooted in a simple belief: tokenized equities should be open, permissionless and interoperable across ecosystems – giving users the freedom to access markets on the platforms and applications they trust most. In the weeks ahead, we’ll continue working with Backed and leading crypto communities to expand access to xStocks, bringing the future of tokenized equities to more users, builders and markets across the world.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/banking-giant-citibank-announces-stablecoins-could-launch-financial-transformation-here-are-the-details/,"Global banking giant Citi announced in its latest “Securities Services Evolution” report that the post-clearance processes of financial transactions are on the verge of a major transformation. Citi: Stablecoins and AI Could Launch a New Era in Financial Transactions The bank's fifth annual survey drew opinions from 537 industry leaders, including custodians, brokerage firms and asset managers. According to the report, tokenization, T+1 implementation, and artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based automation are reshaping post-clearance transactions. Citi predicts that 10% of market volume could be in tokenized assets by 2030. It's emphasized that stablecoins issued by the bank will be the primary enablers of this transformation, playing a critical role in collateral efficiency and fund tokenization. The Asia-Pacific region, in particular, is leading the way in this area thanks to both individual investor interest and regulatory support. AI integration is also a priority for the industry. 86% of companies surveyed said they are testing AI in their customer onboarding processes, while 57% are running pilot projects for direct post-clearance transactions. According to Citi, speed and automation will be the most critical elements in the transition to the T+1 standard. “From expedited settlement to automation in asset servicing, there's a globally converging vision around the same themes,” said Chris Cox, Head of Citi Investor Services. “The industry is on the cusp of a historic transformation driven by the adoption of digital assets and the application of artificial intelligence.” *This is not investment advice.

Notably, XRP has recently faced strong bearish pressure, dropping to around $2.72 at the start of this month, September 2025, after peaking near $3.66 in July. However, CryptoInsightUK suggests that this decline might have marked the completion of a corrective phase, setting the stage for a major bullish breakout. His chart applies Elliott Wave theory to XRP's price action, presenting a roadmap of potential upside targets if major support levels hold.XRP Now Completing Its Corrective Wave 2According to the chart, the first major impulsive wave began in late June 2025, carrying XRP from its consolidation phase around the $2 region to a July peak of roughly $3.66 . Notably, this came amid a broader market recovery push.The surge formed a smaller five-wave structure, which CryptoInsightUK labeled as a larger Wave (1). Following this sharp rally, XRP entered what he described as an expanded flat corrective pattern labeled A–B–C, with the final C-leg pulling prices back toward $2.72 at the time of press.Importantly, this correction, which XRP has continued to face, shows declining volume and neutral momentum readings on the three-day RSI. This suggests that the retracement is more likely a cooling phase rather than the start of a deeper downtrend. XRP 3D Chart | CryptoInsightUK Notably, CryptoInsightUK's chart marks the $2.72 region as the major support zone where Wave (2) likely ended. If this level continues to hold, he expects the next phase, Wave (3), to emerge as a powerful impulsive rally. For the uninitiated, Elliott Wave principles often view the third wave as the strongest and longest, and his projection shows XRP first breaking into the mid-$6 region before potentially reaching as high as $9.69. However, he also outlined an alternative scenario. Specifically, if XRP drops below the $1.99–$1.94 range, the current bullish count would be invalidated, requiring a fresh assessment of the entire structure. For context, the last time XRP saw this level was in June 2025.Expert Opinions from Other AnalystsAfter sharing his analysis, CryptoInsightUK consulted another analyst, CrediBULL, asking whether his wave count aligned with Elliott Wave rules. Responding, CrediBULL explained that the important question is whether the rally from $1.90 was impulsive or merely a corrective bounce. He admitted that he was uncertain on that point but stressed that either way, XRP should not revisit levels below $1.90, so the long-term bullish outlook remained intact. In a separate commentary , CrediBULL added that XRP had already confirmed daily bullish divergences against Ethereum on the XRP/ETH pair, with a three-day bullish divergence also forming. He believes these signals confirm XRP could outperform ETH in the coming weeks and months. XRPETH Chart | CrediBULL Meanwhile, amid the ongoing downtrend, which has triggered a 10% drop in XRP price over the past three weeks, market analyst Dom highlighted trading behavior on Korean exchanges that might have contributed to the slump. He noted significant net outflows since the $3.60 peak. https://twitter.com/traderview2/status/1962341476882387304Specifically, Upbit alone recorded outflows of 536 million XRP, while all other exchanges combined saw 296 million XRP in net outflows. Interestingly, Coinbase and Bitstamp reported net buying during the same period.However, analyst Ali Martinez presented important price levels for XRP's bullish path once a recovery begins. He emphasized that XRP should hold above $2.70 and attempt to reclaim $2.90. Such a move could set the stage for a break above $3.70, and this would confirm the start of the next major upward leg.

This filing was disclosed through a Form S-1 registration submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The announcement comes during a hot period for public listings, with IPO volumes climbing across U.S. exchanges in recent months. According to Gemini, the deal includes a 30-day option that lets underwriters buy up to 2,396,348 extra shares from the company and 103,652 shares from existing holders if demand exceeds expectations. These shares are meant to cover any over-allotments once trading begins. Until the SEC makes the registration effective, though, no shares can be sold or bought. The company made clear that this offer depends fully on market conditions, and there’s no guarantee the offering will close or price within the suggested range. Gemini submits Nasdaq application as crypto IPO wave builds The IPO will only be available through an official prospectus. Copies of that prospectus can be requested from Goldman Sachs, which is serving as a lead bookrunner. Another option is Citigroup, also a lead bookrunner, who’s handling requests. Along with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, the underwriter list includes Morgan Stanley and Cantor, also acting as lead bookrunners. Additional bookrunners are Evercore ISI, Mizuho, Truist Securities, Cohen & Company Capital Markets, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which is part of Stifel, Needham & Company, and Rosenblatt. This IPO attempt places Gemini in line to become the third publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S., right after Coinbase, which joined the S&P 500 earlier this year, and Bullish, which went public months ago. The timing aligns perfectly with the current surge in IPO activity on Wall Street thanks to strong debut sessions and rising investor interest, which are helping revive public markets after a dry spell that stretched through the last crypto winter. Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, who founded Gemini, first gained public attention through their legal dispute with Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg. That 2008 lawsuit resulted in a settlement that the twins used to invest in Bitcoin, a decision that made them among the earliest crypto billionaires. Their bet on Bitcoin, back when it was still trading in the low double digits, earned them the nickname “Bitcoin twins.” Since then, they’ve built Gemini into a recognizable brand in the crypto industry, with global operations and a push toward regulatory compliance.

For context, XRP's built-in burn mechanism has a small but important role in the ecosystem. Specifically, each transaction on the XRP Ledger carries a small fee, and the network permanently removes or ""burns"" this fee. The XRPL's Burn FeatureHowever, the original architects of the XRP Ledger never designed this feature to make the crypto asset scarce or drive its price upward. Instead, they implemented it primarily to prevent spam transactions on the network.Despite this original purpose, several individuals within the XRP community believe large-scale burns could impact XRP's value. At present, the daily average of XRP destroyed through transaction fees hovers around 2,700 tokens. However, recent declines in network activity have pushed this figure down to roughly 600 tokens per day. Notably, since the network's launch 13 years ago, only 14.19 million XRP has been burned, which represents a mere 0.014% of the total supply of 100 billion tokens. At this slow pace, reaching even one billion burned tokens, or just 1% of the total supply, would take over a thousand years.This has led some within the community to call for alternative methods that could accelerate the burn process. Still, the actual impact of burning larger amounts remains uncertain. To understand what might happen if the XRP Ledger were to remove a large amount, say 10% of its total supply from circulation, we asked for an assessment from the AI chatbot Google Gemini.XRP Price if the Network Burns 10% of Supply According to Google Gemini, eliminating 10 billion XRP, or 10% of the total supply, would mark a major deflationary event. Currently, XRP trades at $2.71 with a circulating supply of about 59.48 billion tokens, giving it a market cap of roughly $161 billion. If 10 billion tokens disappeared from circulation, the supply would shrink to 49.48 billion tokens. If XRP kept the same market cap, its price would only climb to around $3.25 solely from the reduced supply, even without additional demand. XRP Immediate Price Projection from Burns Google Gemini XRP Immediate Price Projection from Burns | Google Gemini However, Google Gemini noted that markets do not react in such a straightforward way. Specifically, the psychological shock of such a massive supply cut would almost certainly attract new investors and fuel buying pressure. As a result, the AI chatbot suggested that the price might first surge to between $4 and $5 as traders reacted to the news, before consolidating and potentially breaking past the cryptocurrency's previous all-time high near $3.84.According to Google Gemini, the long-term outlook could become even more bullish. Amid higher demand, reduced supply, and renewed investor interest, XRP might target levels between $10 and $15 in the months following such an event, creating a market cap ranging from roughly $495 billion to $742 billion.

In a post on X this Sunday, PlanC suggested that Bitcoin might slowly trend upward over the next seven years, punctuated by relatively mild corrections. “What if, from here on, Bitcoin simply slow-grinds up and to the right, with long, drawn-out, uneventful 10–30% corrections and consolidations?” the analyst speculated. PlanC added that Bitcoin’s growing acceptance by traditional finance and institutional players could support this steady path. A “Boring” Route to $1 Million PlanC’s outlook contrasts sharply with the market’s long-standing expectation of volatile booms and busts. The analyst argued that sideways periods often mislead investors into anticipating dramatic 80% pullbacks that never arrive. If the pattern holds, PlanC projects Bitcoin could quietly reach $1 million by 2032, later than some industry forecasts but with fewer shocks along the way. Other voices in the crypto industry have painted a more accelerated timeline. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently pointed to 2030 as a possible target, while Eric Trump argued there is “no question” Bitcoin will reach the million-dollar mark in the coming years. Jan3 founder Samson Mow sees an even more radical scenario, predicting an “omega candle” that could add $100,000 to Bitcoin’s price in a single day. He believes $1 million per coin is inevitable, perhaps as early as this year or next. Institutional Support and Market Risks Not everyone agrees that a rapid surge would be healthy for the market. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz cautioned in August that a million-dollar Bitcoin appearing too soon would signal a crisis in the U.S. economy. “People who cheer for the million-dollar Bitcoin price next year, I was like, Guys, it only gets there if we’re in such a shitty place domestically,” he warned. Notably, the market is experiencing smaller, manageable corrections amid consistent demand from corporate treasuries, institutional desks, and sovereign buyers. This structural support should smooth out volatility. For now, Bitcoin’s path to $1 million remains hotly debated — whether through a grinding march upward or a dramatic leap.

51072718,https://cryptonews.com/?p=417041,1756820221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51072718.jpeg,World Liberty Financial Price Prediction: Trump-Backed Coin Goes Live on Binance – Is This the Next $10 Billion Political Play?,https://cryptonews.com/news/world-liberty-financial-price-prediction-trump-backed-coin-goes-live-on-binance-is-this-the-next-10-billion-political-play/,"The World Liberty Financial (WLFI) price is staging a strong recovery today, bouncing 20% from a sharp dip after debuting on Binance – one of the biggest crypto listings of the year. After opening at $0.30 , WLFI experienced high volatility, sliding to $0.21 before quickly rebounding to $0.2525 at the time of writing. While this reflects a 23.5% pullback from its peak of $0.3313 , the swift bounce suggests that buyers are stepping in to defend key levels. Importantly, WLFI remains one of the most politically charged tokens in crypto history – backed by the Trump family and gaining traction as America moves toward friendlier crypto policies. With the Binance listing now complete and high-profile attention behind it, WLFI could become the first meme-coin-style token to ride real-world political events to a $10 billion valuation . World Liberty Financial Price Prediction: Trump-Backed Coin Goes Live on Binance – Is This the Next $10 Billion Political Play? WLFI is the governance token of the World Liberty Financial DeFi platform that launched last year , attracting over 100,000 signups prior to going live. Binance will list World Liberty Financial (WLFI) with Seed Tag Applied https://t.co/0EmyBMBsX4 pic.twitter.com/YA3V1vjLbq — Binance (@binance) September 1, 2025 The listing of its native WLFI token generated considerable hype, but while there was a brief post-listing surge, the token has failed to sustain its initial burst of excitement. This is perhaps not surprising, given that early users of the World Liberty Financial platform had been sitting on WLFI for several months, without the ability to sell. As such, there was a wave of selling when the first batch of tokens were made available for listing yesterday, with the coin currently having a circulating supply of 27.36 billion WLFI (out of a max supply of 100 billion WLFI). World Liberty Financial (WLFI) appears to be setting up for a bullish rebound , with price action dipping into a key support zone before what could be a sharp reversal. According to the 5-minute chart, WLFI is now testing a demand area near $0.21–$0.22 , after breaking down from a rising wedge earlier in the day. The RSI currently sits around 38.7 , just above oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce as buyer interest begins to build again. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram is showing early signs of flattening out, often a precursor to a shift in momentum – especially when combined with rising volume support. If bulls defend this key zone, the next leg could push WLFI back above the $0.30–$0.32 range , before targeting $0.50 in the short to mid-term. With growing attention around WLFI’s ties to high-profile backers and institutional narratives, this pullback may prove to be a launchpad rather than a breakdown. In other words, buyers are flocking to the coin, which should boost the World Liberty Financial price again soon enough. $WLFI is showing a classic high-risk pattern. Price is down -50% from its peak, yet Open Interest has surged +22% to $955M. This divergence, where leverage increases as price falls, often precedes severe liquidations. The setup echoes $TRUMP’s post-ICO crash: a parabolic rally,… pic.twitter.com/a4pdSbl52A — Greg Miller (@greg_miller05) September 2, 2025 And in the longer term, the coin’s attachment to a Trump-backed business will help it grow steadily, especially if new deals, partnerships, and initiatives are announced. As such, the World Liberty Financial price could hit $0.50 soon, while it could end the year closer to $1+ . $13.4 Million: L2 Network Bitcoin Hyper Breaks New Ground in Presale For traders looking for even newer tokens to invest in, there’s currently a variety of presale coins available. Some of these could have the potential to rally strongly once they list for the first time, and one of the most promising available right now is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a layer-two network for Bitcoin .

As a layer-two network, Bitcoin Hyper will provide BTC holders will ultra-fast confirmation times and low transaction fees, while its smart contract functionality will enable the development of a whole host of DeFi applications and protocols. This means that it will provide the opportunity to tap into the enormous value of the Bitcoin network for DeFi purposes, with users able to put their BTC to work, earning yields on top of any price appreciation. It will harness Solana’s Virtual Machine (SVM), providing superior speed and scalability , as well as compatibility with Solana’s large ecosystem of dapps. In addition, Bitcoin Hyper will make use of zero-knowledge rollups, enabling greater throughput, as well as more security and privacy. This promises to make Bitcoin Hyper one of the most capable L2’s in crypto, which helps to explain why its presale is doing so well. Investors can join this sale now by going to the project’s official website and connecting a compatible wallet (such as Best Wallet ). HYPER is currently available at $0.012845, although this will rise again in just under two days.

Why September’s Ethereum (ETH) Chart Could Fool Everyone,https://cryptopotato.com/uptober-incoming-why-septembers-ethereum-eth-chart-could-fool-everyone/,"Ethereum’s (ETH) momentum has stalled, with the token tumbling from its August record of $4,950 to under $4,300. The decline reflects investors shifting focus to securing profits after the recent rally, as the overall sentiment appears to have extended into September. But ETH’s bearish setup may not be what it seems, and traders fearing the altcoin’s September breakdown may regret it. Greatest Bear Trap Ethereum may be on the verge of what some analysts call the “biggest bear trap” this month. In his latest post on X, crypto trader and analyst Johnny Woo warned that Ether could appear bearish in September by forming a head-and-shoulders pattern, which happens to be a classic signal of potential downside. However, if invalidated, this setup could flip sentiment in October, known in crypto circles as “Uptober,” forcing sidelined traders to buy back in at higher levels. Such pattern-driven reversals have occurred before, and have now fueled speculation about Ethereum’s next decisive move. Woo also went on to highlight the critical support zone for Ethereum, as he noted that the $3,800 to $4,100 range is an area to watch closely. According to the analyst, this level has become increasingly significant for traders. If the altcoin manages to hold above this level, it could strengthen bullish sentiment, while a breakdown might open the door for further downside pressure. Bullish Setup Crypto trader Hardy also expressed strong bullish sentiment on Ethereum, and tweeted that the asset looks “ready to PUUMP” with an imminent breakout ahead. He suggested that, based on its previous price action, Ethereum could deliver a “double pump” move. Meanwhile, another popular market watcher, Axel BitBlaze, said that ETH’s setup looks primed for another breakout. He highlighted a cup-and-handle formation alongside two powerful pumps, each retracing before fueling further upside. With the market now on pause, BitBlaze believes that a potential third move could be the most aggressive yet, possibly catapulting ETH above the $5,000 mark. The post Uptober Incoming?

The controversial influencer’s liquidation on Hyperliquid extends his trading losses to nearly $700,000 across 80 trades with just a 36% win rate. Tate reopened his WLFI position within minutes of the liquidation, continuing his pattern of high-leverage crypto betting despite the broader market downtime. The setback follows a rare $16,000 profit from shorting Kanye West’s YZY token two weeks earlier at 3x leverage. Trading Record Shows Consistent Losses Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported Tate’s WLFI position was liquidated six hours before their Tuesday morning update, wiping out his $67,500 investment. Andrew Tate( @Cobratate )'s $WLFI long was liquidated for a $67.5K loss 6 hours ago. But he did not give up and immediately reopened a long position on $WLFI . https://t.co/09Rmkt6BIb pic.twitter.com/MUhAtqT09G — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 2, 2025 Within minutes of the liquidation, Tate had reopened a long position on WLFI, betting again on the token’s price appreciation despite the fresh loss. His latest WLFI bet occurred one day after the Trump family-tied token began trading on major exchanges Monday, ending months of private-only sales. The token crashed from $0.331 to $0.210 within hours as 24.6 billion newly unlocked tokens entered circulation. WLFI Trading Price (Source: CoinMarketCap ) By Tuesday morning, WLFI recovered slightly to trade above $0.242, though it remained over 21% below its launch price according to CoinMarketCap data. Tate’s liquidation occurred during this initial volatility period, with his leveraged position eliminated as prices fell below his entry point. The WLFI loss continues a troubling pattern on Hyperliquid, where only 29 of his 80 trades have generated profits, resulting in $699,000 cumulative losses. His August short on YZY at 3x leverage stands as a rare profitable position among his losing streaks. Tate’s Trading History (Source: Lookonchain ) Earlier in June, Tate also held a 25x leveraged long position on Ethereum, though blockchain analysis later revealed the trade resulted in steep net losses despite his claims of 138.5% profit. Before his active engagement in trading, the former kickboxer previously launched his own meme token, Daddy Tate ($DADDY), on Solana, which reached a $124.57 million market cap in July 2024 before collapsing and was later dubbed as another influencer scam project. Technical Vulnerabilities Compound Market Risks While Tate battles personal trading losses, WLFI itself faces systematic security threats that could affect its long-term viability and add significant complexity for holders and active traders. Security researchers at SlowMist recently identified coordinated attacks targeting WLFI token holders through critical vulnerabilities in Ethereum’s EIP-7702 upgrade implemented in May. The report shows that hackers have systematically exploited the upgrade’s delegation features to install malicious smart contracts that automatically drain wallets containing WLFI and other tokens upon receipt. Over 97% of EIP-7702 delegations have been linked to identical wallet-draining contracts designed specifically to sweep incoming funds, creating widespread risks for token holders. These technical problems compound WLFI’s existing market challenges, as the token continues trading more than 21% below its launch price. Meanwhile, the Trump family’s paper wealth reportedly surged by $6 billion on WLFI’s trading debut , with the family controlling nearly 25% of all tokens through locked holdings. World Liberty Financial proposed a token buyback and burn program using protocol fees to create artificial demand, although specific details about fee amounts or implementation timelines weren’t mentioned.

Alexei Miller, Gazprom CEO, revealed that the pipeline will transport natural gas from Russia’s Yamal fields to China via Mongolia for 30 years, with annual supplies projected to reach 50bcm. Both countries have also agreed to expand gas exports via existing routes. The Power of Siberia pipeline route will increase from 38 billion cubic meters (bcm) to 44 bcm per year, and the Far Eastern Route will increase its deliveries from 10 bcm to 12 bcm annually. Following a reduced transport path, the plan is expected to lower gas prices in China compared to European rates. China set to benefit from relatively cheaper gas due to shortened pipeline route Alexei Miller, Gazprom CEO, noted that gas pricing for China will be reduced compared to the current rate delivered to Europe. He revealed that payments will be made in a 1:1 ratio in rubles to yuan. This means that for gas transactions under the Power of Siberia-2 pipeline agreement, the payment currency will be split equally between Russian rubles and Chinese yuan. Gazprom CEO described the project as the biggest and most capital-intensive in the world. He revealed that plans for constructing the Siberia-2 and Soyuz-Vostok pipelines had been in place for over a decade, even before the original Power of Siberia pipeline was started in 2019. The Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has recently been engaged in several talks with Vladimir Putin. As reported on Cryptopolitan, Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia in May improved their ties and presented a united front against U.S. influence. The agreement follows trilateral talks between China, Moscow, and Mongolia discussing the pipeline project. During the visit, the two leaders signed over 20 deals across the energy and technology sectors. They insisted on building a global balance independent of U.S. dominance, with Putin describing their relationship as equal and mutually beneficial. China will also allow visa-free visits for Russian citizens for up to 30 days from September 15. The previous rule only allowed limited access of up to 30 days for direct flights to Hainan Island. Russia shifts focus to Asia as Europe diversifies its gas supply sources Russia began supplying gas via the Power of Siberia pipeline in 2019 through an agreement with CNPC. So far, the contractual obligations have been exceeded since 2020. Gazprom reached its maximum in December 2024 by supplying 38 bcm via the pipeline. Gas demand in China has also increased by 28% this year throughout the first eight months. The agreement follows Moscow’s increased energy deliveries in Asia as the country faces a European market shortage due to sanctions . According to a report by GIS, Russian pipeline gas exports to Europe via Ukraine were stopped when Kyiv rejected the renewal of the Gazprom contract. European markets have not been significantly impacted since they have already diversified their gas supply sources. According to the report, the U.S. is the leading supplier of liquified natural gas to Europe. Norway and Qatar have also expanded their exports into Europe, which reduces dependence on Russian gas. Moscow is shifting toward Asia through China, but some analysts warn that the country risks having a weaker negotiating position due to reliance on a single buyer. Some analysts have also concluded that Russia’s dominance in the global competition and energy market is likely dead. If implemented, the agreement with China means that Russia’s east-bound exports will exceed 100bcm yearly, making Moscow the biggest gas supplier to China. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

51073573,572307,1756821200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51073573.jpeg,Record de l’or et chute du Bitcoin : que se passe-t-il ?,https://bitcoinist.com/cours-or-nouveau-record-chute-btc/,"L’or vient de signer un nouveau record historique . Il confirme alors une fois de plus son rôle de valeur refuge en période d’incertitude économique. En parallèle, le Bitcoin décroche brutalement, semant une confusion certaine chez de nombreux investisseurs. Pourquoi cet écart soudain entre deux actifs souvent présentés comme concurrents sur le terrain de la protection contre l’inflation ? La réponse tient à un cocktail de facteurs : d’un côté, la peur d’un ralentissement économique mondial et des tensions géopolitiques qui poussent les capitaux vers les métaux précieux ; de l’autre, la pression réglementaire et la volatilité persistante qui fragilisent le BTC . Résultat : les flux se déplacent vers l’or , laissant le Bitcoin à la peine, du moins temporairement. L’or attire à nouveau les capitaux prudents L’or n’a jamais vraiment quitté son rôle de valeur refuge , mais en ce moment, il reprend toute sa force. Avec la croissance qui ralentit et des signaux économiques de plus en plus fragiles, les investisseurs institutionnels cherchent du solide , du palpable . Résultat : ils se replient sur le métal jaune . Le timing joue aussi en sa faveur : le dollar faiblit et les banques centrales achètent massivement, ce qui fait grimper encore plus la demande . Ce record historique n’est pas juste symbolique, il traduit une soif de sécurité absolue . Quand les marchés vacillent, l’or attire naturellement les capitaux souvent au détriment d’actifs jugés plus risqués, comme le Bitcoin . Pourquoi le Bitcoin décroche en parallèle On compare souvent le Bitcoin à l’or , mais les derniers jours montrent à quel point ils jouent dans deux registres différents. L’or rassure avec son histoire millénaire et sa stabilité, tandis que le BTC reste balloté par sa volatilité et par des zones d’ombre réglementaires. Les annonces récentes aux États-Unis et en Europe , qui durcissent le ton sur les cryptos, ont refroidi plus d’un investisseur institutionnel. Résultat : une partie des capitaux glisse vers l’or , jugé plus sûr. Mais ce repli n’est pas une remise en cause du Bitcoin sur le long terme. C’est surtout un rappel : le marché crypto vit au rythme des cycles économiques et politiques , parfois brutalement. Deux cryptos figurant parmi les meilleurs meme coins l’ont très bien compris et veulent sortir du lot. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) : Le Layer 2 qui veut élargir Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper n’essaie pas de réinventer la roue. Il veut donner un nouveau souffle à Bitcoin . Rendre la première crypto plus rapide, plus flexible et enfin programmable, tout en gardant son socle de sécurité inébranlable. Voilà son idée ambitieuse. Pour ça, le projet s’appuie sur un Layer 2 qui embarque la Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , capable de lancer des smart contracts ultra-rapides et bon marché. En pratique, c’est la porte ouverte à des applis décentralisées adossées directement à Bitcoin . Une avancée que beaucoup attendaient depuis des années. La présale parle d’elle-même : plus de 12,7 millions déjà levés , un prix autour de 0,0128 $ et une offre limitée qui alimente l’effet de rareté. La répartition des fonds est pensée pour durer : développement, sécurité, marketing, liquidité, rien n’est laissé au hasard. Pourquoi s’y intéresser ? Parce que Bitcoin Hyper combine le meilleur des deux mondes : la solidité de Bitcoin et l’agilité de Solana . Une formule qui pourrait bien en faire l’une des étoiles montantes de la prochaine altcoin season . Foncez sur $HYPER ! Token6900 ($T6900) : L’ICO qui attire tous les regards en 2025 Token6900 n’a pas mis longtemps à faire parler de lui : en quelques semaines, il est devenu l’une des ICO les plus scrutées de 2025 . Son idée ? Miser sur la rareté , faire grimper le prix par paliers et utiliser les fonds de façon carrée : développement, sécurité, marketing, liquidité. Les traders flairent déjà une volatilité explosive après le claim, tandis que les investisseurs long terme regardent la roadmap et les partenariats annoncés avec beaucoup d’intérêt. Le claim imminent, c’est le crash-test. Si le projet tient la route, il pourrait vite s’imposer comme un acteur clé du marché cette année . Et pourquoi garder Token6900 dans le radar ? Parce qu’il réunit un cocktail rare : le FOMO court terme qui met le feu aux poudres et une vision qui peut durer. C’est ce mélange qui attire autant les communautés que les institutionnels. Achetez maintenant $T6900 ! Conclusion Entre l’or et le Bitcoin , tout est dit : d’un côté la sécurité rassurante du métal jaune, de l’autre l’adrénaline des cryptos . Mais au fond, les investisseurs veulent la même chose : des alternatives qui allient rendement et crédibilité . C’est là que des projets comme Bitcoin Hyper et Token6900 font leur entrée. Le premier s’attaque à un vieux défi, rendre Bitcoin plus souple et programmable. Le second trace la voie d’ICO pensées pour durer, avec une structure claire et ambitieuse. Ensemble, ils incarnent cette énergie d’un marché qui n’arrête jamais de se réinventer. Pour les investisseurs, la vraie question n’est pas de choisir entre l’or ou les cryptos , mais de savoir comment jouer des deux pour profiter du cycle.",Bitcoin|Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|SOL|ALTCOIN|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 13:53:20

While the token briefly passed the $200 level, it has since succumbed to bearish pressures and now trades under. Within the same period, Solana’s market capitalization passed $107 billion. Despite the pullback in its price, activity on Solana remains strong, riding on ETF-driven momentum and whale inflows. Meanwhile, BONK, Shiba Inu, and PEPE have pushed cryptocurrency trading volumes as investors’ activity in the tokens increased. Besides these crypto giants, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a standout altcoin as investors search for the next meme-driven trend. Meme Coins Push Network Demand BONK remains central to Solana’s momentum. Trading volume spiked 210% this week. A one trillion token burn is nearing completion, tightening supply and boosting sentiment. Shiba Inu has leaned on Shibarium. Burns are accelerating. Whales pulled over four trillion SHIB from exchanges this month, signalling long-term conviction. PEPE gained traction with NFT collaborations and whale buys. Listings and Layer-2 efforts added to the hype. These moves kept liquidity high and kept Solana fees climbing. Analyst Outlook on Solana Analysts track near-term resistance at $208 and $217. A breakout could push SOL toward $225 or higher in September. Year-end targets remain in the $300–$500 zone if ETF approvals advance. Whales continue to accumulate as exchange reserves drop. Both signals point to stronger support levels, which analysts say indicate a possible upside play. As the market recovers, BONK’s burn, SHIB’s upgrades, and PEPE’s listings may give Solana a competitive edge. MAGACOIN FINANCE Earns Investors’ Spotlight As leading cryptocurrencies come under pressure, investors are rotating to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a high-upside play. The project, which first gained attention for its roadmap and transparent model, has broken into the crypto market as a worthy breakout contender. On-chain data shows a swell in MAGACOIN FINANCE’s transaction volume. Chatter in the market is that demand for the project is fast outpacing supply. What that signals to smart investors is that the project is getting all the attention it needs to position itself ahead of the upcoming bull cycle. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the high-upside play to hold right now . Conclusion Solana’s rally is fueled by both institutional demand and meme activity. BONK, SHIB, and PEPE each added liquidity and visibility this week as investors show renewed confidence in the meme coins. However, the project getting all the attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts say its cultural energy and surging adoption position it as a token to accumulate before the market recovers.

The steep levies target vehicles priced above $46,000, according to the document, which comes as the government is pushing for Indians to buy domestic products as the US imposed high tariffs strain trade relations between the two countries. The panel’s proposals align with India’s PM The directive comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is looking at reforming the country’s tax system. Currently, India taxes all electric cars at 5%. Now, the Indian government has recommended hefty cuts in goods and services tax (GST) that could make everything from shampoos to electronics cheaper. A key panel that has been tasked with coming up with rate suggestions to the country’s GST Council is in support of sweeping cuts to many items in line with the Prime Minister’s overhaul. The document that details the recommendations however shows that the panel has called for raising taxes on electric vehicles. According to the document, the panel has proposed raising GST rate to 18% from the current 5% on electric vehicles that are priced at between 2 million and 4 million rupees which is equivalent to $23,000 to $46,000. For cars that are above $46,000, the panel has also proposed raising the tax to 28% arguing that these vehicles are for the “upper segment” of the society and largely imported and not manufactured locally . According to a government source familiar with discussions and cited by Reuters , the government has decided to do away with the 28% tax rate, leaving the GST Council with two options. The first is to increase the tax on electric vehicles to 18% while the second option is to put them in a newly planned 40% category that was created for certain high-end goods. Foreign automakers will feel the pinch in India The GST Council is expected to review the proposal at a meeting scheduled for September 3 to 4. The council is led by the federal finance minister and has members from all Indian states. Meanwhile, in response to the Reuters article, the Nifty Auto index went down as much as 0.05% as local automakers Mahindra and Mahindra fell 3%. Tata Motors dropped 1.2%. While the EV market in India is still small, accounting for 5% of total cars sold in April to July this year, its growth has been rapid. EV sales in the country surged 93% to 15,500 units during that same period. “The uptake of electric vehicles is increasing, and while the low rate of 5% is to incentivise faster adoption of electric vehicles, it is also important to signal that higher-priced EVs can be taxed at higher rates,” said the document, detailing the tax panel’s recommendations. With the latest proposal in the pipeline, domestic electric vehicle makers like Mahindra and Tata Motors may be affected, although their offerings above the 2-million-rupee range are limited. However, foreign electric vehicle makers that have luxury offerings will be hit the hardest. For instance, Tesla recently launched its Model Y in India with a base price of $65,000, while Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and BYD also offer high end electric vehicles. For Tesla, which entered the Indian market in July, it has already received fewer orders than it anticipated. The firm has recorded orders just above 600 since its launch in India. The company plans to deliver 300-500 units from its Shanghai plant in 2025, with the first batch expected this month, targeting cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, and Gurugram. In July, Tata Motors led Indian EV market commanding about 40% market share while Mahindra followed at 18%. BYD holds 3% while BMW and Mercedes account for a combined 2%. Don’t just read crypto news.

A state-owned firm in Shenzhen has launched a digital bond offering on Ethereum, showing how the country is selectively embracing new technology while keeping its hard stance on crypto trading in place. First State-Backed RWA Bond On Ethereum According to reports, Futian Investment Holding completed a 500 million yuan issuance of offshore bonds on August 29. The bonds , equal to nearly $70 million, were rolled out in Hong Kong and listed on the Ethereum blockchain. They carry a 2.62% annual interest rate and will expire in two years. The company described the deal as part of an effort to expand its funding sources while also responding to the growing use of real-world assets and tokenization in global markets. It also pointed to Hong Kong’s supportive policies as a factor in the decision, saying the bond aligns with the district’s push to attract digital asset innovation. #UZX BREAKING NEWS #RWA Futian Investment Holding Announces Issuance of the World’s First Public RWA Digital Bond on a Public Blockchain pic.twitter.com/E2sGIJZdwl — UZX Official (@UZX_Official) September 2, 2025 Crypto Still Off-Limits At Home The move does not mean that China has softened its ban on crypto or Ethereum. Back in 2021, Beijing imposed a full ban on crypto mining and trading. Officials at the time said the measures were needed to control energy use and to guard against risks that might destabilize the country’s financial system. That ban remains in effect today. Ordinary citizens and companies in mainland China are still blocked from using or trading cryptocurrencies . What is allowed, however, are limited experiments like tokenized bonds that stay within the bounds of traditional finance. Hong Kong As A Testing Ground By routing the deal through Hong Kong, Beijing can keep its domestic ban intact while still signaling that it wants exposure to blockchain-based finance. The bustling metro has been given more room to try out digital asset projects, and this latest bond fits into that role. China’s strategy delineates a clear split: blockchain as a tool for finance is embraced in regulated manifestations, while crypto as an unfettered market asset is still off-limits. Stablecoins , particularly dollar-denominated stablecoins, have also attracted scrutiny in Beijing, with officials concerned that they can undermine other currencies based around the world. Reports suggest this RWA bond may be the first in a series of state-backed blockchain and Ethereum financial products tied to Hong Kong. For now, the issuance shows China’s intent to cautiously explore blockchain without reopening the door to Bitcoin, stablecoins, or wider crypto adoption.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-this-is-the-hardest-xrp-bull-market-ever-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst StephIsCrypto recently shared an analysis, calling the current XRP bull market the hardest ever. Alongside his post, he shared a chart highlighting XRP’s consistent breakout patterns over recent years and suggested that the digital asset could be preparing for another significant move in 2025. The chart tracks XRP’s price performance against the U.S. dollar on a weekly timeframe through Bitstamp, marking breakout points in 2022, 2023, and 2024, each followed by notable upward moves. According to the chart, XRP formed downward sloping resistance lines in each of those years, eventually breaking above them and producing sharp gains. The same pattern is outlined for 2025, with a breakout zone around the $2.50 to $3.00 range, potentially leading to a larger upward projection. The illustrated target extends toward $14 , a level far above the current trading price. The green rectangles on the chart emphasize the price surges that followed each breakout, with the 2022 move starting from near $0.30, the 2023 rise extending beyond $0.80, and the 2024 rally climbing past $2.00. For 2025, the projection box spans from roughly $3.00 to $14.00, showing the magnitude of a potential move if the breakout structure continues. This is the hardest #XRP bull market ever. Congratulations if you're still here. We will get rich! pic.twitter.com/pewMSk3RxZ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 1, 2025 Community Reactions to the Analysis The post also attracted responses from several XRP holders and traders. X user Arvydas Veikutis commented on the recurring seasonal behavior of XRP’s price movements, noting that rallies often appear in March, April, July, August, and now October to November. However, Arvydas also expressed frustration, pointing out that despite these recurring expectations, the price remains around €2.50, leading to concerns about patience wearing thin. In contrast, Berserker offered a different view, arguing that the current environment should not be classified as a bull market. According to his perspective, the market is more of a liquidity-driven structure, heavily influenced by exchange control rather than organic bullish sentiment. This underscores the ongoing debate within the community on whether XRP’s price movements are natural market dynamics or shaped by broader external influences. Implications of the 2025 Projection StephIsCrypto’s analysis adds to the broader narrative that XRP may be approaching a decisive moment in its multi-year price structure. The historical breakouts outlined in the chart provide a technical basis for optimism, suggesting that the upcoming move could surpass previous rallies in scale. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If the outlined pattern holds, 2025 may represent a critical year for XRP’s market trajectory , with the potential for a sharp breakout leading to significantly higher valuations. However, the varied reactions from the community highlight that sentiment remains divided between confidence, frustration, and skepticism.

They capture attention, drive massive communities, and often deliver the kind of exponential gains that utility tokens can’t match. In 2021, Shiba Inu shocked the market. In 2023, Pepe Coin (PEPE) became the new frog king. But in 2025, all eyes are on Pepe Dollar (PEPD) — the project being hailed as the best meme coin to buy now. The Rise of Pepe Dollar Unlike most meme tokens that live or die by hype alone, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is designed with clear features that support long-term growth: A Meme Minting Platform: Users can create their own meme tokens backed by Pepe Dollar (PEPD) liquidity, fueling an entire ecosystem. Staking Rewards: Holders can lock tokens to earn passive income, encouraging stability over speculation. Ethereum Integration: Built on Ethereum, PEPD enjoys smart contract compatibility and immediate access to deep DeFi liquidity. This model sets PEPD apart from earlier meme cycles, where tokens had little more than branding. Here, investors get both culture and functionality. How to invest in meme coins like PEPD Investing in meme coins requires timing and strategy. Analysts recommend three simple steps for entering projects like Pepe Dollar (PEPD) : Enter Early: Presales are where the outsized gains happen. PEPD’s presale stages reward early buyers with the steepest upside. Diversify Carefully: Many investors combine legacy memes like PEPE with fresh projects like PEPD to balance stability and growth. Stake and Hold: Instead of flipping tokens, using PEPD’s staking features allows holders to earn yields while waiting for price appreciation. This approach is why Pepe Dollar has been labeled by traders as the best current meme investment. Why analysts prefer PEPD over PEPE PEPE remains a powerful brand, but recent trading shows volatility and fading momentum. Analysts point to a potential 20% drop if key support breaks. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) , meanwhile, is still in presale and hasn’t hit exchanges yet. That means its upside is unbounded by the heavy market caps that weigh on PEPE. PEPD is, quite literally, at the beginning of its growth curve. Community and cultural pull No meme coin thrives without a community, and Pepe Dollar is quickly building one. Telegram groups are buzzing, X threads are trending, and early holders are already creating memes about minting memes — a cultural meta-loop that could drive viral adoption. This is exactly how tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE rose in the past, but Pepe Dollar (PEPD) has added utility to keep people engaged after the hype cycle. Conclusion: The best meme coin to buy now For investors wondering how to invest in meme coins in 2025, the answer is straightforward: Pepe Dollar (PEPD) represents the best balance of meme energy and blockchain utility. It’s early, it’s building infrastructure, and it’s giving traders multiple ways to profit. Analysts believe PEPD is the clear rival to Pepe Coin and could surpass it in profitability this cycle.

The sudden disruption lasted several hours and stopped all transactions, leaving users unable to use apps built on the network. Developers later restored block production and stabilized services. Starknet Promises Full Report After Hours-Long Outage The outage started early Tuesday morning and quickly stopped all activity on the network. Transactions could not go through, and apps built on Starknet stopped working. According to the network data, the blackout lasted for several hours before developers brought the system back online. In a recent X post , the Starknet team confirmed the situation, acknowledging the downtime. The Starknet team has committed to providing a detailed retrospective of the incident. This report will explain the timeline of events, the root cause of the outage, and the long-term solutions being put in place to avoid similar problems in the future. For users and developers relying on the network, this commitment to transparency is meant to rebuild trust. Starknet Outage Hits as New Features and SN Stack Roll Out To stabilize the blockchain, developers executed a chain reorganization starting from block No. 1,960,612. This effectively rewound about one hour of network activity. As a result, all transactions submitted between 2:23 a.m. and 4:36 a.m. UTC failed to reach the chain. Users whose activity does not appear on the blockchain will need to resubmit their transactions. The recovery restored block production and allowed most RPC providers to resume operations. The remaining nodes are still catching up as they complete upgrades. The timing of the outage is notable, as Starknet is currently rolling out new features and initiatives . One recent measure allows Bitcoin stakers to play a small role in network consensus. At the same time, developers are working on the SN Stack, a framework that makes it easier for teams to create their own application-specific chains using Starknet’s technology. Starknet Outage Comes as Ethereum Changes Its Testnet Starknet plays a key role in Ethereum’s scaling ecosystem. It is a zero-knowledge Layer 2 rollup. This means it processes transactions off the Ethereum mainnet, bundles them together, and then sends cryptographic proofs back to the Ethereum network. This design lowers gas fees, speeds up transactions , and still benefits from Ethereum’s strong security. As a result of its advantages, Starknet has become a reliable choice for developers building decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and other blockchain-based applications. That is why an outage, even if rare, quickly attracts attention from the wider crypto community. The Starknet incident comes just as the Ethereum blockchain itself is undergoing major changes in its test environment. The Holešky testnet, which launched last year to replace Goerli as Ethereum’s main testing ground, is shutting down.

According to cryptocurrency analyst CrediBULL , XRP, the third-largest crypto by market cap, is positioning itself to outperform Ethereum in the coming weeks. In a September 2 X post , the analyst noted that a review of the XRP/ETH pair points to signs of a shift in momentum after a prolonged decline. XRP/ETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analysis suggested that the pair has established a significant demand zone, where price action appears to be stabilizing. This region could act as a springboard for buyers, especially with technical indicators flashing bullish signals. In this case, the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is showing a bullish divergence, suggesting that while prices remain subdued, underlying momentum is beginning to turn upward. At the same time, CrediBULL pointed out that a bullish divergence has already been confirmed on the daily timeframe, while another one is currently forming on the three-day chart. These developments, combined with the broader market setup, strengthen the case for XRP to regain ground against ETH in the near term. If the technical picture plays out, XRP could be on track to reverse months of weakness versus Ethereum. XRP fundamentals Fundamentals are also backing the possibility of an XRP surge in the coming weeks, particularly as market attention turns to the potential approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). To this end, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has until late October to issue a decision, with approval odds rising significantly after the conclusion of Ripple’s case with the regulator. Meanwhile, both assets continue to trade in tandem with the broader market. XRP has lost the $3 support, trading at $2.84, up over 2% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, after institutional inflows fueled a move toward a record high near $5,000, has retreated slightly and was trading at $4,349 at the time of reporting.

This offsets broader selling pressure and shows longer-horizon conviction. September is often a weak month for crypto. Macro uncertainty around central bank policy and growth outlook continues to pressure risk assets. On-chain and trading activity stayed elevated. Early in the session volumes ran well above normal, then cooled as the day progressed. The pattern matches institutional-led buying in the open and retail-driven trading into the close. Price Action Window: Sept. 1, 14:00 → Sept. 2, 13:00 (24h). Range: $2.70–$2.83, about a 4% swing. Price tagged $2.71 around 21:00 before rebounding to highs near $2.83. Volume: Surged to 101.36M and 93.66M in bursts, compared with a 24h average of 65.49M. Weekly pace was about 19% higher than average. Levels: A base formed at $2.70–$2.72. Repeated rejection near $2.83 capped the upside. The session ended consolidating just under resistance. Technical Analysis Support: $2.70–$2.72 with volume-backed demand. Secondary levels at $2.65 and $2.50 if stress builds. Resistance: $2.83 near term. Above that, $3.00 psychological and $3.30 structural breakout levels. Momentum: RSI in the mid-50s, showing neutral-to-bullish conditions. MACD: Histogram is converging toward a bullish crossover. This would confirm constructive momentum if volumes remain high. Patterns: A symmetrical triangle is forming under $3.00. A sustained move above $3.30 could target $4.00 and beyond. Intraday higher lows point to continued accumulation. Flows: Early heavy prints suggest institutional buying. Later fades show retail profit-taking under resistance. What Traders Are Watching A breakout above $2.83 and then $3.00. A clean close through $3.30 is needed for upside extension. Whether $2.70–$2.72 support holds. A close below this range shifts focus to $2.50.

Credit Card Focused On XRP Rewards Gemini unveiled its latest product last week, a credit card that gives holders varying percentages back from purchases directly in the XRP token. Additionally, it will support Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, which can be used for the US spot trading markets on Gemini’s trading platform. Another XRP ETF Listing, But With A Twist The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States has a long-standing history of delaying ETF decisions for Ripple’s native token, but it could potentially be different this time. Filed by an Illinois investment company with over $12 billion in assets under management (AUM), this will not be a regular spot ETF, but it will be classified as an Options Income Fund instead. As the name suggests, it will focus on options strategies to generate a monthly yield for investors. They will expire monthly, allowing for a regular strategy reset and a steady income to shareholders. Meanwhile, odds of a spot XRP ETF approval by year’s end stand at 87% at the time of writing, according to Polymarket.

That same metric, just two months later, taking data from last week, has made an impressive jump of 144% to over $320 million, according to RWA.xyz. Source: RWA.xyz Price Outlook XRP closed off last Tuesday spot on the $3 mark, and, at the time of writing, is trading at around $2.7, a 10% drop, likely caused by profit-taking, macro-related events, or political jitters. Current sentiment on social media for the token seems to be bullish, with analysts predicting rallies and potentially new all-time highs.

The financing was led by PayPal Ventures and General Catalyst. Other participants in the round included 8VC, Samsung Next, SBI US Gateway Fund, Vertex Ventures, Hashed, HashKey Capital, Dispersion Capital, Alumni Ventures, Avalanche Foundation, GSR Markets, LayerZero, Animoca Brands, Essence VC, and Alchemy. Formerly known as Zettablock, Kite draws on its background in distributed infrastructure systems to develop architecture tailored for the agentic web. The team has previously built large-scale, real-time data infrastructure for decentralised networks, including Sui, Polygon, Chainlink, and EigenLayer. Kite’s current focus is on enabling autonomous agents to operate independently in real-world environments. The company recently introduced Kite Agent Identity Resolution, or Kite AIR, which it describes as a system that allows autonomous agents to authenticate, transact, and function with minimal human intervention. The platform provides programmable identity, built-in stablecoin payments, and policy enforcement on a blockchain optimised for agents. Kite AIR consists of two main elements: Agent Passport, a verifiable identity framework with operational guardrails, and Agent App Store, which enables agents to discover and pay for services such as APIs, data, and commerce tools. The system is live and already integrated with platforms including Shopify and PayPal. “From the beginning, we believed autonomous agents would be the dominant UI for the future digital economies. To function, they need structured and verifiable data, That was our first step,” said Chi Zhang, Co-Founder and CEO of Kite. “Next come identity, trust, and programmable payments. Today’s human-centric systems are too rigid and brittle for swarms of agents conducting micro-transactions at machine speed. Kite AIR solves that”. Kite said that any PayPal or Shopify merchant can now opt in through the Kite Agent App Store using publicly available APIs, making their services accessible to AI shopping agents. “Kite’s foundational trust infrastructure together with the benefits of a well-regulated stablecoin for agentic payments will create unprecedented opportunities,” said Steve Everett, Head of Global Market Development, PayPal Crypto and Digital Assets. Transactions are settled on-chain with stablecoins, offering full traceability and programmable permissions. The company added that it is also working on further integrations across commerce, finance, and data platforms. The founding team brings experience across blockchain protocol engineering, large-scale data infrastructure, and applied AI, which Kite said are the core areas required to support the emerging agent economy.

51077055,571558,1756827003,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51077055.jpeg,Spot Ethereum ETFs Shine With Strong Inflows Despite Price Struggles – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/spot-ethereum-etfs-strong-inflows/,"Since reaching a new all-time high, Ethereum has retested the $4,200 price level in a bearish style. Over the past few days, ETH has been on a downward trend in terms of price action, but the altcoin has demonstrated significant bullish performance in terms of its Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) . Investors Pour Into Ethereum ETFs Ethereum’s ongoing waning price action does not seem to have affected investors’ sentiment, especially on the institutional level. The leading altcoin has displayed a notable bullish performance in its Spot Ethereum ETFs. Glassnode, a leading financial and on-chain data analytics platform, reported the resurgence in investor sentiment in a recent post on the social media platform X. The report from the on-chain platform shows that spot ETH ETFs have just logged a week of substantial inflows after recording significant outflows in the previous week. This renewed inflow over the week underscores rising investor appetite for the altcoin even though it is facing repeated price fluctuations. Furthermore, the consistent flow of money into these funds indicates that both institutional and individual investors are focusing on ETH’s long-term growth potential rather than just short-term market fluctuations. According to the platform, there were huge inflows of over 286,000 ETH into the spot Ethereum ETFs last week. It is worth noting that this massive capital marks one of the strongest weekly inflows since the funds were introduced late last year. Another key development seen on the chart is that the last time the funds saw negative outflows was in early May. After a negative week, the funds experienced 14 consecutive weeks of notable inflows, which implies that investors are increasing their exposure to ETH. Even as ETH closed the week near $4,400, investors continued to invest in the altcoin through the funds. With ETH price action still fluctuating, the tenacity of ETF demand indicates that investors are becoming more confident in the asset’s status as a pillar of the digital economy. A Shift In Capital From Bitcoin To ETH Spot Ethereum ETFs have gained serious upward traction against their BTC counterparts. While ETH has seen unprecedented inflows in August 2025, Reaper, a web3 investor, claims that this development could signal a potential capital rotation from BTC to the altcoin. Such a trend is likely to ignite the most explosive altcoin season this year. In August, Reaper noted that over $4 billion in net inflows were made into spot ETH ETFs alone throughout the month. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spot ETFs suffered about $803 million in outflows during the same time frame. According to the investor, these massive inflows coincide with notable on-chain accumulation of over 1.5 million ETH, valued at $8 billion, by large holders. This institutional demand and on-chain accumulation underscore a shift from BTC dominance to Ethereum’s ecosystem. Amid this wave of capital, Reaper highlighted that smaller-cap ETH tokens have not yet experienced a significant influx of capital into their market sector. However, he anticipates this segment of the market to heat up in the upcoming months.",Ethereum|Altcoin|Altcoin Season|Bitcoin dominance|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|exchange-traded funds|Glassnode|spot Ethereum ETFs,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 15:30:03

The Alpenglow upgrade has already received over 99% validator support, according to data from Staking Facilities. If the upgrade is implemented as intended, it will provide a hundredfold speed increase for Solana. While this upgrade and the innovations it brings are expected to have a positive impact on the Solana price, MEXC Research chief analyst Shawn Young shared his price predictions for SOL. Speaking to Decrypt, Shawn Young noted that the Alpenglow upgrade, along with possible ETF approval and increased institutional adoption, could be positive for Solana’s price. Young predicted that, given all these factors, SOL could reach $215 in September and $250 by the end of the year. “This leap in transaction speed on the Solana network not only puts Solana ahead of competing layer 1 blockchains like SUI, but also makes it faster than a standard web search response time. Another factor supporting Solana's rise is the potential for near-term approval of SOL ETFs. In addition, companies currently have more than $1.7 billion worth of SOL in their treasuries. All these factors combined could push the SOL price to $215 before the end of September and as high as $250 before the end of the fourth quarter.” Finally, the analyst added that the SOL price may experience a correction in the short term, but his targets are likely to be achieved. *This is not investment advice.

This activity coincided with a resurgence in non-fungible token (NFT) activity to the highest level since 2023. Ethereum reportedly reached its highest level of monthly active addresses in years — 19.45 million unique addresses in August 2025. Monthly active addresses measure how many unique wallets interact with the Ethereum blockchain within a given month and capture all kinds of activity in the network, including transfers, DeFi, NFTs, and staking. Ethereum network activity set new records in August 2025. Source: Block.co Ethereum reclaimed milestones in August According to data from Block.co, there has been a clear upward trend in Ethereum’s user activity over time. Back in January 2018, Ethereum had 17.49 million active addresses but by May 2021, the number had crossed 20 million. It has endured a steady decline since then and has struggled to reclaim those highs. This year, the active addresses hit 19.45 million, the closest it has ever come to its 2021 peak. Analysts claim this growth highlights not only growing interest but also the expansion of the ecosystem with more projects, developers, and users now actively building on Ethereum. It also indicates robust on-chain usage across on Ethereum’s Layer-1 (L1) and L2 networks, which is proof of increased adoption and utility beyond speculative trading. Transaction volume only saw a notable uptick last month, suggesting growing engagement with decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and NFTs. Are NFTs back? The NFT market has not been the same since the 2021 craze. Since then, trading volumes have dropped, collections lost momentum, and bag holders have become the butt of some witty jokes. Matas Čepulis, Founder and CEO of LuvKaizen, is one of those who refuse to believe the NFT season will never return or be what it once was. He believes they are still relevant as they tap into powerful emotional and social dynamics. He cited examples of projects like Pudgy Penguins that have grown into big brands as proof that the space is simply evolving, not going away. According to data from NFTPulse, the number of active NFT users across blockchains has nearly doubled since early summer. NFTs on Ethereum (ETH) have also seen renewed momentum as they have surpassed Solana in NFT user count since June, a feat that may possibly be linked to Pudgy Penguins’ presence on Abstract, an Ethereum Layer-2. Data from cryptoslam.io also confirms that ETH NFTs have been increasing in sales since April, peaking last month at $285.6 million with over 1.5 million transactions. The global NFT market size in 2025 is currently estimated at $49–61 billion, and reports claim Ethereum powers up to 62% of all the NFT transactions. So are NFTs back? In a way, they never left but the market has matured. Unlike the 2021-2022 NFT craze, which was driven mostly by speculation, the current trend has seen the market favor utility-based NFTs, like those linked with gaming and DeFi, over vibe-based projects with nothing to offer other than hype.

A momentum gauge shows 55, which means there is some strength, but a speed gauge shows 97, which means the market is too hot. The closest ceiling is $0.000013683, and the closest floor is $0.000011083. If demand stays strong, SHIB could break through the first ceiling and go up 11%. If there is a stronger push, the goal would be $0.000014983, which is about 22% higher than where we are now. If the floor falls, the price could drop to $0.000009783, which is about 21% lower. Traders are on the lookout for a clear move because of mixed signals. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Could the Price Go Up 30 Times? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens are still the most popular ones for speculative trading. The success of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk shows that strong branding, viral marketing, and getting people involved in the community can lead to huge profits. The mood of the market as a whole is also very important for XYZVerse’s future. As the altcoin season gets closer, more people are interested in lower-cap meme coins. XYZVerse is still in presale, so it could benefit from this wave if it gets strategic exchange listings and keeps the community excited after launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings: If XYZVerse gets listed on big CEX sites like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, the price could go through the roof on launch day. Community growth that lasts—meme coins need to go viral. If XYZVerse follows through on its partnerships with sports influencers, it could get a lot of people talking about it on social media. Market Conditions: When Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are doing well, assets that are based on speculation, like XYZVerse, tend to do well too. Can $XYZ Go Up 3000%? XYZVerse has what it needs to have a successful launch, but it needs to follow through to be successful in the long run. The $0.10+ target, which is about 3000% higher than the current price, could be reached if the team does a good job with marketing, gets high-profile listings, and gets the community involved. Put money into $XYZ before it goes up. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Conclusion SHIB stays good yet may slip 15% this autumn. Bull run 2025 shifts focus. XYZVerse (XYZ) pioneers sports memes, presale live, aims 20,000% rise with community roadmap, projected memecoin G.O.A.T.

But Cardano’s struggles may run deeper than just macro pressure. Despite active development and regular upgrades, the project hasn’t delivered the kind of user growth or ecosystem traction that moves markets. Meanwhile, traders and whales alike are rotating into faster, yield-focused alternatives—especially those built on Ethereum Layer 2. One name that keeps coming up? Layer Brett . Cardano (ADA): Great roadmap, but ADA price’s GPS is off The ADA price has been stuck for months, slipping quietly as other chains take the spotlight. While developers continue to improve Cardano’s scalability—Hydra, Mithril, and other upgrades are in motion—none of it seems to be moving the needle. Cardano has always marketed itself as research-first and peer-reviewed. That’s helped build long-term credibility, but in a meme-heavy, hype-driven market, it’s also cost the project serious momentum. DeFi activity on Cardano is minimal compared to Solana or even newer chains like Base. NFT trading is quiet. Daily transactions are consistent, but uninspiring. Staking is still a strong point for Cardano. Participation is high, and the community is loyal. But yields are modest, and with little price movement, it’s hard to call it rewarding. The ADA price reflects that fatigue. Traders aren’t dumping the token, but they’re not exactly rushing in either. Cardano remains a well-engineered platform. But in a market that rewards speed, buzz, and breakout potential, ADA feels like it’s always “almost there.” And while Bitcoin gets blamed for dragging alts down, Cardano’s issues may be more self-inflicted than they seem. Bitcoin (BTC): When the king goes sideways, altcoins bleed It’s true that Bitcoin still sets the tone for everything else. And right now, the tone is flat. The ADA price, like most altcoins, tends to move opposite Bitcoin dominance—but lately, that dominance has remained strong while BTC itself chops sideways. ETF inflows are slowing, miner sell pressure is rising, and volatility has narrowed. That leaves less room for risk-on behavior. Big wallets are consolidating rather than expanding, which translates to less capital chasing altcoin breakouts—including Cardano. And when altcoins do get attention, they’re often the ones with wild narratives and meme-driven momentum. Bitcoin isn’t bleeding, but it’s blocking the lanes. As long as BTC continues to suck up the macro focus, chains like Cardano get squeezed. That creates a perfect setup for high-upside alternatives to grab attention. Layer Brett (LBRETT): The fast-moving ETH L2 that’s stealing attention While Cardano builds slowly and Bitcoin stalls, Layer Brett is sprinting ahead. Built as an Ethereum Layer 2, Layer Brett offers something neither of the majors can match—high-speed, low-fee transactions with meme coin virality and real staking rewards. During presale, Layer Brett is still under one cent. But it’s not just a pitch deck and promises. A working dApp is already live, with 1,130%+ APY available to stakers right now. Traders connect wallets, stake instantly, and start earning—no waiting, no roadmap delays. But the tech is only half the story. Layer Brett leans into culture. It’s meme-powered but function-rich, with gamified staking, NFT mechanics, and a viral narrative built for speed. Layer Brett’s the kind of token people talk about, buy, use, and share—something Cardano has struggled to achieve despite years of effort. For whales rotating out of slow-moving majors, Layer Brett offers what they’re looking for: utility, upside, and energy. Conclusion The ADA price may keep slipping, but not all the blame lies with Bitcoin. Cardano’s slow pace, low engagement, and lack of narrative punch are holding it back. Meanwhile, Layer Brett is emerging as a fast, rewarding alternative with real traction and meme-level attention. For traders chasing what’s next, this ETH Layer 2 might be it.

Following the crackdown on aggressive discounting strategies used by Chinese automakers, the sector’s leader is experiencing a decline in market share and investor confidence. The Chinese vehicle industry is seeing a seismic shift as BYD Co., the nation’s biggest EV maker, struggles to keep up momentum while smaller competitors rapidly gain ground. The company reported a steep profit decline that demoralized its investors, and the Shenzhen-based automaker has since been contending with poor sales in its core domestic market. BYD loses ground to competitors in China’s EV market In August, BYD’s sales rose by an underwhelming 0.1% year-on-year. In contrast, Geely Automobile Holdings reported a 38% jump in sales, while Leapmotor Technology Co. and Nio Inc. both achieved record deliveries in the same time period. Xpeng Inc., meanwhile, has already sold more than three times as many vehicles as it had at this point last year. BYD’s rise to market dominance was due to its aggressive discounting strategy, but Beijing has recently pressured automakers to stop exploiting such tactics over concerns of a destructive price war that could destabilize the industry. According to Bloomberg’s calculations , BYD’s domestic sales fell almost 15% in August. Its market share also slipped slightly in July to 14.4%, despite the fact that it was far ahead of smaller competitors in terms of overall deliveries. Year-to-date, the Chinese giant has sold nearly 2.9 million vehicles, which is about ten times larger than Xpeng and Li Auto’s sales. EV maker falls short of projections Stellantis-backed Leapmotor sold a record 57,066 vehicles in August, bringing its year-to-date total to almost 329,000 units. The company now holds 1.7% of the Chinese market and is pushing to hit its ambitious 2025 target of 580,000 to 650,000 units. Xpeng continues to win over buyers with intelligent, tech-heavy models priced competitively against BYD and Geely offerings. It delivered a record 37,709 units in August, while newcomer Xiaomi Corp. , best known for its smartphones, sold more than 30,000 EVs during the month, raising its 2025 total to about 210,000 units so far. Geely, however, has emerged as the standout rival to BYD, with a 63.2% progress toward its 2025 target. BYD has set an ambitious goal of selling 5.5 million vehicles in 2025, including 800,000 units abroad. To achieve this, the automaker would still need to deliver more than 2.6 million vehicles in the final four months of 2025. Considering that the company sold just under 2.9 million units in the first eight months of the year, Bloomberg analysts estimate that the company may fall short of those goals, selling around 4.9 million units. Sanford C. Bernstein offered a slightly higher projection of 5.1 million units. Earlier this week, BYD reported a 30% drop in second-quarter profit, which caused a loss of around $6 billion off its market value as shares tumbled. That loss and the Chinese government’s decision to curb the company’s successful discount strategy have raised concerns over whether BYD can sustain its lead position in the industry.

The move reflects growing optimism among digital asset platforms that investor appetite for public market debuts is returning after a prolonged slowdown. According to the company’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, Gemini plans to sell 16.67 million shares of its Class A common stock at an expected price range of $17 to $19 per share. If priced at the top of the range, the offering could raise as much as $317 million. Details of the Offering The IPO will be launched under the corporate name Gemini Space Station, Inc., with shares set to trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “GEMI.” In addition, Gemini and its selling stockholders will provide underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2.5 million shares to cover potential over-allotments. The offering is subject to market conditions, and the company cautioned that there is no guarantee on timing, size, or final terms. Still, the listing marks a milestone for one of the earliest regulated U.S. crypto exchanges. Banking Heavyweights Lead the Deal A roster of Wall Street giants is lined up to back the transaction. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are acting as lead bookrunners, joined by Morgan Stanley and Cantor. Additional bookrunners include Evercore ISI, Mizuho, Truist Securities, Cohen & Company Capital Markets, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Needham & Company, and Rosenblatt. Co-managers like Academy Securities, AmeriVet Securities, and Roberts & Ryan will also support the deal. The offering will be conducted solely through a prospectus, which investors may obtain from Goldman Sachs or Citigroup.

The DeFi newcomer has positioned itself as a key player in the next bull run. Early investors are eyeing potential returns of up to $50,000 from a modest $1,000 stake by 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has rallied past presale stages 1,2,3,4, and 5 in record time. Six is now underway and more than 30% claimed. Getting in now means you’re setting yourself up for an upside of at least 5x over the coming weeks and months. The platform has already raised over $15.25 million and onboarded more than 15,950 token holders. While competitors continue vying for market dominance, Mutuum Finance is attracting attention for its ambitious roadmap and disruptive potential in the decentralized finance space. Presale Stage 6 Milestone Mutuum Finance’s presale has been a record-breaking success. The token is still cheap at $0.0035 if you buy now in the sixth phase. Like with every high-potential opportunity, investor FOMO in Mutuum Finance is rising. The presale has already secured over 15,950 token holders and more than $15.25 million in capital, positioning the project for a robust launch and widespread adoption. Investors buying right now are on track for huge success in the next bull cycle. Pioneering the Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance aims to shape the decentralized finance future through a next-generation platform designed for long-term growth and solutions for both retail and institutional users. Mutuum’s will lead the next big DeFi wave. Cutting-edge smart contract infrastructure and focus on security and scalability places it ahead of competition. $100K Worth of Tokens to Be Won To trigger the community activity, Mutuum is conducting a $100,000 giveaway . The reward will go to ten winners, each receiving $10,000. This campaign demonstrates the commitment of the project to building a long-lasting, active, and engaged community. Official Bug Bounty Program In addition, Mutuum Finance has initiated an Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Users can earn up to $50,000 USDT for disclosing vulnerabilities in the project. The program will uncover potential weaknesses and rank them in terms of severity. The different levels will include critical, major, minor, and low, to make the protocol secure and stable. Mutuum Finance Dual Lending Model One of the project’s keys selling points is its dual lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) strategies. P2C leverages smart contracts for lending. On the other hand P2P brings the borrower and lender into contact with no third parties in the transaction. This feature will mostly appeal to meme coin users. Key Metrics and Protections Loan-to-Value ratios cap borrowing relative to collateral, and liquidation thresholds trigger penalties that protect the protocol and reward liquidators. Reserve factors collect a portion of interest to buffer against defaults and extreme market events, with riskier assets assigned higher reserves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor attention with its stage 6 presale at $0.035, over $15.25 million raised, and more than 15,950 participants already on board. Its dual lending models, CertiK-audited security, and ambitious roadmap position it as a potential 2025–2026 breakout, with projections hinting at transformative gains for early adopters.

Indeed, over $120 million in Bitcoin ETFs entered the market recently despite the prevailing bearish mood. The large Bitcoin ETF investments highlight renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin. Even though the flagship cryptocurrency has fallen from its all-time peak, many are still optimistic that BTC could test higher levels before 2025 ends. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are seeing spillover gains from the institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs. ETF Flows Ignite Market Sentiment ETF data shows mixed activity. Outflows last week topped $1.17 billion, the second largest on record. Yet new inflows this week are already reviving optimism. Assets under management remain above $150 billion , proving Bitcoin’s role as an institutional anchor. More than 92 crypto ETF applications sit with the SEC. These include proposals tied to Solana, XRP, and Litecoin. Decisions could begin as early as September 13, with final deadlines set for March 2026. Markets expect clarity sooner. Shiba Inu and Avalanche React Shiba Inu keeps burning tokens and pushing adoption with Shibarium. Prices are still low, but many traders think SHIB could push higher if the momentum continues. Despite the market downturn, the token has remained resilient, positioning itself as one of the best crypto investments in 2025. Avalanche is making noticeable movements, too. Toyota is testing NFTs on its chain, BlackRock is tokenizing assets, and fees just dropped after the latest network upgrade. AVAX is trading in the $23–$26 range, but some analysts say it could hit above $30 if sentiment improves. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rides on ETF-Driven Momentum The excitement around Bitcoin ETFs has also spilled into MAGACOIN FINANCE. As institutional investors search the crypto market for opportunities, the project has emerged as a top pick for those seeking high-reward opportunities . While analysts often caution against early-stage projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the exception. The project’s transparent model, alongside its regulatory compliance, has given investors the necessary assurance. With demand for the project rising, experts say those who get in early may be sitting on a goldmine with the potential to deliver upwards of 100x in gains. Outlook and Key Risks Bitcoin price forecast depends heavily on the SEC timeline. Approval of new ETFs could unlock billions in inflows. A dovish Fed stance to cut interest rates may encourage investors to spend more and push prices up. Altcoins like SHIB and AVAX will continue to react to ETF-driven liquidity. Token burns, ecosystem upgrades, and institutional adoption all strengthen their cases. For investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE has joined the breakout altcoin tokens conversations as a project that can deliver the returns early DOGE and SHIB investors made.

The market’s recent downturn has put bulls on the defensive, with the threat of a deeper correction looming if support levels give way. Despite the uncertainty, Ethereum continues to attract significant interest from large investors, reinforcing the narrative of long-term confidence in the asset. Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Stays Strong As Exchange Reserves Keep Falling – Details Capital rotation between Ethereum and Bitcoin remains one of the defining themes of this market cycle. While Bitcoin has shown signs of weakness following its recent highs, Ethereum has benefited as institutions and whales shift capital toward the second-largest cryptocurrency. This trend suggests that Ethereum’s role as a core market driver is becoming even more pronounced. According to the latest data from Santiment, Ethereum whales have added massive amounts of ETH to their portfolios in just the past 24 hours. Such aggressive accumulation highlights growing conviction among large players, even as retail investors show signs of fear. Whales Add $1.1B In Ethereum As Capital Rotates From Bitcoin Analyst Ali Martinez reports that whales purchased 260,000 ETH in the past 24 hours, valued at around $1.1 billion. This staggering figure is not just another sign of demand—it confirms a dynamic shift unfolding across the market, where smart money is rotating out of Bitcoin and into Ethereum. Despite the heavy volatility and recent pullback, Ethereum continues to display remarkable resilience compared to Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has been losing key support levels and showing signs of weakening momentum, Ethereum has managed to hold above critical structural demand zones. This divergence between the two leading assets underscores the increasing confidence institutions and whales are placing in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Whale accumulation on such a scale often precedes significant market moves, as large holders tend to position ahead of broader market participants. The inflow of $1.1 billion into ETH highlights that major players see value at current levels, even as the market consolidates. As capital rotation intensifies, Ethereum is reinforcing its position not only as the leading altcoin but as a market driver in its own right. Analysts suggest that this could set the stage for a decisive breakout in the weeks ahead, with ETH potentially outpacing Bitcoin’s performance if current trends continue. The coming days will reveal whether this whale-driven demand is enough to fuel Ethereum’s next major rally. Related Reading: Binance Network Activity Outpaces Ethereum As Active Addresses Double Since April Ethereum Price Analysis: Key Support Under Pressure Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $4,384, showing signs of consolidation after several days of volatility and selling pressure. The chart highlights that ETH is testing critical support levels, with the 200-day moving average (red line) around $4,236 acting as a major demand zone. Holding this level is crucial, as a breakdown could accelerate losses toward the $4,000 psychological mark. The 50-day (blue line) and 100-day (green line) moving averages are hovering slightly above price action, showing ETH struggling to reclaim momentum in the short term. Multiple rejections around the $4,600–$4,700 range over the past weeks reveal strong supply pressure, with sellers actively defending higher levels. Related Reading: Solana Investors Cash Out Nearly $1-B As SOL Tests Key Price Level Despite the current weakness, ETH has managed to hold a higher low structure compared to its July base near $3,500, which suggests the broader uptrend remains intact. However, trading volume has declined, signaling reduced conviction among bulls. For ETH to regain strength, it must reclaim the $4,500 level and flip it into support.

The tweet read, “$50,000 XRP Prediction Shocks Wall Street!” and was accompanied by a video featuring a conversation between two speakers analyzing the possible future price of XRP in relation to broader financial and economic developments. The video discussion centered on the global agreements being formed around central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and the potential implications for XRP’s valuation. One of the speakers argued that if institutions could establish frameworks for digital currency interactions on a global scale, it would not be difficult to establish a set price for XRP. This point laid the foundation for revisiting and revising earlier XRP price projections. $50,000 XRP Prediction Shocks Wall Street! pic.twitter.com/4dcdUjcJac — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 1, 2025 Revisiting Previous Projections The speakers reflected on earlier predictions made in 2021, a period when XRP enthusiasts suggested prices in the range of $25,000 to $37,500 per coin. The discussion noted that the economic environment has shifted significantly since then, particularly due to the large influx of liquidity that entered the global economy in the years that followed. According to the speaker, these factors create a foundation for revising earlier expectations upward. When asked whether the valuation would exceed the previously cited figures, the response was affirmative. The speaker indicated that the additional trillions of dollars in circulation today compared to 2021 create conditions that could support an even higher potential price. The estimation provided during the exchange suggested a revised figure of $50,000 for XRP. Implications of the Argument The reasoning presented in the video tied XRP’s potential valuation to broader macroeconomic trends, particularly the interaction of global liquidity and the role of digital assets in central banking systems. The argument suggested that once principles for digital currency frameworks among central banks are fully established, it would not be difficult to assign set values to assets like XRP that could serve a role within such systems. The projection of $50,000 builds upon the belief that XRP could be integrated at a global level and valued according to the scale of economic activity it supports. The speaker emphasized that this estimate had not yet been fully modeled or adjusted but reflected a logical extension of earlier calculations once additional capital flows were factored in.

While the figure of $50,000 is far beyond XRP’s historical trading range, Levi’s decision to share the commentary underscores his view of the growing importance of XRP within the context of global finance and central bank policy development.

Hash Rate Reaches Peak Again!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/a-first-in-bitcoin-btc-history-hash-rate-reaches-peak-again/,"Although Bitcoin has continued to move within a certain range in recent weeks, news of a new record has arrived. According to Coindesk, the Bitcoin hash rate has surpassed 1 Zettahash for the first time. In the news based on Glassnode data, it was stated that the Bitcoin (BTC) hash rate exceeded 1 zettahash (ZH/s) for the first time in its history based on the seven-day moving average. While the hash rate has briefly reached 1 zettahash several times this year, this is the first time it has reached this level on the seven-day moving average. Analysts expect this rapid increase in processing power to lead to a significant difficulty adjustment of over 7% in the coming days, which would be the second-largest upward adjustment of the year. Difficulty adjustments occur approximately every two weeks, ensuring that a new block is added to the blockchain approximately every 10 minutes, regardless of the total mining power. “With the hash rate increasing, Bitcoin mining difficulty is expected to increase by more than 7 percent. This is also expected to be the second-largest increase of the year.” What is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty? Bitcoin difficulty is an automatically adjusted property that determines how difficult it is to mine a Bitcoin block. The Bitcoin network's mining difficulty changes and updates automatically every 2,016 blocks. This is to maintain an average block generation time of 10 minutes. There's no close correlation between the price of BTC and the difficulty or hash rate of Bitcoin mining. Increasing difficulty on the Bitcoin network makes the network more secure and increases competition among miners. In this context, although the hash rate is not a metric directly related to the price, it is interpreted as positive data for the price because when it is high, it means that the demand for the network and the security of the network are increasing. *This is not investment advice.

At the same time, Smart Yield Coin (SYC) is making waves, having secured over $115,000 in its initial presale stage. With utility-focused tools and a structured rollout, Smart Yield Coin (SYC) offers a sharp contrast to hype-only plays. As capital shifts and sentiment evolves, traders are asking whether PEPE can reclaim its firepower, or if SYC’s early momentum signals a changing tide in 2025. Smart Yield Coin (SYC) launches presale with utility-focused ecosystem Smart Yield Coin (SYC) is quickly gaining traction as one of the most promising presales of 2025, separating itself from tokens that thrive only on hype. Instead of chasing trends, SYC is introducing a utility-driven ecosystem designed for real adoption and long-term growth. The project’s features go far beyond what most new tokens offer. Hold-to-Earn staking allows investors to earn passive rewards without complex lockups, while AutoMine technology transforms unused internet bandwidth into income. AI-powered gas fee predictions help reduce transaction costs, while the Smart Swap system enables seamless cross-chain trading. Adding to its appeal, Smart Yield Pay introduces debit and credit cards that let users spend crypto directly, earning cashback in SYC without first converting it to fiat. The presale design also stands out. With only 100 million tokens, 10% is reserved for early buyers. Each of the 10 stages carries a higher price, making Stage 1 at $0.015 the most attractive. That urgency is paying off, with more than $100,000 raised in the opening stage and millions of tokens sold. Compared to giants like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, which already command multibillion-dollar valuations, Smart Yield Coin (SYC) gives investors a rare ground-floor opportunity. Analysts predict returns of 100x–150x, with forecasts suggesting a surge from its $0.015 presale price to as high as $1.50–$2.00 in the next cycle. With real utility and innovation, SYC is emerging as a strong contender for 2025. Is PEPE losing steam or setting up for a surprise rally? PEPE has been under pressure in recent weeks, with the PEPE price slipping to around $0.00000931 after failing to maintain its mid-summer momentum. The PEPE charts show a steady downtrend, with lower highs since July and shrinking trading volumes reflecting weaker participation from both retail and whales. Negative funding rates and declining open interest confirm cautious sentiment weighing on PEPE. Source Adding to the challenge, fresh ecosystem news shows traders shifting attention toward Smart Yield Coin (SYC) , which is capturing buzz with its presale and utility-driven features. This migration of liquidity has left PEPE sidelined, reducing its once-explosive community strength. Still, PEPE remains on watchlists, as meme assets are known for sudden rebounds. Analysts stress that holding the $0.0000082 support is critical. If buyers step in, short-term Pepe price targets could reach $0.000011–$0.000012. But a break below support may open the door for deeper corrections before any genuine recovery attempt. SYC presale momentum builds while PEPE fights to hold support Smart Yield Coin (SYC) has already garnered over $115,000 in early funding at just $0.015 per token, demonstrating that investors are seeking projects with genuine substance. While PEPE struggles to hold key support, SYC’s ecosystem and growing presale traction position it as a stronger long-term play. If momentum continues, analysts believe SYC could outpace meme-driven tokens, with many suggesting the spotlight is shifting from meme hype to real-world utility.

Forget the usual suspects; a buzz is growing around Layer Brett , an innovative new crypto presale that merges the raw, viral energy of a meme coin with the serious muscle of an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Analysts are buzzing; some even dare to project explosive 100x gains. Could this be the best crypto to buy now? Many think so. Best crypto to buy now: Why Layer Brett is capturing Is your wallet tired of sky-high gas fees and slow transactions on legacy chains? Many investors are. While giants like Shiba Inu, Pepe, and even Bonk captured lightning in a bottle with pure meme power, they often grappled with the inherent limitations of their foundational networks. Think about the original Brett, for instance, which found itself stuck on Base, unable to innovate truly. Layer Brett escapes all that. It isn’t just another flashy meme token; it’s a new cryptocurrency built on a cutting-edge Layer 2 blockchain, specifically designed to bypass the congestion and expense of Ethereum’s Layer 1. This is a monumental shift for the everyday crypto user that Shiba Inu and Dogecoin can only dream of. Beyond the hype: Real utility meets meme magic Layer Brett truly offers something unique in the crowded altcoin market. Most meme coins, including the original Brett, ride purely on community sentiment, often lacking any substantive technological backing. But $LBRETT? It marries that infectious, community-driven spirit with genuine utility, distinguishing itself from the pure speculation of Pepe or Bonk. This ERC-20 token offers staking crypto, providing early adopters with the opportunity to earn substantial yields, currently exceeding 1,000% APY. How $LBRETT rewards early buyers and stands apart How do you get in on this potentially next big crypto? The Layer Brett presale is now live, offering an attractive entry price of $0.0053 per token. Buyers can acquire $LBRETT using ETH, USDT, or BNB through popular wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. The real kicker? You can stake your tokens immediately through the dApp for those eye-watering rewards. Lightning-Fast Transactions: Say goodbye to network congestion that plagues tokens like Dogecoin. Ultra-Low Gas Fees: Affordable crypto for everyone, unlike high L1 fees that affect coins such as the original Bitcoin. Massive Staking Rewards: Earn over 1,130% APY for early participants, a stark contrast to pure meme plays like Pepe or Bonk. Decentralized Control: No KYC, full self-custody. Layer Brett and the future of DOGE. Why are so many calling Layer Brett the next Dogecoin? It’s not just about the meme potential, though it certainly has that. It’s about tapping into a new wave of blockchain innovation that makes crypto more accessible and rewarding. Dogecoin achieved massive popularity through simplicity and community, yet it often faces questions about scalability and utility. Layer Brett addresses these head-on, offering a purpose-built Layer 2 solution for performance and user rewards, which sets it apart from its less-evolved brethren, such as the original Brett and even more recent hits like Bonk. With Ethereum Layer 2s projected to process over $10 trillion annually by 2027, $LBRETT is perfectly positioned within a burgeoning sector. This truly feels like a low-cap crypto gem, poised for the crypto bull run of 2025. It leaves Pepe and Shiba Inu in the dust when it comes to its tech stack. The project is also sweetening the pot with a massive $1 million giveaway. This community-first approach, combined with the promise of future NFT integrations and gamified staking, fosters an engaged ecosystem. This is the best crypto to buy now. Visit the Layer Brett website, connect your wallet, and join the movement that’s building the future of meme-powered DeFi. The escape from Base is complete. Brett is building his own future, and it looks incredibly bright.

Between Sept. 1 at 15:00 UTC and Sept. 2 at 14:00 UTC, XLM advanced from $0.36 to $0.36, with volatility of 5% underscoring active participation. The asset found support at $0.35 following a brief wave of selling before consolidating in the $0.36 range. Resistance emerged around $0.37, where the market saw two rejection points, though trading volumes above the daily average of 31.2 million tokens signaled sustained institutional interest. The bullish structure carried into the final hour of the session, when XLM gained 2% from $0.36 to $0.37. The move was bolstered by a volume spike of 2.7 million units at 14:00 UTC, enabling the token to briefly pierce the $0.37 ceiling before stabilizing above $0.36. The breakout reinforced the 24-hour trend and suggested buyers are building a foundation for further upside if volume momentum continues. At the same time, leading South Korean exchanges Bithumb and Upbit said they will suspend XLM deposits and withdrawals beginning Sept. 3 at 09:00 UTC. The move is part of preparations for Stellar’s Protocol 23 upgrade, which aims to modernize network infrastructure and expand interoperability. Protocol 23 has been framed as a step toward broadening Stellar’s utility for real-world assets, of which roughly $460 million are already circulating on the network. The synchronization of price gains with network enhancements highlights a growing narrative of enterprise adoption. CoinDesk Data's technical analysis model note that the consolidation above $0.36, combined with systematic accumulation around key support levels, points to ongoing institutional positioning that could pave the way for a sustained move beyond $0.37. Market Analysis Reveals Strengthening Corporate Interest Price established fundamental support at $0.35 during heightened selling pressure on September 1, 21:00. Robust accumulation activity developed between $0.36-$0.36 following decisive market recovery. Resistance parameters identified at $0.37-$0.37 where price encountered dual rejection events.

DefiLlama data shows this is the first month where combined spot and perpetual contract volumes have exceeded $1 trillion in monthly activity . Spot DEX volumes hit $506B in August, while perpetual contract volumes rose to over $648B, reaching an all-time high for this category. The DEX market remains strong as Web3 becomes more accessible, thanks to apps like Best Wallet . Best Wallet provides an easy way to convert fiat via a mobile app, along with integration with multiple DEXs for a smooth crypto experience. We’ll discuss why the $BEST token is the best way to buy and sell crypto through the Best Wallet app, but first, we’ll take a closer look at the DEX market. Which DEXs are Seeing the Most Volume? Uniswap remains the top spot DEX with over $143B in total volume processed during August, accounting for 28.2% of the month’s total spot volume. PancakeSwap is in second place with nearly three times less volume at $56.6B, while HyperLiquid ranks third with $21.7B. The increase in spot volume raised the DEX-to-CEX trading ratio to 17.2% in August, indicating a growing interest in token swaps done entirely on-chain. The DeFi market cap now stands at $160 billion and continues to grow as more users join the DeFi space. Best Wallet is set to take advantage of a strong DEX market, beginning to compete with institutional CEXs. Let’s learn more about how Best Wallet ($BEST) makes integration with DEXs easier. Best Wallet – A Cross-Chain Wallet Built for the Mobile-First Generation Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is Best Wallet’s official token, a mobile-first crypto wallet that works across multiple blockchains with native DEX support. Best Wallet surpasses older wallets like MetaMask by consolidating your entire crypto portfolio into one app, reducing the need to switch between different blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana. It also gives you access to an exclusive token launchpad to participate in presales for upcoming crypto projects before they are available on CEX and DEXs. Regarding security, Best Wallet employs Fireblocks MPC-CMP to protect your wallet from crypto theft. It’s easy to back up your wallet to the cloud within the app and restore it whenever needed. If you’re interested, you can try it out yourself – Best Wallet is already available on Google Play and the Apple App Store. Best Wallet improves with $BEST. It lowers your transaction fees when swapping crypto, lets you vote on new blockchain support from the Best Wallet DAO, and gives you early access to exclusive new presale tokens before they’re more widely available. There are attractive staking rewards available if you buy $BEST now. You can stake and earn returns of up to 86% annually. Act quickly, as over $15.4 million worth of $BEST has already been reserved during the presale, pushing prices up to $0.025575. We also created a helpful guide on how to purchase $BEST . Purchase $BEST today before the presale ends. What’s Next For DEXs The rise in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume indicates a growing demand for token swaps and leveraged crypto trading, particularly in perpetual futures. Any cryptocurrency project that can reduce the barriers to entry for the DEX market is likely to be quickly embraced by users eager to take advantage of a thriving market, especially those who might be unsure of how to begin.

Crypto Analyst Says Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is More Likely to Break $1 Resistance Than Pepe Coin, Here’s Why",https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/can-pepe-reach-1-crypto-analyst-says-pepe-dollar-pepd-is-more-likely-to-break-1-resistance-than-pepe-coin-heres-why/,"Few milestones in crypto capture attention like the fabled $1 target . For meme coins, hitting this level has always been symbolic — proof that community energy and speculative fervor can turn jokes into generational wealth. Recently, analysts have revisited the question: Can Pepe Coin (PEPE) ever reach $1? The conclusion from many experts is sobering. With trillions of tokens in circulation and a multibillion-dollar market cap already established, PEPE would need valuations higher than Ethereum to approach $1. Instead, analysts are pointing to Pepe Dollar (PEPD) as the token with a more realistic path toward breaking that barrier. Why Pepe Coin Faces Limits Pepe Coin trades at fractions of a cent, and while its meme power is undeniable, the math is its biggest enemy. With such a massive supply, moving even to $0.01 would require hundreds of billions in fresh liquidity — an unrealistic figure for a token that thrives mostly on cultural hype. Analysts note that its price movements are now more about short-term speculation than long-term parabolic growth. This doesn’t mean PEPE is finished; it simply means it’s too large to deliver the exponential upside investors crave. Pepe Dollar’s Supply Advantage Pepe Dollar (PEPD) , however, is built differently. With a total supply capped at 3.695 billion tokens and an integrated Federal Burn Allocation of 29% , PEPD’s tokenomics naturally push toward scarcity. Unlike PEPE, which has limited ways to reduce supply, PEPD’s structure ensures consistent burn events that lower circulating tokens over time. At its presale entry price of $0.006495 , the jump to $1 represents a realistic multiple for early buyers — especially with a launch price already set at $0.03695. Ecosystem Strengthens the Case Breaking $1 isn’t just about tokenomics; it’s about ecosystem demand. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is embedding itself in the meme economy with wallet payments, staking rewards, and a minting platform that lets users launch their own meme tokens within the PEPD framework. This creates real demand for the token beyond speculation. Analysts argue that this combination of culture and utility mirrors Ethereum’s ability to blend adoption with narrative, giving PEPD long-term staying power. Analyst Predictions The top analyst making the $1 prediction noted: “Pepe Dollar is engineered with scarcity and demand baked in. It doesn’t need a miracle to reach $1 — it just needs adoption of its ecosystem.” By contrast, PEPE would require an unprecedented inflow of capital. Investors who missed Shiba Inu’s 2021 run or PEPE’s 2023 wave now view Pepe Dollar (PEPD) as the meme coin with the clearest runway for exponential multiples. Conclusion Pepe Coin (PEPE) will always remain part of meme coin history, but the realistic $1 candidate for 2025 is Pepe Dollar (PEPD) . With smart tokenomics, utility integration, and presale momentum, PEPD is positioned not just to ride the meme wave but to redefine it. For investors chasing the next big meme coin milestone, Pepe Dollar offers the path that PEPE can no longer realistically deliver.

According to PeckShield, the user was subjected to a phishing attack, approved the attacker's address, and then transferred their funds. The attack affected approximately $27 million in assets. Venus Protocol's security update stated that it had contacted the affected user directly and temporarily halted the protocol to prevent the hacker from withdrawing funds. It also emphasized that this incident was the result of a user-generated attack, not a vulnerability within the protocol itself. According to the latest statement, Venus Protocol has launched an emergency voting process following the attack. The proposal includes: Partial reopening of the protocol to enable debt payments and fund deposits within 5 hours, Forced liquidation of the attacker's wallet and recovery of stolen funds within 7 hours, The aim is to complete a full security review within 24 hours and prevent similar attacks. Related News: Will Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance Decline? Will It Trigger an Altcoin Season? Analyst Shares 3 Possible Scenarios The protocol will be fully reopened once the security review is complete and updates will be shared via X (Twitter).

The price is currently consolidating at the $4,400 price level amidst active whale participation. Trends in altcoin market values are compared to what happened before past inflexions in bull cycles in Ethereum. Analysts also predict a significant surge for MAGACOIN FINANCE , an emerging altcoin, due to recent advances in the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum’s Whale Momentum Ethereum’s price has established stability at $4,350 to $4,460. After appreciating 83% in Q3 2025, Ethereum peaked at a price of $4,946 in late summer. The price range is currently clustered around $4,280–$4,300, with support at $4,420 being tested repeatedly. The substantial involvement of large investors is now apparent in the on-chain data, as evidenced by their participation in staking inflows, despite a loss of nearly three billion dollars. This shows a strong vote of confidence, suggesting the whales are seeking even higher prices despite short-term fluctuations in prices. Some analysts expect Ethereum’s strength to trigger a larger shift of money into the currencies of other cryptocurrencies. Altcoins Following the Signal Historical data show that when Ethereum whales accumulate, altcoins often follow with strong rallies. Solana, for example, continues to attract whale accumulation and developer momentum, trading near $203 with a market capitalization of nearly $95 billion. NEAR Protocol has also been gaining traction, supported by new partnerships and rising developer activity, trading at $2.41 with a market cap of $2.67 billion. Shiba Inu and Pepe are keeping the memecoin segment lively, with community engagement and speculative flows fueling demand. Shiba Inu’s pivot toward governance upgrades and Layer-3 scalability projects, combined with Pepe’s liquidity-driven growth, reflect how investor appetite for altcoins extends across both serious infrastructure and meme-driven plays. A Rising Early-Stage Contender As Ethereum whales build positions and broader capital rotation begins, traders are also highlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as a new gem gaining momentum. The project is currently in its early access phase, and investor demand continues to grow ahead of exchange listings. With the pre-listing pricing window still open, it has been described as an early-stage opportunity for those looking to balance established altcoin exposure with low-risk, higher-reward plays. Conclusion Ethereum’s significant increase in “Whale” activity is a perfect indicator of when large investors decide to shift their spending to other digital currencies. A market recovery, enabled by the stabilization of exchange-traded ETH, the rise of Bitcoin in the market, and the increase in various altcoins, may lead to an upswing in 2025. As history tells us, new influential projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are usually the major winners in the next bullrun.

This sudden redirection of funds has sparked discussions about its implications for the future of both leading cryptocurrencies. With such a dramatic capital rotation , traders question whether Ethereum is poised to step into the spotlight again as BTC comes under mounting pressure. Whale Moves $4 Billion From Bitcoin To Ethereum This week, the crypto world was shaken after news broke that a single Bitcoin whale rotated more than $4 billion worth of BTC into Ethereum. This unprecedented move, which saw the large-scale holder sell off a significant BTC position for ETH , has fueled speculation that Ethereum could be gearing up for a major price rally. As a result, Rekt Fencer, a crypto analyst has even predicted that ETH will soon reach as high as $15,000. Notably, the whale’s $4 billion rotation has caught the attention of various crypto members, igniting heated debates across the community. One trader noted that the move could mark the beginning of a “ rotation season ,” when capital changes from one dominant asset into another. Other members echoed similar sentiments, highlighting that the sudden shift into Ethereum is not limited to a single whale, but is also observed among several long-time BTC holders now turning to ETH . Many market participants were quick to share their thoughts on the latest whale move. Some saw the rotation as evidence that these large-scale players may have access to insights that the broader retail crowd does not. Others suggested it could simply be a strategy to ignite momentum within the Ethereum market , attracting attention and volume while Bitcoin consolidates. Regardless of the motivation, ETH bulls are believed to be finally taking control , predicting a potential surge to $10,000 from its current price of $4,412. The timing could not be better for Ethereum, as the cryptocurrency has been seeing slow price growth following its previous rally . This unexpected surge in whale demand could accelerate momentum, potentially pushing ETH to a new all-time high. More Whales Exit BTC For ETH Multiple reports have indicated that whale rotation from BTC to ETH has become a broader trend. According to blockchain analytics firm CMDR, a whale recently sold approximately $435 million in Bitcoin before quickly converting nearly the same amount, $433 million, into Ethereum. Market expert Ash Crypto also noted that since August 20, Bitcoin OG addresses have dumped 35,991 BTC, worth just over $4 billion, in exchange for 886,371 ETH, valued at $4.07 billion. Supporting this momentum, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that whales have collectively bought more than 260,000 ETH in just the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, market observers like CryptoGoos revealed that Ethereum is rapidly disappearing from exchanges, signaling accumulation by big players and reduced availability for retail traders.",Bitcoin News|Ash Crypto|bitcoin|bitcoin news|Bitcoin OG|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CMDR|CryptoGoos|ETH|Ethereum|Rekt Fencer,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 17:00:48

Between August 26 and September 1, the firm purchased 4,048 BTC for about $449.3 million at an average price of $110,981 per coin. This update was revealed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin Treasury Surges Past 636,000 BTC Worth $70B With this acquisition, Strategy now holds a total of 636,505 BTC, worth around $70 billion at the current market price. The company’s average purchase price stands at $73,765 per Bitcoin , for a total investment of roughly $47 billion. This means Strategy is sitting on paper gains of nearly $23 billion. To finance this latest crypto buy, Strategy sold 1,237,000 shares of its Class A common stock, MSTR, for $425.3 million. Strategy still has $16.31 billion available under its at-the-market program. It also sold 199,509 shares of STRK for $19 million, with $20.39 billion remaining in that program. Additionally, Strategy sold 237,931 shares of STRF for $26.5 million, with $1.8 billion left, and 12,973 shares of STRD for $1 million, with $4.17 billion remaining. Strategy Doubles Down on Bitcoin With Bold 42/42 Plan These sales are part of the Nasdaq-listed company’ s expanded “42/42” plan, which aims to raise $84 billion through equity and convertible notes for Bitcoin acquisitions by 2027. The plan was doubled from its earlier $42 billion “21/21” program after the firm quickly used up its equity side. In its Q2 results, Strategy pledged not to issue common stock when its market cap to net asset value (mNAV) ratio is below 2.5x. However, the company reversed course two weeks later, saying it may still issue shares below that threshold if it believes it benefits the business. This move confused investors, but Strategy argued it needed flexibility in capital markets to keep buying Bitcoin. Last week, investors dropped a class action lawsuit that accused Strategy of misleading shareholders about its Bitcoin plans. Strategy Keeps Long-Term Confidence Despite Market Swings While Strategy’s market cap of $94.8 billion trades at a premium to its Bitcoin holdings, its leverage is still seen as manageable. Debt payments are not due until 2028, giving the company breathing room. Co-founder and Chairman Michael Saylor remains confident, stating that his company’s crypto buy does not move the market . He has said the firm’s capital structure could withstand a 90% drop in Bitcoin prices lasting four to five years, though shareholders would feel the pain. Also, Strategy’s stock, MSTR, slumped , closed at $334.41 on Friday, down 1.3% for the day. Over the year, MSTR is up 11.4%, compared to Bitcoin’s 17.4% gain. The company continues to move in lockstep with the cryptocurrency it has tied its future to.

The deal, announced Tuesday, marks one of the largest commitments to the firm to date and strengthens its position ahead of a planned Wall Street debut later this year. The Ether Machine Secures $2.16B in ETH Commitments With Berns’ Backing According to a Reuters report , Berns contributed 150,000 Ether (ETH) to the company in a private transaction, with funds set to be transferred to its wallet later this week. Berns will also take a seat on the board of directors once The Ether Machine completes its pending merger with Dynamix Corporation and Ether Reserve LLC. Good morning, Machinists. We just raised another 150,000 #ETH in August ($654M). This is the largest follow on investment of any crypto treasury company thus far, bringing our total committed capital up to >$2.5B — The Ether Machine (@TheEtherMachine) September 2, 2025 The latest investment adds to The Ether Machine’s existing pool of institutional backing. In prior rounds, the company raised more than $800 million from a mix of institutional and strategic investors, including an anchor commitment from co-founder and chairman Andrew Keys. Keys’ initial contribution of 169,984 ETH, now valued at roughly $741 million, has served as a cornerstone of the company’s treasury. The company was formed through the merger of Ether Reserve LLC and blank-check firm Dynamix Corporation. The Ether Machine initially set out to raise over $1.5 billion , courting names such as Blockchain.com, Kraken, and Pantera Capital. While the company has since adjusted its fundraising strategy, the latest capital injection leaves it with a sizable stockpile of Ethereum. In total, the firm has secured commitments for 495,362 ETH, currently worth around $2.16 billion, with approximately $367.1 million available for further acquisitions, assuming no shareholder redemptions. Ether Machine has bought 15,000 ETH as part of its long-term treasury strategy, coinciding with Ethereum's 10th anniversary. #EtherMachine #Ethereum10Years #ETHTreasury https://t.co/K9c8Ybp9p1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 31, 2025 Keys called Berns’ participation a key moment for the project. “Securing this amount of capital from a single investor—particularly from someone with Jeff’s understanding and leadership in Ethereum—is a transformative milestone as we prepare for our public debut,” he said. “I look forward to partnering with him to build the best-in-class ether-producing machine.” Berns, who has spent years funding Ethereum-based projects and Web3 ventures, echoed that sentiment. “As a long-time believer in the potential of Ethereum to transform how we live and work, I am excited to join Andrew and The Ether Machine team on this journey,” he said. He described the company’s plan as “the only institutional public vehicle purely Ethereum focused” and praised its corporate structure as well-suited for global expansion. ETHM Prepares Nasdaq Debut With 345,400 ETH in Treasury The Ether Machine expects to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker ETHM in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to shareholder approval and closing conditions. The public launch will cement its status as a new type of institutional vehicle devoted exclusively to Ethereum. The Ether Machine is a purpose-built, singularly focused Ether generation machine, and now our @NasdaqExchange ticker demonstrates that. Welcome to the era of $ETHM — The Ether Machine (@TheEtherMachine) August 28, 2025 In addition to its financing activity, The Ether Machine has been steadily building its treasury. The company recently purchased 15,000 ETH , worth about $56.9 million at an average price of $3,809.97, as part of its long-term accumulation strategy. That purchase coincided with Ethereum’s 10th anniversary celebrations , which included a global livestream featuring Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and other early contributors. With the latest acquisitions, The Ether Machine’s holdings now exceed 345,400 ETH, surpassing the 231,600 ETH held by the Ethereum Foundation. The firm has positioned itself as the third-largest public ETH treasury and expects to hold as much as 400,000 ETH (valued at $1.53 billion) upon its Nasdaq debut. Keys described the mission as long-term and expansive. “We are just getting started. Our mandate is to accumulate, compound, and support ETH for the long term, not just as a financial asset, but as the backbone of a new internet economy,” he said. Ethereum Reserves Concentrate as Whales Accumulate Amid Market Uncertainty Ethereum’s supply is increasingly concentrated among institutions, ETFs, and whales, acc ording to new data from StrategicETHReserve. SER entities, including corporations, exchanges, and ecosystem players, collectively hold 4.44 million ETH worth about $19.1 billion, equal to 3.67% of the total supply. The largest holder, Bitmine Immersion Tech, controls 1.8 million ETH ($7.7B), or 40.5% of SER reserves. SharpLink Gaming follows with 797,700 ETH ($3.4B), while The Ether Machine and the Ethereum Foundation hold 345,400 ETH ($1.5B) and 231,600 ETH ($996M), respectively. @SharpLinkGaming acquires 56,533 ETH at $4,462 avg, lifting holdings to 797,704 ETH (~$3.7B) $360.9M raised. https://t.co/wb497Nd4Ju — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 26, 2025 ETF reserves dominate even further, locking 6.74 million ETH ($29B), equal to 5.57% of supply. Combined, ETFs and SER entities control 11.18 million ETH, about 9.24% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. However, ETFs reported daily net outflows of 36,500 ETH ($157M), indicating investor redemptions or profit-taking. Whale activity adds another layer of concentration. Blockchain tracker Lookonchain reports that wallet 0x4ED0 has bought 18,447 ETH ($81.5M) since mid-August, alongside 1,357 WBTC ($160M), later collateralized on Aave for $114.2M USDT loans. Another whale, 0xFf15, swapped 425 BTC ($46.5M) for 10,567 ETH. Since August 20, one whale has shifted 35,991 BTC ($4.04B) into 886,371 ETH ($4.07B) at a 0.0406 exchange rate while still holding nearly $5.4B in Bitcoin. Since Aug 20, the Bitcoin OG has sold 35,991 $BTC ($4.04B) and bought 886,371 $ETH ($4.07B) at a 0.0406 rate on #Hyperliquid . He still holds 49,634 $BTC ($5.43B) in 4 wallets. pic.twitter.com/ns7T1zMtAO — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 1, 2025 Ethereum’s network activity underpins these moves. August saw $320B in transaction volume , $135B in DEX trades, and $240B in DeFi TVL, the highest since 2021. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin predicts ETH could rally 100x , aligning with Fundstrat’s Tom Lee in calling Ethereum Wall Street’s preferred asset over Bitcoin. Yet, with ETH struggling to hold $4,000, analysts warn that sustained ETF outflows or liquidity shocks could test the market’s resilience in September.

Such a move may undermine the Eastern European nation’s integration with the EU and clash with IMF requirements, warned a member of the regulator’s management. NBU turns back on crypto reserve initiative The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) does not back a proposal to include virtual assets (VAs) in the country’s foreign currency reserves, which it views as premature, First Deputy Governor Serhiy Nikolaychuk has made it clear. The vast majority of cryptocurrencies remain high-risk assets, while security is the core principle of managing international reserves, the high-ranking central bank executive explained in an interview with Interfax-Ukraine, elaborating: “Sharp swings in the value of virtual assets would negatively affect the overall size of reserves.” The official went on to list several more reasons why the NBU is not so keen on the idea, including the absence of a uniform global understanding of the essence of VAs and unified regulatory legislation governing their transactions and classification. His comments come after a group of Ukrainian lawmakers announced in May that they are working on a bill that would allow the NBU to add cryptos to its gold and foreign exchange reserves. The draft law was filed with the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, in June. Nikolaychuk pointed out, however, that the central bank in Kyiv had not been consulted by the sponsors of the legislation. Crypto reserves said to hinder Ukraine’s EU accession The NBU executive further noted that adding crypto assets to Ukraine’s reserves could undermine the nation’s integration with the European Union. He told the news agency: “The European Central Bank has a very clear position: it considers it unacceptable to include crypto assets in the reserves of EU member states’ central banks. Reserves must be liquid, safe, and protected. Serhiy Nikolaychuk was clearly echoing statements like one by ECB President Christine Lagarde, who said she was “confident that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will not enter the reserves of any of the central banks of the [ECB’s] General Council.” Lagarde made the remark after having what she described as a “good conversation” with Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Aleš Michl earlier this year. He had previously suggested studying the idea of diversifying the Czech Republic’s reserves with crypto investments. Michl, who later won the prestigious central bank “Governor of the Year” award, admitted that in time crypto holdings can be worth “either zero or a huge amount,” due to price volatility. In general, European political and financial leaders have failed to embrace one of the initiatives that helped bring U.S. President Donald Trump back to power in Washington – the promise to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which he fulfilled after his election. According to Nikolaychuk, the proposed legislative changes to allow the NBU to keep crypto in reserve would also go against the requirements of the Technical Memorandum under Ukraine’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In August, the chairman of the parliamentary committee on finance, taxation, and customs policy, Danylo Hetmantsev, told the Ukrainian News website that the Rada was not planning to adopt the crypto reserve bill. The lawmaker was quoted as stating in an interview: “We talked with the head of the National Bank about this and do not support such steps, given the high volatility of crypto assets.” The draft law’s provisions do not oblige but rather grant the central bank the power to acquire cryptocurrencies for Ukraine’s reserves, if it so chooses. The former Soviet republic, which became the target of a full-scale invasion by neighboring Russia in 2022, has seen a spike in crypto usage since the NBU restricted financial transactions to prevent capital flight during the war. According to a recent report by a leading U.K. think tank, the country, which is yet to comprehensively regulate its market for virtual assets, is losing billions of U.S. dollars as a result of crypto-related crime.

The purchase, disclo sed in a voluntary filing on Tuesday, was funded entirely from Yunfeng’s internal cash reserves. The company said the move reflects its strategic expansion into Web3, real-world assets (RWAs), digital currencies, and artificial intelligence. ETH will be booked as an investment on Yunfeng’s balance sheet and will serve as part of its reserve assets. Corporate Ethereum Reserves Climb to $19B as Yunfeng Enters the Market The filing emphasized that the acquisition is aligned with Yunfeng’s long-term strategy. The company said Ethereum’s inclusion in its treasury would support tokenization activities for RWAs, provide infrastructure for Web3 innovation, and enhance its ability to integrate financial services with emerging technology. The group also hinted at exploring potential applications for ETH in its insurance business and broader fintech offerings. Yunfeng stressed that it would continue to monitor market developments and regulatory changes before expanding its holdings further. The board cautioned that cryptocurrency remains highly volatile and warned shareholders to exercise care when trading its stock. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the local securities regulator also distanced themselves from the contents of the filing, noting that they take “no responsibility” for its accuracy or completeness. The acquisition places Yunfeng alongside a growing group of corporate and institutional entities treating ETH as a strategic reserve. According to Strategic ETH Reserve (SER) data , structured entities now hold 4.44 million ETH valued at around $19 billion, representing 3.67% of Ethereum’s total supply. The largest single holder is Bitmine Immersion Tech, which controls 1.8 million ETH worth roughly $7.7 billion, accounting for more than 40% of all SER reserves. Other major entities include SharpLink Gaming with 797,700 ETH ($3.4 billion), The Ether Machine with 345,400 ETH ($1.5 billion), and the Ethereum Foundation with 231,600 ETH ($1 billion). Coinbase also maintains 136,800 ETH ($588 million), largely tied to customer balances and staking operations. Analysts warn that sustained redemptions could temporarily weigh on prices, even as long-term accumulation by corporations like Yunfeng suggests growing confidence in Ethereum as an institutional-grade asset. The concentration of reserves also remains a key market factor. Bitmine and SharpLink together account for over 58% of all ETH held by SER entities, raising questions about liquidity risks if these major players adjust their positions. Still, the growing role of regulated companies, ETFs, and corporate treasuries shows Ethereum’s accelerating adoption among institutional investors. Yunfeng’s $44 million move may be small compared with the billions held by global giants, but it carries symbolic weight in Hong Kong, a market positioning itself as a digital asset hub. Japan’s Corporate Crypto Adoption Surges With Multi-Billion-Dollar Treasury Plans While Hong Kong-linked funds are making headlines with Ethereum bets, Japan is quietly building one of the world’s most aggressive corporate crypto adoption waves. A string of Tokyo-listed companies has begun reshaping their balance sheets around Bitcoin and altcoins, showing that Asia’s crypto race is no longer just about retail traders. On August 31, Tokyo-based gaming firm Gumi announced plans to purchase ¥2.5 billion ($17 million) worth of XRP before February 2026. The move, approved by its board, reflects Gumi’s ties to SBI Holdings, Ripple’s closest Japanese partner and largest shareholder. Gumi has also been actively buying Bitcoin, including a $6.5 million acquisition earlier this year , and has even launched a BTC lottery for new shareholders. Mobile game developer Gumi Inc. has announced plans to acquire Bitcoin worth 1 billion Japanese yen (approximately $6.58 million). #Gumi #Bitcoin https://t.co/O11tfwoUc1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 11, 2025 Executives described the XRP purchase not as speculation but as a “strategic initiative” to expand into financial services. Japan’s corporate push doesn’t end there. Beauty chain Convano has unveiled one of the boldest treasury plans yet , seeking to raise ¥434 billion ($3 billion) to buy 21,000 BTC, equal to 0.1% of Bitcoin’s supply. Its three-phase program targets 2,000 BTC by the end of 2025.

On August 25, five Japanese companies disclosed new allocations totaling 156.79 BTC . The standout was Metaplanet, which added 103 BTC for $11.7 million, raising its reserves to 18,991 BTC, worth nearly $2 billion. The company, now among the world’s top seven corporate Bitcoin holders, recently secured a place in the FTSE Japan Index, boosting investor confidence despite stock volatility.

These moves align with Tokyo’s policy stance. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato, speaking at WebX2025, called crypto “a part of diversified investments” and pledged to build an environment that supports adoption without stifling innovation. Japan is also preparing to roll out its first yen-denominated stablecoin this autumn, led by fintech firm JPYC. The token will target international remittances and corporate settlements, potentially tying together the nation’s growing corporate crypto strategies.

As Pepe Coin (PEPE) has fallen by 10% in recent days and other low-priced coins have given mixed signals, market observers are starting to pay more attention to the new DeFi project, Mutuum Finance. Presale Phase 6 Underway Mutuum Finance is at presale Phase 6 and the token costs $0.035. Phase 7 will see a 14.29% increase to $0.04. The project already collected over 15.25 million dollars and attracted above 15,950 investors. Mutuum Finance will be in a better position to rekindle market feeling at an opportune time when other cryptocurrencies are walking in the dark. PEPE Coin is Base-Bound. PEPE is currently dealing at approximately $0.000010 representing very little intra-day change. Analysts indicate that the price should range between $0.000013 and $0.000019 in the medium term, but its performance mostly depends on the macro market mood. With the emerging dynamics in the meme token industry, investors are shifting towards newer projects like Mutuum Finance in the pursuit of growth. Official Bug Bounty Program In partnership with CertiK, Mutuum Finance has introduced an Official Bug Bounty Program that provides users with an opportunity to win a portion of $50,000 USDT by discovering a possible vulnerability. This program has four severity levels it is critical, major, minor and even low which guarantees all the users and investors complete security and protection. Interest Rate Models and Liquidity Management Mutuum charges interest rates based on utilization to ensure there is a balance of liquidity. Low rates stimulate borrowing in the presence of an abundance of capital, and high rates stimulate repayments and stimulate deposit making in times of shortage. To ensure certainty in terms of repayment costs, fixed rates can be used at the time of taking out the loan; they are normally higher than variable rates and can be re-calculated in case of a major change in market conditions. The stable-rate borrowing is only allowed on sufficiently liquid assets. Massive Token Giveaway Announced by Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has just declared a $100,000 giveaway, giving 10 people $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Besides that, the project is building an overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin over the Ethereum blockchain. It has also been audited and certified by CertiK, which supports its security and transparency. The Future of Decentralized Lending. The non-custodial lending protocol implemented by Mutuum Finance allows users to have full control over their assets and to receive passive income. By securing diversified assets automatically, borrowers are able to access funds, and systematic changes in rates help to streamline capital efficiency and sustainability throughout the ecosystem. For optimal flexibility and customer autonomy, the platform provides a dual-lending structure. By using smart contracts to govern lending pools, the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) approach dynamically modifies interest rates in response to market conditions. This guarantees stable borrowing possibilities for borrowers and secured yields for lenders. By removing middlemen, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly. This completely decentralized structure gives consumers the most power and is particularly well-suited for high-risk commodities like meme coins. Momentum of the Presale Mutuum Finance keeps gaining ground as Pepe Coin (PEPE) remains stagnant at $0.000010. The project has secured over $15.25 million from more than 15,950 investors. Presale Phase 6 tokens are priced at $0.035, set to rise by 14.29% in Phase 7. Mutuum Finance is establishing itself as a standout project in decentralized lending, offering early investors a prime opportunity to enter before the next price increase.

Related Reading: No Fireworks, Just Grind: Bitcoin Could Drift To $1M Over 7 Years: Analyst According to trading data and market reports, the token briefly traded above $0.30 at launch before falling as much as 15%–30% and settling around $0.21–$0.24 in the hours that followed. Early Volatility And What Hit The Market Based on reports, the sharp drop followed a large token unlock that added roughly 25 billion WLFI to circulating supply, a move that instantly inflated the paper value of the Trump family’s holdings. That unlock pushed the family’s stake into the billions on paper—various outlets put the tally near $5 billion to $6+ billion depending on the price used. Trading venues including Binance, OKX and Bybit handled early volume, and roughly $1 billion changed hands in the first hour on some platforms, according to coverage of the debut. Reports say early investors were allowed to sell a portion of their holdings, which likely amplified selling pressure as markets digested the newly tradable tokens. Proposal To Use Fees For Buybacks In response, World Liberty Financial’s community and team floated a buyback-and-burn program that would route 100% of protocol-owned liquidity (POL) fees from chains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain and Solana toward repurchasing WLFI on open markets and permanently burning those tokens. The aim, according to proponents, is to reduce circulating supply and support longer-term holders. Critics warn that burns funded by fees may take years to materially reduce the massive unlocked supply. Analysts and commentators pointed out a mismatch between headline valuations and the practical reality of supply dynamics. Depending on which price is used, WLFI’s market cap was reported across a wide band—some outlets published peak valuations in the billions, even as price swings kept the effective market cap volatile throughout the day.

World Liberty insists the project is a private venture with governance rules, but regulators and critics have said they will be watching closely. Market participants are now watching vote outcomes and governance updates closely. If the fee-to-burn plan is approved and implemented, it will be measured by how much protocol revenue it can divert into buybacks and how quickly those repurchases can reduce supply.

On Tuesday, Injective (INJ) announced that Wall Street firm Pineapple Financial has launched the world’s first Injective Digital Asset Treasury (DAT). The Toronto-based fintech platform, listed on NYSE American, is eyeing an initial $100 million bet on the INJ token as a treasury asset. INJ, the native token of the Injective ecosystem, was up slightly amid the news, hovering around $12.76 at the time of writing. Pineapple Financial bets on Injective with $100 million treasury buy Ethereum, Solana and BNB are among top altcoins to attract “microstrategy-like” crypto treasury moves. However, these are not the only ones seeing Wall Street salivate on the potential across the blockchain space. Injective is basking in the latest limelight as Pineapple Financial unveils a $100 million Digital Asset Treasury dedicated exclusively to accumulating $INJ. The company’s bet sees it become the first to establish a publicly traded Injective DAT, with purchase of the crypto tokens set to commence in coming weeks. Injective 🥷 @injective · Follow Today, the Injective ecosystem takes a historic step in bringing $INJ to Wall Street for the first time.Fintech platform Pineapple Financial $PAPL has launched a $100 Million Digital Asset Treasury dedicated solely to accumulating INJ. Over the coming weeks and months this 7:04 PM · Sep 2, 2025 625 Reply Copy link Read 101 replies “This release will not only enable traditional finance institutions to access INJ via the stock market, it will also allow Injective to bring an unmatched set of tokenized assets to its blockchain, unlocking a truly multi-trillion dollar market opportunity,” Injective posted on X. Pineapple Financial’s raise attracted a consortium of prominent investors, including FalconX, Monarq, Abraxas, Blockchain.com, Canary Capital, Kraken, and the Injective Foundation. Injective price outlook – key catalysts While the launch of the $100 million treasury strategy marks another potential catalyst for Injective’s growth, it only adds to a growing ecosystem. Recent momentum has revolved around the prospect of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with Injective price recently benefiting from fund manager Canary Capital’s filing applications for a staked Injective ETF. Analysts say a SEC nod for an Injective ETF could spark massive buying pressure amid institutional participation. “Injective was purpose-built to unite traditional and decentralized finance. This ETF integrates staking into a regulated format, giving both institutions and individuals secure access to the new future of finance,” Eric Chen, co-founder of Injective, said at the time of Canary’s filing. Traction for Injective in tokenization is another key growth engine, with the platform’s blockchain infrastructure increasingly crucial in the real-world assets market. This, and broader trends in decentralized finance are likely catalysts for INJ price. Recently, Republic, a platform with $3 billion in deployed funds, integrated with Injective, adding to the tokenization trend with wallet and launchpad support. The platform has also unveiled a Nvidia GPU derivatives marketplace. The INJ token reached highs of $34 in December 2024, but has struggled for upside amid broader altcoin market turbulence. However, bulls currently sit near the support zone at $12 and could drive higher amid fresh crypto gains.

The company seeks to expand its financing options after its stock slumped. According to Metaplanet’s president, Simon Gerovich, shareholders voted to authorize 555 million preferred shares for potential issuance at a meeting in Tokyo on Monday. The company has confirmed the vote outcome in a disclosure on its website today. Metaplanet shareholders have approved all 3 resolutions at today’s EGM: ✅ Increase in Total Number of Authorized Shares ✅ Virtual Shareholder Meetings ✅ New Provisions for Perpetual Preferred Shares pic.twitter.com/O7UY2lW5P0 — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) September 1, 2025 In his words, Gerovich described the preferred issuance as a “defensive mechanism” that will protect common shareholders from losing value if the stock price falls below the value of its Bitcoin reserves. While preferred shares typically lack voting rights, they offer dividend priority over common stock. This is a feature that Japanese investors like when interest rates are low. Metaplanet’s resilience after 55% stock dip This initiative comes after a recent announcement of an underwritten offering to raise $884 million ( ¥130 billion) in foreign markets. According to reports, the fundraising will happen on international markets outside Japan, with US-based selling restricted to accredited investors. The pricing of the offering is expected between September 9 and September 11. Metaplanet has raised over $1.6 billion (¥242 billion) through a moving strike warrant agreement with investment firm Evo Fund. However, Metaplanet has stopped all uses of Evo’s warrants from September 3 to September 30. The company seeks new capital-raising tools to keep up with the global race to accumulate Bitcoin. However, as reported by Cryptopolitan earlier, the company is looking to stabilize its stock price, which has declined by nearly 55% since its peak in June. Its market value is now roughly double that of its Bitcoin holdings, down from a premium of eight times in June. The stock was up 0.6% as of 11.30 am in Tokyo on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the company recently added 1,009 BTC for $112 million, pushing its total holdings to 20,000 BTC. The acquisition was made at an average cost of $102,700 per coin, with the company’s total investment now exceeding $2 billion. Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation is part of a broader strategy to multiply its Bitcoin holdings to 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026. Metaplanet is set to become Asia’s Strategy Metaplanet Inc. solidified its position as Asia’s biggest corporate Bitcoin holder. The company has recorded a 468% yield in the second quarter of 2025 and a treasury of 18,113 BTC worth $2.1 billion. Metaplanet’s strategy has been compared to Michael Saylor’s Strategy in its rapid accumulation of BTC. MSTR’s Bitcoin holdings now represent over 3% of the total supply. Metaplanet wants to get 210,000 BTC by 2027, which is about 1% of all the coins in circulation. The company made an operating profit of $5.5 million (¥816 million) in Q2. Bitcoin option insurance brought in ¥1,131 million of that profit. Also, around 128,000 people now own shares in Metaplanet, making it the best-performing company out of 55,000 on the stock market in 2024. Over 170 businesses around the world now have Bitcoin on their books, worth a total of over $111 billion. Analysts still say that the approach could lose value when stock prices reach the same level as Bitcoin’s net asset value. A VanEck executive says that Bitcoin treasury tactics might not work because companies that are getting close to NAV risk lowering the value of their shares by holding on to Bitcoin. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Strategy has seen a 15% decline in its stocks in August.

Still in its presale stage, SYC is drawing investors who are hunting for early entry points that could rival the kind of life-changing returns we once saw from BTC, ETH, and SOL. Meanwhile, TRX has been stealing headlines with record-breaking network activity and bullish chart patterns. But here’s the real question: can a speed-driven rally from TRX compete with the carefully designed staying power of a presale project built for long-term adoption? TRON sets records while investors chase momentum This week’s Tron news has been all about numbers. With its price holding over $0.33 , TRON’s network recorded 2.5 million active addresses in just 24 hours, more than BNB Smart Chain and Solana combined. A community-backed fee cut of 60% has fueled this explosion, helping TRON (TRX) establish itself as the busiest blockchain in daily usage. Justin Sun’s push to make TRON (TRX) the leader in the stablecoin market is working, with trading volume jumping 40% to $687 million. With 329 million accounts and 11.3 billion total transactions, the TRX fundamentals are hard to ignore. Every wave of Tron news seems to reinforce the same story: Tron price moves fast and captures attention. The real test, though, is whether momentum alone can deliver the kind of compounding growth that long-term investors crave. Source: TradingView Smart Yield Coin builds for long-term adoption While TRX runs on speed, Smart Yield Coin (SYC) is playing a different game entirely, one that favors patience and structured growth. Its presale is currently in Stage 1, the lowest price point available before tokens rise in value at each of the 10 stages. For early buyers, that means a rare ground-floor entry. Then there’s the ecosystem itself. Features like Hold-to-Earn and AutoMine reward users simply for participating, while Smart Yield Pay debit and credit cards make it possible to spend SYC like traditional currency. The AI Gas Fee Prediction Tool is another standout, helping users save up to 50% on transfer fees, a feature even larger chains like TRX or Solana can’t match. Cross-chain swaps through Smart Swap and advanced analytics with CoinSight AI complete the toolkit, offering real utility where meme-driven tokens like SHIB, DOGE, PEPE, and BONK fall short. Tokenomics also strengthen the case. With a capped supply of 1 billion SYC, only 10% allocated to presale, and dedicated reserves for staking rewards, liquidity, and ecosystem growth, scarcity and sustainability are baked into the design. This makes Smart Yield Coin (SYC) more than just another altcoin, it’s a blueprint for how a presale project can grow into a long-lasting ecosystem. Conclusion: The race is on Investors are looking past the daily Tron price updates and toward the steady, structured growth of Smart Yield Coin (SYC). With audited security, real-world use cases, and a presale designed to reward early entry, SYC offers something TRX can’t: true ground-floor potential. If you’ve been waiting for the next breakout project, the window is open, but only at Stage 1 pricing. Don’t miss your chance to secure Smart Yield Coin (SYC) before the presale stages push the price higher.

The most important innovation introduced in this context was the dynamic and tiered fee system called Creator Fees V1. In the new system, Creator Fee rates are determined by the coin's market capitalization. Higher-capitalization tokens will have lower Creator Fees, while lower-capitalization projects will have higher rates. This structure will apply to all tokens on PumpSwap. However, the fee rates passed on to the protocol and liquidity providers (LPs) will remain unchanged. PUMP price increased by a significant 11% today: Chart showing the rise in PUMP price. Related News: BREAKING: Millions of Dollars Worth of Tokens Are About to Be Burned in This Altcoin, Only One Signature Remains The Pumpfun team explained that the goal of this update is to “support the long-term growth of coins in the ecosystem and provide content creators with a stronger revenue model.” It was argued that the dynamic fee structure will simplify marketing, content creation, and growth activities for creators and communities. Pumpfun stated that with this innovation, it aims to attract more talent to the ecosystem and become the strongest project and community center on Solana. *This is not investment advice.

51082386,https://cryptonews.com/?p=417392,1756835062,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51082386.jpeg,"Leading AI Claude Predicts the Price of XRP, MemeCore and TRUMP by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/leading-ai-claude-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-memecore-and-trump-by-the-end-of-2025/,"The market dipped hard, and panic spread quickly, with plenty of bearish chatter. Still, both analysts and Claude AI kept calm. Claude AI predicts a bullish long-term outlook, showing XRP’s real-world growth, Memecore’s expanding ecosystem, and Trump Memecoin’s steady hype despite the new WLFI coin launching. Ethereum just hit a fresh ATH at $4,950, proving it’s still the altcoin leader. That move boosted ETH-based meme coins and pushed the whole alt scene higher before cooling off. Meanwhile, Bitcoin just reclaimed 110K and is currently sitting at $111K—about 8% under its $124K August peak. Even so, sentiment leans bullish thanks to the friendliest regulatory environment we’ve seen yet, and Claude AI predicts matches that vibe. XRP (Ripple): Claude AI Predicts Big Rally Ahead—Does It Kick Off in September? 2025 has been XRP’s breakout year, beating the SEC, smashing past a dollar, and running up 400% in just twelve months. Claude predicts the rally is still alive and ready for another leg. Adoption’s heating up fast with more users jumping on. The XRP Mastercard just launched , pushing it right into the credit card game. An October ETF looks likely, too, adding even more hype to the mix. A senior Coinbase analyst said if the Fed starts easing, risk capital will flow back into crypto, and XRP’s set to shine. With its cross-border payment edge and steady compliance progress, it’s shaping up as a prime investment pick. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView While the long term still looks bullish, September is a historically weak month for the crypto market. Although XRP is expected to hit over $5, traders must remain cautious. Momentum’s still shaky. RSI sitting at 39 shows weak demand, and MACD’s hanging just under neutral. Candles are printing spinning tops right at resistance, usually hinting a breakout’s getting close. The potential move toward $10 is clear in the long term, but it needs to break resistance at $3.66 first, a level the price was rejected from, before dipping under $3 again. Memecore Pumping Amid Market Blood Proves Claude AI Was Right Out of nowhere, Memecore started pumping, bringing fresh energy back into the memecoin scene with a 20% jump in a single day. The community says it best: “Holding Memecore (M) isn’t just investing, it’s being part of a movement.” With the ecosystem growing and hitting new milestones, that line’s starting to feel real. Memecore’s closing in on a $1B market cap and just touched a $0.87 all-time high. The momentum doesn’t look like it’s slowing down, and the chart’s matching the ecosystem’s strength. Memecore (M) just ripped 100%, jumping toward an all-time high of $0.88. With its market cap closing in on $1B, it has overtaken Floki as the biggest utility memecoin on the BNB Chain. Since its token generation event (TGE), Memecore’s price has stayed impressively strong, backed by a massive community wave in Asia. Many think that if it scores a listing on Upbit, cracking into the multi-billion market cap range is just a matter of time. On top of that, Memecore runs its own platform for experimenting with new memecoins, and the leading project there has already hit a $4M market cap. Trump Memecoin After WLFI Launch: Claude Predicts $15 by End of 2025 The launch of this highly anticipated Trump-backed digital asset has sparked a rally for Official Trump ($TRUMP). Over the past five days, the President’s meme coin has outpaced every other token in the top 10 of its category, climbing 3.1%. Trading volume also surged 180% in the last 24 hours ahead of $WLFI’s debut, fueling a bullish outlook for Trump Coin as technical indicators point to accelerating momentum. The RSI is indicating that bullish momentum is building, with the oscillator now pushing into overbought territory. Although this usually hints at a short-term pullback, it also shows that buying pressure is strong. That supports a bullish Trump Coin outlook, with the token eyeing a push toward $30 soon. A confirmed breakout over $17.5 would open the door for that surge, but the real upside potential for $TRUMP looks much higher from here. Memecoins keep proving over and over that they’re a major force in the market. Every rally seems to kick off with a fresh meme idea sparking bullish momentum. That’s exactly what Maxi Doge is aiming for, and it’s already finding success in its presale. Maxi Doge: Claude AI No. 1 Memecoin—100× Potential? Maxi Doge’s stealing the spotlight right now. Fresh out of presale, this Dogecoin-inspired meme token already racked up over $1.75 million. Maxi Doge is all-in on meme culture, centered around a jacked “gym bro” Doge hooked on high-leverage trading, no fake utility pitch here. But it’s not just laughs. The project has staking and contests lined up to keep the community active and locked in for the long run. Best part? The token distribution. About 40% of supply went straight to the public presale, with no insider or private rounds, cutting down the risk of whale dumps once it lists on major exchanges. They’re also rolling out a staking program for MAXI holders, giving presale buyers the chance to earn up to 178 % annual yield. So, you can lock up your MAXI and start racking up rewards even before the presale ends. Early believers might cash in big and end up making the most of it. Head to the Maxi Doge website to follow smart investors and join the presale. You can make your purchase using ETH, USDT, BNB, or even a credit card.

Charles Hoskinson claims ADA is the ""best performing asset of all time."" He says $ADA has outperformed $BTC by over 200% since inception. pic.twitter.com/kLYsT006UL — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) September 2, 2025 However, technical analysis reveals ADA trading at key levels following what appears to be a textbook breakout and retest pattern. The cryptocurrency currently holds above $0.80 support after challenging long-term descending resistance, while whale activity and institutional developments create conflicting signs for ADA price prediction moving forward. Institutional Momentum Builds Despite Government Snub The numbers tell a compelling story from ADA’s development. From its modest $0.02 debut in 2017 to current levels around $0.82, Cardano has delivered what Hoskinson describes as over 200% outperformance against the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Grayscale’s SEC filing for a Cardano ETF has increased institutional interest, with Polymarket traders assigning an 87% probability of approval in 2025. Source: PolyMarket Market analysts suggest such approval could trigger a 120% price surge, potentially mirroring Ethereum’s $27.6 billion institutional inflow following its ETF launch. Strategic partnerships also contribute to the momentum. Hoskinson confirmed active negotiations with WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin project, which has already claimed fifth position among stablecoins by market cap after releasing 20% of its 3 billion token supply. Discussions with Chainlink regarding oracle integration continue, despite the controversy surrounding the exclusion from the U.S. government’s blockchain data initiative. The exclusion particularly stung Cardano supporters, given the network’s five-year zero-downtime record. Hoskinson blamed Chainlink’s “outrageously high” integration costs for shutting Cardano out of the federal program that includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and seven other networks. BREAKING NEWS: CHARLES EXPOSES CHAINLINK NEGOTIATIONS @IOHK_Charles says @chainlink gave Cardano an absurd price for integration Despite delays, $ADA is pushing forward with $LINK integration. Could this be the game-changing move Cardano needs? pic.twitter.com/5BlFAUetCg — Mintern (@MinswapIntern) September 1, 2025 While Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Tron, Stellar, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism now distribute official macroeconomic data, Cardano remained sidelined due to Chainlink’s pricing demands. Technical Breakout Faces Whale Distribution Pressure ADA’s chart structure reveals a compelling breakout narrative currently testing at $0.8076. The cryptocurrency successfully breached long-term descending resistance around $0.70, subsequently holding above this level on multiple retest attempts. Source: X/@CryptoGemAthos This technical pattern typically precedes strong trend reversals, particularly when institutional buying, rather than retail, drives the initial breakout. The clean nature of ADA’s resistance breakthrough suggests sophisticated accumulation underlying recent price action. Current trading is occurring within a well-defined ascending channel, targeting $0.88 as immediate resistance. Fibonacci projections point toward $1.20-$1.25 as the next major technical objectives, representing potential new all-time high territory. However, whale distribution activity casts shadows over bullish technical setups. Large holders sold 30 million ADA tokens during the past week, creating potential overhead supply that could limit upside momentum. 30 million Cardano $ADA sold by whales in the past week! pic.twitter.com/HkhkZyG019 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 1, 2025 Social Dominance Peaks as Critical Support Tested Additionally, ADA’s social dominance surged to 92%, dwarfing major competitors, including Solana at 1.28% and Chainlink at 1.6%. Such extreme retail attention often coincides with local price peaks as smart money begins to distribute strategically. Historical patterns suggest extreme dominance readings frequently precede corrections as retail enthusiasm wanes following initial price movements. ADA’s next clear trajectory hinges on breaking decisively above $0.88 resistance within the coming weeks. Success at this level opens pathways toward $1.20-$1.25 targets, while failure could trigger retracement toward $0.68-$0.70 support zones where institutional accumulation previously occurred. Is Bitcoin Hyper the Next 1000x Layer-2 Everyone’s Watching? While ADA prepares to break key resistance levels, this new token is already performing well in presale markets. Smart investors know that finding the right project early can lead to massive returns during bull runs. Bitcoin Hyper is getting attention because it makes Bitcoin faster and adds smart contracts. The coin uses Solana’s technology to cut Bitcoin transaction times from 10 minutes to seconds. The coin sale has raised over $13 million so far. Early buyers can earn over 150% rewards for holding their coins. Here’s the reality – the best presale opportunities don’t last forever. Bitcoin Hyper’s mainnet launches in Q4 2025. This means you need to buy soon if you want the lowest presale price. You can buy Bitcoin Hyper tokens on their website using crypto or credit cards.

Broader corporate adoption of crypto treasury strategies remains focused on BTC and ETH, but ecosystem-specific deals are emerging. Treasury integration between public companies and token foundations is still rare, but is growing in strategic relevance. The Conflux Foundation is seeking community approval to authorize its Ecosystem Fund to pursue strategic cooperation with publicly listed companies, according to an announcement published on September 2. The proposed partnerships would involve digital asset treasury allocations and ecosystem support activities such as RWA asset management , on-chain liquidity provision, and POS node operations. These agreements would not be restricted to firms listed in specific jurisdictions. Conflux Foundation Proposes Treasury Plan Under the plan, any CFX tokens injected into the treasury of listed entities would be subject to a lock-up period of no less than four years. The Foundation said a governance vote will be held to gauge community sentiment before proceeding. A separate voting announcement will be issued when the proposal moves forward. “The goal is to explore the possibility of strategic cooperation with listed companies,” the Foundation wrote. Announcement: Conflux Ecosystem Fund Authorization https://t.co/cjZkhn3O3r The Foundation proposes authorizing the Ecosystem Fund to explore cooperation with publicly listed companies in areas like: Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) POS node operations On-chain… — Conflux Network Official (@Conflux_Network) September 2, 2025 The Ecosystem Fund plays a central role in allocating resources toward long-term projects and infrastructure development within Conflux. This proposed mandate expansion would mark a shift toward institutional-level engagement through regulated markets. The Foundation is encouraging community members to follow updates and participate in the upcoming vote. Conflux is currently trading at $0.173 , according to CoinMarketCap. It has seen fluctuations in the past few months and is down by 18% within the last 30 days. Public Companies Embrace Crypto Treasury Public companies have increasingly explored digital asset treasury strategies since 2020, led by early adopters such as MicroStrategy and Tesla. These firms have allocated portions of their balance sheets to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, citing inflation hedging and long-term value preservation. While most public treasury activity has focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum, some firms have begun exploring token holdings tied to specific ecosystems. These arrangements often involve longer lock-up periods, structured custody, and regulatory reporting requirements. Cooperation between listed firms and blockchain foundations remains limited, but interest is growing. Treasury partnerships can offer token projects institutional exposure while providing companies with direct access to blockchain infrastructure and liquidity networks. For projects like Conflux, such partnerships may suggest an effort to build long-term alignment with regulated financial entities. Four-year lockups suggest a focus on stability and strategic collaboration rather than short-term capital inflows. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why would a public company hold tokens from a specific blockchain project like Conflux? Aside from price exposure, firms may view such holdings as a way to participate in network governance, liquidity provisioning, or strategic infrastructure operations. How are corporate crypto treasury strategies typically managed? They often require board-level approvals, custodial arrangements, and compliance with financial reporting and risk disclosures across jurisdictions. Could these partnerships affect token liquidity or market stability? Locked-up tokens can reduce circulating supply, potentially affecting liquidity. However, they also indicate long-term institutional involvement, which can stabilise expectations. How do such agreements compare to venture-style investments?

51083149,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=177218,1756836042,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/51083149.jpeg,Wall Street Goes All-in on Crypto – But That May Not be Good News,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/wall-street-goes-all-in-on-crypto-but-that-may-not-be-good-news/,"Wall Street’s crypto embrace is reaching fever pitch, and while that taps a historic growth lever, it’s also triggering warning signs. Over the past week, Ethereum ETFs alone recorded over $307 million in inflows , and institutional investors continue to dedicate large capital portions to crypto assets . Powerhouse firms like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Fidelity are now active in everything from custody to tokenization. At the same time, macro volatility remains sharp: Fed signals, dollar fluctuations, and leveraged positions threaten sudden shifts. History shows that when institutions pile in during early cycles, markets can overheat, and that’s when prudent positioning becomes mission-critical. While Wall Street’s bets reinforce crypto’s long-term appeal, they also increase fragility in near-term cycles. Among the emerging alternatives, one presale is quietly shaping up as a high-conviction play with potentially transformative returns: MAGACOIN FINANCE , pegged to deliver up to 9,000% ROI amid rising institutional noise. 1. Eth dominance is rising – too fast Ethereum is being dubbed “the Wall Street token,” and for good reason. VanEck’s CEO recently touted ETH’s vital role in unlocking on-chain stablecoin activity as institutions lean into digital assets. Yet, such hype often leads to overextended moves. While ETH may benefit from inflows, the speed and scale risk sparking a short-lived inflationary spike, setting the stage for speculative breakouts or steep retracements. 2. ETF mania masks structural risk With daily ETF moves dominating headlines, true market structure is overshadowed. Ethereum ETFs pulled in over $300 million in just one day, stunning, but possibly fleeting if sentiment shifts . Reliance on passive fund inflows can distort price discovery; when fund flows reverse, assets can crash hard. What makes this moment especially compelling is the standout performance emerging from a carefully structured presale. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being described by analysts as a rare breakout candidate, with ROI projections reaching as high as 9,000%, rivaling the frenzy surrounding early SHIB gains. This rise is fueled not by hype alone, but by a solid trust structure: MAGACOIN FINANCE has completed dual audits by both CertiK and HashEx, delivering institutional-level security assurance. Unlike ETH’s ETF-fueled rally, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trajectory is supported by engineered scarcity, explosive early interest, and distribution precision. Its presale phases have seen intense demand, with every tier selling out quickly, reflecting both widespread retail traction and timely positioning. Amid increasing institutional risk, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a high-upside alternative built on transparency and trust, positioning it as one of the most credible and explosive presale opportunities of 2025. 3. Wallet inflows signal overconfidence On-chain data reveals a pattern: wallets are inflating positions, especially in ETH and BTC, based on bullish headlines, not fundamentals. Such behavior has historically precipitated corrections when macro nerves reassert themselves. Timing entry points is critical now. 4. Macro shifts may trigger reversals Regulatory whiplash remains a lurking hazard. Announcements from Washington or altering Fed bias could spark fast reversals, especially when momentum is ETF-driven and not rooted in organic adoption. Fast fund inflows can just as quickly reverse into brutal selloffs if policy signals shift. Conclusion: institutional momentum meets presale opportunity Wall Street’s embrace of crypto is unmistakable, Ethereum’s ETF inflows and bullish infrastructure signal long-term maturity. But bullish haste often flirts with short-term danger, especially when fundamentals are overshadowed by fund flows. Ethereum dominance, ETF mania, and speculative wallet surges all tell the risk cycle is intensifying. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a speculative yet structurally sound counterpoint: a presale-backed token with dual audits, built scarcity, and up to 9,000% ROI projection, giving forward-looking investors a thoughtful path into high growth without leaning on Wall Street’s volatility. It’s not just another story of institutional demand, it’s an alternative narrative grounded in credibility and strategic positioning, perfectly timed for cycles when headline risk meets foundational upside.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/td-sequential-flashes-back-to-back-buy-signals-on-xrp-heres-the-significance/,"Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a widely followed cryptocurrency analyst, has highlighted a potential rebound setup for XRP. Sharing a chart on X, he pointed to the TD Sequential indicator, which has recently flashed back-to-back buy signals for the token. Martinez’s observation arrives at a time when XRP has been under selling pressure , showing a series of downward moves throughout late August and into the start of September. TD Sequential flashes back-to-back buy signals on $XRP . Rebound setup in play! pic.twitter.com/nN8q4TD27c — Ali (@ali_charts) September 1, 2025 Understanding the TD Sequential Indicator The TD Sequential indicator is a time-based technical analysis tool that identifies turning points in price trends by counting a series of consecutive candles in either direction. When a specific number of candles align, the indicator can signal an exhaustion of the prevailing trend and a possible shift. In this case, XRP’s 12-hour chart displayed consecutive buy signals, suggesting that bearish momentum may be fading. Over the past several days, XRP has struggled to maintain momentum . The token’s value slipped steadily from levels near $3 toward the $2.7 range. The chart data indicates consistent bearish candlesticks, marking a decline in confidence as sellers pressed prices lower. This drawdown set the stage for the latest signals from technical indicators that traders often monitor for potential reversal points. These back-to-back buy signals are significant because they reinforce a potential floor. It implies that selling pressure may have reached a critical point, offering conditions favorable for a rebound if confirmed by subsequent price action. Traders who use this tool typically watch for follow-through movement to validate the signal rather than treating it as a guaranteed shift. Will XRP Rebound? According to Martinez’s chart, XRP may be positioned for a rebound if the TD Sequential plays out as it has in past market conditions. The signals appeared as the price tested support levels near $2.7, marking an area where demand could re-enter the market. A rebound from this range would require XRP to sustain higher closes in upcoming sessions, potentially targeting resistance between $2.8 and $2.85 before attempting a higher climb. This signal could also attract more buyers to the market , aiding the XRP rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The indicator does not provide a fixed price target but instead signals the likelihood of a momentum shift. Given XRP’s recent downward trajectory, even a modest upward move could signal a meaningful change in sentiment among traders.

While several countries have announced pilots and research initiatives, many others remain secret. Crypto commentator Crypto Sensei (@Crypt0Senseii) has highlighted this issue, noting in a recent video that many CBDC pilots have not been made public. According to him, more than 20 projects are underway, yet only a fraction have been officially confirmed. The lack of public information raises questions about which nations are involved, the scope of these pilots, and why the details have not been released. RIPPLE HOLDERS! THIS WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING!!! pic.twitter.com/CkF3NXwf57 — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) September 1, 2025 Rising Interest in CBDCs This uncertainty leaves open the possibility that major economies could already be engaged in private experiments. CryptoSensei highlighted the European Central Bank and France, which prefer XRP’s features for the Digital Euro, as potential participants. Speculation persists that undisclosed projects may include some of the world’s largest markets. Such secrecy is not unusual in financial and monetary innovation. However, the scale and number of hidden pilots suggest that the global CBDC framework may be more advanced than most observers realize. Ripple’s Position in Global Discussions CryptoSensei connected this uncertainty with Ripple’s role in the broader financial landscape. Ripple has repeatedly appeared in policy rooms and industry settings where only a small number of organizations have access. Ripple has also confirmed multiple CBDC-related partnerships in the past. CryptoSensei emphasized that this visibility shows the company’s influence in the infrastructure that supports digital currencies and cross-border settlements. Beyond the immediate connection to CBDCs, Crypto Sensei offered a broader perspective on Ripple’s trajectory. He described Ripple as “one of the biggest blockchain infrastructure companies in the world,” projecting that its role will expand significantly over the coming decades. He expressed the view that Ripple could become “one of the most powerful companies,” ranking within the top ten, top five, or even top three by valuation. According to his comments, the foundation for this potential lies in Ripple’s assets, particularly XRP, and in the solutions it can deliver to global markets . The company’s technology has already been applied in payment corridors, liquidity management, and financial settlement networks. If integrated into CBDC systems, XRP’s reach could extend even further, as it gets embedded into the architecture of future monetary systems .

The money for this purchase came from the company’s own cash reserves. In a voluntary statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the company revealed that the purchase marks its continuation of treasury strategies disclosed in July, when the board showed interest in Web3 technologies, RWA tokenization, digital currencies, ESG net-zero assets, and AI. The board has reiterated that the acquisition of ETH supports the company’s long-term goal of integrating finance and technology. ETH demand rises as ETHZilla and Yunfeng advance their holdings Yunfeng Financial mentioned that adding ETH to its reserves might help explore applications with new financial services like insurance. The firm aims to spread its financial investments to reduce dependence on traditional systems. Yunfeng Financial bought the 10,000 ETH through the open market for $44 million, including transaction fees. Jack Ma’s Yunfeng Financial bought $44,000,000 $ETH for their strategic reserve. Ethereum = new gold. — Ted (@TedPillows) September 2, 2025 The Hong Kong-listed firm will continue to monitor market trends and the regulatory framework surrounding digital assets to assess whether to increase its reserve, according to the statement . The board also highlighted several risks relating to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, citing high volatility driven by macroeconomics and regulatory shifts. The Jack Ma-linked firm noted that integrating ETH into its financial framework may improve client experience by enhancing financial autonomy and innovation. The purchase announcement follows larger institutions’ commitments to the Ethereum treasury strategy. ETHZilla corporation, a U.S.-based listed firm, has also announced plans to deploy $100 million in ETH into EtherFi, a liquid stacking protocol. ETHZilla’s current holdings stand at 102,246 ETH, which is valued at $456 million. The firm revealed that the partnership with EtherFi will deliver higher yields than standard stacking strategies. Ethereum gains institutional confidence following strategic treasury allocations McAndrew Rudisill, ETHZilla’s executive chairman, described the initiative to deploy $100 million on EtherFi as a strategic evolution in treasury management. Mike Silagadze, company CEO, reiterated the growing institutional confidence in treasury strategies worldwide. ETHZilla aims to simplify its financial structure with the recent cancellation of 1.3 million shares held by Elray Resources for $1 million. The company confirmed via a press release that potential DeFi integrations should be expected as part of its long-term goal. Yunfeng’s purchase of 10,000 ETH and ETHZilla’s plan to deploy $100 million on EtherFi reflect how institutional demand for ETH is rising as reserve assets and as a foundation for new financial innovations. The Yunfeng model involves acquiring ETH as part of a wider plan involving Web3, tokenization, ESG, and AI integration. The ETHZilla model, on the other hand, represents its deepening engagement with the DeFi ecosystem to increase its treasury returns. Cryptopolitan recently reported on Ether Machine, which also increased its holdings to 495,400 ETH today. The company increased its holdings through an individual contribution by Jeffery Barnes, a long-term believer in the Ethereum network. 150,000 ETH was added to Ether Machine’s holdings, driving its value to approximately $2.16 billion plus $367.1 million in liquid capital. The string of large-scale institutions allocating ETH into their financial strategies shows how Ethereum’s stacking yield strategy, DeFi finance applications, and role in tokenization may position the infrastructure as a leader in the upcoming phases of the financial ecosystem. Institutional demand for Ethereum has surged, driving ETH ETFs’ exposure to over 11.1 million ETH worth $43.5 billion. Conversely, Bitcoin remains on top with a larger market share and a market cap of 2.2. The BTC token is trading at $110,663.61, with a 1.51% gain today.

As the Pi Network price bucks trends, rallying towards an impressive $0.40, we’re seeing some familiar giants, like Ethereum and XRP, facing a noticeable slump. Investors are scrambling, asking the perennial question: what’s the best crypto to buy now? While the market churns, a new contender, Layer Brett ($LBRETT), is stealing the spotlight from established coins including ETH, XRP, and Pi, offering a blend of meme magic and serious utility from its early crypto presale. Analysts whisper about explosive gains, perhaps even a next 100x altcoin contender. Beyond PI, ETH, XRP: The Layer Brett edge Layer Brett isn’t just another meme token; it’s a bold leap onto the Ethereum Layer 2 scene, promising to fix the headaches of its older, slower cousin. Remember the original Brett, somewhat stuck on Base, without much purpose beyond the meme? This is different. Layer Brett is purpose-built for performance, scale, and user rewards, leaving tokens like Pepe and Bonk in its dust when it comes to fundamental technology. It’s truly an evolution from hyped coins like Pi and XRP. Ethereum’s mainnet, while undeniably secure, often struggles under heavy loads, leading to frustratingly slow transactions and gas fees that could make even a seasoned user weep. Layer Brett, as an Ethereum Layer 2, shatters these limitations. Imagine near-instant transactions at pennies per pop, a stark contrast to the often exorbitant costs found on Layer 1. This isn’t just an upgrade; it’s a revolution for accessibility. This low-gas-fee crypto solution means the average user can actually interact with DeFi without flinching at transaction costs. Many established altcoins, including Pi, Ethereum, and XRP, lack this foundational infrastructure, making $LBRETT a powerful alternative. Its architecture also positions it to rival existing Layer 2 crypto solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrum. How Layer Brett rewards early buyers Layer Brett isn’t just handing out peanuts; it’s serving up a banquet of staking rewards. Early adopters are currently feasting on APYs that soar past 25,000%. This incredible yield is a direct benefit of its efficient Layer 2 scaling, ensuring more value is returned to the community. You can buy and stake $LBRETT in seconds using ETH, USDT, or BNB, transforming your initial investment into a powerful passive income stream. This staking crypto opportunity sets $LBRETT apart from pure meme tokens like Pepe or the original Brett, which typically offer no such utility. It transforms a speculative buy into a long-term investment strategy. The project even boasts a massive $1 million giveaway, sweetening the deal for those who jump in early. Here’s why investors are eyeing $LBRETT: Ethereum Layer 2 Power: High-speed transactions, ultra-low gas fees, and unmatched scalability. Explosive Staking APYs: Early buyers are locking in rewards above 1,900%. Community-First Ecosystem: Transparent tokenomics and a focus on user benefits, unlike many traditional meme tokens. Real Utility & Memecoin Energy: It combines viral culture with legitimate blockchain scaling solutions, a departure from Shiba Inu and Bonk’s pure meme play. The next big crypto for your portfolio? As the Pi Network price garners attention and we watch Ethereum and XRP navigate market volatility, Layer Brett offers a compelling case as a low-cap crypto gem. With a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens, this next big crypto is more than just another trending cryptocurrency. It’s a community-driven blockchain designed for experimentation, interaction, and creative Web3 use cases. Unlike some competitors, it’s not merely chasing fads. The presale is live, offering a golden ticket to get in on the ground floor of what many believe will be a significant player in the 2025 crypto bull run. Don’t let this opportunity slip by. Layer Brett is still in its early stages, but not for long. Join the project set to supersede the Pi Network price.

For aggressive growth in wealth, five coins that can be highlighted are Little Pepe, Ripple, Cardano, Pepe, and Dogecoin, which showcase strong investment potential based on fundamentals, with excellent returns on investment. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – revolutionizing the meme coin concept via layer 2 Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is gaining the most hype as a meme coin launch for 2025 due to the use of Layer-2 technology, which provides fast, low-cost transactions as well as scalability. Unlike traditional meme coins, LILPEPE isn’t all about virality; it is designed to be eco-friendly and sustain the growing decentralized economy. Little Pepe is on Stage 12 of the presale with the token priced at 0.0021. The total amount raised till now is $23,104,797 across various stages. They currently have 36,994 holders. Their presale is picking up a lot of speed and has a solid community support behind it, with 28,000 total members in their Telegram group. A key highlight is the rise of Little Pepe meme coins and the giveaway of 777,000 dollars, which has 283,307 entries to date. Ten winners will receive 77,000 dollars worth of Lilpepe tokens. From the very beginning, the project has been clear on its focus. Certik audit significantly increases the trust investors have in the project. On top of that, Little Pepe is also on CoinMarketCap, which is excellent for their credibility. Ripple (XRP): legal clarity sparks massive bullish momentum Ripple has been a long-time leader in the cross-border payment sector, but price growth has been stifled by a legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As of now, both parties have agreed not to appeal, eliminating the legal grey zone. This increases the likelihood of market institutional adoption. XRP has surged significantly following this news, recently trading between $3.10 and $3.25. This is a significant increase from the 52-week low of $1.64. Ripple now has a market cap of almost $190 billion, solidifying its position among the top digital assets. Analysts expect strong bullish momentum, with conservative estimates putting XRP around $3.80 in the short term, while more optimistic predictions eye $5.00 to $7.00 by late 2025. Ripple’s alliance with SBI Group in Japan for the distribution of its stablecoin is a clear showcase of Ripple’s global vision. This move demonstrates their efforts in reconciling traditional finance with blockchain technology, which is arguably one of the safest and most profitable bets in the finance world. Cardano (ADA): institutional interest driving growth Thanks to the institution-friendly ADA, Cardano’s academic-led development continues to attract institutional interest. The talks regarding an ADA ETF have sparked speculation that institutional money might soon pour into Cardano, similar to the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Cardano’s ADA is currently trading at around $0.88 to $0.92, approaching the psychological $1.00 mark. It has a market cap of $32 to $35 billion, which places it in the upper tier. Should the bullish momentum continue, ADA could soon reach $1.50, with some long-term predictions soaring up to $3.00, but only if the macro environment supports it in addition to growth in the cryptocurrency market. Pepe (PEPE): high-risk, high-reward play With a market cap of 4.2 to 5.5 billion, Pepe has secured a strong position in the meme coin market. Currently trading at $0.000010 to $0.000012, Pepe is known for his volatile business style. During bullish phases, PEPE is capable of offering considerable returns, and analysts expect PEPE to try and retake the 0.000028 mark. PEPE’s rabid following keeps it a viable speculative play for the investors at heart. Dogecoin (DOGE): institutional bets could trigger a rally The first-ever meme coin, Dogecoin, has sprung to life again after the speculative ETF filings of Grayscale and others. If a DOGE ETF were to be approved, it could bring in a tidal wave of new liquidity in the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum did post ETF approval. Currently, DOGE is trading between the $0.21 to $0.24 mark, within a market cap of $31 billion to $36 billion. Updates, such as “Project Sakura,” which explores a hybrid proof-of-stake mechanism, may enhance scalability and efficiency. Analysts predict that if the bullish triggers hold, DOGE could easily reach $0.30 to $0.50 by the end of 2025, forming a good mid-risk bet. Conclusion The 2025 crypto market introduces high-risk and conservative investors to disruptive opportunities, such as Little Pepe , alongside institutional support from Ripple and Cardano. Even though Dogecoin and PEPE meme coins are well known, Little Pepe is more exciting due to his strong community support and Layer 2 scalability.

A crypto analyst has labeled this stretch a “loading at prior high phase,” suggesting that the market is stuck in this area. Currently, bulls are eyeing a decisive breakout above $5,000, but the analyst remains torn about whether ETH is merely pausing before another surge or setting up for a deeper retest. Ethereum Price Loading Phase Likely Short-Lived A market expert identified as ‘Crypto Nova’ has characterized Ethereum’s current price behaviour as a loading phase taking place near previous highs. Looking at the monthly chart, ETH has reportedly climbed back toward the $4,800 range, brushing against levels that previously triggered reversals. Historically, when Ethereum approaches a former high, momentum tends to slow as supply briefly catches up to demand. Related Reading: Analyst Says 4-Year Cycle Ended In Dec 2024, But Ethereum Remains Insanely Bullish However, Crypto Nova notes that this slowdown rarely marks the final top. Instead, it often signals a temporary equilibrium before buyers reassert control. The analyst emphasized that demand for ETH continues to heavily outweigh supply, meaning that short-lived pullbacks will likely be absorbed quickly. Examining the price chart, Crypto Nova identifies two “magnetic” price zones above $6,000 and $8,000, which serve as medium-term targets for Ethereum. These zones also represent strong liquidity pools that the market tends to gravitate toward once upward momentum resumes. If Ethereum manages to convincingly clear the $5,000 barrier, the probability of a sustained move into these higher zones increases. With its price action maintaining a broader uptrend structure and repeatedly rejecting breakdown attempts, ETH further reinforces its bullish case. In other words, the current consolidation emphasized by Crypto Nova is seen as a healthy pause, rather than a signal of weakness or price exhaustion. Bullish Setup Suggests Retest Before $5,000 Push Adding to Ethereum’s bullish narrative, Hardy, a crypto trader and analyst, offers a more tactical outlook using shorter timeframes. On the hourly chart, the analyst highlights that ETH has shown choppy movement around $4,400 and $4,600 after failing to sustain momentum above its 2021 all-time high of $4,865. This has raised the possibility of near-term dips before Ethereum attempts another price breakout. Related Reading: Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal Calls ‘Full Port’ Into XRP, Ethereum Hardy identifies two untapped daily zones of interest, $4,225 and $4,075, as key levels where buyers are likely to step back in. These price targets represent support areas that could provide solid entries for long positions if the price does not pull back. Despite the possible short-term volatility, Hardy remains optimistic about Ethereum’s future trajectory. He suggests that the price is primed for a new all-time high, provided the market respects the above support levels. Ethereum’s overall structure continues to lean bullish, reinforcing the broader campaign toward a $5,000 target and beyond.

Known for its massive mobile-mining user base and grassroots adoption, Pi has long been a community-driven project that lacked the exchange presence needed to unlock real price discovery. A potential listing on Coinbase, the most recognizable platform for U.S. retail investors, could transform that narrative overnight, sparking debates about whether Pi is finally ready for mainstream legitimacy. And while Pi dominates headlines, analysts note that other emerging opportunities, including MAGACOIN FINANCE, are also beginning to capture investor attention as the next wave of breakout tokens takes shape. Bullish, bearish, and base scenarios Speculation around Pi’s Coinbase potential has created a range of forecasts. Bullish scenario: Analysts argue that Pi could see a rapid repricing, with speculative hype pushing the token toward $1 or beyond if liquidity is deep enough. Coupled with its upcoming open-source release and hackathon activity, a rally could mirror the explosive runs seen in mid-cap tokens after similar listings. Bearish scenario: Traders may adopt a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news approach. If excitement fades quickly, Pi could retrace back toward more modest levels, leaving investors disappointed. Concerns about decentralization and real-world utility remain key hurdles. Base case: A gradual climb fueled by developer engagement and ecosystem expansion. In this outlook, Pi could see steady growth rather than parabolic spikes, gaining legitimacy slowly as applications launch on PiOS and partnerships expand. Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE While Pi Network captures attention through Coinbase speculation, analysts are pointing to a different opportunity already in motion. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about presales of 2025, with forecasts projecting up to 50× ROI. The project’s early success lies in its blend of cultural branding, independent audits, and whale-backed inflows. Presale rounds have sold out rapidly, confirming intense demand. Analysts argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE could replicate the kind of momentum Pi is chasing, except with investors able to secure ground-floor entry before listings take place. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the rare chance to buy before the market prices in broader awareness. Why presales are compelling now The Pi Network story shows the importance of visibility, but it also highlights the challenge of waiting years for utility and listing milestones. By contrast, presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE give investors a chance to capture upside earlier. In past cycles, the biggest fortunes were made not by buying assets at their peak hype but by securing allocations before they became mainstream. With analysts comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s setup to early Solana, momentum is building around the idea that this could be the cycle’s breakout token. Conclusion: two stories, one lesson The Coinbase rumors have reignited interest in Pi Network and underscored how important major exchange listings can be for visibility and legitimacy. Whether Pi experiences a rapid repricing or a slower path toward recognition, the spotlight proves that community-driven tokens can capture mainstream headlines. But analysts caution that the real asymmetric upside lies in opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale, where entry points are still discounted and momentum is building fast. With forecasts of 50x ROI and presale allocations selling quickly, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be one of the most interesting options for investors.

EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a well-followed analyst on X, has shared his latest perspective on the current setup. He emphasized that for XRP to maintain a bullish continuation, it needs to achieve several key closes. According to the analyst, the market should secure daily closes above $2.85, then $2.95, with $3.13 marking the next critical threshold. Beyond that, $3.4 stands as the defining point where it could target a new all-time high. At the same time, he acknowledged the importance of the $2.65 zone, stating that a close below it could introduce further downside pressure. #XRP – Throwback Update! : For a #Bullish continuation, #XRP needs to close above the following key levels: $2.85 $2.95 $3.13 And of course, $3.40, which would signal a new all-time high (ATH)! However, we are still seeing a retest of $2.65, which has been my… https://t.co/tmXPRGIhv0 pic.twitter.com/vD4l0mAr60 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 2, 2025 Chart Patterns and Throwback Structure The chart posted by the analyst displays a structured pattern of higher moves followed by corrective phases. The highlighted “Throw Back” region reflects the current retest of lower levels after the sharp rise earlier in the summer. This type of throwback often acts as a retesting mechanism for support before resumption of the upward trend . The outlined resistance levels at $2.85, $2.95, and $3.13 align with the previous rejection zones, while the $2.65 level sits firmly as the foundation of the current structure. The formation also suggests that buyers are defending against a deeper pullback, but market strength has not yet been fully confirmed. The overlapping resistance zones show that XRP’s path forward will depend on how decisively it can break from this consolidation range and hold above these figures. XRP’s Upside Potential With the current price around $2.80, the next major target of $3.40 represents a meaningful increase. That level would deliver a gain of approximately 21% from the current zone, and set the asset up for a run toward its all-time high of $3.65 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Beyond that, the chart indicates a longer-term target in the $4 to $4.2 region, marking a potential breakout move of up to 50%. However, the necessity of breaking through incremental resistance points makes the journey to those levels dependent on sustained momentum.

Launching Sept. 22, the Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures will be the first U.S.-listed derivatives contracts to combine traditional equities with digital assets, according to a blog post . The move, said the company, marks expansion beyond single-asset derivatives into multi-asset offerings designed to give investors thematic exposure to innovation and growth sectors. The new index includes ten components weighted equally at 10% each. It consists of the so-called “Magnificent 7” stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla — along with Coinbase’s own stock and two crypto ETFs: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). MarketVector, known for its crypto and thematic indexes, will serve as the official index provider. Contracts will be monthly and cash-settled, with each representing $1 multiplied by the index level. At an index value of $3,000, for example, the notional value of one contract would be $3,000. The index will be rebalanced quarterly to restore equal weighting across all components. Coinbase framed the product as a way for investors to manage multi-asset risk more efficiently while gaining exposure to both sides of the innovation economy — Silicon Valley tech leaders and blockchain-native assets. “Equity index futures mark the next evolution of our product suite and pave the way for a new era of multi-asset derivatives,” the company said in its announcement. The launch comes amid growing investor appetite for crossover products that bridge traditional finance and crypto markets. Coinbase said it plans to expand availability of the contracts to retail users in the months ahead, though they will initially trade on partner platforms.",Markets|Derivatives|Coinbase|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-02 19:09:38

From viral sensations to community-driven tokens, meme coins like Arctic Pablo Coin, Non-Playable Coin, Just a Chill Guy, and Brett are capturing the attention of investors eager for high-reward opportunities. These coins are not just about quirky mascots—they offer innovative presales, staking rewards, and real growth potential. Could you be the next early investor to reap unprecedented gains? This moment is shaping up to be a defining chapter in the meme coin landscape, where timing, strategy, and insight collide. Among these, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is drawing attention for its unique staking rewards, presale structure, and community-driven approach. Investors are not only intrigued by its playful branding but also by tangible opportunities to earn high returns. While Non-Playable Coin, Just a Chill Guy, and Brett are generating buzz, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out for its robust ecosystem and clear roadmap, giving it an edge in the crowded meme coin market. With early-stage excitement peaking, savvy investors are already positioning themselves for maximum rewards. Arctic Pablo is one of the Best Cryptos to Buy Today , making it the meme coin poised to dominate the charts next. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin: Stake, Earn, and Multiply Your Gains Arctic Pablo Coin offers a standout feature that elevates it beyond the typical meme coin hype: an impressive APY of 66% during its presale phase. Investors can stake their APC tokens and earn consistent rewards, turning holding into a lucrative strategy rather than just speculative excitement. This innovative approach not only fosters a loyal community but also allows early adopters to maximize their token accumulation. By integrating staking with a gamified presale structure, Arctic Pablo Coin ensures that every investor benefits from compounding growth. Could this be the opportunity where holding truly pays off? With a system designed to reward patience and engagement, Arctic Pablo Coin is proving that meme coins can be both fun and financially strategic. The presale excitement intensifies with Stage 39 — aptly named Shiver Me Bags — where investors enjoy a 300% bonus and receive 4 times the tokens. A $1,000 investment today translates into 4.04 million APC tokens, unlocking massive potential gains. Early adopters can experience an ROI of 708.08% at the listing price of $0.008 or a staggering 10,001.01% if the analysts’ predicted price of $0.1 is reached. With the code BAGS300 activated, the presale allows you to quadruple your chill while quadrupling your gains. If you invest $2,000 now, it could grow to $64,664.40 by listing—making it a rare opportunity that combines fun with serious financial upside. Arctic Pablo is one of the Best Cryptos to Buy Today, and timing is critical: missing this stage could mean losing the chance to ride an unprecedented growth wave. Shiver Me Bags: The Stage 39 Presale Frenzy The current Stage 39 of Arctic Pablo’s meme coin presale has investors buzzing. With over $3.70 million already raised and an activated 300% bonus, this is the week where the Arctic multiplier hits 4x. Every token purchased is an opportunity to turn a modest investment into extraordinary returns. Imagine turning $100 into $400 worth of APC tokens—an icy wind carrying the promise of a financial avalanche. The presale mechanics encourage engagement, participation, and strategic investment, rewarding those who move fast and decisively. As the community rallies, the countdown to listing is intensifying. This is not just a presale; it is a movement for early adopters to stake, earn, and grow wealth exponentially. Arctic Pablo is one of the Best Cryptos to Buy Today, making this an unmissable opportunity for savvy investors seeking high returns. APC Goes Mainstream: Exchange Listings Ignite Buzz CEX Coinstore recently announced on its verified X account that Arctic Pablo Coin will be listed on both PancakeSwap (DEX) and Coinstore (CEX) immediately after the presale. For whales and early adopters, this signals the opening of high liquidity channels and widespread accessibility. Listing on both decentralized and centralized exchanges provides a dual path for investors to realize gains and trade seamlessly. The announcement has heightened anticipation around APC, giving both seasoned and new investors confidence that Arctic Pablo Coin is poised for a major market presence. Early participation could mean taking advantage of premium entry points before the mainstream listing frenzy begins. 2.

This coin has carved out its place in the meme coin ecosystem through clever design, interactivity, and viral appeal, offering an experience that goes beyond mere trading. Non-Playable Coin earns recognition for transforming a meme coin into an immersive and strategic crypto experience. 3. Just a Chill Guy: Low-Key, High Potential Just a Chill Guy takes a relaxed approach to crypto, offering investors a low-pressure entry into the meme coin arena. Its community-centric philosophy emphasizes gradual growth and widespread adoption rather than hype-driven spikes.

51086821,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=797676,1756840523,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51086821.jpeg,"Elon Musk said Tesla’s future will rely 80% on its robot project Optimus, not cars",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musk-teslas-future-depends-on-robots/,"Tesla boss Elon Musk said Monday that the company’s future isn’t tied to cars anymore. Speaking just after releasing a new “master plan,” Elon said that 80% of Tesla’s value will come from Optimus, the humanoid robot project he first introduced in 2021. That’s a major change for a company that still doesn’t make a dollar from robots. This statement, reported by Bloomberg, came as Tesla publicly acknowledged, for the first time, that robots are part of its core future plans. Elon wrote on X, the social platform Elon, that: “We are building the products and services that bring AI into the physical world. We have been working tirelessly for nearly two decades to create the foundation for this technological renaissance through the development of electric vehicles, energy products and humanoid robots.” Optimus is still under construction, not ready for delivery, and years away from generating revenue. But that didn’t stop Elon from putting it at the center of Tesla’s valuation going forward. Elon shifts attention from EV plans that fell short This new robot-first mindset came right after the release of Tesla’s latest master plan. Elon’s first plan, released in 2006, focused on building an expensive electric sports car and using the profits to make cheaper models. That plan was actually followed. But the second plan, published in 2016, still hasn’t been completed. It promised electric trucks and buses, fully self-driving cars, and an autonomous ride-hailing platform. Almost none of that exists in the real world. When Elon published a third plan in 2023, even he admitted it didn’t land. “Too complex for almost anyone to understand,” he said. This newest version is short, under 1,000 words, but it doesn’t give clear numbers or roadmaps. And that includes Optimus . Back in January, Elon said a “very rough guess” is that Tesla might be able to deliver Optimus robots to outside companies sometime in the second half of 2026. Even without working prototypes or any business case, Elon keeps talking up the robot. And the timing isn’t random. Tesla’s car sales have been falling. Global vehicle deliveries dropped 13% in the first half of 2025, putting the company on track for its second yearly decline in a row. That’s the worst performance the electric car maker has seen in years. Tesla sees Europe slump while Norway stays loyal While Tesla tries to refocus around robots, the company’s EV business in Europe is falling apart . Tesla’s vehicle sales in the region dropped 40% in July, and things got worse in August. New registrations in France were down 47%, and in Sweden they collapsed by 84%. Tesla’s shrinking sales come as more competitors, especially from China, pour into the market. Brands like BYD are selling cheaper electric models and taking large chunks of Tesla’s customer base. The other problem is Tesla’s own lineup. Buyers have been waiting years for significant upgrades, and nothing new has really dropped. On top of that, Elon’s frequent political statements have drawn heavy criticism in Europe. It’s not helping sales. But not all markets are falling. In Norway, Tesla is still on top. The country has basically gone full electric. In August, 97% of all new cars sold were EVs. Tesla came out as the top-selling brand in the country this year, and saw its sales jump 22% year over year that same month. Norway is giving Tesla some breathing room, and the company also saw a slight increase in sales in Spain and Portugal last month. Still, that isn’t enough to offset the crash in France, Sweden, and other major markets. Elon has denied that the company is in trouble in Europe. But Tesla is clearly under pressure, and Elon’s robot dreams are now doubling as a distraction from poor numbers on the ground. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Bitcoin has recently rebounded on the $106,000 to $108,000 minor support area and is now consolidating within its major previous ATH support. Ethereum is still far from bearish and points more towards consolidation as long as prices hold above the $4,000-4,095 pivot region. Ripple is going through a profit-taking phase, having breached the $3.00 that was acting as a key psychological level. Solana's price action is probably the most bullish out of all other cryptos. By Elior Manier We are assisting at a very mixed picture across different asset classes. Equities are down after the long weekend, the US dollar is up but correcting from its highs since the ISM Manufacturing PMI report , and cryptocurrencies are sluggish but showing signs of rebound. After sending worrying signs throughout the past week of price action, with Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) correcting for the whole past week and Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ) marking a new record in a weak-looking price action, cryptos are finding a floor with traders bracing for the upcoming Non-Farm Payrolls. Bitcoin has, for example, marked an intermediate low at around $107,000 at the extreme of its previous ATH support area and rebounding since, while Ethereum opens the week off its $4,200 lows. Bitcoin holding above $100,000 still paints a broadly positive picture for cryptos, but markets are starting to be more careful at the recent highs. A huge boost to sentiment should be needed to push BTC to a renewed ATH, but everything is possible. However, Solana USD ( SOL-USD ) is still holding decent momentum. In the preparation of this shortened week of compact action (volumes were down hard yesterday due to a prolonged Labor Day weekend), let's take a look at intraday charts and levels for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple USD ( XRP-USD ), and Solana. For reference, here is our previous crypto market analysis. An overlook on the Cryptocurrency Market Crypto market overview, September 2, 2025 (Source: Finviz) Technical analysis for the major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin ((BTC-USD)) 4H Chart BTC-USD 4H Chart, September 2, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Bitcoin has recently rebounded on the $106,000 to $108,000 minor support area and is now consolidating within its major previous ATH support. Breaking above would bring back bullish trends back to life - for now, the picture for the intermediate term is mixed, and the short-term picture is still slightly bearish, as the action is evolving within a downwards channel (as seen on the chart) and the 4H MA 50 crossed below the MA 200. A soft beat on NFP expectations would be the goldilocks conditions for Bitcoin, as the Fed would still be expected to cut rates while sentiment wouldn't degrade too harshly. A strong miss could send fears of a too-late Fed, while a strong beat would take out hopes for cuts. Levels of interest for BTC trading: Support Levels: $110,000 to $112,000 previous ATH support zone (currently getting tested). $106,000 to $108,000 minor support. $100,000 main support at the psychological level. Resistance Levels: $112,000 previous ATH – immediate resistance level. $115,000 to $117,000 pivot zone (most recent rejection). Major resistance $122,000 to $124,500. Current all-time high $124,596. Ethereum ((ETH-USD)) 4H Chart ETH-USD 4H Chart, September 2, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Ethereum has weakened since its past-week new all-time high (around $4,950). Some technical concerns could be noted due to the sharp rejection right after marking its new record, not the best sign for continuation (watch Bitcoin's previous $72,000 ATH in November 2021 if you haven't). Nonetheless, the action is still far from bearish and points more towards consolidation as long as prices hold above the $4,000-4,095 pivot region. With buyers holding steady at the $4,200 level, bulls haven't given up anything yet. More on this as the week progresses. Don't forget that decisive momentum should pick up after Friday's US NFP release. Levels of interest for ETH trading - Support Levels: $4,200 to $4,300 consolidation zone (getting tested). $4,000 to $4,095 main long-run pivot. $3,500 main support zone. Resistance Levels: $4,460 MA 50 (acting as immediate resistance). $4,950 Current new all-time highs. $4,700 to $4,950 all-time high resistance zone. Potential main resistance $5,230 Fibonacci extension. Ripple ((XRP-USD)) 4H Chart XRP-USD 4H Chart, September 2, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Ripple is going through a profit-taking phase, having breached the $3.00 that was acting as a key psychological level. Now evolving within a downwards channel, it appears that the path is for gradual correction. Some buyers have stepped in at the $2.60 support zone, which will be one of the last barriers before a retest of the previous break (around $2.20) would get higher probabilities of happening. Levels of interest for XRP trading: Support Levels: $2.60 to $2.70 immediate support (getting tested). $2.20 to $2.30 next key support. $2.00 psychological level. Resistance Levels: 4H MA 50 $2.80. $3.00 Key momentum pivot, now acting as resistance. Current ATH resistance is around $3.66. Solana ((SOL-USD)) 4H Chart SOL-USD 4H Chart, September 2, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Solana's price action is probably the most bullish out of all other cryptos. The biggest rival for Ethereum's dominance has held its upward channel and recently tested its upper bound. The technical short-timeframe top has led to some small profit taking, but the action stays bullish above the $185 momentum pivot, which coincides with the middle of the channel, essential for momentum analysis. Levels of interest for SOL trading: Support levels: $185 momentum pivot and recent swing lows. $160 major support and the low of the channel. $150 psychological support. Resistance Levels: $200 psychological level (getting tested). Current highs are $216 and the top of the upward channel. Current all-time high $295. Safe Trades!

This bold move has pushed the company ahead of popular crypto miner MARA in crypto reserves. BitMine Immersion Becomes Largest ETH Corporate Holder According to Lookonchain data, this purchase brings BitMine’s total Ethereum holdings to 1,866,974 ETH, valued at nearly $8.15 billion. Notably, this move solidifies BitMine’s status as the largest corporate holder of ETH worldwide. It also reflects how quickly the company is scaling up its exposure. Recall that BitMine launched its ETH treasury on June 30, 2025. The company also revealed plans to buy back up to $1 billion of its outstanding common stock . Since it announced its Ethereum strategy, BitMine Immersion has recorded many key milestones. BitMine is building its Ethereum holdings because it believes in Ethereum as an asset for decentralized finance (DeFi), Web3 tools, and running smart contracts. As companies increase their ETH holdings, Ethereum is becoming more accepted in traditional finance and business management. This change could also affect how regulators view cryptocurrency and encourage more companies in different industries to adopt it. BitMine Immersion Bets Big on Ethereum Intriguingly, BitMine Immersion has been getting attention in the financial and cryptocurrency industry after growing its Ethereum holdings to over $6.6 billion. A week ago, BitMine purchased $21 million worth of ETH . The sharp rise shows that the company is not treating crypto as a side bet; it is making Ethereum the core of its long-term strategy . In a recent statement, BitMine’s chairman, Tom Lee, described Ethereum as one of the greatest trades of the decade. He says several factors are making Ethereum more valuable. These include more interest from big investors and financial institutions moving toward blockchain technology. Meanwhile, its fast growth has already attracted investors like Ark Invest , Founders Fund, Pantera Capital, and Kraken. Notably, Tom Lee’s view matches analysts at Bernstein, who see Ethereum as a leading symbol of blockchain innovation . Interestingly, BitMine aims to own 5% of all Ethereum in the world. Firms Join BitMine in Adopting Ethereum Although BitMine has positioned itself as an Ethereum-dominated treasury, more public firms have added ETH to their balance sheets. Specifically, SharpLink has updated its Ethereum treasury with 39,008 ETH worth about $176.7 million at an average price of $4,531. This purchase brings SharpLink’s total holdings to 837,230 ETH. The company also reported earning 2,318 ETH from staking rewards. This shows its ongoing support for Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network and commitment to the long-term benefits of staking income. In a similar move, The Ether Machine acquired 15,000 ETH for $56.9 million. The firm bought the coins at an average price of $3,809 per ETH, pushing its total holdings to 334,757 ETH. Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has voiced support for the Ethereum treasury companies.

They’re building a new system that dodges gaming regulators by not calling it betting. Instead, it’s a tradeable contract based on game outcomes, and yes, it’s real money. The structure is simple. Crypto.com’s U.S.-registered derivatives arm, CDNA, will provide the infrastructure. Underdog will run the front-end, where users actually place the trades, using its existing app. There will be no sportsbooks, no odds from a bookmaker, and no need for state betting licenses. Everything runs on pricing from market activity alone. The more people buy into an outcome, the more expensive it gets. If you sell at the right time, you profit. If your outcome wins and the market agrees, you profit. No one takes your bet, because it’s not a bet, it’s a contract. Underdog moves first while others circle the space Underdog is the first sports gaming platform to fully step into this kind of setup. It’s a market space that blends the mechanics of crypto, finance, and sports into a single tradeable product. CEO Jeremy Levine said on CNBC’s Worldwide Exchange that “prediction markets are one of the most exciting developments we’ve seen in a long time,” and added, “While still new and evolving, one thing is clear; the future of prediction markets is going to be about sports, and no one does sports better than Underdog.” Others are watching closely. Platforms like Robinhood, Kalshi, and Polymarket already offer event-based contracts tied to sports, but none have the kind of reach or existing user base that Underdog has in fantasy gaming. On top of that, FanDuel, which is owned by Flutter, recently announced a partnership with CME Group to offer similar financial products. DraftKings boss Jason Robins has also expressed interest on CNBC. What makes Underdog’s deal different is the combination of timing, size, and legal positioning. By using CDNA, Crypto.com’s North American derivatives platform, they’re tapping into a regulatory structure that already exists under the CFTC. That gives them a legal pathway that most traditional sportsbooks don’t have, especially in restricted states. The map of the U.S. tells the story. California and Texas, the two most populous states, still don’t allow legal sports betting. Florida, which ranks third in population, has its gambling system locked up by the Seminole Tribe. The tribe has exclusive rights to run casinos and sportsbooks through its Hard Rock brand. That leaves millions of potential users out of the betting market, and Underdog wants to give them something else to use. Regulators, tribes, and lawsuits can’t stop the contracts… yet This approach is likely to raise eyebrows at both the state and federal levels. The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission hasn’t decided how to classify these contracts yet. Courts are still wrestling with whether prediction markets count as gambling. And questions are being raised about whether they violate state control over gaming laws or infringe on tribal rights under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. But as of now, none of that is stopping the rollout. Citizens gaming analyst Jordan Bender, writing in April, said, “prediction markets are too loud to ignore.” Bender estimated the market could hit $555 million in 2025. For comparison, legal online sports betting raked in roughly $16 billion in 2024. Crypto.com’s CDNA, being already registered with the CFTC, is at the center of the launch. Travis McGhee, managing director and global head of capital markets at Crypto.com, said: “We were the first to offer sports events contracts, and our technology partnership with Underdog will provide more access to CDNA’s innovative offerings.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",News|BTC|CFTC|USD,EN,0,0,MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-02 19:35:43

Institutional liquidations of $1.9 billion since July have made things worse. But whales have quietly built up 340 million XRP, which shows that big holders see value even when prices are going up and down quickly. More and more investors are noticing Remittix , which goes beyond XRP’s price swings. People looking for crypto that can be used in the real world and has long-term potential are interested in its PayFi system and planned growth. XRP Price Has Support and Resistance There is a clear support zone for XRP price between $2.75 and $2.77. If this doesn’t work, the next important levels are $2.50 and $2.00. The immediate ceiling is $2.80–$2.87, and the higher breakout point is $3.30. There are mixed technical signals. The RSI shows that the market is oversold in the mid-40s. MACD shows a bearish divergence, but this could change if whales keep buying. There may be a chance for an upside with symmetrical triangle patterns and double-bottom formations. If resistance breaks, liquidity pockets up to $4.00 could make any rally stronger. Traders are keeping a close eye on XRP to see if it can stay above $2.75 and if a move above $2.87 can start a move toward $3.30 or more. Remittix: A Growing PayFi Alternative Remittix is a clear and organized alternative to XRP’s ups and downs. The token costs $0.1030, and more than 639 million have been sold, bringing in $23.2 million. Its listing on BitMart has already increased its visibility, and a second listing on LBank improves its liquidity. People are interested in Remittix not just because of the numbers, but also because of what it does. Remittix has a clear plan and useful features that both retail and strategic investors like. Here’s why Remittix stands out: Real-world utility: It enables faster, simpler crypto-to-fiat payments. Exchange accessibility: Multiple CEX listings make trading convenient. Staged rollout: Beta wallet and platform expansions reduce execution risk. Community incentives: Programs reward active users and grow adoption. Growth potential: It has a clear roadmap, functional adoption, and organized strategy that can attract long-term investors. Unlike XRP, which faces regulatory uncertainty and institutional swings, Remittix has a measurable path forward.

Cred Executives Face The Music According to the press release , Schatt and Podulka were sentenced on Friday to 52 months and 36 months in federal prison, respectively, for a wire fraud conspiracy. Daniel Schatt and Joseph Podulka were sentenced to multi-year federal prison sentences for misleading investors about the failing crypto investments of Cred LLC.

Podulka And Schatt Set To Serve Prison Time U.S. officials allege the duo’s fraud scheme began at the start of the COVID pandemic in March 2020, when Cred’s hedging partner was forced to liquidate all its trading positions following “a sudden and dramatic decrease” in Bitcoin’s value . “The hedging partner then ended its relationship with Cred, leaving Cred with no hedges and no hedging strategy going forward,” the press release reads. “As the conspiracy progressed, Defendants also learned that the Chinese company would not be able to pay back tens of millions of dollars to Cred.” The crypto executives then made “misleading representations” about Cred’s financial situation, with Schatt claiming that the business was “operating normally” during an “Ask Management Anything” session. Schatt and Podulka will begin serving their sentences on October 28 for the crypto-oriented fraud, while a restitution hearing has been set for October 7.

Newton noted that Ethereum could reach around $5,500 in September and $9,000 in early January. The bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum isn't limited to price predictions. The Fundstrat team argues that Ethereum could play a critical role in the decentralization of artificial intelligence (AI). Accordingly, the ETH network could provide the foundational infrastructure for areas like data collection commercialization, copyrights, loyalty programs, AI verification, and identity proofing. Related News: This Altcoin Announced a Major Update, Spiking Its Price Ethereum has also been described by analysts as “digital oil.” Citing ExxonMobil’s position as one of the largest companies in the S&P 500 between 1990 and 2018, Fundstrat argues that ETH could also emerge as a long-term leader in the financial system’s payment infrastructure with a similar valuation model. According to the analysis, if Bitcoin reaches $250,000 by the end of the year, Ethereum's price could fall between $12,000 and $22,000. In more ambitious scenarios, ETH could reach over $60,000, with a valuation that would replace the banking system's payment infrastructure. Newton’s technical analysis focuses on the short term: “$5,500 levels are possible in September, and $9,000 is on the agenda at the beginning of January.” *This is not investment advice.

51088042,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=797726,1756842931,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51088042.jpeg,SAP will invest over €20 billion in sovereign cloud infrastructure across Europe over 10 years,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sap-e20b-sovereign-cloud-europes-ai-future/,"SAP said Tuesday it will put more than €20 billion ($23.3 billion) into its sovereign cloud systems across Europe over the next 10 years. The German software firm is not just expanding its cloud tools; it’s also building something designed for AI and data control in the EU, no middlemen needed. Everything will sit inside Europe, from the hardware to the cloud services. SAP confirmed it will offer a new infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform so businesses can access computing power through SAP’s own network. These kinds of services are usually controlled by Microsoft or Amazon, but SAP is making a version that keeps everything local. There’s also a new on-site option. That means customers can install SAP-run infrastructure directly inside their own data centers. No one else handles it. No border-crossing involved. SAP adds local options to keep data inside Europe The reason behind this move is simple: EU laws. SAP said the whole goal is to store customer data inside the European Union, so it doesn’t break GDPR rules . “Innovation and sovereignty cannot be two separate things — it needs to come together,” said Thomas Saueressig, the SAP board member in charge of customer services and delivery. He was speaking during a virtual press event on Tuesday. Saueressig made it clear that European firms need full access to the latest tech, like artificial intelligence, but under strict control. He said they must have it “in a full sovereign context.” This push for sovereignty isn’t random. Over the past year, tech companies and governments have started to rethink their dependence on foreign systems. Tensions between countries have made it risky to rely on outside cloud platforms. Now, nations are trying to move key computing infrastructure back home. These are the servers and systems needed to train and run powerful AI tools. SAP isn’t alone here. Amazon and Microsoft have also announced their own sovereign cloud setups to keep European user data locked inside the EU. Everyone’s fighting for the same turf, but SAP’s pitch is different. It’s based in Europe. It already follows EU law. It doesn’t need to bend to U.S. regulations. The whole operation stays local. The European Commission is pushing hard on this. It made AI a top issue for the entire bloc. The Commission said Europe has been falling behind the U.S. and China in tech for years. So now they’re putting their own money on the line. Earlier this year, the Commission laid out a separate plan to throw €20 billion into AI gigafactories. These are massive sites filled with supercomputers, designed to build and run next-generation AI models from scratch. SAP confirmed it’s “closely” involved with that initiative. But it also said it won’t be the lead partner on the project. Just part of the buildout. Still, the overlap between cloud and AI is obvious. You need a secure local infrastructure to make AI safe and usable. You can’t build that if all your servers are sitting overseas. This is why Europe needs a sovereign cloud, not just for compliance, but to run its own AI systems. Get seen where it counts.

This ETH Meme Coin Is Set For Triple-Digit Gains",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-binance-coin-break-1000-in-september-this-eth-meme-coin-is-set-for-triple-digit-gains/,"Is BNB price prediction still topping your watch list? wondering if Binance Coin can actually hit that mythical $1,000 mark this September? While established giants like BNB continue their steady climb, the cryptocurrency world is abuzz about a new contender, a Layer 2-based ETH meme coin that analysts whisper could deliver triple-digit gains far quicker than its older peers. Get ready, because the old guard is about to face a serious challenge from Layer Brett ($LBRETT) . What sets Layer Brett apart from BNB and other meme coins? Forget the predictable swings tied to every new BNB price prediction for a moment. Where does true, explosive growth hide? Often, it’s in the best crypto presale opportunities, especially those that fix a fundamental blockchain problem. While Shiba Inu, Pepe, Dogecoin, Bonk, and even Brett (original) captivated the market with sheer meme power, they often struggled with the very networks they called home. High gas fees on Ethereum Layer 1, slow transactions: sound familiar? Layer Brett, the new kid on the block, changes the game entirely. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a Layer 2 blockchain, purpose-built on Ethereum for speed and efficiency. Imagine transactions hitting 10,000 TPS with fees as low as $0.01. That’s the reality, Layer Brett is engineering. Compare that to the often-congested Ethereum network that still burdens many altcoins and DeFi coins. While BNB offers its own ecosystem, Layer Brett is leveraging Ethereum’s security with Layer 2 scalability, making it a low-gas-fee crypto solution that’s truly designed for the future. The layer 2 advantage and why it matters for $LBRETT Ethereum Layer 2 solutions are projected to handle an astounding $10 trillion in annual transactions by 2027. This isn’t just a trend; it’s the inevitable evolution of Web3. Layer Brett isn’t just riding this wave; it’s aiming to be one of the top DeFi tokens within it. While Shiba Inu and Pepe rely on the underlying chain’s performance, $LBRETT, as an ERC-20 token on its own Layer 2 network, offers tangible utility from day one. It’s the next big crypto because it solves real-world blockchain problems while keeping that infectious meme coin energy. What does this mean for early adopters? Huge rewards, for one. Layer Brett offers an insane over 1,230% APY for staking right now. Yes, you read that correctly. These eye-watering staking crypto rewards are amplified precisely because of its efficient Layer 2 scaling. Unlike the massive market caps of Dogecoin, Bonk, or even Brett (original), Layer Brett, still in presale at $0.0053, presents a rare chance at 100x gains. Here’s why $LBRETT is capturing serious attention: Built on Layer 2 Ethereum: Unmatched speed and ultra-low gas fees. Massive Staking Rewards: Over 1,230% APY for early participants. Memecoin Energy, Real Utility: Not just hype, but tech-backed scalability. Community-First Approach: Active engagement and a $1 million giveaway. Why investors are watching $LBRETT, not just BNB While many are still focused on a potential BNB price prediction to reach $1,000, savvy investors are always on the lookout for the next 100x altcoin. BNB is a solid play, but parabolic moves typically come from low-cap crypto gems that combine innovation with a strong community. Layer Brett ticks both boxes. It’s an escape from the limitations of simple tokens, offering a comprehensive ecosystem with staking, token rewards, and plans for future crypto governance. Layer Brett is still in its crucial presale stages, available for early-entry pricing. The opportunity to get in on a potentially trending cryptocurrency with such a clear value proposition, especially compared to the more saturated markets of Dogecoin or Bonk, won’t last forever. Don’t miss the chance to be part of the Ethereum Layer 2 that memes truly deserve.

While popular ETH price predictions suggest an entrenched momentum even into the current market sentiment development, Mutuum Finance has gained wide recognition owing to its pioneering DeFi ecosystem and the increasing interest generated among community members. Already having exceeded the amount of capital raised of $15.25 million, in the ongoing presale campaign, MUTM has been able to amass over 15,950 investors, establishing itself not only as a speculative asset, but a probable disruptor for decentralised finance. Ethereum Price Prediction Ethereum is currently trading at $4,403 signalling a slight rebound after recent market volatility. Analysts point to a near-term support around $4,280, and keep an eye on institutional inflows accounting for overall market stability. Should this blast strength remain steady, ETH could inch closer to $5,000 in the coming months. At the same time, the investor demand is tending to become oriented toward emerging DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance, which reflects the wider spread of innovative momentum in the sector. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance at present is in presale Stage 6 with a unit price of $0.035. The next phase is expected to bring about a 14.29% price increase, moving the valuation of the tokens up to $0.04. To date, more than 15,950 investors are taking part in the presale which has raised a total of over $15.25 million in capital. The robust traction further emphasizes the confidence in the project’s strategic maneuvering and its value proposition within the decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Developing a Stable and Secure DeFi Platform Mutuum Finance is also developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Designed as a non-algorithmic, overcollateralized token, it aims to provide stability and security while avoiding the volatility often seen in algorithmic stablecoins that can de-peg during market turbulence. The Dual-Lending Edge Mutuum Finance’s most important strengths are derived from the yield produced via the inter-working and P2P -pronged twin-lending structure built into a responsive monetary gadget. Under Peer-to-Contract model, completely autonomous smart contracts perform lending operation autonomous of human activity. These contracts provide real-alignment of supply and demand through the creation of market data streams which are continuously generated by real-time wrangling of data and promptly presented to a faster process. Peer to Peer, on the other hand, provides a direct Bilateral interface to borrowers and lenders without the need for an intermediary. Yet this structure enables a negotiated pact that most closely ensures participants’ interests are met as per their limitations. Giving Decentralised Finance a Long Term Outlook Together, the bifurcated mechanism is versatile but also efficient, ensuring that the user can seamlessly move between person-to-person interactions, bilateral contractual agreements and fully automated contract supported lending. These core principles underlie a decentralised financial system that is not only scalable but also resistant to changes in the market dynamics and user requirements. Within this context, Mutuum Finance emerges as a public choice solution that is both clear, organisational-grade, institutional-grade, secure, and serves both organisational and individual stakeholders that focuses itself on the crypto’s future financial architecture. Mutuum Finance Guarantees Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched an official Bug Bounty Program reward pool $50,000 USDT. Four severities will be chosen. These include critical, major, minor, and low. The project is also hosting a $100,000 giveaway . 10 investors will be awarded $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens. Ethereum maintains stability near $4,403, yet the spotlight is increasingly shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM), where over $15.25 million has been raised from more than 15,950 participants. Presale Stage 6 – Tokens are priced at 0.035 USD during this stage. Based on the market dynamics that apply, we predict that this token’s price will go up 14.29%, increasing to $0.040 in the next round. Join the presale now to lock in early access before the price climbs and demand accelerates.

The popular token is trading above a key support area that it has repeatedly tested. If buyers continue to defend this structure, the top memecoin has room to rally higher. However, if the support fails, the bullish outlook could fade rapidly, leaving Dogecoin vulnerable to a deeper pullback. Dogecoin Price Holds Critical 0.5 Fibonacci Support According to the TradingView analyst, Dogecoin is consolidating just above the $0.214 level, which matches the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement and the ascending trendline support. The analyst described this support as a “make-or-break” zone for the Dogecoin price. If bulls can keep the price steady here, it may give them the strength to push higher. Related Reading: Crypto Adviser For The Ultra Wealthy Tells XRP Investors What To Do As Coins Turn To Real Money The 0.214 area is essential as it combines two key supports simultaneously: the Fibonacci 0.5 level and the rising trendline. According to the analyst, this means buyers must hold firm to keep control. The Stoch RSI indicator is also resetting in the middle zone, which shows the market has room for momentum in either direction. In simple terms, it signals that a bigger move could be coming soon, depending on whether buyers or sellers take control first. This zone is now watched closely by traders. Holding above it suggests that buyers are still in charge. Falling below it, however, would open the door for a deeper test of lower levels. Bounce Could Target $0.278, Breakdown Risks $0.197 The analyst notes that if bulls succeed in defending the 0.214 level, Dogecoin could bounce toward the $0.278 resistance zone. This level they described as a central horizontal supply zone, where sellers may attempt to halt the rally. Breaking past it would confirm strength from buyers and could drive fresh momentum into the market. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Bitcoin Price Will Break This Support Level, Can $100,000 Hold? The analyst cautions about the risks at play here. If the structure fails and price breaks down from the 0.214 area, the next necessary support lies near $0.197, known as the golden pocket. Falling under this level would cancel the bullish outlook and push the price toward the deeper retracement zone at $0.173. The analyst says that Dogecoin’s next direction depends on how the price reacts at this level. Bulls need to hold their ground if they want to trigger a run toward higher levels. Sellers, on the other hand, are waiting for any sign of weakness to lower prices. At this stage, Dogecoin stands at a decisive crossroads. Market watchers are keeping a close eye to see whether bulls can protect the structure and ignite the bounce toward higher resistance, or if sellers will seize control instead.

Policy Shift And IMF Deal Based on reports, the conference comes as El Salvador adjusts its approach to Bitcoin after signing an IMF agreement worth roughly $1.4 billion. Under terms publicized earlier this year, Bitcoin was removed as legal tender and merchant acceptance was made voluntary. At the same time, government statements and filings show officials have not abandoned Bitcoin entirely; rather, they appear to be reshaping how the state uses the asset. State Bitcoin Holdings And Security Reports have disclosed the country’s Bitcoin purchases continue. Officials have been buying at a steady clip—often described as about one coin per day—bringing total holdings to over 6,200 BTC. Some transfers and security moves have been public. Reserves were moved into multiple addresses and other steps were taken after worries about future cryptographic threats were raised. Those actions were described as efforts to protect state assets against emerging risks . Institutional Push And New Rules Analysts and local lawmakers point to a new regulatory frame that allows well-funded firms to register as crypto investment banks for sophisticated investors. The shift signals an intent to attract larger players, not just individual users. Conference themes listed by organizers include monetary independence, Lightning Network scaling and geothermal-powered mining, with a clear emphasis on technical and institutional topics rather than mass retail adoption. What The Conference Could Mean Observers say Bitcoin Histórico will serve two jobs at once: it will promote tourism and local commerce, and it will act as a signal to investors that El Salvador plans to keep Bitcoin in its national story while changing how the asset is used. The choice of the National Palace as a venue is symbolic. The timing—coming after the IMF deal and after public moves to bolster wallet security—adds weight to the message.

A massive whale transfer of 24,000 BTC worth over $300 million triggered cascading liquidations across major exchanges, wiping out more than $550 million in leveraged positions. Bitcoin plunged sharply, testing support levels near $108,000 before rebounding, while Ethereum and altcoins mirrored the turbulence. For many, it was a painful reminder of crypto’s volatility. Yet history consistently shows that such violent downturns often create some of the best entry points. Investors who position during crashes, rather than chasing euphoria, are often those who reap the most significant gains in the recovery. With fundamentals intact and institutional flows still strong, the current dip is being framed as a setup rather than a setback. Analysts are already pointing to specific altcoins as prime candidates to rebound aggressively – including Hedera, Solana, and a fast-rising presale contender, MAGACOIN FINANCE. Hedera Hashgraph Among the most resilient projects emerging from the chaos is Hedera. Known for its enterprise governance model, Hedera is backed by a council that includes major global corporations — from financial heavyweights to technology leaders. Its consensus mechanism, Hashgraph, allows the network to scale without sacrificing performance or security, giving it an advantage over older blockchains struggling with congestion. In the aftermath of the crash, Hedera’s metrics remain strong. RSI and MACD indicators both point to bullish momentum despite short-term volatility, while whale wallet activity shows accumulation rather than panic selling. What sets HBAR apart is its growing role in tokenization and real-world utility . From pilot programs for equities to identity verification solutions, Hedera is carving a place in institutional adoption. With tokenization forecasted to become a trillion-dollar market segment, Hedera’s unique structure positions it as a long-term survivor and a near-term rebound play. Investors seeking stability with growth potential after the crash will find HBAR a strong addition to portfolios. MAGACOIN FINANCE What makes this moment especially interesting is that alongside established projects, one emerging presale is capturing outsized attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE has surged to prominence with market cycle forecasts projecting up to 12,000% ROI , cementing its place among the top altcoin picks of 2025. In its presale stages, it has already raised more than $13 million from over 14,000 wallets, underlining both demand and community momentum. Unlike many speculative launches, MAGACOIN FINANCE has completed audits from HashEx and CertiK, a dual validation that provides rare transparency and credibility. Each presale phase has sold out rapidly, creating urgency as early entry opportunities narrow. Analysts highlight that this combination of scarcity, trust signals, and accelerating visibility makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand apart from typical meme-driven projects. With the presale tightening and attention intensifying, it is increasingly seen as one of the most legitimate breakout contenders for the next bull rally. Solana While MAGACOIN FINANCE captures speculative momentum, Solana remains one of the strongest large-cap alts to accumulate in the wake of the crash. Its architecture supports high-throughput, low-cost transactions , making it a natural choice for tokenized assets and decentralized trading platforms. In the past week alone, Solana has facilitated hundreds of millions in tokenized stock transactions, underscoring its role as a backbone for the coming wave of real-world asset adoption. Institutional flows into Solana remain notable despite volatility. Analysts point to steady developer activity and partnerships across fintech sectors as evidence that Solana is far from losing relevance. Historically, Solana has rebounded sharply from corrections, leveraging its reputation as a “Wall Street friendly” blockchain that combines efficiency with scalability. As markets recover, Solana’s blend of utility and adoption positions it for strong performance. For investors buying the dip, SOL is once again a frontrunner. Chainlink (LINK): market trust and adoption Another altcoin that commands attention after the crash is Chainlink. As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink bridges on-chain applications with real-world data, making it indispensable for DeFi and tokenization. Volatile markets often remind institutions of the need for reliable infrastructure – and Chainlink has delivered. Just last week, it announced a deeper partnership with ICE, parent of the New York Stock Exchange, extending its enterprise relevance. On-chain activity for LINK has been equally impressive. In the last 48 hours, new top wallets accumulated $27 million worth of LINK , while nearly 10,000 new wallets were created. Such accumulation during a downturn signals confidence rather than fear. Chainlink’s critical role in connecting traditional finance to blockchain-based systems gives it both short-term rebound potential and long-term structural importance. In moments of uncertainty, assets with entrenched utility like LINK often lead the recovery wave. Conclusion: resilience and asymmetric upside Crypto crashes are never easy, but they often separate speculative froth from genuine opportunity. The latest downturn, sparked by whale activity and amplified by leveraged liquidations, has reset valuations across the board. For investors with discipline, it has also created openings. HBAR offers enterprise-grade resilience, Solana provides scalability and tokenization power, and Chainlink delivers trusted infrastructure. Alongside them, MAGACOIN FINANCE – with over $13 million raised, dual HashEx and CertiK audits, and forecasts for a staggering 12,000% ROI – stands as a unique high-reward play tightening its presale access window. Together, these four narratives capture the balance between stability and asymmetry, offering a roadmap for rebuilding portfolios in the wake of this market reset.

Yesterday, whispers of an exploit on Venus Protocol sent shockwaves across X. At first, some thought the lending protocol itself had been breached. But hours of joint analysis cleared the air, Venus wasn’t hacked. Instead, a phishing attack snared a whale, draining $27 million in assets with one bad transaction. This wasn’t a protocol failure. It was human error. And it’s a stark reminder of DeFi’s biggest weakness: one careless click can wipe out a fortune. The victim approved a malicious transaction from a fake site. That single signature gave the attacker’s burner wallet, 0x7fd8…202a, unlimited access to his tokens. Once approval was granted, the attacker struck instantly. Assets vanished in seconds. According to Cyvers Alerts ALERT27M suspicious transaction has been detected involving a user of @VenusProtocol on the #BNBChain The user unknowingly approved a malicious transaction, granting token permissions that resulted in the loss of $27M in digital assets. The stolen funds are currently held… pic.twitter.com/WekHEicyec — Cyvers Alerts (@CyversAlerts) September 2, 2025 And, here’s what got drained: $19.8M vUSDT $7.15M vUSDC $146K vXRP $22K vETH Even 285 BTCB on BNB Chain Generational wealth gone. Just like that. The Wild Part: Venus Was Never Hacked Venus Protocol confirmed on X Update: we are in direct contact with the victim of the phishing attack, and the protocol will remain paused while we try to recover his funds. Venus was not exploited, but we are committed to protecting our users. If the protocol resumes now, the hacker gets the user's funds. https://t.co/441ncPEbla — Venus Protocol (@VenusProtocol) September 2, 2025 that their contracts were safe. The frontend? Fine. No smart contract vulnerabilities. No code exploits. This was pure social engineering. A fake link, a trusted click, and boom, open approvals did the rest. That’s the dark side of DeFi power. Unlimited token approvals make DeFi seamless and fast. But they also turn every wallet into a ticking time bomb if approvals fall into the wrong hands. Community Reaction: Shock and Sympathy Crypto Twitter lit up with reactions. Some expressed sympathy for the whale; others saw it as another warning. A Venus Protocol user just lost $27M in a single click. Here’s what happened: They approved a shady transaction, unknowingly giving unlimited access to their tokens. Attacker’s burner wallet (0x7fd8…202a) didn’t waste a second, assets got drained instantly. We’re talking… pic.twitter.com/PVZmqJSXC0 — Crypto Jargon (@Crypto_Jargon) September 2, 2025 He noted how attackers patiently wait for one careless moment. The phishing link likely circulated for days before the victim clicked. Venus Protocol has since paused parts of the platform while working directly with the victim. Recovery options remain slim, but efforts are ongoing. Why Phishing Keeps Winning in DeFi DeFi removes middlemen. That’s the beauty, and the danger. You hold the keys. You sign the transactions. There’s no customer support if things go wrong. Phishers exploit this perfectly: Fake sites copy real ones pixel-for-pixel. Twitter bots reply under official announcements with “urgent” links. Unlimited approvals mean attackers only need access once. In TradFi, banks can reverse fraudulent transfers. In DeFi, blockchain immutability means once assets leave your wallet, they’re gone. Lessons Learned: How to Stay Safe The Venus incident highlights simple but critical safety steps: 1. Don’t trust random links. Always type URLs manually or bookmark official sites. 2. Double-check every transaction. Read approvals before signing, infinite token access is risky. 3. Revoke old approvals regularly. Tools like Revoke.cash make it easy. 4. Use hardware wallets. They add a physical confirmation step attackers can’t bypass. Phishers thrive in bull markets when wallets grow fat. They know greed kills caution. Don’t give them an opening. The Bigger Picture: Social Engineering vs. Smart Contracts This attack shows where DeFi risks really lie. Smart contracts are getting stronger. Protocol exploits, while still happening, are down compared to 2021-22. Humans, on the other hand, remain the weakest link. Phishers don’t need to hack code when they can hack trust. A fake MetaMask popup. A Twitter link promising “airdrops.” One moment of distraction can cost millions. Security experts argue education matters more than new tech here. Wallet UX improvements, clearer approval warnings, and better scam detection could help. But ultimately, self-custody comes with self-responsibility. Will Funds Be Recovered? Venus Protocol confirmed communication with the victim. Recovery efforts are on, but realistically, funds drained to attacker-controlled wallets rarely come back. Sometimes, attackers negotiate for ransom-like returns, but there’s no sign of that yet. The assets may get mixed through bridges and mixers soon, making tracing harder. Final Thoughts: A Wake-Up Call for DeFi Users This wasn’t just another exploit headline. It’s a reminder that DeFi security starts with the user. Protocols can be bulletproof. Audits can pass. But one bad click can still drain millions. As the bull market heats up, expect more phishing attempts. More fake airdrops. More Twitter bots with urgent links. Don’t be the next headline. Double-check. Revoke often. Stay paranoid. Because in DeFi, you only learn this lesson once. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

However, most eyes are now turning to a newly launched token seen as a bigger opportunity. Speculation grows over whether this fresh project can outpace XRP’s potential, drawing attention away from the established coin and stirring curiosity about what makes the newcomer stand out. XRP (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP hovers near $2.8 inside the $2.67-$2.98 band. Price slipped 1.84% in the past week after edging up 1.15% over the month and climbing 11.99% across six months. The broader view still leans positive despite the latest dip. The 10-day average stands at $2.77 while the 100-day average sits at $2.81, so the coin is glued to its trend line. A strength reading of 57 shows steady demand, yet a fast momentum score near 97 hints the market may cool. If sellers press, the nearest floor is $2.56, about 8% below. A deeper slide could touch $2.24, roughly 18% down. If buyers regroup, the first ceiling is $3.19, a 12% jump. Clearing that could open a path to $3.51, around 24% above today. The mild upward drift in recent averages favors this route, though price may first ping-pong between $2.56 and $3.19 before any larger move. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.005 Next Stage: $0.01 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Conclusion XRP eyes $5 as momentum expands , yet excitement shifts to XYZVerse; the first all-sport memecoin targets 20,000% gains with community power, sports partnerships, and GameFi plans, shaping a cultural movement.

While Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) remain household names in the space, a new entrant, Layer Brett ($LBRETT), is drawing serious attention. Analysts are debating whether these established tokens can reclaim their past highs or if fresh projects are set to lead the next big breakout. Pepe Coin price outlook Pepe Coin became one of the standout tokens of 2023 after turning small bets into millions during its first explosive run. At present, PEPE trades near $0.000009809, well below its peak levels but still supported by an active community. Traders highlight that meme coins at this price range can move quickly, with even modest rallies translating into sharp percentage gains. Analysts say PEPE will need a resurgence in volume to reach cycle highs again. If broader market sentiment turns bullish, forecasts point to a potential run back toward its all-time high zone. Without fresh catalysts, though, PEPE risks spending more time consolidating before any meaningful breakout. Shiba Inu cycle prediction Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the most recognized meme coins, with over 1 million holders and strong exchange listings worldwide. After reaching a peak of $0.00008616 in 2021, SHIB has struggled to regain momentum. Its Layer 2 solution, Shibarium, was designed to improve scalability and reduce fees, but recent on-chain data shows a steep drop in daily transactions. That said, SHIB’s token burns and active community give it long-term staying power. Analysts expect SHIB to remain a top meme coin in terms of visibility and liquidity, but the likelihood of another 100x run appears much smaller compared to its early years. Price predictions for the next cycle suggest a possible climb to $0.00003–$0.00004 if sentiment improves, still far from its former peak but enough for solid percentage gains. Why Layer Brett is being tipped as the next leader The project attracting the most buzz now is Layer Brett ($LBRETT). Unlike older meme tokens, it is being built on Ethereum Layer 2, offering faster speeds and ultra-low fees. This infrastructure gives it a technical edge while still embracing the meme-driven culture that powers community growth. The token is in presale at $0.0053, with early investors gaining access to staking rewards in the thousands of percent APY. Analysts argue this setup has created strong momentum, with both retail buyers and whales getting involved. Importantly, $LBRETT has a roadmap that includes NFT tie-ins, gamified staking, and cross-chain expansion. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens, scarcity is built into its design. Many traders now compare Layer Brett to the early days of Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu, but with stronger scalability from launch. If presale energy carries into listings, some forecasts suggest the project could deliver 100x to 200x returns, potentially surpassing both SHIB and PEPE in the next bull cycle. Final thoughts Both Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu are expected to remain key players in the meme coin market heading into 2025. PEPE offers low entry points with high-risk potential, while SHIB benefits from its massive community and established position. But with presale momentum, Ethereum Layer 2 backing, and staking incentives, Layer Brett is emerging as the meme coin that could capture the next wave of speculative demand. For investors weighing the cycle top price predictions, the choice may be between established tokens with moderate upside or a new entrant with the potential to surpass them both.

Institutional demand for altcoins extends beyond U.S. regulatory narratives, with XRP emerging as a core part of Gumi’s blockchain growth plan. In an August 29 X statement , the firm confirmed the purchase of 2.5 million Yen in XRP tokens. Gumi X post translated into English. Notably, this move follows the closure of the Ripple SEC case, a 5-year-long headwind that had sidelined demand from investors waiting on regulatory clarity. Gumi’s crypto treasury now holds both Bitcoin and XRP, following parent company SBI Holdings’ close ties with Ripple and its focus on cross-border payments. The strategy forms a two-pillar approach: Bitcoin as a universal store of value and source of staking yields, and XRP as a utility token powering remittances and liquidity services. This marks a broader corporate trend, as non-financial firms begin integrating crypto into treasuries, positioning XRP for deeper adoption as digital assets enter mainstream balance sheets. Broader acceptance could stretch even further, laying the groundwork for XRP to one day feature in digital asset reserves at the sovereign level. XRP Price Prediction: Could Institutional Adoption Push New Highs? Continued institutional adoption of XRP on a global scale could help realise the breakout of a bull flag pattern forming since mid-July. XRP / USD 1-day chart, bull flag nears apex. Source: TradingView. The consolidation forming the flag now nears its apex as momentum indicators flash early reversal signs, setting the stage for a potential continuation of the early July rally. The RSI is climbing from the 30s, now at 44, and heading toward the neutral line, suggesting buy pressure is quietly building. More so, the MACD line is en route to form a golden cross, surpassing the signal line for the first time since July with its recent rebound from $2.73. On the daily timeframe, this often indicates the start of a new uptrend. If fully realized, the flag could see XRP reclaim its June high and push toward the $5 target, a potential 75% gain from current levels. But as the bull market matures, momentum could carry further. With deeper TradFi integration via 401(k) exposure, corporate treasuries, and potential spot ETFs, XRP could extend to $10 — a 250% move.

This aggressive accumulation strategy solidifies its position as one of the world’s leading corporate Bitcoin holders. Strengthening Its Long-Term Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Metaplanet, a publicly traded company based in Japan, has successfully transitioned from a hotel operator to a major Bitcoin powerhouse. The company recently purchased 1,009 BTC, which increased its total holdings to 20,000 BTC. This acquisition cements its position as the sixth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, surpassing Riot Platforms. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Race Heats Up As Dutch Firm Shoots For $23-M Launch A crypto-oriented social media influencer known as Next100XGEMS has stated on X that what makes this achievement more significant is that the investment reflects more than just a financial play. However, it represents a fundamental shift in its core business strategy. By dedicating a significant portion of its treasury to Bitcoin, Metaplanet demonstrates a profound level of institutional trust in the digital asset as a long-term strategic reserve, which marks a new era of institutional adoption. Metaplanet’s 21 million plan is a bold, long-term strategy to combat the decline in the value of the Japanese yen and rising inflation. The company aims to acquire a significant portion of the total 21 million Bitcoin supply, positioning itself as a hedge against currency debasement. This strategic use of BTC as a currency protection tool highlights its growing appeal as an alternative to traditional fiat currencies, a trend that is becoming increasingly popular globally. The remarkable 486.7% year-to-date yield from this investment showcases the immense potential and could serve as a model for businesses and organizations around the world, prompting them to reassess their own treasury management approaches. This development is expected to drive increased demand for Bitcoin, further fueling its price growth and solidifying its role in the emerging financial system. Institutional Flows Fuel Bullish Momentum As institutional demand for Bitcoin accelerates and market infrastructure strengthens, CryptoBusy has revealed that September has long been considered a historically weak month for Bitcoin. Data shows that the median return sits at -3.12% with 8 of the last 12 years ending in the red. However, 2025 is shaping up to be fundamentally different. Related Reading: $40M Bitcoin Treasury Launch Marks South Korea’s First Institutional Crypto Move The landscape has shifted significantly. ETFs are now live, institutional inflows are accelerating, and the US has openly embraced Bitcoin. These factors have transformed the usual bearish September narrative into a potentially bullish setup. Last year, September 2024 closed with a green candle at +7.29% despite the seasonal headwinds. With Bitcoin having already printed a new all-time high of $124,000 earlier in this cycle, the market is poised to see if 2025 will mark the first ETF-driven September Rally.

Altcoins are where innovation and speculation collide, creating conditions for rapid upside moves. In every past cycle, a handful of smaller projects have outpaced the giants by staggering margins, and analysts believe 2025 will be no exception. Already, traders are rotating capital toward assets that bring something unique: technical scalability, cultural firepower, or audited legitimacy. SEI has emerged as a frontrunner in the infrastructure race, FARTCOIN has captured attention as a meme-driven sensation, and analysts are also spotlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has begun to attract serious recognition as one of the year’s most legitimate breakout opportunities. SEI shows infrastructure strength SEI has built a reputation as one of the most promising Layer-1 blockchains in the current market. Unlike networks that struggle under high usage, SEI was designed from the ground up to handle trading and DeFi applications with speed and resilience. It offers ultra-fast block times and finality that makes it competitive with leading chains while avoiding the congestion issues that have hindered others in past bull markets. Analysts highlight that SEI’s model positions it as a critical backbone for the next generation of decentralized exchanges and derivatives platforms. Institutional attention has followed, particularly across Asia, where partnerships and integrations suggest SEI could secure lasting adoption. Developers are increasingly deploying apps to the network, fueling demand for its token. MAGACOIN FINANCE brings the explosion What makes this cycle even more compelling is the rise of projects combining credibility, scarcity, and retail momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly established itself here, standing out after passing both HashEx and CertiK audits, a dual seal of trust that is rare among new launches. Its presale stages sold out rapidly, highlighting retail demand and a tightening window for early access. With bold forecasts of up to 50x returns , it is being recognized as one of the most legitimate crypto launches of 2025, capturing both analyst attention and investor excitement. FARTCOIN rides meme momentum If SEI represents technical strength and MAGACOIN FINANCE brings credibility, FARTCOIN is trying to become the cycle’s cultural wildcard. Meme coins have a track record of catching investors off guard, transforming humor and community energy into gains. Dogecoin began as a parody but grew into a multibillion-dollar asset, while Shiba Inu became one of the biggest winners of the last bull cycle. Its playful branding masks a surprisingly organized community, which has proven capable of sustaining hype and liquidity. FARTCOIN’s ability to trend consistently has made it difficult to ignore, and with meme coins already rotating back into favor, its timing is near perfect. Market dynamics set the stage The interplay between these three narratives – infrastructure, meme culture, and legitimacy – highlights the diversity of opportunities available in 2025. Investors no longer need to choose between betting on technology or speculation; instead, portfolios can blend both. SEI offers a strong foundation for those who believe adoption of high-speed decentralized trading will explode. FARTCOIN embodies the cultural power of meme investing, which has repeatedly minted fortunes in past cycles. MAGACOIN FINANCE introduces a rare third element : the security of dual audits and the scarcity of a fast-moving presale, making it one of the most trusted new entrants of this bull market. Liquidity cycles suggest capital will continue rotating across these categories. When infrastructure projects stabilize, traders often shift into meme tokens, and when speculative assets cool, attention moves back to credible launches. This rhythm has already begun, with whales spreading positions across multiple sectors in anticipation of strong second-half performance. Analysts emphasize that the biggest returns usually occur before the market peaks, meaning the window to position early is shrinking. Conclusion: three paths to potential 50x The bull market is once again delivering on its reputation for outsized opportunities. SEI provides the infrastructure narrative, FARTCOIN captures the meme-driven mania, and MAGACOIN FINANCE, backed by completed HashEx and CertiK audits, rapid presale sellouts, and growing analyst recognition, stands as one of the most legitimate launches of 2025. Together, these projects demonstrate how scalability, cultural energy, and audited legitimacy can combine to create the type of conditions where 50x returns are possible before the bull market ends. For investors willing to embrace diversification across these narratives, the remainder of 2025 could prove transformative.

51089991,572071,1756846852,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51089991.jpeg,"Galaxy Digital Deposits 500,000 Solana ($103M) To Coinbase In 5 Days – Details",https://bitcoinist.com/galaxy-digital-deposits-500000-solana-103m-coinbase/,"Solana (SOL) has been one of the strongest performers in the altcoin space since April, sustaining a bullish yet volatile uptrend that has captured investor attention. While many altcoins have struggled with breakdowns and heavy selling pressure, Solana has managed to hold firm, showing relative strength despite broader market uncertainty. Still, the momentum is being tested as SOL approaches critical resistance levels that could determine its next major move. Some analysts caution that Solana may face profit-taking and pullbacks in the near term, with price potentially dropping to lower support zones before any sustained rally can resume. The combination of technical resistance and increasing volatility makes this a decisive moment for traders watching whether Solana can break higher or consolidate further. Adding to the uncertainty, onchain data reveals that Galaxy Digital recently transferred a massive amount of Solana to Coinbase, sparking speculation about potential institutional profit-taking. While these inflows don’t necessarily confirm selling, they often signal preparation for liquidity events. Massive Solana Transfer Sparks Speculation According to Lookonchain, Galaxy Digital has deposited 500,000 SOL (worth approximately $103 million) to Coinbase over the past five days, raising eyebrows across the market. Such a large transfer by a major institutional player is often interpreted as preparation for liquidity events, whether that means hedging, profit-taking, or reallocating capital into other assets. While the exact motivation remains uncertain, the move comes at a time when Solana is testing critical resistance levels, making market participants more cautious. This development has fueled speculation that Solana may move toward lower price levels in the near term. Some analysts argue that institutions may be locking in gains after SOL’s strong performance since April, when the token began its bullish uptrend. Others suggest that capital could be rotating into Ethereum or alternative large-cap projects, given the recent surge in whale accumulation of ETH. At the same time, broader market conditions add to the uncertainty. With Bitcoin struggling to reclaim momentum and Ethereum consolidating around demand levels, many analysts see the crypto market as a whole entering a sideways consolidation phase. If that outlook proves correct, Solana could face continued profit-taking pressure as traders look to secure gains before the next major leg up. Despite these headwinds, Solana’s resilience throughout recent volatility highlights its underlying strength as a network and investment vehicle. The coming weeks will be crucial to see whether Galaxy Digital’s transfer marks the beginning of broader institutional selling or simply a short-term adjustment within a longer bullish trend. Price Analysis: Testing A Pivotal Zone Solana is currently trading around $203.33, showing resilience despite ongoing market volatility. The chart highlights a bullish structure that has been developing since the lows of May 2025, when SOL traded near $120. Since then, the token has steadily climbed, reclaiming key moving averages and now testing the critical $200–$220 resistance range. This area has historically acted as a major barrier, marking both local tops and heavy selling zones in past cycles. The 50-day moving average is trending above the 100-day and 200-day MAs, a bullish sign confirming Solana’s medium-term strength. However, the price is struggling to close convincingly above $210, indicating that sellers are still active at higher levels. Profit-taking behavior, also noted in recent on-chain data, adds weight to this resistance. If SOL manages to break above $220 with strong volume, the next upside targets could open toward $240 and $260, levels last seen during its 2024 rally. Conversely, failure to hold above $200 may invite a pullback toward $180 or even $165, aligning with the 100-day MA and past demand zones.

In a stark shift from the hesitant, risk-averse stance of the previous administration, the regulators appointed by President Donald Trump — an avowed advocate of the industry and a growing crypto magnate though his family's business operations — have quickly cleared a wide path for digital assets to get into the existing financial regulator system. The SEC, until last year run by crypto skeptic Gary Gensler, and the CFTC ""are coordinating efforts to facilitate the trading of certain spot crypto asset products on registered exchanges,"" according to the Tuesday statement . Under the SEC's ""Project Crypto"" and the CFTC's ongoing ""crypto sprint,"" their leaders are pushing to meet Trump's orders to set up the U.S. as the world's leading crypto hub. The agencies argue their view that CFTC-registered designated contract markets (DCMs), foreign board of trade (FBOTs) and SEC-registered national securities exchanges (NSEs) ""are not prohibited from facilitating the trading of certain spot crypto asset products."" The SEC and CFTC are inviting such entities to contact staff to figure out how to move forward . ""Market participants should have the freedom to choose where they trade spot crypto assets,"" said SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, in a statement. His counterpart at the CFTC, Acting Chairman Caroline Pham, called the joint statement ""the latest demonstration of our mutual objective of supporting growth and development in these markets, but it will not be the last.” The Tuesday statement didn't detail specific cryptocurrencies beyond citing ""certain spot crypto asset products."" The markets watchdogs said they ""are prepared to engage with trading venues about applying fair and orderly market principles as they seek to operate markets for participants to trade spot crypto asset products."" As the agencies seek to use existing regulations and authorities to open the financial system to crypto, Congress has been working on a sweeping set of crypto market rules that the industry is counting on to fully establish it in the U.S. It's unclear, though, how long the lawmakers might take getting that legislation to Trump's desk. One of the main holes in previous U.S. oversight of crypto has been the CFTC's lack of authority to fully regulate firms trading on the crypto commodity spot market — where actual assets are directly changing hands.

This isn’t just another free token. Midnight is Cardano’s new privacy-focused sidechain , built to enable anonymous transactions and smart contract deployment for sensitive, real-world applications like medical records, financial data, and identity systems . With the Token Generation Event (TGE) approaching, $NIGHT could mark a turning point for the ADA ecosystem, opening the door to massive utility and renewed market momentum. $NIGHT tokens will be distributed to investors who held more than $100 worth of BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, ADA, BNB, AVAX, or BAT. However, different percentages of the total supply that will be distributed will be allocated to each of these tokens. The Glacier Drop – the name of the claim period of the Midnight airdrop – started on August 5. You can visit the airdrop’s official website and connect your wallet to see if you are eligible. In case you are, just follow the instructions provided on the site to make your claim. Once the claim period ends on October 4 , eligible users will begin redeeming their $NIGHT tokens in tranches over a 360-day period , gradually unlocking their allocation. To participate, users must create a new Cardano wallet , a move that could significantly boost the number of daily active users on the network. This influx of new wallets and first-time interactions with the Cardano ecosystem may strengthen a bullish Cardano price prediction , as millions of crypto investors gain direct exposure to ADA during the redemption phase. Cardano Price Prediction: Support Bounces Could Ignite Strong Rally to $1.25 Cardano has hit a key trend line support today and could bounce strongly off this level in the next few days. Trading volumes confirm the relevance of this price zone as more than $1 billion worth of $ADA were traded yesterday after two days of relatively low trading activity. If the price action breaks above the rising wedge shown in the chart, this could ignite a strong rally toward $1.25 first and then to $2, offering an upside potential of 144% for $ADA in the near term. If the price breaks below the current trend line support , it may still find a strong rebound at the 200-day EMA around $0.75 – a level that could trap bears and trigger a fresh rally to the upside. The Midnight airdrop ranks among the most anticipated events of the year, alongside the breakout launch of Pepenode ($PEPENODE) – the first meme coin mining game in crypto. Just days after going live, this mine-to-earn (M2E) project has already raised over $500,000 , as investors rush to secure early access to its innovative crypto mining game. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Lets Users Create Virtual Servers to Mine Meme Coins Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is a new mine-to-earn (M2E) crypto game that lets users deploy virtual servers and stack mining rigs – all powered by this fast-rising meme coin. The more $PEPENODE you hold, the more rigs you can activate – and the more tokens you’ll mine over time. Top miners are also rewarded with popular meme coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN , distributed from the project’s reward pool. No hardware, no technical setup – just buy $PEPENODE, build your virtual rig, and start mining right away. Funds raised in the presale will go directly toward building out the full blockchain-based game, where $PEPENODE serves as the native utility token. As word spreads about the game’s potential profitability, demand for the token could skyrocket. To get in early at the discounted presale price , visit the official Pepenode website , connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ), and invest using ETH, USDT, or a bank card .

The decision marks ETHZilla’s first direct integration with DeFi infrastructure. The firm seeks to generate higher yields on its holdings while strengthening Ethereum’s network security. ETHZilla Leverages EtherFi to Unlock Yield on ETH Holdings Executive Chairman McAndrew Rudisill described the shift as a “strategic evolution” in treasury management. “By deploying $100 million into liquid restaking, we’re reinforcing Ethereum’s security while unlocking incremental yield opportunities to enhance returns on our treasury holdings. Partnering with EtherFi marks a pivotal step in our engagement with DeFi,” Rudisill said in the release. Breaking ETHZilla news Today, we are excited to announce that we will deploy ~$100 million worth of our ETH holdings into the @ether_fi restaking protocol. This marks our first engagement with DeFi protocols but it certainly won't be our last! pic.twitter.com/PrVleYWWr3 — ETHZilla (@ETHZilla_ETHZ) September 2, 2025 The allocation represents a portion of ETHZilla’s 102,246 ETH reserves, valued at approximately $456 million as of August 31. In addition to its crypto holdings, the company maintains $221 million in cash equivalents and has more than 166 million shares outstanding. According to data from the company’s capital summaries, ETHZilla aggressively expanded its Ethereum position through August, acquiring over 20,000 ETH at an average purchase price of $3,949. EtherFi, the protocol selected for the investment, offers enhanced yield through restaking, a process that allows staked ETH to be rehypothecated into additional security layers and services beyond Ethereum’s core validation. Mike Silagadze, founder and CEO of EtherFi, called ETHZilla’s entry a watershed moment. “Their commitment highlights the growing institutional confidence in decentralized protocols and showcases a unique method of bridging traditional finance with the Ethereum ecosystem,” Silagadze said. The move follows ETHZilla’s rebranding from 180 Life Sciences Corp. in late July, when the company pivoted to digital assets and adopted Ethereum as its central treasury reserve. Backed by more than 60 institutional and crypto-native investors, the firm announced plans to raise $425 million through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, supplemented by $150 million in potential debt securities. Proceeds from the financing have been earmarked for ETH acquisitions, treasury operations, and transaction costs. ETHZilla’s treasury strategy is managed in partnership with Electric Capital, which is overseeing an on-chain yield program intended to outperform standard ETH staking. The company has stated that its broader plan involves a mix of lending, liquidity provisioning, and structured agreements, designed to balance yield optimization with risk controls. ETHZilla Evolves Into Educator and Investor as Ethereum Restaking Gains Traction ETHZilla recently canceled 1.3 million outstanding shares held by Elray Resources in a $1 million settlement, streamlining its capital structure as it deepens its focus on crypto. The move follows its broader push to position itself not only as an investor but also as an educator. Its “Ethereum School” publishes weekly lessons on monetary policy and staking economics, with recent material emphasizing how Ethereum’s fee burn and issuance model have reduced net annual issuance since the 2022 Merge to just 0.139%, showing its deflationary potential. Announcing ETHZilla's Ethereum School Every Friday, ETHZilla will teach you something that you may not know about Ethereum. Today's lesson: Ethereum's monetary policy.

Total value locked in Ethereum protocols has climbed to $30 billion , driven by validators shifting away from native staking. EtherFi leads the sector in TVL, ahead of Eigenpie by offering users restaking yields via EigenLayer. Corporate demand for Ether remains strong. According to SER data , Tom Lee’s BitMine holds about 1.8 million ETH, while Joe Lubin’s SharpLink ranks second with 837,000 ETH. SharpLink added 39,008 ETH between August 25 and 31 at an average price of $4,531, raising its treasury value to $3.6 billion.

SHIB has managed to attract dip-buying interest thanks to technical support and ecosystem upgrades, while DOGE continues to face headwinds from whale profit-taking and sector-wide risk aversion. Together, their performance highlights the fragile sentiment across meme coins as traders weigh technical levels against broader market flows. SHIB Holds Support, Eyes Resistance Shiba Inu found support near $0.000012, aligning with its 30-day SMA ($0.000012755). Indicators show selling pressure easing: MACD histogram reflects slowing bearish momentum. RSI (43.39) avoided oversold territory, suggesting stabilization. What this means: Short-term traders are exploiting oversold conditions, but resistance at $0.000013236 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement) remains a challenge. What to watch: A daily close above $0.000013 could unlock momentum toward $0.000014, while failure to break resistance risks renewed downside. Shibarium Ecosystem Upgrade Fundamentals also support SHIB’s resilience. On August 29, the Shib Alpha Layer beta launched, enabling faster transactions and multi-asset gas payments. This Layer-3 solution is designed to simplify blockchain interactions and broaden SHIB’s utility. What this means: By addressing scalability and usability, Shibarium could draw developers and fuel new applications. Historically, milestones such as surpassing 1.4B transactions have aligned with SHIB price rallies, making ecosystem growth a catalyst to watch. DOGE Faces Technical Weakness Dogecoin, meanwhile, remains under pressure. Prices sit below both the 7-day ($0.2165) and 30-day ($0.2222) SMAs, while indicators lean bearish: MACD histogram: -0.00194. RSI-14: 45.18, close to oversold but lacking reversal signals. Losing $0.23 triggered bearish sentiment, turning the $0.214–$0.222 zone into resistance. Critical support now lies at $0.20–$0.195. What to watch: A break below $0.20 could accelerate declines toward the 200-day SMA ($0.1977). DOGE’s decline has been exacerbated by whale selling. In early August, Dogecoin suffered over $3M in liquidations during a 5% drop to $0.195. Whale wallets dumped about 310M DOGE near $0.23, reinforcing resistance at that level. Diverging Paths in Meme Coin Sentiment SHIB and DOGE are moving in different directions. SHIB shows resilience, holding above support while ecosystem upgrades add a bullish narrative. If buyers can push above $0.000013 resistance, momentum could carry it higher. DOGE, however, faces technical breakdowns and persistent whale selling, with $0.20 support now the last major defense before deeper corrections. Outset PR: Clarity Beyond Market Noise Just as SHIB and DOGE face uncertainty from technical levels and whale actions, crypto projects themselves must navigate unpredictable markets with precision. This is where Outset PR, founded by strategist Mike Ermolaev, delivers an edge. Outset PR operates like a hands-on workshop, designing campaigns tailored to each project’s stage, goals, and market context. Instead of mass-blast outreach, it emphasizes performance-based media selection, choosing outlets based on discoverability, domain authority, and viral potential, while timing narratives to maximize impact. The agency’s proprietary traffic acquisition technology is a standout, blending editorial coverage with SEO and lead-generation tactics. This approach has generated results far beyond standard PR. For instance, ChangeNOW achieved a 40% boost in customer reach after Outset amplified coverage with a Google Discover campaign. In a space where PR often feels like a black box, Outset PR delivers C-level clarity, turning communications into a measurable growth engine. For web3 projects this kind of data-driven, insight-backed storytelling ensures visibility and trust are sustained even when markets turn volatile.

ChatGPT 5 relance le x1000,https://bitcoinist.com/fortune-crypto-chatgpt5-x1000/,"Et si l’IA remettait une pièce dans la machine à rêves crypto ? Avec l’arrivée de ChatGPT 5, les discussions repartent de plus belle sur X et Discord. Le fameux x1000 ; transformer 1 000 € en 1 million, serait-il encore possible en 2025 ? L’IA alimente le buzz avec des scénarios qui rappellent l’âge d’or des meme coins et des ICO fulgurantes. Cependant derrière l’euphorie, les réalités du marché n’hésitent pas à nous rappeler à l’ordre. Pendant que certains dénoncent un fantasme dangereux , d’autres voient dans ce débat une opportunité : repérer les projets capables de dépasser le simple effet spéculatif. À ce jeu là Bitcoin Hyper, Token 6900 et Best Wallet Token rêvent de rafler la mise. Le buzz ChatGPT 5 réveille le fantasme du x1000 Depuis son arrivée, ChatGPT 5 ne se limite pas au code ou à la rédaction : il est aussi devenu un outil pour bâtir des stratégies d’investissement. L’IA brasse données, historiques et signaux de marché pour imaginer des scénarios où certains tokens s’envolent façon fusée. De là est née une avalanche de contenus viraux pointant vers de prétendues “pépites” prêtes à exploser. Mais il faut garder les pieds sur terre : aussi brillante soit-elle, l’IA n’efface pas les fondamentaux. Elle peut aiguiller, pas remplacer l’analyse de marché ni la gestion des risques . Entre rêve et réalité : ce que disent les investisseurs Les traders expérimentés tempèrent : oui, il y a toujours des projets capables de faire x50, x100, voire plus . Mais la probabilité d’un x1000 reste infime. La clé, rappellent-ils, c’est d’identifier les cryptos qui combinent narratif fort, tokenomics bien calibrés et adoption réelle . Ceux qui ont ce cocktail possèdent en général les meilleures préventes du marché. Là-dessus, certains projets récents attirent déjà les regards, loin des simples prédictions d’IA. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) : Un Layer 2 pour propulser Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper veut repousser les limites de Bitcoin . Plus rapide, plus flexible, programmable mais sans jamais sacrifier sa sécurité légendaire. Une sacrée mission. Pour la réussir, le projet s’appuie sur un Layer 2 original qui intègre la Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) et permet de lancer des smart contracts à grande vitesse et à faible coût directement sur l’infrastructure Bitcoin . Côté chiffres, la presale a déjà récolté plus de 12,7 millions de dollars , avec un prix actuel d’environ 0,0128 $ . L’offre totale est volontairement limitée, ce qui crée un effet de rareté qui attire autant les spéculateurs que les investisseurs long terme. Les fonds sont placés de manière ultra stratégiques : développement, sécurité, marketing et liquidité. De quoi poser des bases solides dès le départ . Bitcoin Hyper marie la solidité du réseau Bitcoin et l’agilité de Solana . Cette altcoin season qui s’annonce explosive, ce projet pourrait bien s’imposer comme l’un des plus stratégiques de 2025 . Achetez maintenant $HYPER ! Token6900 ($T6900) : L’ICO qui attise la FOMO Token6900 a littéralement explosé sur les radars en un temps record. Tout juste lancé, il s’est hissé parmi les ICO les plus en vue de 2025 . Sa recette ? Pas de poudre aux yeux, mais une mécanique simple et redoutable. Rareté programmée, prix qui montent par paliers, et une répartition des fonds calibrée entre développement, sécurité, marketing et liquidité. Résultat : une architecture claire qui rassure autant qu’elle excite. Les chiffres parlent d’eux-mêmes : plus de 15 millions de dollars levés, une hausse de plus de 30 % depuis le début de la presale, et une communauté qui grossit de jour en jour. Les traders à court terme guettent déjà une volatilité électrique après le claim. Les autres, qui visent à long terme, misent sur une roadmap solide et des partenariats en coulisses. Dans un marché saturé de projets qui disparaissent aussi vite qu’ils apparaissent, Token6900 sort du lot . Avec le claim imminent, la question brûlante est claire : simple effet de mode ou futur catalyseur de 2025 ? Pour l’instant, tous les signaux pointent vers la deuxième option . Foncez maintenant sur $T6900 ! Best Wallet Token ($BEST) : L’allié des investisseurs Faire du bruit juste pour faire du bruit? Très peu pour Best Wallet Token . Être utile, voila sa raison de vivre, tout simplement. Conçu dans l’écosystème Best Wallet , il se positionne comme un hub crypto complet où l’on peut gérer ses tokens, échanger, et suivre ses actifs sans se perdre dans la technique. Il cherche à rendre la crypto fluide et sécurisée pour le quotidien, loin des projets qui ne vivent que de spéculation. Tout est pensé pour durer au niveau mécanique. Une partie des fonds va à l’innovation et à la sécurité, le reste est réparti entre développement, marketing, liquidité et récompenses à la communauté. L’offre est volontairement limitée pour renforcer l’attractivité du projet , il faut savoir se faire désirer. Pour les investisseurs, $BEST coche deux cases à la fois : c’est un outil pratique qui simplifie l’entrée dans la crypto, mais aussi un actif avec un vrai potentiel de croissance si son écosystème continue d’exploser. Dans un marché où l’utile prend enfin le dessus sur le “bling”, Best Wallet Token fait figure d’outsider solide à surveiller de très près . Profitez immédiatement de $BEST ! Conclusion Le mythe du x1000 revient en force avec ChatGPT 5 , mais la réalité est simple : ces rendements sont rarissimes. Pourtant, des projets comme Bitcoin Hyper , Token6900 ou Best Wallet Token montrent qu’il existe autre chose que des rêves creux : une vraie utilité, une vision claire et un potentiel qui dépasse le simple buzz. La question n’est plus “ où décrocher un x1000 ? “, mais “ quels projets ont les épaules pour durer et marquer 2025 ? “. Parce qu’au fond, la crypto reste un pari risqué, mais c’est aussi là que naissent les révolutions.",Artificial Intelligence|Crypto News|1000x|artificial intelligence|bitcoin|Chat GPT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|SOL|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 21:17:14

This incident prompts questions about the potential impact on UNI's market value. Readers will discover which cryptocurrencies are poised for growth amidst this unfolding scenario. Uniswap (UNI) Shows Growth Potential Despite Price Dip Source: tradingview Uniswap's current price swings between nine and ten dollars. It's facing a challenge at just over eleven dollars. But this isn't the end for UNI. It's enjoying a decent climb from last month's price, jumping nearly nine percent. Over six months, it has gone up by more than a quarter. If it pushes past the eleven-dollar resistance, it might aim for thirteen dollars, climbing roughly twenty-five percent. The recent dip hasn't shaken its upward move. Analysts think crossing these levels could see further growth. With an RSI of fifty-two, it's in neutral territory, which means it can still rise. Uniswap seems positioned for potential gains ahead. Conclusion The incident at Bunni DEX has created concerns about the stability of the platform. As a result, the UNI token may face downward pressure. Investors might become cautious, potentially affecting the coin's short-term performance. It's crucial to monitor market reactions and investor sentiment closely in the coming days.

This comes as factories struggle with the fallout from Trump’s import tariffs, which have affected the current business environment so much, some manufacturers are reminded of the Great Recession. Trump’s import tariffs may be doing more harm than good According to a survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), some manufacturers have been complaining about how the sweeping import duties were making it harder to manufacture goods in the United States. Trump’s trade policy has raised the nation’s average tariff rate to the highest in a century. However, the president has defended it, calling it necessary to revive a long-declining U.S. industrial base. The base is still in decline, and government data has shown that spending on the construction of factories actually dropped in July , down 6.7% from a year ago. Also, last Friday, a U.S. appeals court ruled that most of Trump’s tariffs were illegal, contributing to the uncertainty businesses feel. “I continue to see the broad economy generally and the manufacturing sector in particular as in a holding pattern until tariff-related uncertainty recedes,” said Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander U.S. Capital Markets. Some of the industries that have been most affected by the fallout from the tariffs include makers of paper products, machinery, electrical equipment, appliances, and components, as well as computer and electronic products. Some makers of transportation equipment have even compared the current conditions to the 2007-09 recession. They attribute the lack of activity to “current tariff policy and the uncertainty it has created.” The sentiment was seconded by some electrical equipment, appliances, and components producers who complained that ”made in the USA” has become even more difficult due to tariffs on many components. Manufacturers of computer and electronic products have blamed the tariffs for wreaking havoc on planning and scheduling activities, saying that “plans to bring production back into (the) U.S. are impacted by higher material costs, making it more difficult to justify the return.” Meanwhile, food, beverage, and tobacco products manufacturers have warned that everything made of organic sugar was “about to get significantly more expensive” thanks to a 50% tariff on imports from Brazil and the elimination of the specialty sugar quota. The U.S. manufacturing industry is particularly susceptible to tariff fallouts President Trump’s far-reaching tariff policy has already affected the world and attracted deep and often contradictory economic consequences for the United States. It is possible for some U.S. industries to indeed experience a revival as a result of the policies, as their products become more competitive in domestic markets compared to tariffed imports. However, nobody can tell if the potential benefits will outweigh the costs of tariffs, not only for consumers who now have to deal with higher prices but also for U.S. workers themselves. Analysts have found that U.S. manufacturing industries are more exposed to tariffs on intermediate inputs compared to other U.S. industries. This undermines a key Trump administration argument about tariff effectiveness. Of the top 25 subsectors of the U.S. economy that are most affected by tariffs , 19 are in manufacturing. Other industries relatively vulnerable to tariffs include construction, mining and energy production, and repair and maintenance. In 2024, more than 23 million people were employed in these more exposed industries, but with the current trends, they could face wage stagnation or even job losses as their employers seek to pass down the costs of tariffs onto workers.

This bold move hints at strategic plans for broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. Dive into the article to uncover which coins could be next in line for a global breakthrough. Ondo (ONDO) Shows Steady Climb With Potential for More Source: tradingview Ondo (ONDO) is currently trading between $0.85 and $0.96, showing positive momentum. In the past week, its price increased by 2.5%, and over the month, it grew by 4.59%. The coin has comfortably surpassed its 10-day and 100-day moving averages of $0.91 and $0.90, respectively. With an RSI of nearly 58, there's room for further gains without it being overbought. The next resistance sits at $1.03, and breaking this could see it rally to $1.14, marking a potential rise of roughly 19% from its current range. Ondo appears poised for growth, bouncing back from a six-month dip. Worldcoin Teeters: Will It Break Through or Fall Back? Source: tradingview Worldcoin (WLD) is now trading between the mid-80s and mid-90s cents. It is close to overcoming a resistance at just over a dollar. Yet, it has dipped nearly one percent this week and over six percent this month. If it breaks the dollar mark, it might climb to $1.15, signaling a bump up of about 20% from its lower current range. But it also sits near a support around 79 cents, with a deeper drop point at 67 cents. Current indicators, like the 10-day and 100-day averages, suggest it is mildly stuck in place. With an RSI near an even 50, market sentiment is neutral. Ethena (ENA) Price Rallies with Strong Growth Potential Source: tradingview Ethena’s price is currently between 60 and 69 cents, showing a significant upward trend. In the past month, its price has surged by nearly a third, and over the past six months, it has more than doubled. The price is nearing its short-term resistance around 74 cents, but if it breaks this, it could head towards the next level at 84 cents. This represents an increase of over 20% from the current range. Its momentum indicators suggest strong interest, hinting that Ethena may keep rising, driven by both investor enthusiasm and market dynamics. Keep an eye on these levels to gauge further potential growth. Conclusion Binance's major investment signals strong interest in expanding financial services in Mexico. This move can potentially shine a light on emerging coins like ONDO, WLD, and ENA. These coins may see increased adoption as the market continues to grow. Their unique features and practical uses could appeal to a wider audience, enhancing their reach globally.

This follows earlier purchases totaling $28 million from other large holders, underscoring sustained accumulation from deep-pocketed investors. Continuous whale inflows reduce circulating supply, creating scarcity while reinforcing signals of institutional conviction. HYPE’s liquidity remains thin, which means large orders can amplify price swings far more than in deeper markets. USDC Integration Fuels Liquidity Another tailwind came earlier this month as Circle integrated native USDC through CCTP v2 on August 1. The upgrade simplified cross-chain transfers directly into Hyperliquid, sparking a 3% HYPE price bump. By reducing friction, native USDC access makes it easier for traders to enter HYPE positions. Unlike wrapped alternatives that previously inflated total value locked (TVL), these flows represent real capital. Indeed, USDC inflows rose 8.3% MoM, compared to an industry average of just 0.4%. Technical Rebound From Key Levels Source: coinmarketcap From a technical perspective, HYPE has stabilized after recent volatility. The token currently holds above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level ($45.52), despite bearish signals from the MACD (-0.2419) and a neutral RSI at 47.58. The 30-day SMA ($43.66) continues to act as dynamic support. Consolidation around current levels looks likely. A breakout above the 23.6% Fib level ($47.64) could set up a move toward $51.07 (August 27 swing high). Conversely, failure to hold $45 support risks a deeper pullback toward $43.81 (50% retracement). HYPE’s modest daily performance reflects a balance between whale-driven accumulation and technical indecision. The immediate test remains whether HYPE can hold the $45.52 support. A decisive move either way could dictate the broader direction of altcoin momentum — and if whales continue aggressive buying, HYPE could be well positioned to challenge new all-time highs in the coming months.

The Trump administration plans to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court to have it overturned. Last week, the court ruled in a 7-4 decision that Trump's global tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), enacted in the 1970s, were excessive. The court postponed the ruling until October 14, giving the White House time to appeal. Trump, in a statement on social media, said, “Without tariffs and the TRILLIONS of dollars we collect, our country would be destroyed, our military might would be destroyed in an instant.” The president claimed that removing tariffs would turn the United States into a “third world country.” Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro called the decision “partisan injustice weaponized at its worst” and claimed that a negative Supreme Court outcome would be “the end of the United States.” Related News: Ripple (XRP) Announces Major Partnership in the Payment Sector Following the ruling, importers raised the possibility of refunding the taxes they paid, but experts argue that the process will take a long time. Angela M. Santos of the law firm ArentFox Schiff said that while the ruling is encouraging for importers, “the case is not over yet.” Beyond emergency economic powers, the Trump administration can also impose tariffs based on alternative laws, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. However, these mechanisms are more limited in scope and speed. Foreign trade experts say that if the United States loses in the Supreme Court, it will not only have to repay billions of dollars in customs revenue, but also put agreements with the European Union and other countries at risk. In a statement following the decision, Trump described the stock market fluctuation as “the result of uncertainty” and announced that he would hold an “emergency meeting” on the issue tomorrow. *This is not investment advice.

Traders are backing away from risk, and bond yields are doing the exact opposite of what the textbooks promised. Instead of falling, the 30-year Treasury yield is climbing fast, now pushing toward 5%, a level not seen since the middle of the 2008 financial crisis. Traders now see 50 basis points of rate cuts as the base case for 2025. There’s even a 34% chance of 75 basis points of cuts happening this year. But none of it is making investors bullish. The mood is sour. Treasury yields are surging. The system is off. While the central bank prepares to ease, the market is hiking its own rates in protest. Bond market pushes back as inflation and debt explode Over the past five weeks, the U.S. Treasury has issued over $200 billion in new bonds. But investors are walking away. The usual appetite for long-dated debt just isn’t there. Buyers want more in return. That’s seen in the term premiums on 10-year notes, now at the highest level since 2014. Term premiums measure the extra payoff buyers demand for holding longer debt, and right now, that premium is flashing red. Core inflation is above 3% again and heading higher. At that rate, the dollar loses over 25% of its value in the next ten years. It’s already lost about 25% since 2020, compounding pressure on consumers. That hasn’t slowed Washington’s spending. The more debt they create, the more the market resists. And the Fed? It’s losing control of the entire yield curve. The United Kingdom is already dealing with the fallout. The Bank of England cut rates five times in one year, blaming a weak labor market. But the result is ugly. The UK’s 30-year bond yield just moved above 5.70%, the highest since April 1998. Instead of softening borrowing costs, their cuts sent yields to a 27-year high. Traders rejected the central bank’s move and demanded higher compensation for risk. The exact same playbook is now playing out in the U.S. Japan is feeling it too. The 30-year Japanese Government Bond yield now sits above 3.20%, more than 30 times higher than where it was in 2019. The global bond market is sending a message: central banks can’t buy their way out of structural debt anymore. Gold rallies, stocks bleed, and stagflation takes hold One asset isn’t confused. Gold is charging higher with near-perfect alignment to long-term yields. As bond yields move up, so does gold. And now, it’s made history. Gold hit $3,600 per ounce for the first time. That’s a +33% gain year-to-date, more than 3.5x the return of the S&P 500. XAUUSD 1-day price chart Traders aren’t running to stocks. They’re dumping them. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 249.07 points, closing at 45,295.81. The S&P 500 lost 0.69% to end at 6,415.54, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.82%, closing at 21,279.63. Big names bled. Nvidia dropped 2%, while Amazon and Apple slid about 1% each. The season is part of it. September is historically brutal for equities, and traders are taking profits after a hot summer. August was strong. The S&P 500 climbed almost 2%, broke 6,500 for the first time, and hit five new all-time highs, bringing the 2025 total to 20. But now, all eyes are on Friday’s jobs report. That will likely be the final data point the Fed reviews before its rate decision. The unemployment rate for 16 to 24-year-olds has hit 10%, and that’s likely what the Fed will cite when it justifies the cut. But the timing is ugly. Inflation is climbing, the labor market is weakening, and economic growth is slowing. That’s stagflation, and it’s now a reality.

The announcement sent Pump.fun’s native token PUMP surging more than 10% as traders reacted to the promise of “100x growth” across the platform. introducing Project Ascend, a series of updates that will 100x the pump fun ecosystem by making coins more sustainable & aligned with their communities to start: – 10x more creator earnings via Dynamic Fees – 10x faster processing of CTO Creator Fee applications learn more pic.twitter.com/ATO1HCjarR — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) September 2, 2025 The centerpiece of the rollout is a reimagined creator fee system designed to better align projects with their communities and reduce incentives for short-lived, high-risk token launches. Pump.fun Revamps Creator Fees in Bid to End Short-Lived Token Hype At the heart of Project Ascend is Dynamic Fees V1, a new tiered structure applied exclusively to PumpSwap tokens. Instead of charging flat fees, the system reduces creator fees as a token’s market capitalization grows. Pump.fun says the model will make launching new coins “10x more rewarding,” encouraging fresh talent ranging from streamers to startups, while still allowing successful projects to scale without being weighed down by costs. Additionally, allocations for protocol fees and liquidity providers remain unchanged, ensuring continuity for the broader ecosystem. Pump.fun argues the change directly addresses problems with its earlier Creator Fees initiative, which faced community criticism and proved ineffective in covering the costs of building real projects. According to the team, while the original system offered a proof of concept, it fell short of supporting expensive needs like marketing campaigns, exchange listings, and long-term development. The updated fee model, combined with faster processing of community takeover applications for inactive tokens, is intended to give legitimate builders a clearer path to sustainability. The update comes at a key moment for Pump.fun. In recent weeks, the platform has rolled out a series of expansions designed to strengthen its footprint within Solana’s ecosystem. On July 17, it announced its first acquisition , purchasing wallet-tracking tool Kolscan to integrate advanced analytics and social trading features. Just days later, the project launched its public token sale, seeking to raise up to $600 million, representing 15% of PUMP’s total supply. over the past week, pump fun purchased $10,657,503 in $PUMP tokens, which equates to 99.32% of total revenue for that period (Aug 20-Aug 26) to date, pump fun has purchased a total of $58,134,191 of $PUMP tokens, offsetting 4.261% of the circulating supply pic.twitter.com/YIsGH4Jr95 — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) August 27, 2025 Pump.fun has also introduced a real-time revenue dashboard, reporting over $58 million in token buybacks to date, equivalent to offsetting 4.26% of the circulating supply. Pump.fun Pushes Beyond Memes With Liquidity Fund and Social Trading Tools In parallel, Pump.fun launched the Glass Full Foundation , a fund dedicated to injecting liquidity into promising community-driven projects. The initiative, revealed on August 8, has already begun supporting several tokens, planning to accelerate the most vibrant and organic communities on the platform. More recently, Pump.fun added a Kolscan-powered leaderboard on August 25 , allowing users to track top traders and influencers in real time. Despite the momentum, questions linger about whether Project Ascend can meaningfully curb the plague of rug pulls and failed meme coins. The platform’s promise of becoming “the hub for the most successful projects and creators” rests on its ability to turn structural incentives into long-term value. Critics note that while fee reforms may encourage higher-quality projects, they do not directly eliminate the risks of bad actors launching short-lived tokens. Even so, Pump.fun’s broader strategy appears to be positioning itself as a central hub for Solana startups and meme projects alike. By combining new fee mechanics, social trading features, liquidity injections, and real-time transparency tools, the platform hopes to strengthen its reputation as more than just a generator of fleeting meme coins. Pump.fun Surges Past LetsBonk, Capturing 75% of Solana DEX Revenue Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) activity is showing sharp declines after a year of explosive growth fueled by meme coins. August Data from Dune Analytics shows that daily active traders on Solana DEXs have dropped 81%, from 4.8 million earlier this year to just 900,000 in August . Daily transactions have also fallen, sliding from 45 million in July to 28.8 million this month. The slowdown marks the fourth straight day that Solana’s trader count has stayed under one million, indicating what many see as the end of the frenzy that drove record volumes in late 2024. Activity had surged last year as meme coins and experimental tokens dominated trading, with weekly traders peaking above 30 million by October. But inflows collapsed in early 2025, leaving recurring users to sustain activity at a lower baseline of 10–15 million weekly. Amid this downturn, Pump.fun has staged a comeback after losing ground to Solana-based rival LetsBonk.fun in July .

According to CNBC, Warren Buffett, who led the merger that created the food giant in 2015, said on Tuesday that he’s “disappointed” in the breakup. He also said the merger itself was “not a brilliant idea” and that splitting Kraft Heinz apart won’t fix the real issues. The new move divides Kraft Heinz into two separate businesses. One now handles sauces, spreads, and shelf-stable meals. The other is left with U.S. household brands like Kraft Singles, Lunchables, and Oscar Mayer. The announcement was made early Tuesday, and Warren’s comments came later that day in an interview with Becky Quick. Shares dropped more than 7% after his interview aired. Berkshire stays put as Kraft Heinz breaks apart Warren has kept Berkshire Hathaway’s 27.5% stake untouched since the merger. The company hasn’t trimmed or added to the position at all since teaming up with 3G Capital a decade ago to form Kraft Heinz. But now, with 3G already out, having quietly exited in 2023, Warren and his incoming successor, Greg Abel, are left holding the investment solo. Abel, who will take over from Warren at the end of this year, has also expressed his disappointment in how Kraft Heinz is being handled. Since the merger, Kraft Heinz has lost serious ground. Its shares have collapsed nearly 70% since 2015, shrinking its market value to just $33 billion. The decline came after U.S. sales dropped and consumer behavior changed. Shoppers started avoiding processed foods, opting instead for fresh items around the outer edges of grocery stores. The brands under Kraft Heinz, despite being household names like Velveeta and Oscar Mayer, started to lose relevance. Analysts blame some of the collapse on 3G Capital’s aggressive cost-cutting, which prevented the company from investing in its brands at the time they needed it most. Kraft Heinz ended up selling off big pieces of its portfolio, including its Planters nuts and parts of its cheese business. At the same time, it tried to revive a few brands like Capri Sun and Lunchables by investing more heavily in them. Back in May, executives at Kraft Heinz admitted they were thinking about strategic changes and even possible deals. This split is the result of that process. The company didn’t say if more breakups or asset sales are coming, but it’s clear the structure from 2015 isn’t working anymore. Despite the mess, Warren hasn’t walked away. He told CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway will do whatever is best for the firm. He also made one thing clear: if anyone comes forward to buy their stake, Berkshire won’t accept a private block deal unless every other shareholder is offered the same exact terms. That means no backroom discounts or side deals. Warren also admitted during a rough quarter back in 2019 that Berkshire “overpaid” for Kraft. Still, unlike other investors who bailed out years ago, he hasn’t sold. Whether that patience pays off after this new split remains to be seen.

Its Hydra upgrade and steady improvements have made it one of the most respected blockchains. But as markets gear up for the next cycle, many traders see ADA as slow-moving compared to other projects. Analysts suggest that while ADA could climb in 2025, bigger returns may come from alternatives such as Hedera (HBAR), Stellar (XLM), and the meme-fueled newcomer Layer Brett (LBRETT). Hedera (HBAR) and real-world adoption Hedera has been marketed less as a retail coin and more as an enterprise solution. Its hashgraph consensus allows for high throughput, low cost, and strong security. Instead of promising ideas on paper, Hedera has already signed major companies as governing council members. Brands in tech, telecom, and finance are helping shape the network, a sign of real-world interest. Developers are turning to Hedera for tokenization, payment rails, and supply chain tracking. Cardano also pushes innovation but takes a more academic route. For investors, the contrast is clear: ADA has credibility in theory, while HBAR is gaining credibility through use cases. If enterprise blockchain adoption grows, Hedera could easily outpace ADA’s growth rate. Stellar (XLM) and global payments Stellar was designed with a simple purpose: to make moving money across borders faster and cheaper. With financial institutions, fintech firms, and even central banks testing its rails, XLM continues to build relevance in payments. Its low-cost transactions and partnership activity make it a candidate to benefit from the rise of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Cardano has leaned on a vision of slow but steady upgrades. Stellar, by comparison, has aimed straight at the money-transfer industry. This clear focus on payments has given XLM a path to adoption that ADA doesn’t directly address. If blockchain-powered remittances expand in 2025, Stellar could see the kind of growth that makes it one of the top alternatives to Cardano. Layer Brett (LBRETT) and speculative momentum Then there’s Layer Brett , the newcomer drawing buzz. Unlike most meme coins, it isn’t built on hype alone. It runs on Ethereum Layer 2, giving it fast speeds, low fees, and the ability to connect with Ethereum dApps. This makes it practical for actual use while still carrying the viral appeal of a meme token. The presale has caught fire, thanks in part to staking rewards reported in the thousands of percent APY. That has pulled in both small buyers and early whales. A clear roadmap adds to the interest: NFT tie-ins, gamified staking, and plans for cross-chain features. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens, scarcity is locked in, giving traders another reason to stay interested. Compared to ADA, which is already a large-cap coin, Layer Brett starts from a tiny market base. Even moderate demand could produce outsized multiples. Analysts speculate that if momentum continues, it could rival past meme coin stories, with returns far beyond what ADA might deliver. Final thoughts Cardano remains a cornerstone project, respected for its security and research-driven approach. But in 2025, alternatives may offer more upside. Hedera could capture enterprise clients. Stellar is pushing into global payments. And Layer Brett brings meme energy backed by real infrastructure. For investors, it comes down to risk preference. ADA looks set for steady gains, but those chasing bigger multiples may find opportunities in HBAR, XLM, or LBRETT. Each offers a different path, and together they highlight where capital may flow as the next cycle takes shape.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $111,170 (+2%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $124,457; August 14, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $111,564 24-hour low $109,147 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 111,170 Price Prediction $ 117,109 (+6.56%) Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 3.01% Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $ 116,091 200-Day SMA $ 95,954 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faces bullish surge above $111K Resistance for BTC is at $113,624 Support for BTC/USD is at $107,078 The BTC price analysis for 2 September confirms that BTC faces a surge in volatility as the price moves above $111K. The price is now aiming for a consolidation within a bullish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces a move above $111K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bullish pressure as it hovers above $111K. Currently, the market is facing buying domination around resistance channels. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $1.41 billion, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $111,391, surging by over 2% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades at 45.98, hinting that a correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $112K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.84, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $113,624, it will fuel a bullish rally to $121,729. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $107,078, beginning a bearish trend to $99,908. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying demand as buyers pushed the price above Fib levels. The recent lows triggered strong accumulation. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Metaplanet announced that it purchased 1,009 BTC, worth around $112 million. Its total holdings reached 20,000 BTC, making the company the sixth largest public corporate holder of Bitcoin. Bitcoin price prediction September 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $125,000, making August its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction September 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-02 22:00:00

The first investors will receive a guaranteed minimum return of 300% when MUTM token goes live. The project has already raised over $15.25 million and over 15,950 investors on board. As traders look forward to a potentially bullish Q4, Mutuum Finance stands out as a next-generation decentralised finance (DeFi) protocol that is building a real-world use case and ecosystem all in one. Shiba Inu Resist Market Volatility The current market price of SHIB is close to $0.00001245 with a slight negative weekly impact of 6-7%. Despite this impact on the sentiments in the meme coin world, the SHIB ecosystem is continuing to grow through projects such as token burning and Shibarium. At the same time, DeFi projects related to utilities such as Mutuum Finance are gaining more and more attention from investors. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is at presale Stage 6 for $0.035 per token. Cost will go up 14.29% to $0.04 in next phase. With more than 15,950 investors involved and having successfully raised over $15.25 million, the presale is off to an incredible start, and enjoys significant confidence from early adopters. USDT Stablecoin on Ether Mutuum Finance will release an overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum The stablecoin is intended for daily use, for decentralised applications and for long-term portfolio stability, increasing usability and trust in the platform. Dual-Lending: DeFi Infrastructure Future-Proof Mutuum Finance is a dual-lending protocol that may be run with automation and user interaction for maximum efficiency. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending smart contracts dynamically change their interest rates (in real time) based on market supply and demand using self-executing smart contracts. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending: This form of lending allows lenders and borrowers to transact directly, eliminating intermediaries and offering more flexibility and transparency. This dual approach positions Mutuum Finance as a secure, future-resistant infrastructure that ensures financial inclusion, high returns, and opportunities for both retail and institutional investors. Its focus on security, transparency, and scalability forms the foundation for a sustainable and expansion-ready DeFi ecosystem. Mutuum Protocol Overview Mutuum’s dynamic interest rate another smart contract solution for liquidity management. Borrow rates are determined by utilisation, with low rates providing incentives to borrow (and enhance capital efficiency) when capital is plentiful, and higher rates (with accompanying deposit incentives) promoting repayment and drawing deposits during times of scarcity. Stable rates can be used for resource borrowers who are looking for predictability. These fees will usually be higher than variable ones but can be tweaked if the market conditions change to a drastic extent. Only sufficiently liquid assets can be used as collateral to obtain stable-rate borrowing. The protocol promotes a strong risk management based on parameterised assets. Borrowers must over-collateralize and liquidators are rewarded for smoothing under-collateralized loans. Secondary markets enforce limits, including restrictions such as collateral requirements (expressed in terms of high-risk tokens), deposit and borrow constraints to limit exposure to volatile or illiquid asset classes. Improved Borrowing Capacity: Correlated assets predict even greater borrowing capacity, and LTVs limit borrowing based on collateral themselves. Liquidation thresholds and penalties are necessary to keep the protocol solvent and reserve factors are there to generate some interest (so it doesn’t default and causes market extreme conditions). Price discovery is based on solid oracle infrastructure. Permissions data stream will provide reliable pricing for USD and native assets like, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX on a chainlink data feed. Aggregated feeds, oracle standards/fallbacks, and on-chain DEX metrics serve to further sanitise, ensuring valuations are reliable and arrive in a prompt and accurate fashion for downstream collateral management & liquidation operations. Stability and Security Measures Mutuum Finance has established an official Bug Bounty Program with a $50,000 USDT reward pool, rating vulnerabilities as critical, major, minor, and low in severity. The project is also running a $100,000 community giveaway , where 10 investors will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. While SHIB struggles near $0.00001245, Mutuum Finance is attracting significant attention from early adopters. The project is already taking the lead as the next big player in the crypto market.

51092254,572057,1756850402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51092254.jpeg,Here’s How Much The TRUMP Meme Coin Will Be With The Market Cap Of Dogecoin,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-with-doge-market-cap/,"The Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin stormed into the crypto scene in January 2025 with a rally that pushed its price from below $1 to a $73.43 peak in a matter of days. This rally placed it among the top twenty digital assets, but today, it is trading far below those heights. Nonetheless, Official Trump is still one of the biggest n ames among meme coins, and investors are still looking towards another rally. A way to measure the potential rally is by asking what would happen if TRUMP reached the same market capitalization as Dogecoin, the leading meme coin. What If TRUMP Reached Dogecoin’s Market Cap? At the time of writing, TRUMP is trading at $8.41, down by 7.2% in the past 24 hours but up by 1.4% in a seven-day timeframe. The meme coin has a market cap of about $1.683 billion. Dogecoin, the most established meme coin and the benchmark of the category, is currently valued at $0.2135 per token, down by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The leading meme coin has a market cap of about $31.85 billion. When comparing the two side by side, TRUMP’s market cap is just a fraction of Dogecoin’s size. According to calculations from the MarketCapOf tool, TRUMP’s current market value is only about 0.05× that of Dogecoin. Therefore, if TRUMP were to achieve the same market capitalization as the current price of Dogecoin, its price would have to climb to about $160.99 per token, which would represent a 19.21x increase from where it stands today. Dogecoin’s All-Time High The comparison is even more different when considering Dogecoin’s all-time high. At its all-time high of $0.7316 in May 2021, Dogecoin’s market capitalization reached roughly $88.79 billion on the back of the meme coin mania at the time. If TRUMP were ever to match that market cap high, its price would need to increase to about $444.23 per token. That would equate to an extraordinary 53.01x increase from its current price. However, these calculations only take into account the current circulating supply of these cryptocurrencies. TRUMP currently has a circulating supply of 199,999,973 tokens out of a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens. Dogecoin, on the other hand, currently has a circulating supply of 150.748 billion tokens with an uncapped maximum supply. TRUMP has arguably had the best meme coin performance this cycle. Its astonishing run in January was reminiscent of similar meme coin rallies in 2021, which the market has been missing this cycle. After its launch on January 17, 2025, the TRUMP meme coin’s value soared by over 300% in under a day, reaching approximately $64 per token on the same day. By January 19, the meme coin had reached a peak of $73.43.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Marketcapof|Trump,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 22:00:02

Analysts say the cryptocurrency’s recent rally is largely driven by Binance whales. Ethereum Rally Driven By Large-Scale Binance Orders According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, Ethereum whales are now dominating order flows on the Binance exchange. The analyst highlighted the average ETH order size on the platform as evidence. Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Stays Strong As Exchange Reserves Keep Falling – Details Crazzyblockk shared the following chart showing different phases of average ETH order size on Binance. Retail-driven phases, highlighted in red, dominated much of 2023–24, when small orders drove up ETH’s price but left it vulnerable to corrections. These retail-driven periods were followed by neutral phases, shown in gray, which reflected indecision among ETH investors. This phase was characterized by fragmented participation and sideways trading behavior. Fast-forward to mid-2025, whale orders – highlighted in green – are firmly in control. Average order sizes have now surged past $3,000 per trade, signaling accumulation by institutional and large-scale investors. The CryptoQuant analyst noted that this whale dominance reflects renewed institutional confidence in ETH, aligning with its rapid price appreciation in recent months. Larger average orders suggest fewer fragmented trades and stronger directional conviction. Binance was chosen for the analysis not only as the world’s largest exchange but also because it is the “epicenter of ETH capital flow.” Crazzyblockk concluded: ETH’s latest rally isn’t just retail speculation – it’s being powered by whales on Binance. With large-scale players setting the tone, Ethereum’s market structure looks increasingly robust, and Binance remains the hub where these decisive flows shape price performance. Is ETH Getting Ready For A Rally? While Bitcoin (BTC) has tumbled 4.1% over the past 30 days, ETH is up 23.4% in the same period, indicating that large-scale investors may be in the middle of capital rotation from BTC to ETH over the past month. Related Reading: Ethereum Will ‘Likely 100x From Here,’ Says Joe Lubin Analysts predict ETH may have further room to grow for the remainder of 2025. Ethereum contracts are seeing a sharp resurgence in 2025, setting the stage for a potential rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $5,000 towards the end of the year. Ethereum fundamentals are also strengthening, with as much as 36 million ETH staked on the blockchain, raising the possibility of a supply crunch. That said, despite whale accumulation, some analysts caution that ETH could dip to $4,000. At press time, ETH trades at $4,316, down 2.8% in the past 24 hours.

With Bitcoin consolidating around key levels, attention is shifting to altcoins that could deliver outsized returns before the next big pump. Analysts say a handful of tokens are attracting both retail and institutional demand, and for good reason. One of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has become a hot topic after its presale nearly sold out, reminding investors of the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin when those who moved quickly saw exponential gains. XRP Eyes a Return to Strength Ripple’s XRP remains a favorite for investors betting on utility and adoption. Its cross-border payment network continues to expand, with growing partnerships in Asia and the Middle East. After recent price pressure, traders are watching whether XRP can reclaim momentum, with forecasts suggesting it could push toward new yearly highs if the market turns risk-on. Solana’s Speed Still a Major Draw Solana (SOL) has recovered from multiple setbacks, proving its resilience in the competitive Layer-1 space. With transaction speeds that rival traditional financial systems and a growing DeFi ecosystem, SOL is seen as one of the strongest contenders for long-term growth. If institutional flows extend beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana could be one of the top beneficiaries. MAGACOIN FINANCE Heating Up While established names dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building one of the strongest early-stage communities of 2025. Its presale is moving at record speed, with allocations vanishing quickly as whales and retail buyers compete for a spot. Analysts point out that early investors could see as much as 40x returns if MAGACOIN FINANCE mirrors past breakout performances from other meme-powered projects. With a countdown now live and the presale almost sold out, this could be one of the last chances to enter before the next pump phase begins. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Gains Serious Traction Hyperliquid (HYPE) has quickly become a favorite in the decentralized trading space. With near-zero fees and growing daily volumes, the project is winning over traders who demand performance and scalability. As its ecosystem develops, many see HYPE as one of the most undervalued opportunities in the market today. Dogecoin Refuses to Fade Despite new meme coins popping up every week, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to command loyalty. Its massive community, strong branding, and new use cases in payments keep it relevant. DOGE has historically surprised skeptics, and if history repeats itself, another major rally could be around the corner. Cardano Pushes Toward Long-Term Adoption Cardano (ADA) has taken a slower but steady path, focusing on peer-reviewed development and scalability. With Hydra scaling technology rolling out, ADA is preparing to handle thousands of transactions per second. This foundation could power new adoption in DeFi, identity solutions, and enterprise-level blockchain applications. Analysts suggest ADA could benefit from the next wave of institutional attention, making it a coin to watch in the coming months. Conclusion As Bitcoin holds its ground, the real action could soon shift to altcoins. XRP and Solana are positioning for institutional inflows, Dogecoin and HYPE keep expanding their reach, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting records with its fast-selling presale. With the countdown nearly finished, investors looking for the next explosive opportunity may not want to wait much longer.

Solana (SOL) whales are not only fueling Solana’s own rally but also rotating into Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) , signaling a broader appetite for high-utility altcoins ahead of October. Alongside Ethereum (ETH) and XRP , a new player, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is capturing attention as investors look for early-stage opportunities with breakout potential. Together, these five tokens stand out as the top altcoins to watch into October . Solana Whales Drive Market Rotation Despite a surge to $215, Solana has seen 2 million SOL ($432M) deposited onto exchanges in just three days, creating caution about sell pressure. Still, whales remain active, and analysts point to critical levels: Support: $200, aligned with the on-chain MVRV mean. Next Resistance: $280, marked by the +0.5σ MVRV band. Upside Potential: Sustained whale demand could lift Solana toward $300 and beyond . The fact that whales are also loading up on AVAX and DOT suggests Solana whales are positioning broadly across Layer-1 ecosystems. Avalanche (AVAX) Gains Momentum With Government Adoption Avalanche posted 66% transaction growth in a week , surpassing 11.9 million transactions across 181,300 active addresses. Government Catalyst: The U.S. Department of Commerce announced it will publish GDP data directly on Avalanche, among other blockchains — a historic step for decentralized data. ETF Progress: Grayscale has updated its filing for an AVAX spot ETF , potentially unlocking new institutional inflows. These developments are driving renewed demand, with AVAX trading around $23.64 and investors eyeing further growth as adoption widens. Polkadot (DOT) Gains ETF Tailwinds Polkadot (DOT) has joined the growing list of tokens with ETF applications. Grayscale filed registration statements for both DOT and ADA trusts, signaling institutional interest is spreading beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ticker Plans: DOT would list on Nasdaq as a single-asset ETF. Market Impact: ETF filings validate DOT’s role as a next-gen blockchain for cross-chain applications and scalability. As whales rotate into DOT, the token could benefit from heightened visibility and new flows from traditional finance. Ethereum (ETH) Remains a Whale Favorite Whales continue to rotate billions from Bitcoin into Ethereum. $2.59B Rotation: A single whale shifted BTC into a $2.2B ETH spot and a $577M perpetual long. $456M Purchases: Nine addresses added hundreds of millions more. Validator Concerns: Over 1M ETH ($5B) is queued for withdrawal, but institutional inflows are absorbing supply. Trading near $4,300 , ETH remains a top pick among whales betting on DeFi and enterprise adoption. XRP Eyes ETF-Driven Breakthrough XRP is riding speculation that an XRP ETF could attract $5B in inflows during its first month if approved. Price: Currently trading near $3.00. Impact: ETF approval would bring hedge funds, pensions, and sovereign investors into XRP. Outlook: Analysts see potential for XRP to push into double-digit territory. Institutional adoption could cement XRP’s role as a utility-driven digital asset. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Emerging Altcoin to Watch Whales are now quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE as its transparent team and audited contracts give confidence. With limited tokens available in its early-access stage and significant upside, early investors see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a chance to get in before it gets listed by exchanges. XRP and Solana investors are shifting focus toward MAGACOIN FINANCE’s breakout, seeking early exposure before wider adoption, exchange listings, and institutional attention ignite massive growth potential. As whales diversify into Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot, smaller but promising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE could become the surprise outperformers in October . Analysts now expect 51x gains in the coming months of 2025. Final Thoughts Whales are reshaping the altcoin landscape by driving liquidity not just into Solana, but also into Avalanche and Polkadot. Alongside Ethereum’s continued dominance and XRP’s ETF-driven momentum, these tokens represent the top five altcoins to watch as October approaches. But the story isn’t only about large caps. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors a unique early-stage opportunity with strong community backing and growing utility — making it a wildcard that could join the ranks of the top-performing altcoins in the next cycle.

According to the analysis, a large portion of the supply of many popular altcoins is held by just the top 10 wallets. According to the data, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has the highest centralization rate. The top 10 wallets control 62.3% of SHIB's total supply, followed by Uniswap (UNI) with 52.2% and Ethereum (ETH) with 51.0%. The situation for other prominent altcoins is as follows: Tether (USDT): 40.5% Pepe (PEPE): 39.4% Chainlink (LINK): 31.5% Dai (DAI): 31.0% USD Coin (USDC): 28.6% Related News: Another Altcoin Launches Token Sale Project for Companies in the US and China Santiment stated that this data has revived discussions about “centralization,” particularly for investors. The intense dominance of large wallets over supply is considered a risk factor, as it could lead to sharper price fluctuations. It's also noteworthy that three of the seven altcoins on the list are stablecoins. However, it's important to note that the list only includes altcoins from the Ethereum ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.
