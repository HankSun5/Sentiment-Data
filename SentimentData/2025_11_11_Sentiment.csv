Related Reading: US Gov’t Shutdown Deal Sparks Hope For Crypto Market Relief Reports of a bipartisan Senate deal lifted global investor sentiment, sending Bitcoin above $106,000 and Ethereum past $3,600 for the first time in nearly two weeks. The overall crypto market capitalization jumped 4.4% to $3.6 trillion, according to CoinGecko data. Shutdown Relief Sparks Market Optimism The Senate voted 60–40 to advance a funding bill, which is expected to restore federal operations by midweek. President Donald Trump is set to sign the legislation once it passes the House. Analysts say the reopening could revive economic data flows and provide the Federal Reserve with the clarity needed to resume rate cuts as early as December. Jeff May, COO at BTSE, noted that “without key data during the shutdown, the Fed had to wait. Once operations resume, policymakers will have the confidence to adjust rates more actively, potentially easing liquidity pressures across markets.” Bitcoin Leads the Rebound as Liquidity Returns Bitcoin rallied more than 4% in 24 hours, reclaiming the $105,000–$106,000 range, while Ethereum gained over 5%. Other major cryptos, including XRP and BNB, also advanced, reflecting renewed risk appetite. Analysts attribute the rebound to an anticipated recovery in liquidity as government functions and Treasury flows normalize. Peter Chan of Presto Research said, “Removing the shutdown factor opens the door to a repricing of risk assets in a favorable macro setting, looser monetary policy, fiscal incentives, and reduced uncertainty.” Despite the bullish tone, whale movements remain in focus. On-chain data from Lookonchain revealed that early investor Owen Gunden transferred 3,549 BTC ($361 million) to Kraken, sparking speculation of continued profit-taking. Yet analysts like “Darkfost” believe these sales represent “a healthy rotation of long-term holders,” noting that institutional demand and ETF inflows have provided sufficient liquidity to absorb large sell orders. Fed Policy, Inflation, and Crypto’s Path Forward The prospect of a reopened government has also fueled bets on another Federal Reserve rate cut in December, with CME data showing a 63% probability. Lower borrowing costs would likely benefit both equities and digital assets. Related Reading: Why Are Bitcoin OGs Dumping Billions Of Dollars In BTC? While macro optimism drives short-term gains, experts warn that lasting recovery depends on consistent liquidity and policy stability.

Following a sharp drop below the $3,300 level, bulls are now attempting to reclaim $3,600, with the next major objective set at $4,000 — a level that could confirm a shift in market momentum if conquered. Related Reading: SharpLink Gaming Wallet Moves Freshly Redeemed Ethereum to OKX – Details Amid this recovery effort, key on-chain data highlights a surprising move from one of the market’s most closely watched traders — the so-called Anti-CZ Whale. This investor gained notoriety for shorting ASTER shortly after Changpeng Zhao (CZ) — the former CEO of Binance and one of the most influential figures in crypto — publicly mentioned buying it. The whale’s timely short turned out to be highly profitable, reinforcing their reputation as a contrarian yet precise market player. Now, this same whale has flipped bullish on Ethereum, opening a significant long position after having shorted ETH last week. The move signals growing confidence in Ethereum’s recovery potential and could hint at an upcoming market reversal. As sentiment begins to stabilize and liquidity rotates back into major altcoins, Ethereum’s price action in the coming days will be crucial in determining whether this bounce evolves into a sustained uptrend. The Anti-CZ Whale Flips Bullish on Ethereum According to new on-chain data shared by Lookonchain, the trader known as the Anti-CZ Whale has once again demonstrated his sharp market timing. After shorting Ethereum (ETH) during last week’s market correction, the whale has now flipped bullish — taking a major long position that reflects growing confidence in the asset’s recovery. The data reveals that the whale currently holds 32,802 ETH, valued at roughly $119.6 million, with more than $15 million in unrealized profit so far. This strategic pivot came shortly after Ethereum’s rebound from its recent lows near $3,200, suggesting that the trader anticipated a relief rally as selling pressure began to ease. What makes this move even more significant is that the Anti-CZ Whale is still maintaining profitable short positions in other assets — notably ASTER and PEPE. This indicates a selective, tactical approach rather than a broad market shift. His ETH long aligns with improving sentiment around Ethereum, while the other shorts suggest caution toward more speculative altcoins. Historically, the Anti-CZ Whale has earned a reputation for trading against major narratives — including his successful short on ASTER after Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Binance’s former CEO, tweeted about buying the token. His latest move toward ETH could therefore signal that smart money is beginning to rotate back into high-conviction assets. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Trim Positions – 4M ADA Sold in 7 Days ETH Price Analysis — Signs of a Short-Term Recovery Ethereum’s price action on the 4-hour chart shows a notable recovery following last week’s sharp decline. After dipping below $3,300, ETH found strong buying interest and has since rebounded toward the $3,600 region — a key short-term resistance level. This rebound coincides with increased trading volume, suggesting renewed confidence among bulls after several days of panic-driven selling. The structure now shows early signs of a potential trend reversal, as Ethereum has formed a short-term higher low pattern, with buyers defending the $3,350–$3,400 support zone. If momentum continues, the next target for bulls lies near $3,800, where previous breakdowns occurred. A clear break and close above that level would confirm a bullish continuation toward the $4,000 mark.

The broader market remains fragile, and the asset is yet to reclaim its 200-period moving average, which currently acts as dynamic resistance. Failure to sustain momentum above $3,600 could lead to renewed selling pressure, potentially retesting support near $3,250.

The exchange announced on Nov. 10 that it will debut a dedicated token sales platform, starting with the layer-1 blockchain Monad, whose sale is scheduled to run from Nov. 17 to 22, offering 7.5% of its total supply. Token launches just got a whole lot better. → Early access to your favorite tokens → Real supporters are prioritized → Sustainable token distribution → US users can finally join Now possible with token sales on Coinbase. Oh, one more thing: the @monad sale starts Nov 17. pic.twitter.com/ox5VRAqfiH — Coinbase (@coinbase) November 10, 2025 The move marks Coinbase’s first public token sale since 2018 and indicates a broader shift in how projects distribute their tokens. Coinbase’s New Token Sales Put Structure Over Speed According to the company , the initiative is an effort to set “a new standard” for sustainable and transparent token launches. Under the new framework, Coinbase plans to host around one token sale per month, each governed by an allocation algorithm designed to ensure broader participation and fairness. Unlike the chaotic “first-come, first-served” sales that dominated the 2017–2018 ICO boom, Coinbase’s model gives investors a one-week window to submit purchase bids in USD Coin (USDC). When the window closes, an algorithm determines allocations, favoring smaller orders to promote wider token distribution. Coinbase also added a rule to curb speculative flipping: users selling within 30 days of listing may receive smaller allocations in future sales, rewarding long-term supporters. Only verified and compliant Coinbase users will be eligible to participate, while issuers will undergo vetting based on team credentials, token economics, and vesting structures. Projects launching through the platform will be required to lock their tokens for at least six months, with any over-the-counter or secondary sales needing Coinbase’s approval and public disclosure. The exchange said there will be no participation fees for users, with issuers paying a percentage fee on the funds raised. For Coinbase, the new platform extends a string of major product rollouts in recent weeks as the company deepens its on-chain and retail services. Earlier this month, Coinbase introduced DEX trading within its mobile app for U.S. users (excluding New York), allowing access to Base-native tokens before formal listings. @Coinbase has rolled out DEX trading directly within its mobile app for U.S. users, expanding the platform’s on-chain capabilities. #Coinbase #DEX https://t.co/rhNl9TEAuz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 9, 2025 It also activated staking for New York residents and applied for a National Trust Company Charter with the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. Coinbase Launches Token Sales Platform After $375M Echo Acquisition The token sales platform comes shortly after Coinbase’s $375 million acquisition of Echo , an on-chain capital-raising startup founded by crypto trader Cobie. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong envisions moving the complete startup lifecycle onchain after acquiring Echo for $375 million to democratize capital formation. #Coinbase #Echo #Startup https://t.co/5wsDdA065a — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 26, 2025 Echo’s infrastructure now forms the foundation of Coinbase’s new system, allowing direct project-to-community fundraising. The company said the integration will “create more accessible, efficient, and transparent capital markets” for crypto issuers. The timing coincides with a resurgence of public token offerings in the broader market. Last month, rival project MegaETH raised $50 million in five minutes through a sale hosted on Echo’s Sonar platform, attracting more than $300 million in pledges. Kraken and Andre Cronje’s Flying Tulip have also entered the new generation of ICOs, with compliant, regulated models. Unlike the 2017 ICO frenzy, when lax oversight led to widespread fraud, today’s market is marked by tighter regulation, institutional participation, and increased transparency. Coinbase’s initiative represents a bid to revive the spirit of community-driven fundraising while aligning it with compliance standards that were absent in the past. Monad, which has raised $248 million across prior funding rounds, including a $225 million Series A in 2024, will become the first project to sell tokens directly to U.S. retail investors in more than seven years. Source: tracxn.com Coinbase has confirmed that tokens launched through its sales platform will later be listed on its exchange, offering a seamless bridge from early access to secondary trading. The launch also follows Coinbase’s strong Q3 2025 earnings , reporting $432.6 million in net income, a fivefold increase from the same quarter last year. CEO Brian Armstrong said the company’s recent moves advance its “Everything Exchange” vision, one platform for every part of the crypto economy.

BNY Mellon’s latest report reveals an incredible projection: the stablecoin market could reach a staggering $3.6 trillion by 2030. This represents one of the most significant growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency space, fundamentally changing how institutions manage money and collateral. What Does the Stablecoin Market Projection Really Mean? The current $300 billion stablecoin market could quintuple to $1.5 trillion within just five years. This explosive growth reflects increasing institutional adoption and the practical utility of stablecoins in global finance. Moreover, tokenized deposits and digital money market funds are expected to contribute an additional $2.1 trillion to this expanding ecosystem. Why Are Institutions Embracing Stablecoins? Financial institutions are discovering multiple benefits that make stablecoins increasingly attractive: Enhanced collateral management for institutional operations Faster settlement times compared to traditional systems Reduced counterparty risk through blockchain transparency Global accessibility without traditional banking limitations How Will Tokenized Cash Transform Finance? Tokenized cash represents the next evolution in digital assets. BNY Mellon’s report highlights that tokenized deposits and digital MMFs will create new efficiency layers in financial markets. These innovations enable institutions to optimize their treasury operations while maintaining regulatory compliance. The transition toward tokenized assets marks a fundamental shift in how value moves globally. What Challenges Does the Stablecoin Market Face? Despite the optimistic projections, the stablecoin market must overcome several hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains a primary concern for widespread adoption. Additionally, technological infrastructure needs continued development to support massive scale. However, the potential rewards justify the ongoing investments and regulatory discussions happening worldwide. Practical Implications for Investors and Institutions The growth of the stablecoin market creates numerous opportunities. Institutional investors can leverage these assets for improved liquidity management. Meanwhile, traditional finance players must adapt to remain competitive. The convergence of traditional banking and digital assets is accelerating, creating new business models and revenue streams. The projected $3.6 trillion stablecoin market represents more than just numbers—it signals a fundamental restructuring of global finance. As institutions increasingly adopt these digital assets, we’re witnessing the birth of a new financial ecosystem that combines traditional reliability with blockchain innovation. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are stablecoins? Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, designed to maintain consistent value unlike volatile cryptocurrencies. How does tokenized cash differ from stablecoins? Tokenized cash represents traditional bank deposits on blockchain networks, while stablecoins are typically issued by private companies and backed by reserves. Why are institutions interested in stablecoins? Institutions value stablecoins for their settlement efficiency, transparency, and ability to optimize collateral management across global operations. What risks does the stablecoin market face? Key risks include regulatory uncertainty, reserve management transparency, and technological scalability challenges as adoption grows.

Today’s strong uptick favors a bullish XRP price prediction , and here’s why. Canary Capital and 21Shares finally filed Form 8(a).

Canary’s ETF will trade under the ticker symbol XRPC. Meanwhile, 21Shares does not seem to have received an official ticker yet. Thus far, the only spot ETF for XRP that has already been listed is the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR). Since its launch, it has brought in over $100 million in assets. XRP Price Prediction: 41% Upside Potential in the Short-Term The 4-hour chart shows that XRP broke a symmetrical triangle that had been forming since the token started its latest downtrend in late October. The $2.2 level acted as strong support lately. The market seems ready to take off after a brief period of turmoil. A break above $2.35 and the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) emphasizes the strength of the latest wave of buying pressure. As a result, we could witness a much stronger move toward, $3 at least if the uptrend breaks past the $2.65 area. The price should continue to move toward $3.60 if positive momentum gains further steam, indicating a 41% total gain ahead. Although a $1,000 XRP may still be out of reach this year, a move to $10 looks far more realistic as institutional adoption accelerates and real-world use cases expand. Beyond XRP, early-stage crypto presales are where the biggest upside lies — and few are making waves like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). The project has already raised more than $26 million to build a high-speed, Solana-powered Layer 2 for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Lets BTC Holders Earn Passive Income for the First Time For years, Bitcoin’s biggest limitation has been its lack of scalability and utility beyond simple transfers. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) changes that. By bringing Solana-level speed and efficiency to the Bitcoin network, it allows BTC holders to stake, lend, and earn yield directly on their assets — unlocking passive income opportunities that were once impossible on the original chain. As the presale nears completion, early buyers are positioning themselves ahead of what could be one of Bitcoin’s most transformative upgrades yet. With the help of the more efficient Solana blockchain, the Hyper L2 supports lighting-fast transaction speeds at a low cost to create the best environment for launching decentralized apps, meme coins, and payments platforms. Investors can safely send their BTC tokens to a designated Bitcoin wallet through the Hyper Bridge to get started. This allows them to access DeFi applications without leaving the Bitcoin OG network. As the demand for the solution progressively rises, analysts agree that the price of $HYPER could skyrocket. To grab this token at a discounted presale price, you can simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper official website and connect a compatible wallet like Best Wallet .

The draft is a significant step toward passing long-sought legislation that would help create clearer regulations in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies by giving the CFTC more authority. The bill was introduced by Senate Agriculture Chair John Boozman (R-Ark.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who have been working quietly behind closed doors for months to thaw the frigid relations between Democrats and Republicans over cryptocurrency. Their alliance is a rare example of bipartisan cooperation on an issue that has long been a source of political contention. Many parts of the bill remain in parentheses, a sign that negotiations are ongoing over issues such as consumer protections, the requirement for exchanges to register, and how to classify different types of digital tokens. Legislators say they are working through those sticking points so that a bill can move forward. The process is heavily influenced by the Agriculture Committee, which has oversight of the CFTC. Under this draft, the CFTC would have primary jurisdiction over digital commodities — a category that includes cryptocurrencies that are not deemed securities. CFTC moves to widen oversight If approved, the bill would grant the CFTC new authority to register and regulate digital commodity exchanges . To protect new kinds of businesses, these platforms would have to adhere to clearer standards for custody, trading transparency, auditing, and cybersecurity. Advocates for the CFTC expanding its role believe that the crypto market has grown too powerful and too large to allow for rampant speculation without oversight. Bitcoin and Ether alone are worth hundreds of billions of dollars. However, many trading platforms are currently operating under a fragmented or inconsistent regulatory framework. Industry groups have long complained about the lack of uniform regulations, which they say has led to enforcement by surprise, in which agencies penalize companies after the fact instead of providing clear guidance upfront. The draft attempts to address this by providing a predictable regulatory framework. However, not all digital currencies would be subject to the CFTC. Determining which tokens are securities — and therefore subject to the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — is among the biggest hurdles. The SEC has contended that many crypto tokens are more akin to investment contracts and should be classified as securities. Bipartisan negotiations persist as lawmakers seek a final agreement Legislation for the structure of the cryptocurrency market is being crafted across two top committees. The digital commodities and CFTC authorities provisions fall under the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Agriculture. Meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee has jurisdiction over the sections of the bill that deal with securities laws and the SEC. Republicans on the Banking Committee released their own market structure proposal earlier this year. Now they are negotiating with Democrats to draft a unified version. Those discussions are likely to cover how responsibilities are divided between the two financial regulators, a perennial source of friction in Washington. Crypto exchanges, financial firms, and even large asset managers have urged Congress to develop a clearer regulatory environment. A lack of clear regulations has deterred investment and driven innovation overseas, many argue — pointing to Europe and Singapore as other locations that have already established comprehensive digital asset frameworks. The bill is one of President Donald Trump’s priority items, which he considers advancing policies that ensure technological competitiveness while also protecting against fraud and market manipulation. If lawmakers reach a compromise, the bill would rank among the most significant pieces of crypto legislation in American history. It would determine which federal agency should have authority over different market segments, establish guidelines for how trading platforms operate, and implement protections that help insulate investors and shape how the United States competes with other countries when companies begin issuing a new form of money on a large scale. So, for now, it’s progress to see it at all. However, lawmakers concede that the most difficult part lies ahead. They need language that serves the interests of both Republicans and Democrats, reconciles the outright conflicting approaches of the SEC and CFTC on climate change, and appeals to an industry still deeply divided on the subject.

What Does 250 Million USDC Minted Actually Mean? When the USDC Treasury mints new coins, they’re essentially creating fresh digital dollars backed by real assets. This recent 250 million USDC minted represents one of the larger single transactions we’ve seen recently. The process involves Circle, the company behind USDC, creating new tokens that are fully collateralized by US dollar reserves. This substantial amount of USDC minted typically indicates one of several scenarios: Growing institutional demand for stablecoin exposure Preparation for major market movements or investments Increased liquidity needs across cryptocurrency exchanges Strategic positioning by large investors or institutions Why Should Crypto Investors Care About USDC Being Minted? The timing and scale of this 250 million USDC minted operation matter significantly. Large-scale minting events often precede important market developments. When substantial amounts of USDC get minted, it usually means big players are preparing to make moves in the crypto space. Moreover, this massive USDC minted transaction demonstrates the growing importance of stablecoins in today’s digital economy. These coins serve as the backbone for trading, lending, and decentralized finance operations across countless platforms. How Does Massive USDC Minting Affect Crypto Markets? When the treasury releases such a large amount of USDC minted into circulation, it creates several immediate effects. First, it increases available liquidity across exchanges and DeFi protocols. This additional capital can fuel trading activity and potentially influence price movements. Second, the sheer scale of this USDC minted transaction suggests confidence in the stablecoin ecosystem. Institutions don’t commit hundreds of millions without thorough due diligence and clear use cases for these digital dollars. What’s the Real Impact of This USDC Minted Event? The 250 million USDC minted represents more than just numbers on a blockchain. This development signals several key trends in cryptocurrency adoption. The growing institutional interest in stablecoins continues to validate the entire digital asset space. Furthermore, each time significant amounts of USDC get minted, it reinforces the coin’s position as a trusted digital dollar alternative. The transparency of these minting operations, verified by independent observers like Whale Alert, builds trust throughout the crypto community. Key Takeaways From the 250 Million USDC Minted This substantial USDC minted event teaches us valuable lessons about the current state of cryptocurrency markets. The continued growth of stablecoin usage demonstrates their crucial role in the digital economy. The scale of this particular USDC minted transaction highlights the maturing infrastructure supporting these assets. Most importantly, the 250 million USDC minted shows that despite market volatility, institutional players remain committed to building within the crypto ecosystem. Their actions speak louder than words, and this massive minting operation speaks volumes about their confidence in digital assets. FAQs About USDC Minting What does it mean when USDC is minted? When USDC is minted, new tokens are created by the USDC Treasury and added to circulation, backed by equivalent US dollar reserves held in regulated financial institutions. Why would someone mint 250 million USDC? Large institutions or exchanges typically mint substantial amounts of USDC to meet growing demand for stablecoin trading pairs, provide liquidity, or facilitate large transactions. Is minting new USDC inflationary? No, each USDC token is fully collateralized by real US dollars or equivalent assets, so minting doesn’t cause inflation in the traditional sense. How does USDC minting affect cryptocurrency prices? Increased USDC minting can indicate growing institutional interest and potentially lead to increased trading activity, though it doesn’t directly cause price changes. Who can mint USDC tokens? Only authorized institutions working with Circle can mint USDC tokens, ensuring proper collateralization and regulatory compliance. How transparent is the USDC minting process? The process is highly transparent, with minting events publicly reported and reserve holdings regularly audited by independent accounting firms. Found this analysis helpful?

Millions of tokens were burned last week as well, favoring a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction . In the past 24 hours, SHIB has jumped by 1.7%, above the $0.000010 mark. Meanwhile, trading volumes have increased by 14% to $160 million, accounting for nearly 3% of the token’s market cap. HOURLY SHIB UPDATE $SHIB Price: $0.00000975 (1hr 0.27% ▲ | 24hr -2.13% ▼ ) Market Cap: $5,744,495,553 (-2.15% ▼) Total Supply: 589,247,184,047,940 TOKENS BURNT Past 24Hrs: 919,747 (-78.31% ▼) Past 7 Days: 32,297,688 (-47.20% ▼) — Shibburn (@shibburn) November 9, 2025 Data from Shibburn, a website that tracks Shiba Inu’s automatic token burns, indicates that, in the past 7 days alone, 32.3 million tokens have been taken out of circulation forever. Although this represents a small percentage of the token’s circulating supply, it reflects that trading and network activity has been rising. Since the year started, SHIB has lost 52% of its value as the market. Nonetheless, Shiba Inu has one of the strongest communities in the meme coin space. Once altcoin season resumes, it could be one of the first tokens to benefit from a wave of positive momentum. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: 110% Gain Ahead If SHIB Breaks Out Of Its Price Channel The daily chart shows that SHIB just bounced off a key trend line support. This could mark the start of the token’s net leg up, as it eyes the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). This EMA coincides with the upper bound of Shiba Inu’s trend line resistance, increasing its relevance from a technical standpoint. If the price rises above this level, we could witness a strong move toward $0.00001650 first, and then to $0.000021, meaning a total upside potential of 110%. Moreover, if altcoin season kicks off again, we could expect a retest of the $0.000030 area that the token hit back in December. Although the top meme coins have lost their shine lately, early crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI), have kept attracting investors. With exchange listings coming soon, now could be a great time to get involved. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Aims to Build a Community of Risk-Taking ‘Degens’ Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a new Ethereum-based meme coin that creates a social hub for traders to share setups, flex wins, and compete in viral contests . It blends the hype of Doge with the energy of retail speculation, offering a space where users can swap ideas, spot trends early, and climb leaderboards through bold, high-reward plays. From trading competitions to meme-fueled community events, $MAXI is building a tribe of traders who treat the market like a game worth winning. The project gamifies trading with weekly challenges like Max Gains and Max Ripped, rewarding top ROI hunters with prizes and recognition. In addition, it will invest 25% of the presale’s proceeds in top meme coins and use the gains to finance additional marketing efforts. As cryptos recover, $MAXI could hit full send once its presale ends and listings start. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, visit the Maxi Doge official website , and connect your wallet (e.g., Best Wallet ). You can swap USDT or ETH to complete the transaction or use a traditional bank card instead. Buy $MAXI Here.

Prices have enjoyed some relief after last week’s losses, with Bitcoin up by 4% in the past 24 hours and Ethereum up by 6.5%. Other altcoins (e.g., World Liberty Financial, Pump.fun) have rebounded even more strongly, underlining their potential for when the market enters a bull rally. And some of the most promising alts right now are new presale coins, such as new ERC-20 token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE). PEPENODE has been gaining momentum in its sales, and given its exciting features, it could rally strongly once it launches. Crypto Price Prediction: Here’s One Crypto That Could 100x As of writing, PEPENODE has raised $2.1 million in its presale, which it kicked off in September. This figure indicates the interest that’s growing around PEPENODE, which is planning to launch crypto’s first-ever mine-to-earn platform. The new Mt.Rushmore is looking mighty fine https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/dr3W5CnVKo — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 9, 2025 This platform will provide users with the ability to build and operate their own virtual mining rigs, earning themselves considerable rewards – paid out in coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin – in the process. Given that traditional mining is now so expensive that only large companies or pools can engage it, PEPENODE is aiming to make mining more accessible to the wider crypto market. All users will need to acquire some PEPENODE , which they can use to buy more mining nodes. The more mining nodes they own, the greater their mining rewards will be. What’s bullish about this is that it will provide a strong incentive to acquire more PEPENODE, which in turn should help to push the token’s price up over time. Staking will also drive demand for PEPENODE, since holders will be able to stake the coin, which currently offers an APY of 614%. This all makes PEPENODE one of the more promising new meme tokens to hit the market in recent weeks, which is why it has such a promising crypto price prediction. It could potentially surge once it lists in the coming weeks, especially if it gains listings from big exchanges. How to Buy PEPENODE Before Presale Ends Investors may therefore want to join the PEPENODE presale before it ends, and before the coin’s price rises, since its launch could coincide with a big market rally. They can do so by visiting the official PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet and MetaMask. The token is currently selling at a price of $0.0011408, although this price will rise at regular intervals until the sale ends, so buyers should act quickly. As a coin, PEPENODE has a max supply of 210 billion tokens, with 35% of this supply going to its treasury, 35% to development, 15% to marketing, 7.5% to node rewards, and 7.5% to growth and listings.

The Bitcoin treasury and asset management firm added 7,525 BTC to its portfolio, sourced directly from the open market at a total purchase price of approximately $162 million. This latest purchase places Strive ahead of Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital , which owns approximately 6,894 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. The sale is the latest sign of a burgeoning arms race among publicly traded companies that view an investment in Bitcoin as a means to increase their holdings. It is a harbinger of a larger macro trend, where investment institutions and companies are starting to view Bitcoin as a key treasury asset, especially amid fluctuations in monetary policy, which is driving further global interest in digital reserves. Strive dips into IPO funds to grow Bitcoin treasury Strive purchased the asset with proceeds from its recent initial public offering of new issue SATA noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, which was offered at $80 per share. It was an oversubscribed IPO that had been upsized before going public — a strong signal of demand from institutional investors, if there ever was one. In a press release , Strive CEO Matt Cole stated that the move to perpetual preferred equity, rather than selling common stock or corporate debt, is an “innovative model” for corporate Bitcoin buying and holding. The offering provides Strive with an opportunity to expand its Bitcoin portfolio while ensuring that ASST’s common stockholders are not diluted. Cole said it was a “make or break” moment for the company. He added that Strive is the first Bitcoin treasury firm to reach this milestone through strategic investments in perpetual preferred equity, demonstrating that Bitcoin can serve as a disciplined foundation for long-term value creation. Corporate buying of Bitcoin has been active across all sectors. Among those that have increased their holdings in recent weeks are the digital currency company CleanSpark, Trump Media and Technology Group, formed by Donald J. Trump, and Tesla. Institutional inflows to Bitcoin ETFs and structured investment vehicles are also continuing to increase, with unconfirmed reports that JPMorgan has been allocated $340 million of BlackRock’s BTC ETF. For Strive, the rise in Saudi Arabia is just the first snowflake before their intended accumulation avalanche. The company has indicated it’s likely to make more purchases of Bitcoin if market conditions remain conducive to its corporate treasury model. SATA’s dividend strategy delivers a 12% return on capital The SATA preferreds pay an adjustable payout, which, in its simplest form, is intended to yield 12% per year, known as the Return of Capital (ROC). That permits payouts to be handled differently for tax purposes if there is an advantage to any given investor. Strive said that it would adjust the dividend rate to keep the stock trading between $95 and $105 per share. SATA is what CIO Ben Werkman called a financial vehicle that merges the yield-stabilizing nature of a conservative type of fixed income with Bitcoin’s capital dollarization efficiency. He said the design is intended to provide investors with a predictable yield, while enabling Strive to grow its Bitcoin treasury over time. Bitcoin’s liquidity, transparency, and round-the-clock global trading make it an attractive asset for treasury-backed yield strategies, said Jeff Walton, the company’s Chief Risk Officer. Walton stressed that Bitcoin’s track record and market structure enable Strive to model risk and return more easily than in many alternative asset classes. With the most recent acquisition, Strive now sits just below GD Culture Group and above Galaxy Digital in terms of corporate Bitcoin holdings. The velocity with which the company has grown is a testament to its unabashed approach and willingness to place Bitcoin at the heart of its capital formation model. At a time when Bitcoin-supported corporate structures are gaining popularity worldwide, it is reasonable to assume that Strive’s approach will be of interest not only to traditional market investors but also to crypto-oriented players.

Die Aussicht auf Stabilität und neue Finanzhilfen sorgt für bessere Stimmung an den Märkten. Davon kann besonders BTC profitieren, der deutlich an Stärke gewinnt. Der wochenlange Stillstand in der US-Regierung sorgt für Unsicherheit – doch nun scheint sich endlich etwas zu bewegen. Eine mögliche Einigung im Kongress lässt Investoren aufatmen. Besonders der Kryptomarkt reagiert spürbar: BTC legt kräftig zu. Die Hoffnung auf Stabilität und frisches Geld weckt die Risikofreude der Anleger – und könnte den Startschuss für eine neue Rally bedeuten. US-Senat stimmt für Öffnung – Anleger atmen auf Ein wichtiger Schritt im US-Senat sorgt für neue Hoffnung: Am Sonntag stimmten die Senatoren für einen Gesetzentwurf, der die Regierung wieder öffnen soll. Dieses Signal hat die Stimmung an den Finanzmärkten deutlich verbessert. Viele Experten sind überzeugt, dass ein Ende des Shutdowns Unsicherheit beseitigt und die Risikobereitschaft stärkt. Besonders der Kryptomarkt, der oft auf politische Signale reagiert, zeigt positive Reaktionen. The US government shutdown is ended. House Speaker Johnson gives briefing.Some Democrats finally joined the Republicans to end the pains and nightmare. pic.twitter.com/BgeqYw7Wjw — The Knight News (@Knight981311) November 10, 2025 Laut Ryan Lee, Chefanalyst bei Bitget, könnte das Ende des Stillstands kurzfristig mehr Vertrauen schaffen und die Liquidität erhöhen. Das würde Bitcoin und anderen Kryptowährungen helfen, ihren Aufwärtstrend fortzusetzen. Die Aussicht auf politische Stabilität sorgt also auch bei digitalen Anlagen für frischen Schwung. Wetten auf baldige Einigung nehmen zu Auch Prognoseplattformen wie Myriad, betrieben vom Mutterunternehmen von Decrypt, zeigen die wachsende Zuversicht. Nutzer dort schätzen die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass der Shutdown bis zum 15. November endet, inzwischen auf 91 Prozent – doppelt so hoch wie noch vor wenigen Tagen. Dieser Optimismus überträgt sich direkt auf den Kryptomarkt. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass Bitcoin bald die Marke von 115.000 Dollar erreicht, liegt nun bei 68 Prozent. Anleger glauben wieder an steigende Kurse – und das spiegelt sich in höheren Handelsvolumen und steigender Nachfrage wider. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Trump kündigt mögliche Geldzahlungen an Für zusätzlichen Auftrieb sorgte ein Beitrag von Präsident Donald Trump auf Truth Social. Er schrieb, dass jeder Bürger eine Zahlung von mindestens 2000 Dollar erhalten solle – ausgenommen seien Besserverdiener. Diese Nachricht erinnert viele an die Corona-Stimulus-Checks von 2021, die damals für einen großen Geldzufluss in den Kryptomarkt sorgten. Solche direkten Zahlungen erhöhen meist den Konsum und das Vertrauen in die Wirtschaft. Analyst Ryan Lee meint, dass dies den Appetit auf riskantere Anlagen wie Aktien und Kryptowährungen stärken würde. Schon jetzt ist die Stimmung an den Märkten deutlich optimistischer als noch vor einer Woche. Finanzminister bremst Erwartungen Trotz der Euphorie trat Finanzminister Scott Bessent auf die Bremse. In einem Fernsehinterview erklärte er, dass die angekündigte „Dividende“ möglicherweise keine direkten Schecks, sondern Steuererleichterungen sein könnten. Das würde zwar weniger sofortiges Geld in Umlauf bringen, aber immer noch die Kaufkraft stärken. Auch wenn die Maßnahmen kleiner ausfallen könnten, bleibt der positive Effekt auf die Stimmung bestehen. Viele Anleger hoffen weiterhin auf Impulse, die direkt in die Wirtschaft fließen. Der Kryptomarkt reagiert sensibel auf solche Zeichen – und hat den Optimismus bereits eingepreist. Ausblick: Wie weit kann Bitcoin noch steigen? Analysten blicken nun gespannt auf die kommenden Wochen. Wenn der Shutdown tatsächlich bald endet, erwarten viele eine Fortsetzung der Rally. Jay Jo von Tiger Research rechnet mit weiter steigenden Kursen, falls zusätzlich Finanzhilfen fließen. Mehr Liquidität im Markt bedeutet oft steigende Nachfrage – auch bei Kryptowährungen. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Trotzdem mahnen Experten zur Vorsicht. Eine anhaltend hohe Inflation, geopolitische Spannungen oder ein stärkerer Dollar könnten den Aufschwung abbremsen. Dennoch bleiben die Prognosen ehrgeizig : Tiger Research sieht BTC zum Jahresende bei bis zu 200.000 Dollar, während Bitget eine Spanne zwischen 90.000 und 160.000 Dollar erwartet. Viel hängt davon ab, wie die US-Notenbank ihre Zinspolitik gestaltet. BTC Hyper: Mehr technische Tiefe, mehr Zukunftschancen Der Kryptomarkt steht vor einer spannenden Wende: Mit dem angekündigten Ende des drohenden US-Government Shutdowns kommt neues Vertrauen in die Märkte, und besonders bei Bitcoin (BTC) könnte damit eine neue Ära beginnen. BTC hat sich als sicherer Hafen etabliert – durch seine Dezentralität, starke Netzwerksicherheit und breite institutionelle Akzeptanz. Genau darauf setzt Bitcoin Hyper auf: Es greift die Stärke von Bitcoin auf und kombiniert sie mit modernster Technik. Bitcoin Hyper verwendet die Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) – eine leistungsstarke Blockchain-Engine, bekannt für hohe Transaktionsraten – und verbindet diese mit Bitcoins Sicherheitsanker. Über eine sogenannte Canonical Bridge wird BTC auf Layer 1 gesichert, gleichzeitig wird auf der Layer-2-Kette von Hyper eine Wrapped-Version erstellt, die dann blitzschnell, günstig und in hoher Zahl bewegt werden kann. Damit werden Smart Contracts, dApps, DeFi-Funktionen und Zahlungsanwendungen möglich – Dinge, die Bitcoin alleine bislang technisch limitiert sind. Langfristige Perspektive: Wenn Bitcoin gewinnt, könnte Bitcoin Hyper mitziehen Wenn Bitcoin durch institutionelle Investments, ETFs und eine gestiegene Marktakzeptanz weiter an Bedeutung gewinnt – und die kürzlich positive politische Signalgebung in den USA ein solches Umfeld begünstigt –, dann wächst nicht nur der Wert von BTC, sondern auch das Ökosystem rund um BTC. Hyper steht genau in diesem Ökosystem: Es bietet die technische Erweiterung, die Bitcoin braucht, um von Wertaufbewahrung zu aktiver Nutzung überzugehen. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! Mit dem Ausbau von BTC als stabiler Wertanlage und Zahlungsnetzwerk steigt auch der Bedarf nach Lösungen, die Bitcoin nutzbar machen – nicht nur als digitales Gold, sondern als Funktion in echten Anwendungen. Insofern ergibt sich für Hyper ein langfristiges Potenzial: Wenn Bitcoin wächst, gewinnt auch die Infrastruktur – und $HYPER als Token dieser Infrastruktur – an Bedeutung, Nutzen und damit potenzieller Performance. Natürlich gilt: Jede Investition bringt Risiken mit sich und technische Versprechen müssen sich erst in der Praxis bewähren.

Die XRP-Community feiert das als lange erwartete Anerkennung durch die Wall Street. Doch Experten fragen sich, ob die Worte wirklich für das ganze Unternehmen BlackRock gelten. Was viele Krypto-Fans seit Jahren hoffen, scheint nun Wirklichkeit zu werden: Die großen Finanzhäuser öffnen sich der Blockchain-Technologie. Auf der Ripple Swell 2025 Konferenz sprach ein BlackRock-Manager offen über Ripples Bedeutung – und brachte damit die XRP-Gemeinschaft in Feierlaune. Doch hinter der Euphorie stehen noch einige Fragezeichen. BlackRock spricht über Ripple und die Zukunft der Blockchain Die Ripple Swell 2025 Konferenz in New York hat einen Moment geschaffen, der vielen in Erinnerung bleiben wird. Maxwell Stein, Mitglied des Digital-Assets-Teams von BlackRock, sprach auf der Bühne über die Zukunft der Finanzwelt – und über Ripple. Er sagte, der Markt sei nun bereit, Blockchain im großen Stil einzusetzen. Dabei lobte er Ripple als wichtigen Teil dieser Entwicklung. Stein erklärte, dass Ripple bereits Anleihen, Stablecoins und andere Vermögenswerte auf der Blockchain abgebildet habe. Diese Technologie könne bald Kapitalströme in Billionenhöhe bewegen. Für viele im Publikum klang das wie der Beweis, dass Blockchain nicht mehr nur ein Traum, sondern Realität ist – und Ripple einer der Motoren dieser Bewegung. XRP-Community feiert den großen Moment Für die Anhänger von XRP war diese Aussage fast wie ein Ritterschlag. Jahrelang wurde Ripple als Nischenprojekt belächelt. Nun lobt einer der größten Finanzverwalter der Welt öffentlich seine Arbeit. Die Stimmung in der Community war entsprechend ausgelassen. BREAKING: White House Crypto Chief Says “Bitcoin Is Not XRP” — and “Tens of Trillions Are Coming by The Year End” at Ripple Swell This might’ve been the most electric interview of @Ripple Swell 2025. Ripple CEO @bgarlinghouse sat across from @patrickjwitt Executive… pic.twitter.com/EUy3QGxus5 — Diana (@InvestWithD) November 5, 2025 Auf der Plattform X (früher Twitter) verbreiteten sich begeisterte Posts im Minutentakt. Viele nannten Steins Worte den Beweis, dass XRP endlich ernst genommen wird. Für sie war es ein Symbol: Die Brücke zwischen alter Finanzwelt und neuer Blockchain-Ökonomie ist nicht mehr nur Theorie – sie entsteht gerade. Von Experiment zu Standard: Blockchain wird ernst genommen Steins Worte zeigten auch, wie sehr sich die Sicht auf Blockchain verändert hat. Noch vor wenigen Jahren galt sie als riskante Spielerei für Technik-Freaks. Heute sprechen führende Finanzmanager von ihr als kommender Standard. BlackRock hat damit – gewollt oder nicht – eine neue Botschaft gesendet: Die Zeit des Zögerns ist vorbei. Ripple wird so immer mehr zu einem Symbol für den Wandel. Statt nur Transaktionen in der Krypto-Welt zu ermöglichen, arbeitet das Unternehmen daran, die Finanzinfrastruktur selbst zu verändern. Was früher utopisch klang, könnte bald Alltag sein: globale Geldströme, die über Blockchain laufen. Rechtliche Fragen bremsen den Jubel Nicht alle sehen das Lob so unkritisch. Der australische Anwalt und XRP-Fan Bill Morgan fragte öffentlich, ob Stein im Namen von BlackRock oder nur privat gesprochen habe. Diese Frage ist wichtig, denn eine offizielle Stellungnahme von BlackRock wäre ein starkes Signal für die gesamte Branche.

Minutes after the interview, analysts spotted… pic.twitter.com/3pGoI5WPrx — COACHTY (@TheRealTRTalks) November 10, 2025 Sollte es sich aber nur um eine persönliche Meinung handeln, bleibt die Bedeutung begrenzt – auch wenn sie symbolisch wichtig ist. Viele Beobachter weisen darauf hin, dass rechtliche Unsicherheit weiterhin eine Hürde bleibt. Zwischen Begeisterung und Realität liegt noch ein weiter Weg. Regulierung als Schlüssel für die Zukunft Auch Adena Friedman, die Chefin der Nasdaq, sprach auf der Konferenz über den Reifeprozess des Marktes. Sie sagte, dass die Finanzwelt zwar interessiert sei, aber noch klare Regeln brauche, bevor sie voll einsteigen könne. Banken testen bereits tokenisierte Anleihen und Stablecoins, doch ohne eindeutige Gesetze bleibt das Risiko groß. Ihre Worte erinnerten daran, dass technologische Fortschritte allein nicht reichen. Vertrauen und Regulierung sind nötig, damit Institutionen wirklich aufspringen. Die Swell 2025 zeigte damit nicht nur Begeisterung, sondern auch die Hürden auf dem Weg zur echten Integration von Blockchain in die Finanzwelt. Fazit: Ripple steht im Rampenlicht – aber der Weg ist noch lang Die Swell 2025 machte deutlich, dass Ripple längst kein Außenseiter mehr ist. Mit der Unterstützung eines BlackRock-Managers hat das Unternehmen einen Meilenstein erreicht. Doch der Krypto-Markt bleibt volatil: Der XRP-Preis fiel zuletzt um über vier Prozent auf 2,21 US-Dollar. Trotzdem scheint der Trend klar. Blockchain ist dabei, die Finanzwelt zu verändern – und Ripple ist mittendrin. Was als Vision begann, wird Schritt für Schritt Wirklichkeit. Vielleicht war die Swell 2025 der Moment, in dem die Finanzelite begriff, dass Blockchain gekommen ist, um zu bleiben. Bitcoin Hyper: Gewinner einer neuen Phase der Krypto-Adoption Die zunehmende Institutionalisierung von Ripple (XRP) zeigt, dass Kryptowährungen endgültig in der Finanzwelt angekommen sind. Immer mehr Banken und große Investoren nutzen Ripple, um internationale Zahlungen schneller und günstiger abzuwickeln. Das stärkt das Vertrauen in die gesamte Branche – und besonders in Bitcoin, der für viele weiterhin das sicherste und verlässlichste Krypto-Asset bleibt. Wenn Banken und Institutionen verstärkt auf Blockchain-Technologie setzen, steigt auch die Nachfrage nach Bitcoin als digitales Wertaufbewahrungsmittel. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! Bitcoin Hyper: Aufgebaut auf Vertrauen und Innovation Bitcoin Hyper ist eng mit Bitcoin verbunden und profitiert von diesem wachsenden Vertrauen. Das Projekt nutzt die Sicherheit des Bitcoin-Netzwerks und kombiniert sie mit der Geschwindigkeit und Flexibilität von Solana. So entsteht eine Erweiterung, die Bitcoin nicht ersetzt, sondern verbessert: schnellere Transaktionen, geringere Gebühren und echte Alltagstauglichkeit. Wenn durch Ripple immer mehr institutionelle Investoren und Banken in den Kryptomarkt einsteigen, wächst auch die Bedeutung von Bitcoin – und damit die Chancen für Bitcoin Hyper, als moderne und praktische Ergänzung mitzuwachsen.

But beneath the surface of this seemingly straightforward enterprise AI expansion lies a disturbing pattern of circular money flows that could undermine the entire AI investment ecosystem. As cryptocurrency investors who understand real economic value creation, we need to ask: are these massive AI deals generating genuine innovation or just moving capital in circles? What Are AI Investments Really Creating? The SoftBank-OpenAI partnership represents more than just another corporate collaboration. SoftBank, already a major investor in OpenAI through its Vision Fund, is now both investor and customer in the same ecosystem. This creates a troubling scenario where investment returns might be artificially inflated through internal transactions rather than genuine market demand. The SoftBank OpenAI Partnership Breakdown The Crystal Intelligence joint venture aims to sell enterprise AI tools in Japan, but the financial structure reveals deeper complexities: SoftBank invests in OpenAI through Vision Fund OpenAI forms joint venture with SoftBank SoftBank becomes both investor and primary customer Revenue flows back to OpenAI, potentially boosting valuation Circular Money Flows in Major AI Deals This pattern isn’t unique to SoftBank and OpenAI. Several major AI investments show similar circular characteristics: Company Investment Structure Circular Elements Microsoft-OpenAI Strategic partnership with equity Microsoft both invests and uses services Amazon-Anthropic Cloud credits for equity Revenue flows back through AWS usage Google-Various AI Startups Investment plus cloud partnerships Multiple circular revenue streams Measuring Real Economic Value in AI Genuine economic value creation in AI should demonstrate: Independent customer adoption beyond investors Clear productivity improvements for end-users Sustainable revenue models not dependent on circular flows Tangible cost savings or revenue generation Enterprise AI Adoption Challenges While Crystal Intelligence targets Japanese enterprises, real adoption faces significant hurdles: Integration complexity with existing systems Data privacy and security concerns ROI measurement difficulties Employee training and change management The Future of AI Investment Sustainability The current circular money patterns raise serious questions about long-term sustainability. As cryptocurrency investors know from previous market cycles, artificial valuation inflation eventually corrects. The AI sector must transition from circular investments to genuine value creation to avoid a similar fate. FAQs About AI Investments and Circular Money What is SoftBank’s investment history with OpenAI? SoftBank has invested significantly in OpenAI through its Vision Fund , creating the circular money concerns discussed in this article. How does the OpenAI partnership with Microsoft compare? OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft shows similar circular characteristics, with Microsoft being both investor and primary cloud provider. What is the Crystal Intelligence joint venture? Crystal Intelligence is the 50-50 joint venture between SoftBank and OpenAI focused on enterprise AI tools in the Japanese market. How can investors identify circular money patterns? Look for investments where the same entities appear as both investors and customers, creating artificial revenue streams that don’t represent genuine market demand. What are the risks of circular AI investments? The primary risk is valuation inflation based on artificial metrics, which can lead to significant corrections when genuine market demand fails to materialize. The circular money problem in AI investments represents a fundamental challenge to the sector’s long-term viability. As we’ve seen in cryptocurrency markets, artificial valuation inflation eventually meets reality. The AI industry must prioritize genuine economic value creation over financial engineering to avoid repeating history’s investment mistakes.

For XRP holders, the shift could prove pivotal. As the Fed prepares to inject fresh reserves, the XRP could once again benefit from an environment of expanding liquidity and easing financial conditions. XRP holders are paying close attention as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signals that the Fed will soon add reserves to its balance sheet, subtly setting the stage for the next phase of US monetary policy where digital reserves are not optional. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull has noted on X that President Donald Trump had recently mentioned that the US maintains a crypto stockpile, and XRP was among the assets held. Why Fed Reserve Growth Could Be The Spark XRP Has Been Waiting For The claims that Ripple is not just another startup, but a US-born solution to a quadrillion-dollar global payment challenge. This infrastructure is led by individuals who have met with presidents and policy architects like Brad Garlinghouse and Stuart Alderoty. Meanwhile, XRP has already held legal clarity and enterprise utility in the US. “What if XRP is not merely surviving regulation, but being positioned for integration?” XFinanceBull asked.

A publisher, Wilberforce Theophilus, highlighted that the Ripple XRP US patent number 10,902,416, and the US patent number 11,998,003 make XRP the undisputed cryptocurrency in the world. The publisher predicts that the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will eventually rest on the Chainlink ledger, and every asset will be hosted on the XRPL. At the same time, LINEA will serve as the secure messaging system connecting banks, while HBAR will provide the security layer that will underpin the entire network. These protocols form a coordinated framework to position XRP as the reserve asset currency, and its market capitalization could multiply exponentially. XRP was designed to replace the old financial system. Theophilus concluded that “once everything is properly positioned, individuals will be glad they joined crypto at this stage,” and he will be writing on why there are several regulations coming from the white house.” How XRP Is Inheriting The World’s Payment Rails The XRP Ledger is entering an unexpected moment that the crypto market has not seen before. JackTheRippler has stated that XRP holders should pay attention that the true value is about to be unlocked beyond imagination. He claims that a clear view of what’s unfolding will provide insights into why $10,000 and even $35,000 per XRP is not just a fantasy, but is entirely possible.

54250815,624642,1762819258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54250815.jpeg,"Old Bitcoin Whales Exit, New Whales Enter — The Market’s Natural Rotation in Action",https://bitcoinist.com/old-bitcoin-whales-exit-new-whales-enter-rotation/,"Bitcoin is showing early signs of recovery after last week’s sharp dip below the $100,000 mark. Bulls have managed to hold the line, but momentum remains cautious as the market digests a complex mix of profit-taking and structural change. According to top analyst Darkfost, the recent selling activity among long-term holders — or “old whales” — is not necessarily a bearish sign but a natural part of the market’s evolution. “Yes, it’s true that many old whales are waking up and selling,” Darkfost explains. “But that’s happening simply because they can now.” In previous cycles, Bitcoin’s smaller market capitalization and lack of deep institutional liquidity made it difficult for large holders to exit without causing severe price disruptions. Now, thanks to the growth of ETFs, deep asset tokenization (DAT), and even government-level participation, these investors can offload large amounts of BTC more efficiently. This ongoing distribution phase is seen as a healthy process that redistributes coins across new market participants, building a stronger, more liquid foundation for the next leg of growth. While short-term volatility persists, analysts argue that this transition reflects a maturing Bitcoin ecosystem capable of absorbing large flows without structural damage. Whales Resume Accumulation After Temporary Distribution According to Darkfost, the broader on-chain picture reveals that Bitcoin’s whales — large entities holding significant BTC balances — remain active participants in this cycle, and many continue to accumulate. The 1-Year Change in Whale Holdings , a key long-term metric, has been steadily increasing since 2023, suggesting that despite recent volatility and headline-driven fear, large players are not abandoning the market. Zooming into recent activity, however, the data tells a nuanced story. After a strong August rally, when Bitcoin climbed toward $123,000, whale holdings experienced a sharp drawdown — falling from roughly 398,000 BTC to 185,000 BTC by October. This period aligned with profit-taking and renewed selling from older cohorts, as prices reached psychologically significant resistance zones. Yet, by early November, the trend shifted again. Whale accumulation resumed, with holdings rising to about 294,000 BTC. This rebound suggests that while some early whales are distributing, a new wave of capital — possibly institutional or strategic investors — is entering the market at these levels. Darkfost emphasizes that this structure is very different from the late 2021 distribution phase, which preceded a prolonged bear market. Instead, the current cycle reflects a rotational accumulation process, where selling by older whales is offset by steady demand from newer, high-conviction participants. This dynamic points to an evolving, more mature Bitcoin market capable of absorbing distribution without triggering systemic weakness. Bitcoin Regains Ground After Sharp Correction Bitcoin is showing early signs of strength after last week’s sharp correction pushed prices briefly below the $100,000 level. On the 4-hour chart, BTC has rebounded firmly, reclaiming the $106,000 area after forming a short-term base near $101,000. This recovery follows a period of heavy selling pressure, which flushed out over-leveraged traders and helped reset market positioning. Price action now shows BTC testing the $106,500–$107,000 resistance zone, which aligns with a previous local breakdown point from early November. A confirmed breakout above this level could open the door for a move toward $110,000, though volume remains modest, signaling cautious participation from traders. On the downside, $103,000 serves as immediate support, while a more significant demand zone lies between $100,000–$101,000, where buyers previously defended the market with high volume. Holding this range would reinforce the case for a gradual recovery.

This explosive growth represents more than just numbers—it’s transforming how businesses innovate and compete in the AI era. How Lovable AI Coding is Reshaping Corporate Innovation The Stockholm-based platform has seen user numbers surge from 2.3 million active users in July to nearly 8 million today, representing one of the fastest-growing AI tools in history. What’s driving this massive adoption? According to CEO Anton Osika, it’s the platform’s ability to democratize software creation for the 99% of people who don’t know how to code. Startup Growth That Defies Expectations Lovable’s metrics tell a story of unprecedented startup growth: 100,000 new products built daily on the platform $228 million in total funding raised $1.8 billion valuation from recent $200 million round Rumors of potential $5 billion valuation from new investors Despite questions about the sustainability of the vibe coding trend, Osika points to strong retention metrics, including more than 100% net dollar retention, indicating users are spending more over time. Corporate Employees Driving Enterprise Adoption The platform’s user base spans from Fortune 500 companies to individual creators. More than half of Fortune 500 companies now use Lovable to “supercharge creativity” among their corporate employees. The platform enables rapid prototyping, allowing teams to test ideas with users before committing significant resources.

This increase follows the announcement that the company’s assets under management have escalated by 76%, reaching a total of $20.8 billion for the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Apart from this report, eToro made public a 28% surge in net contribution, reaching $215 million. Reports indicated that this figure is up from $167 million recorded the previous year. Additionally, the eToro board approved a share repurchase plan of up to $150 million, including an initial accelerated tranche of approximately $50 million. eToro shifts its focus towards developing new products and innovations eToro’s net income following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a set of standardized regulations and guidelines for financial accounting and reporting used in the United States, soared by 48% to reach $57 million. On the other hand, the number of funded accounts increased by 16%, attaining a total of 3.73 million. This growth was partly attributed to the integration of Australia’s Spaceship app, a micro-investing and wealth management application. Following these moves, reports dated Monday, November 10, revealed that eToro’s stock climbed about 7% during intraday trading on Nasdaq. This was after the company’s users made 5 million cryptocurrency trades last month. The cryptocurrency trades marked an increase from the same time last year. In the meantime, the average investment for each trade skyrocketed by 52% to reach $320 while interest-earning assets grew to $8.7 billion, demonstrating a 55% year-over-year increase. In light of this significant accomplishment, eToro sought to generate further excitement in the crypto ecosystem with news of the launch of its crypto wallet. According to the company, the introduction is expected within the next few quarters. According to reliable sources, this crypto wallet will provide users with access to tokenization, lending products, and prediction markets. Yoni Assia, the CEO of eToro, commented on the topic of discussion. Assia outlined the company’s current focus, stating that its goal is to develop new products and embrace innovations. Concerning innovation, the CEO stated that eToro will particularly focus on sectors such as AI and copy trading. To demonstrate the company’s commitment to solidifying its position as a leader in finance, eToro recently launched Tori, an AI-driven analyst that offers customized investment insight. Trump’s pro-crypto stance encourages eToro to explore the crypto ecosystem In September 2024, eToro ceased trading most cryptocurrencies in the US following a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also stated that it had agreed to pay $1.5 million to resolve allegations that it operated an unregistered brokerage and clearing agency through its cryptocurrency platform. However, following the growing adoption of cryptocurrency among nations, analysts realized that the perspective towards crypto has gradually changed. Their finding was released after it was discovered that the US government’s view on digital assets had evolved since eToro’s incident. Sources acknowledged that President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance is behind this positive change in perspective towards the crypto world. Trump had pledged to make his country a world leader in developing crypto and AI innovation. In September, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said, “most crypto tokens are not securities.” These efforts created a conducive environment for crypto-related activities. As a result, eToro outlined plans to tokenize 100 top US-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on ERC-20 tokens, which will be available for 24/7 trading on the Ethereum blockchain starting in July. The news came after Robinhood launched a layer-2 network on Arbitrum to tokenize US stocks, allowing European investors to trade over 200 tokenized equities and ETFs, available 24/5.

The number beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.29 billion, based on figures from LSEG. But despite the revenue surge, the company still recorded a net loss of $110 million, though that’s down significantly from the $360 million loss CoreWeave reported in Q3 last year. Earnings for the quarter came in at a loss of 22 cents per share. The numbers reflect a company growing fast, spending hard, and trying to prove it belongs at the center of the AI infrastructure race. The business, headquartered in the U.S., rents out Nvidia GPUs to companies building out AI tools. CoreWeave has secured customers like Google and Microsoft, both of whom rely heavily on the compute power it provides. That demand helped balloon CoreWeave’s contract backlog to $55.6 billion, up from $42.3 billion just three months earlier. The company also reported having 2.9 gigawatts of contracted power, up from 2.2 gigawatts at the end of Q2. Deals with OpenAI and Meta push backlog past $55 billion In Q3, CoreWeave announced a $6.5 billion expansion of its contract with OpenAI, a company known for developing ChatGPT. It also signed a new six-year agreement with Meta worth up to $14.2 billion. These deals, alongside a new contract signed with what CoreWeave called “a leading hyperscaler”, are what pushed the revenue backlog up by over 30% in a single quarter. The name of that sixth hyperscaler was not disclosed. CoreWeave’s public debut came earlier this year, when it listed on the Nasdaq in March, selling shares at $40 each. On Monday, those same shares closed at $105.61, reflecting a 164% return since the IPO. That’s more than five times the 32% gain in the Nasdaq index during the same stretch. But even with that performance, CoreWeave’s stock dropped in extended trading after the earnings were released. The company tried to expand further in Q3 with a $9 billion proposed acquisition of data center infrastructure operator Core Scientific. But that plan collapsed after Core Scientific’s shareholders voted against it. That rejection left CoreWeave without a key expansion path, despite the momentum it had been building. Michael Intrator, who co-founded CoreWeave and now serves as both CEO and Chairman, said the company had delivered “an exceptional third quarter” and praised its team for hitting new records. “We almost doubled our revenue backlog to more than $55 billion,” Michael said in the earnings release. He added that the company was growing by focusing on infrastructure, capacity, customer expansion, and new software tools. Kerrisdale Capital attacks CoreWeave’s valuation and revenue model Not everyone is impressed. Kerrisdale Capital, a New York-based short seller, published a scathing report last month accusing CoreWeave of being “the poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble.” They dismissed the company’s growth as cosmetic, writing that CoreWeave is nothing more than “an undifferentiated, heavily levered GPU rental scheme.” In the report, Kerrisdale criticized CoreWeave for being overly reliant on Microsoft, which they claimed accounts for 70% of the company’s revenue. The firm also said Microsoft had recently declined to extend its business with CoreWeave, choosing instead to sign a larger contract with Nebius, a competitor. Kerrisdale described this customer concentration as a serious risk for investors. They also pointed to CoreWeave’s rapid transformation from a crypto mining startup in a founder’s grandfather’s garage, just three years ago, to a self-declared “AI hyperscaler” now valued at $75 billion. Kerrisdale said this jump lacked financial support and sustainability. The short seller went further, slamming CoreWeave’s economics. Their report stated the company “generates returns below its cost of capital,” which they said results in destroying shareholder value instead of creating it. They assigned a fair value target of $10 per share, a number that would imply a 90% drop from the current trading price. CoreWeave has not publicly addressed the Kerrisdale report in detail. But with deals stacking up and critics circling, the company is now caught between wild growth and deep skepticism.

The move has generated a lot of buzz within the crypto community as it finally addresses long-standing restrictions that had limited ETPs’ ability to generate and on-chain yields to potential customers. Today @USTreasury and the @IRSnews issued new guidance giving crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) a clear path to stake digital assets and share staking rewards with their retail investors. This move increases investor benefits, boosts innovation, and keeps America the… — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) November 10, 2025 Treasury Secretary makes the announcement The guidance was announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent via a post on X, and it laid emphasis on how the move gives ETP issuers a “clear path” to stake digital assets on behalf of their holders. In the past, the U.S. limited how ETPs could generate on-chain yield, restricting them primarily to holding spot assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, the new guidance changes that as it effectively allows issuers to provide staking-based returns—similar to how traditional funds offer dividends—while ensuring transparency and accountability. Industry analysts expect the move to accelerate institutional adoption of proof-of-stake assets and stimulate demand for staking-based ETPs . It also places the United States ahead of other major financial jurisdictions in formalizing staking within its regulatory perimeter. According to Bessent, the policy is a significant step toward expanding investor participation in digital assets without compromising on oversight. “This move increases investor benefits, boosts innovation, and keeps America the global leader in digital asset and blockchain technology,” he wrote. The announcement comes as the U.S. inches towards ending the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Record-breaking U.S. government shutdown nears end As of the time of this writing, the government shutdown in the U.S. has lasted 41 days, beating the previous record of 35 days, which was set over five years ago, but there is now an end in sight. Late on Sunday, November 9, the Senate advanced a bipartisan compromise bill in a key procedural vote, the first major breakthrough after 14 failed attempts, which paves the way for the government to reopen as soon as later this week. “After 40 long days, I’m hopeful we can bring this shutdown to an end,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said shortly before the vote. The 60-40 vote to take the first step toward ending the shutdown came hours after a considerable number of Democrats agreed to support a package that would fund multiple agencies and programs for the full fiscal year, and all others until January 30, 2026. In exchange, the Trump administration promised to rehire government workers fired at the start of the funding lapse, and the promise of a Senate floor vote in December on legislation to extend expiring Obamacare tax credits. As uncertainty thaws in response to the bill advancing, confidence can be expected to slowly return. Already, cryptocurrencies have been showing signs of a rebound, with Bitcoin showing strength and altcoins like Ethereum, Solana , and Avalanche showing signs of recovery from earlier declines. The treasury’s move could further strengthen the recovery, as market observers have suggested the new announcement could drive significant inflows into upcoming Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano-based funds, potentially reshaping how crypto investment products operate in the U.S. Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Regulation|ETPs|U.S Treasury,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-11 00:25:44

The revolutionary Coinbase savings account has arrived in the United Kingdom, bringing crypto convenience to everyday banking with impressive 3.75% variable interest rates. What Makes the Coinbase Savings Account Special? Coinbase has officially launched its highly anticipated savings product for selected UK users. This innovative Coinbase savings account represents a significant step in bridging traditional finance with digital asset convenience. The platform leverages infrastructure from established payments firm ClearBank to ensure reliability and security. Unlike conventional savings options, this Coinbase savings account offers daily interest payments without locking up your funds. The variable annual percentage rate currently stands at 3.75%, significantly higher than most high street banks. Moreover, there are no minimum deposit requirements, making it accessible to savers at all levels. How Does the Coinbase Savings Account Protect Your Money? Security remains paramount when considering any financial product. The Coinbase savings account provides substantial protection through the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This government-backed insurance covers deposits up to £85,000, matching the security levels of traditional UK banks. The account features several key benefits: Instant deposits and withdrawals with no lock-up periods Daily interest payments calculated on your balance No minimum deposit requirements Full FSCS protection up to £85,000 Seamless integration with existing Coinbase services Who Can Access This Revolutionary Savings Option?

Eligible customers receive notifications within their Coinbase applications inviting them to open accounts. The selection criteria consider factors like account history, verification status, and geographic location. However, Coinbase plans to expand access gradually to all qualified UK residents. This measured expansion demonstrates the company’s commitment to responsible financial innovation. Why Choose a Crypto-Based Savings Account? Traditional banking often fails to keep pace with digital innovation. The Coinbase savings account bridges this gap by combining crypto-platform efficiency with familiar banking security. The 3.75% variable rate substantially outperforms most conventional savings accounts while maintaining equivalent protection. Furthermore, the absence of minimum deposits and instant access to funds provides unprecedented flexibility. Savers can adjust their holdings according to changing financial needs without penalties or processing delays. This responsiveness represents a significant advantage over traditional savings vehicles. What Does This Mean for UK Savers? The introduction of the Coinbase savings account signals a transformative shift in UK personal finance. It demonstrates how cryptocurrency platforms can expand beyond trading into mainstream financial services. This development potentially heralds increased competition and better options for British consumers. As digital assets gain wider acceptance, products like the Coinbase savings account help normalize crypto services while addressing consumer concerns about security and reliability. The FSCS protection particularly reassures cautious savers considering alternative financial platforms. Final Thoughts on Coinbase’s UK Savings Innovation The Coinbase savings account represents a bold step toward integrating digital asset platforms with traditional financial security. With competitive interest rates, robust protection, and user-friendly features, it offers UK savers an attractive alternative to conventional banking options.

The Altcoin Season Index just dropped to 30, indicating a significant shift in market dynamics. This crucial metric helps investors understand whether altcoins or Bitcoin are leading the charge – and right now, the numbers tell a compelling story. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as your market compass. It measures how the top 100 cryptocurrencies perform against Bitcoin over 90 days. This calculation excludes stablecoins and wrapped coins to give you pure performance data. When 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin, we officially enter altcoin season. Think of the index as a market thermometer. Scores closer to 100 signal strong altcoin momentum, while lower numbers like today’s 30 indicate Bitcoin dominance. The recent one-point drop might seem small, but it reflects broader market sentiment shifts that could impact your investment decisions. Why Should You Care About This Index Drop? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index helps you make smarter investment choices. The drop to 30 suggests that Bitcoin is currently outperforming most alternative cryptocurrencies. This information becomes valuable when you’re deciding where to allocate your funds. Market Timing : Helps identify optimal entry points Risk Assessment : Indicates overall market sentiment Portfolio Strategy : Guides asset allocation decisions Trend Identification : Shows broader market movements Many experienced traders watch this index closely because it often precedes significant price movements. The current reading suggests caution for altcoin investors and potential opportunities for Bitcoin-focused strategies. How Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Work? CoinMarketCap calculates this index by comparing price performance across multiple timeframes. The system tracks whether each of the top 100 cryptocurrencies has outperformed Bitcoin during the measurement period. This methodology ensures you get a comprehensive view of market leadership. The index uses a simple but effective approach: it counts how many altcoins beat Bitcoin’s returns. When the majority succeed, we see higher index values. The current score of 30 means only about 30% of top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin – a clear signal of changing conditions. What Can We Learn From Current Market Conditions? The declining Altcoin Season Index often correlates with increased Bitcoin dominance. This pattern typically occurs when investors seek safety in established cryptocurrencies during uncertain market periods. However, remember that crypto markets are highly volatile, and conditions can change rapidly. Historical data shows that low index readings sometimes precede strong altcoin rallies. Savvy investors use these periods to research promising projects and prepare for potential market shifts. The key is maintaining a balanced perspective and not making impulsive decisions based on single data points. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So what should you do with this information? First, understand that the Altcoin Season Index is just one tool among many. Combine it with other indicators and your investment strategy. Consider these practical steps: Diversify Wisely : Don’t abandon altcoins completely Monitor Closely : Watch for index trends, not just single readings Research Thoroughly : Identify strong projects during quieter periods Set Alerts : Track when the index crosses key thresholds Remember that successful crypto investing requires patience and multiple data sources. The Altcoin Season Index provides valuable context, but it shouldn’t dictate your entire strategy. Final Thoughts: Navigating the Crypto Landscape The Altcoin Season Index dropping to 30 signals a market in transition. While Bitcoin currently shows strength, crypto history teaches us that conditions can change unexpectedly. The most successful investors maintain flexibility and use tools like this index to inform rather than control their decisions. Stay informed, stay diversified, and remember that market metrics are guides, not guarantees. The current Altcoin Season Index reading suggests careful evaluation of your portfolio and potential adjustment of your risk management strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What does the Altcoin Season Index measure? The index compares the performance of top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over 90 days, excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins. How often does CoinMarketCap update this index? They update it regularly, typically daily, to reflect current market conditions and price movements. What score indicates a true altcoin season? An altcoin season is officially declared when the index reaches 75, meaning 75% of top altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Should I sell my altcoins when the index drops? Not necessarily. Use the index as one of many factors in your decision-making process rather than making impulsive moves. Can the index predict future price movements? While it indicates current trends, it cannot guarantee future performance. Always combine it with other analysis methods. Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? You can find it on CoinMarketCap’s website under their market analysis tools and indices section. Share Your Thoughts Found this analysis helpful?

Related Reading: Trump’s Bitcoin Bet Grows: American Bitcoin Now Holds Over 4,000 BTC The plan would pay at least $2,000 to most adults and has been described as part of a broader push to use tariff receipts for direct payments. Tariff Dividend Sparks Market Moves According to reports, the proposal is being presented as a way to convert tariff revenue into direct payments to citizens, with proponents linking the move to stronger consumer spending and higher risk appetite among investors. Trump said the government could afford the new payout because tariffs had brought in massive revenue and because factories across the country were attracting record levels of investment. He mentioned that the money would go to most Americans, except those earning higher incomes. “People that are against tariffs are fools,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post. “We are taking in trillions of dollars and will soon begin paying down our enormous debt, $37 trillion.” Trump also pointed to record highs in 401(k) savings and the stock market, saying tariffs helped the economy grow instead of slowing it down. The figure being cited publicly as backing for the program is about $400 billion, though analysts and budget experts say the math and legal pathway remain unclear. Crypto Prices Tick Higher The cryptocurrency market reacted within hours following news of the dividend. Bitcoin climbed above $106,000, while Ether moved into the mid-thousands, reflecting a short, sharp lift in sentiment among traders who expect fresh liquidity could flow into risk assets. These price moves followed a week when some crypto indexes had fallen sharply, so the announcement helped reverse part of that pullback. Market watchers said the reaction was driven more by sentiment than by a confirmed funding mechanism. Some commentators compared the potential effect to past stimulus checks, noting that when households get direct dividend payments they often boost spending and, in some cases, channel money into markets. Still, regulators and budget experts are asking how the plan would work under existing law and whether tariff receipts are a reliable source for recurring payouts.

Legal and political questions are front and center. Treasury officials have suggested parts of the payout could be handled through tax changes already on the books, while court challenges over the scope of tariff powers may complicate any quick roll-out.

The analyst, known for his bullish takes on XRP, says the cryptocurrency is still “missing the fifth wave,” implying that the next leg could push its price far into new all-time highs. Despite recent consolidation just above $2.2, Elliott Wave projections show that the cryptocurrency is only just gathering strength before launching into price targets as high as $27. XRP Is Still Missing Its 5th Wave EGRAG CRYPTO’s latest update on X presents XRP’s price action within an extended five-wave structure typical of the Elliott Wave Theory. His analysis, which was done on the 5-day timeframe chart, proposes that XRP is currently completing a fourth impulsive wave, which is a corrective period that leads to massive bullish extensions. In his words, the “Power of 5” is about to unfold, setting up what he expects to be the “most explosive fifth wave yet.” The historical context highlighted by the analyst supports his claim. Similar fourth corrective wave patterns in 2017 and 2021 preceded XRP’s strongest rallies, each time occurring after a lengthy consolidation. Furthermore, EGRAG’s chart highlights repeating cycles of impulse and correction, highlighted by cyan and pink EMA bands that have consistently acted as support zones before a rally. The current setup shows XRP is holding above its support zone, and bullish traders have prevented it from falling below $2.20. This successful hold suggests that the fourth wave might be nearing its end. Fibonacci Extensions Point To $27 Target According to EGRAG, the fifth wave is designed to break disbelief in the market. This is a stage where many traders bet against the trend only to get caught on the wrong side of history. His post referenced an infamous case of a trader who lost $30 million shorting XRP during its 2024 leg-up, using it as a reminder that history repeats itself. The technical projection is reinforced by Fibonacci extension levels plotted on EGRAG’s chart. The analyst’s framework identifies notable price resistance targets for the next leg higher, with the 1.272, 1.414, 1.618, and 2.618 extensions aligning around $4.78, $5.515, $6.755, and $18.25, respectively, while higher extensions extend to the $27 range. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.49 after rebounding from lows of $2.12 last week. The token has gained 9% in the past 24 hours, reflecting growing confidence among market participants as bullish setups begin to take shape. Despite market hesitation and low volatility across most cryptocurrencies, the entire market appears to be changing in conviction. At the time of writing, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased by about 4.4% over the past 24-hour period.",XRP|Egrag Crypto|Elliott Wave|Fibonacci Extension Level|ripple|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-11 01:00:33

The company posted a loss of $6.67 per share, compared with the $3.24 loss expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Gemini, which debuted on public markets in September, has seen its stock price fall almost in half from the peak, amid a broader decline in crypto prices. Gemini’s GEMI stock quickly crashed by more than 11% in after-hours trading after the earnings report, slipping below $15 and breaking a new all-time low, according to data from CNBC. Still though, Gemini’s revenue still climbed sharply. Net revenue for the quarter came in close to $50 million, which was a 52% increase from the prior quarter. The company reported that more than $26 million came from transaction fees, while around $20 million came from services like its credit card and institutional staking. The company’s adjusted EBITDA stood at negative $52.4 million, showing that growth did not outweigh spending. Trading volume rose to $16.4 billion, up 45% quarter-over-quarter, driven by larger institutional movement, which rose nearly 50% from the previous period. Gemini sees surge in services income after expansion into new markets According to the earnings report , Gemini has been adding new features and expanding into new regions. A self-custody wallet was introduced this quarter, and the company also secured a MiCA license in Europe in August and launched operations in Australia in early October as part of its regulatory expansion strategy. Services revenue now represents nearly 40% of Gemini’s total revenue, compared with under 30% from just a year ago. The Gemini credit card passed 100,000 open accounts, with more than $350 million in transaction spending, which was double the previous quarter’s usage, while staking balances increased to $741 million. After going public, the company also repaid debt and opened a $150 million credit facility for credit-card receivables to improve capital efficiency For the full year, Gemini forecasted $60 million to $70 million in services and interest revenue based on continued credit-card and staking growth. The company is also entering new business areas. It is working on prediction markets that allow users to place bets on political and sports outcomes. It has begun offering tokenized U.S. stocks, letting users gain exposure to equities through blockchain representation. But analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in October that Gemini’s expansion of the credit-card business “introduces both credit and interest rate risk in an economic downturn,” pointing out the financial pressure that could build if consumer defaults increase or credit conditions tighten. Winklevosses political activity triggers valuation concerns Outside the company’s financials, Cameron and Tyler have also been active politically. In August, they donated $21 million to a political action committee supporting President Donald Trump and the Republican Party’s pro-crypto policy goals. They also attended multiple events at the White House, including a donor reception in the new ballroom. From a valuation standpoint, the company’s parent entity, Gemini Space Station, currently trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 13.9x, which is way higher than both sector peers and the broader US Capital Markets industry average of 3.8x. The stock last closed around $16.18, and if you do that math, you’ll see that the price means investors are paying a large premium per dollar of revenue even though Gemini remains unprofitable… technically. That gap between high valuation and ongoing losses is what fueled the steep stock decline after earnings were released.

The growth came from higher bitcoin mining output, expanded mining capacity, and the first reported quarter of revenue from its AI and high‑performance computing (HPC) infrastructure services. Out of the total revenue, $43.38 million came from bitcoin mining, while $7.2 million came from the new AI/HPC service line. The company said its cost of revenue, excluding depreciation, rose 17% to $17.1 million in the period. TeraWulf ended the quarter holding $712.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The company also said that it completed more than $5 billion in long‑term financing during the quarter, which included funding for its Lake Mariner facility and equity investments tied to the Abernathy joint venture with Fluidstack and Google. Total debt stood at about $1.5 billion, made up mainly of convertible notes maturing in 2030 and 2031. TeraWulf signs new data center deals and maps out multi-site HPC growth through 2027 At its Lake Mariner campus in Barker, New York, TeraWulf operates 245 megawatts (MW) of bitcoin mining capacity and 22.5 MW of HPC capacity. The company manages additional HPC infrastructure through two subsidiaries, La Lupa Data LLC and Akela Data LLC, which together oversee more than 520 MW of long‑term HPC leases. Within this, La Lupa’s Core42 leases include 72.5 MW of GPU‑optimized power, supported by $1.1 billion in contracted revenue. During the quarter, the company signed three 10‑year Fluidstack leases at Lake Mariner totaling approximately $6.7 billion in contracted lease payments. These leases are supported by a $3.2 billion Google credit enhancement, according to the company. The Abernathy joint venture in Texas is being developed for 240 MW of HPC capacity, with the option to expand the site to 600 MW, operating under a 25‑year lease backed by $1.3 billion in Google credit support. TeraWulf also signed an 80‑year lease in Lansing, New York, where the company plans to build another HPC campus beginning deployment in 2027. In addition, the company secured a 51% ownership interest in a proposed 200 MW Fluidstack‑led data center development. TeraWulf CEO Paul Prager said the company expanded its partnerships with Fluidstack and Google during the quarter and continued preparing for the next series of build‑outs planned through 2027. Prager said during the earnings call that he “would not be surprised if by the end of the year the company announces one or two new sites.” Chief Operating Officer Sean Farrell said construction work at both Lake Mariner and Akela remains on schedule toward planned delivery milestones. Chief Financial Officer Patrick Fleury said that the company’s $5 billion capital formation effort outlines how TeraWulf plans to continue funding and scaling its infrastructure. The company reaffirmed its target of signing 250 to 500 MW of new HPC leases each year, pointing to continued demand for low‑cost, low‑carbon computing capacity from enterprise customers, including those building or training AI models. On October 28, Oppenheimer began coverage of TeraWulf Inc. (NASDAQ: WULF) with an Outperform rating and a $20 price target. The firm noted the company’s access to renewable electricity, data‑ready land, and fiber connectivity, which it said have helped attract AI industry clients. Oppenheimer said demand for AI data centers has grown faster than expected in the past three years and projected that the market could expand 18% annually over the next five years, while estimating a 15‑gigawatt capacity shortage, equal to about 20% below need. The report said that TeraWulf controls 1.2 gigawatts of available power and land capacity, with over 400 MW in customer lease contracts and 250 MW of bitcoin mining capacity that can be converted to HPC use.

It should have been a routine deal, but it quickly escalated into a substantial loss. The user did not pay a realistic fee , but rather incorrectly set 0.99 BTC as the fee amount (approximately $105,000 at today’s market prices). To put this into perspective, the BTC network will not confirm even high-priority transactions if the fee is less than one coin. This amounts to an overpayment of more than 100,000 times. The vast difference is a stark reminder of just how costly it can be to make the simplest mistake when moving cryptocurrency. According to experts, errors like this occur when people attempt to set wallet settings themselves instead of using automatic fee estimators. If the “change” or recipient fields are filled out incorrectly, the extra can go to the miner. In this case, it was indeed a large mining pool that mined the block containing the transaction and pocketed the entire fee. Occasionally, miners return the unintended payment, but this usually requires the recipient of the money to prove ownership of the private key for the address again, which is generally a tedious process. Accidental transaction sends massive fee to miner As painful as it is to lose $105,000 on a $10 transfer, that’s not even close to the biggest screw-ups in the annals of Bitcoin fees. Others have also cropped up, for instance, a user accidentally sent a $24 million transaction fee on the Ethereum network last year, before the miner returned most of it. Bitcoin has seen its share of costly fee mistakes over the years. For example, in a 2023 incident, a user accidentally paid 83.64 BTC as a transaction fee—equivalent to roughly $8.7 million at today’s rate. It demonstrates that in cryptocurrency, everyone can use an extra ounce of caution. Costly errors are somewhat more difficult to commit if you’re pulling from a wallet that does your fee math for you. It is an advanced feature and can result in loss of funds if used incorrectly. The network will treat a transaction as “confirmed” after it has been mined. Miners’ fees are generally non-refundable unless refunded by a miners’ vote. It is merely a reminder that typos and misconfigurations of even a single letter can result in financial losses of thousands. Traders watch Bitcoin’s critical technical zones Meanwhile, market watchers are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin’s price action . Many data-driven models suggest that the next bear market may be milder than previous cycles, with support likely to be found between $55,000 and $70,000. Bitcoin’s MVRV, considering the rising cost of production, suggests that Bitcoin’s structural support will likely lie within the range, resulting in milder retracements. While the traditional cycle remains, growing institutional participation and greater market maturity are starting, albeit very gradually, to shape the volatility environment. Looking ahead, traders and investors see significant resistance levels. Near-term gains may face resistance at $109,400 and around $111,000; however, if the price manages to remain above $116,000 for an extended period. A sustained volume spike confirms a break in higher activity, which could signal that momentum has been flipped back in favor of the bulls, with an initial target at the essence of the broadening wedge pattern – approximately $129k.

This Bitcoin price surge represents one of the most significant moments in cryptocurrency history, demonstrating the digital asset’s growing dominance in global financial markets. What’s Driving This Massive Bitcoin Price Surge? The recent Bitcoin price surge above $107,000 on Binance’s USDT market reflects several converging factors. Institutional adoption continues to accelerate, with major corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Moreover, regulatory clarity in key markets has provided investors with increased confidence. The limited supply of Bitcoin, combined with growing demand, creates perfect conditions for price appreciation. How Does This Bitcoin Price Surge Compare to Previous Highs?

The market has shown remarkable resilience despite: Previous volatility concerns Regulatory uncertainties Market corrections This sustained upward movement indicates maturing market dynamics and stronger investor conviction. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The ongoing Bitcoin price surge presents both opportunities and considerations for market participants. New investors should understand that while momentum appears strong, cryptocurrency markets remain volatile.

The deal, initially unveiled in September 2025, is being orchestrated by a group of investors, including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), as well as US private equity firm Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, an investment vehicle co-founded by Jared Kushner. Goldman will be paid $10 million under the deal, with the remainder of $ 100 million due at closing, subject to any required shareholder and regulatory approvals . Goldman navigates complex negotiations The acquisition group originally reached out to Electronic Arts in early March, with Silver Lake talking directly to EA’s chief executive. The maneuver kicked off months of strategic negotiations over one of the biggest mergers in the gaming industry. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) then joined the consortium, holding a stake of less than 10 percent in EA. There was also a third major investor identified as Affinity. The source agreed to the terms of becoming the majority owner of EA, which would give the company decisive influence on its strategic direction in the future. Silver Lake retains a significant minority stake, enabling it to remain actively involved in EA’s operations and decision-making. The ownership structure would also allocate Affinity Partners a stake of approximately 5%. This smaller but still meaningful ownership stake would enable it to participate in governance and take advantage of growth opportunities. Due to these allocations, the negotiations quickly led to competitive bidding for EA. After an initial offer of $200 per share in early September, this consortium increased its offer to $210 per share by the end of the month. At the time, this price represented roughly a 25% share price. Initially, the investors believed that the company was being undervalued by the market, indicating its long-term potential. EA’s banker and long-term financial adviser on the offer was Goldman Sachs. Despite being EA’s sole adviser on the deal, it has not collected any advisory or underwriting fees from EA over the past two years. In contrast, Goldman Sachs had earned $24 million and $154 million in fees for advising PIF and Silver Lake during the same period. Wall Street watches mega deal impact The record fee reflects just how lucrative advisory services have become in the era of mega deals. Big buyouts and mergers are on the rise, fueled by strong debt markets, looser regulatory control in some instances, and high corporate confidence in the American economy. Bank of America, for instance, is set to make nearly $130 million advising Union Pacific Corporation on its acquisition of Norfolk Southern Corporation earlier this year. And JPMorgan Chase made $123 million advising AbbVie in its $63 billion acquisition of Allergan last year.

The company has spent nearly $4 billion this year snapping up financial infrastructure companies in a bid to blend crypto with banking. In an interview with CNBC at the Swell 2025 conference in New York, CEO Brad Garlinghouse made it clear that Ripple is quite literally buying its way in right now. “I want to see Ripple invest in [the] future and get ahead of where that market’s going,” Brad said on Tuesday. The company’s entire strategy now leans on using crypto tech inside the very systems that once shunned it. “The assets we have been buying have been on the traditional finance side, so we can bring crypto-enabled solutions to that traditional financial world,” Brad added. Ripple’s long-game is to inject its blockchain tech, and XRP, directly into financial pipes that already move trillions daily. Ripple buys up TradFi firms, raises half a billion In April, Ripple dropped $1.3 billion to buy Hidden Road, a major prime brokerage. Later in the year, it paid over $1 billion to acquire GTreasury, a software company used by banks and corporates. And just last week, the company rolled out Ripple Prime, a brokerage built for U.S. institutions that want access to over-the-counter crypto trading. Ripple also raised $500 million in fresh funding this fall, pushing its overall market value to around $40 billion, all in 2025. The timing is no accident. Institutional appetite for crypto has grown as U.S. regulators pull back. Under President Donald Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodities Futures Trading Commission have relaxed their crackdown on the industry. Big banks are taking the hint. Bank of America and Citigroup are now exploring stablecoins, with Citi laying out plans for a full custody service launching in 2026. JPMorgan announced in June that it plans to introduce a deposit token on Coinbase’s Base blockchain. Meanwhile, institutional investors have dumped billions into Bitcoin ETFs since their U.S. debut in January 2024. “The United States used to lean out on crypto, and now we’re leaning in, and I think people underestimate how big a shift that is,” Brad said. For Ripple, it means an open path to plug in, so long as the tools and deals are in place. XRP tech offered to banks despite legal freeze Alongside building its own services, Ripple wants to license its XRP Ledger to banks and financial giants trying to move into crypto. That tech runs the native XRP token and is designed for fast, cheap transactions. Brad said the more real-world usage Ripple can build around XRP, the better it is for the broader network. Still, XRP hasn’t moved much in 2025. While Bitcoin and Ether have jumped to $126,000 and $3,900, respectively, XRP has been mostly flat. Brad said big partnerships could change that, but admitted that red tape is still holding things back. The crypto industry had pinned hopes on a bill called the Clarity Act, which would’ve created clear rules for crypto company and token holders. But with the U.S. government shutdown now in its sixth week, that bill isn’t moving anywhere. “Until we have that [legal go-ahead], it’s gonna be hard,” Brad said. “Banks are looking for and need that clarity for them to really lean in.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Sources indicated that this boost will likely reduce the likelihood of an interest rate cut soon. This announcement followed Westpac Banking Corp.’s release of its survey findings, which highlighted a 12.8% surge in sentiment to 103.8 points. The change marked the first time since February 2022, when 100 was the threshold, ending a streak of 44 months during which Australian consumers felt negative emotions. “This is an amazing and somewhat unexpected outcome. November is the first month in nearly four years where consumer sentiment is ‘net positive,’” explained Matthew Hassan, who leads Australian macro forecasting at Westpac. Still, this comes as Australia’s unemployment rate increased to 4.5%, marking its highest level since 2021. The unexpected jump caught economists off guard, indicating that the previously resilient labor market is starting to cool. The latest data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) suggests a 14,900 increase in employment in September, falling short of forecasts for a rise of 20,000. Meanwhile, more Australians found jobs or started looking for one, slightly lifting the participation rate to 67%. Australia’s consumer confidence rises despite escalating worries about the job market Hassan acknowledged that there were clear signs that the recovery is gaining momentum, particularly in the housing market and consumer demand. According to him, the most amazing fact is how these positive factors have counteracted renewed concerns about interest rates and inflation. His remarks followed the Reserve Bank’s recent decision to maintain borrowing costs unchanged at 3.6%. When reporters asked the central bank to clarify the reason behind this decision, the bank pointed out ongoing concerns about low unemployment and inflation. With this argument in mind, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Michele Bullock, expressed the unlikelihood of an additional interest rate reduction soon, following the three rate cuts this year. Meanwhile, the positive economic outlook stems from a substantial improvement in how households perceive their financial situation. Following this economic optimism, the sub-index for family finances 2026 surged by 12.3%, reaching a score of 109.1. On the other hand, Westpac noted that this increase occurred despite a small decline of approximately 0.3% in mortgage expectations from households. Still, individuals have expressed concerns about the job market, despite being optimistic about the economy and their family finances. This was after the Westpac–Melbourne Institute Unemployment Expectations Index escalated by 9.3% in November, reaching 139.5. Notably, a larger number on this index indicates that more people believe unemployment will increase significantly in the coming year. Australian consumer confidence in their finance surged amid a third interest rate cut According to the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey, a measure of how Australians feel about their finances jumped in August thanks to the third interest rate cut this year, which boosted sentiment about money and the economy. The Survey pointed out that its index on consumer sentiment jumped 5.7% in July to 98.5, marking the highest level since early 2022. However, this number was below 100, indicating that there are still more pessimists than optimists, but only slightly. This boost was led by the Reserve Bank of Australia’s quarter-point cut in interest rates to 3.60%, accompanied by a possible further cut later this year. Hassan commented, “This seems to have strengthened consumer expectations that mortgage rates will decrease, providing a broad lift in sentiment.” In the meantime, it is worth noting that the survey demonstrated an overall improvement in confidence across various areas. A measure of economic outlook for the next year surged by 7.6%, and a five-year outlook rose by 5.4%.

Binance has announced a crucial Binance STX suspension that will temporarily affect your trading activities. This strategic pause is actually good news for the network’s long-term health and functionality. What Does the Binance STX Suspension Mean for You? The Binance STX suspension begins precisely at 3:00 p.m. UTC on July 11. During this period, you cannot deposit or withdraw your STX tokens on the Binance platform. However, trading pairs involving STX will remain operational throughout the maintenance window. This temporary measure supports the Stacks network upgrade, which brings important improvements to the blockchain. Network upgrades typically enhance: Security features and protocol stability Transaction speed and efficiency Overall network performance Compatibility with future developments Why Exchanges Like Binance Implement Temporary Suspensions? When blockchain networks undergo significant upgrades, exchanges must temporarily pause services to ensure a smooth transition. The Binance STX suspension follows industry best practices for several important reasons. First, it prevents potential transaction conflicts during the upgrade process. Second, it safeguards user assets from any technical issues that might arise. Finally, it allows the exchange to update its systems to be fully compatible with the new network version. How Should STX Holders Prepare for This Temporary Pause? If you hold STX tokens, here’s what you need to know about the Binance STX suspension . Plan your transactions accordingly before the suspension begins. Complete any urgent deposits or withdrawals well in advance of the 3:00 p.m. UTC deadline on July 11. Remember that while deposits and withdrawals are paused, you can still trade STX against other cryptocurrencies on Binance. This flexibility means you’re not completely locked out of managing your positions during the upgrade period. What Benefits Does This Network Upgrade Bring? The temporary Binance STX suspension enables significant improvements to the Stacks ecosystem. Network upgrades typically deliver enhanced functionality that benefits all token holders in the long run. These improvements might include better smart contract capabilities, reduced transaction costs, or improved scalability. While the temporary inconvenience might be frustrating, the long-term benefits make this necessary maintenance worthwhile for the entire Stacks community. When Will Normal STX Services Resume on Binance? Binance hasn’t specified an exact end time for the Binance STX suspension , which is common practice during network upgrades. The exchange will restore services once they confirm the network upgrade’s stability and complete their internal testing. Typically, such suspensions last a few hours to a full day. Monitor Binance’s official announcements for the most current information about service restoration. The exchange will make a public announcement once deposits and withdrawals are fully operational again. Frequently Asked Questions Can I still trade STX during the suspension? Yes, trading of STX pairs will continue normally. Only deposits and withdrawals are temporarily suspended. Will my STX tokens be safe during the upgrade? Absolutely. Your tokens remain secure in your Binance wallet throughout the entire process. How long will the suspension last? While no exact end time is provided, similar upgrades typically complete within hours. Do I need to take any action before the suspension? Only if you need to deposit or withdraw STX tokens urgently before the deadline. Will this affect STX token price? Temporary suspensions for upgrades rarely cause significant price movements as they’re planned events. Where can I get updates about the suspension? Monitor Binance’s official announcements page and social media channels for real-time updates. Share This Important Update Help other STX holders stay informed! Share this article on your social media channels to spread awareness about the temporary Binance suspension.

This marks the first major proposal from Uniswap Labs in years, and that is, to a great extent, thanks to the fact that the new SEC administration is not as suffocating as the previous and was gracious enough to dismiss prior scrutiny against the company. Users have had to wait for UNIfication for years UNIfication is the name given to the joint proposal from Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap Foundation, and it aims to activate protocol fees and distribute them to tokenholders. The plan had been in the pipeline since 2022, but due to multiple previous proposals, rejections, and delays, it has stayed there, frustrating UNI holders to no end. The UNI token has been doing well since the proposal was revealed, trading above $7 for the first time in weeks. UNI is currently priced at $9.25 per token, having recovered from a low of $4.95 less than a week ago. Uniswap’s UNI token got a jolt from the latest talks of a ‘UNIfication.’ Source: CoinMarketCap Uniswap Foundation co-founders Devin Walsh and Ken Ng published the UNIfication blog post today, expressing excitement for the opportunity to turn on protocol fees and align incentives across the Uniswap ecosystem . “We believe this proposal positions the Uniswap Protocol to win as the default decentralized exchange for tokenized value,” they wrote. “Together with Uniswap Labs, we’re proposing a long-term model for the Uniswap ecosystem: one where protocol usage drives UNI burn and one aligned team focuses on protocol development and growth.” It remains to be seen exactly what percentage of fees will be allocated to the UNI burn and incentives, but the community is simply excited; it looks like progress is finally being made after years of sluggish steps forward. The proposal has gotten hopes up again The UNIfication proposal addresses the “fee switch” mechanism, which has been in debate for years and was rejected in prior votes. Aside from the rejection, there were also delays that came from regulatory fears due to the oppressive regime of the SEC under Gary Gensler, as well as governance apathy, which resulted in low voter turnout. Now that there is a new proposal coming up under the new, more friendly SEC administration, hopes are up once more. Also, the community does not seem to mind such occasional injections of hope; after all, each time the talk comes up, UNI’s price reacts with a pump. This may be because of the mechanism’s potential to redirect the billions of protocol fees Uniswap toward UNI burns and holder rewards, thereby creating deflationary pressure and utility. Current factors, especially the friendly regulatory environment, make it very likely that the waiting is coming to an end, but it would not be completely surprising to see talk of implementing the mechanism get postponed again.

While he repeatedly underscored uncertainty around ultimate cycle timing, the analyst said Dogecoin has “reclaimed the uptrend,” adding that the macro uptrend looks broken but the summer uptrend is “valid technically,” especially when viewed on the weekly chart. Dogecoin To $1 Still Possible? VisionPulsed framed the setup as binary for risk takers: “Dogecoin’s road to the bull” if momentum confirms, versus a “path to the pig” near $0.06 if support breaks. He tempered expectations of euphoric targets, saying, “I’m not going to come on here telling you $5 Doge just yet. Let’s let it play out.” VisionPulsed framed the setup as binary for risk takers: “Dogecoin’s road to the bull” if momentum confirms, versus a “path to the pig” near $0.06 if support breaks. He tempered expectations of euphoric targets, saying, “I’m not going to come on here telling you $5 Doge just yet. Let’s let it play out.” Momentum—what he called “firepower”—was the core of his case. Scanning through multiple periods, he argued that stock RSI signals are broadly supportive on key charts: “We have the firepower to do it on the weekly time frame. We have the firepower now to do it on the daily time frame. If we go to the 2-day time frame, the firepower is there. If we go to the 3-day time frame, the firepower is almost there. If we go to the 4-day time frame, the firepower is there.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Set For 1,200% Rally To $2.2 In This 3rd Run He noted that the 5-day “still needs more time to reset,” the 6-day is “still resetting,” and the **10-day stock RSI gives us the chance to move higher.” On the 8-day, he said momentum has “just [been] attempting to curl up”—a posture that previously preceded upside bursts during this cycle. Even as he spotlighted constructive internals, the analyst did not dismiss larger-timeframe risks. He characterized the two-week view as “maximum bearish,” while reminding viewers that similar conditions in 2023–2025 did not prevent sharp upside reversals: “There’s no rule that says we have to stay down here.” In his view, if momentum confirms and support holds, “technically the bull market resumes,” whereas a failure at key levels would “confirm a bear market.” For Dogecoin specifically, VisionPulsed said the coin has “regained the uptrend,” distinguishing between what he sees as a broken macro structure and a still-intact summer trendline on higher timeframes. Should momentum continue to build, he argued that DOGE could “move to the top of the channel,” echoing a pattern he has flagged repeatedly this year: “Every time [support] holds… each time Doge has had an explosive move to the upside.” Still, he avoided definitive timing: “If no one knows where the top is, then technically we don’t even know what the deadline is for Doge to come up here.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Bull Run Ends If Rally Doesn’t Start Now, Analyst Warns The analyst’s broader cycle take remained intentionally agnostic. He acknowledged previously calling for a potential cycle top earlier in the year, then noted that a break to fresh highs would invalidate the popular “150-day from the bottom” top-timing theory: “If we break the high, that theory gets invalidated. And then the question becomes, where is the top? And we can say we don’t know.” That uncertainty, he suggested, is precisely why the market could surprise to the upside if momentum reasserts itself. The near-term action item, in his telling, is straightforward: watch momentum follow-through from oversold RSI conditions across the daily to 10-day bands, and respect the risk that a failed confirmation flips the script. As he put it in closing, “We’re rooting for the bull run to continue. We have the momentum for it to continue and as long as we stay over the moving average in my opinion it will continue.” But the fork remains visible: “Dogecoin’s road to the bull” if support holds and momentum confirms—or the “path to the pig” if it breaks. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1815.

Ethereum Open Interest Has Observed A Strong Rise As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Open Interest has just shot up for Ethereum. This indicator keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to ETH that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. When the value of the metric rises, it means the investors are opening new positions on the market. Generally, the overall leverage in the sector rises alongside new positions, so the asset could witness more volatility following such a trend. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies the number of positions is decreasing, whether as a result of willful closure or forceful liquidations. This kind of deleveraging can lead to a more stable ETH price. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Ethereum Open Interest over the last few weeks: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Open Interest has witnessed a rise of almost $2 billion during the past day, reflecting an increase of more than 10%. This growth in market speculation has come alongside the recovery surge that ETH has gone through over the last 24 hours. Sharp price action, like a rally, tends to attract attention to the asset, so the Open Interest usually rises alongside it. While this trend can be normal, a particularly sharp jump in the indicator can be something to watch for. In the chart, the analyst has highlighted the instances where the derivatives market faced a similar level of overheating as now. It would appear that the last three instances all coincided with some sort of top for Ethereum. “Historically, 75% of these moves mean revert,” noted Maartunn. It now remains to be seen whether similar volatility will also follow this time. In some other news, the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw net outflows during the past week, as data from SoSoValue shows. In total, ETH spot ETFs in the US saw nearly $508 million in outflows. This is the third-largest weekly negative netflow that the funds have witnessed in their history so far. As spot ETFs provide a regulated off-chain route into cryptocurrencies, they can be a popular mode of investment among traditional institutional entities. Considering this, the outflows can imply the presence of a negative sentiment among these large investors. Despite the bearish mood, however, Ethereum has managed to rebound to start the new week. ETH Price Ethereum has made its way back above $3,600 with its rally of 4% in the past day.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum Derivatives|Ethereum open interest|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-11 02:00:22

Vlad said he wants “normal people” to have a chance to invest in private AI firms whose valuations have surged. He said AI will cause “widescale disruption” and that retail traders should be able to participate in whatever comes out of that change, rather than being locked out while large institutions collect the gains. The plan involves a new fund managed by Robinhood’s subsidiary, Robinhood Ventures, which will invest in a concentrated group of at least five private AI start-ups considered “best in class.” Vlad said the fund may use borrowed money to potentially increase returns. This comes at a moment when private markets are attracting more interest from smaller investors, while traditional public markets have steadily shrunk. Fund access shifts toward smaller investors Asset managers across the country are actively targeting individuals because the pool of institutional money is no longer the only main source they want. A recent executive order signed by President Donald Trump in August made it easier for employers to include private equity and private credit in retirement savings plans. This has encouraged firms such as Blue Owl, Blackstone and Apollo to expand beyond their usual large-scale clients and approach everyday investors. Public markets have been shrinking for decades. At the same time, private markets have ballooned. In 2016, only 20 private companies in the United States were valued at more than $1 billion. By 2024, that number jumped to more than 1,000. Major AI developers like OpenAI and Anthropic have driven much of this growth. Over just the past year, ten unprofitable AI start-ups added nearly $1 trillion to their combined valuations through private funding rounds. The new fund from Robinhood is closed-end, which means investors cannot freely redeem shares at any time. If many people try to exit at once, they may not be able to get their money. Bryan Armour, who is director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, said, “Managing a complex, private equity strategy like this could seriously burn their fast-moving user base.” His concern is that many users of the platform tend to trade quickly and may not adjust well to money being locked up. High risk appetite and expanding features Vlad said retail traders are already familiar with taking risks and that many of them are aware that investments in early-stage private companies could go all the way down to zero. He said users are “buying heavily” into AI-related themes and that he does not believe valuations of large tech giants are excessively inflated. Vlad became widely recognized during the 2021 meme-stock cycle due to Robinhood’s popularity among highly active traders who were willing to take bold bets. Shares of Robinhood have risen around 255 percent this year, making it one of the strongest performers in the S&P 500. Despite that run, the stock fell almost 11 percent on Thursday after the company reported third-quarter revenue of $1.27 billion, which was double what it reported a year ago. Income from crypto trading increased sharply, rising 300 percent to $268 million. Earlier this year, Robinhood partnered with Kalshi to offer prediction markets where users can trade on binary outcomes tied to sports, politics or entertainment. The company reported that the number of event contracts traded on the platform rose to 2.3 billion between July and September, and then to 2.5 billion in October. Vlad said this type of market could expand further and become more personalized. He said that if traders could price the risk of a house being damaged by a flood or fire, it could lead to a product that functions differently than traditional insurance and may appeal to many users.

The Financial Services Commission (FSC) recently announced plans to bring virtual asset service providers under the Credit Information Act, marking a significant shift in how crypto exchanges handle user data and transaction information. What Does the Credit Information Act Mean for Crypto Exchanges? The proposed legislation represents a major upgrade in regulatory oversight. Currently, crypto exchanges follow the Personal Information Protection Act, but the new rules would place them under the same strict framework as traditional financial institutions. This means crypto exchanges must implement much stronger data protection measures. The core objective is clear: enhance user rights and data security. By classifying virtual asset transaction information as data managed under the Credit Information Act, the FSC ensures that crypto exchanges meet higher standards for information management. This change affects every aspect of data handling. How Will This Impact Your Crypto Transactions? The new requirements will transform how crypto exchanges collect, store, and use your information. Under the Credit Information Act, exchanges must follow much stricter procedures than before. Here’s what changes: Enhanced data collection protocols with explicit user consent requirements Strict storage security measures matching banking standards Limited data usage only for specified purposes Regular compliance audits and reporting obligations Stronger breach notification requirements These changes mean crypto exchanges must invest significantly in their security infrastructure and compliance systems. The transition won’t be easy, but the benefits for users are substantial. Why This Matters for Crypto Exchange Users For everyday cryptocurrency users, this regulatory shift brings both challenges and advantages. While crypto exchanges may need to adjust their operations, users gain stronger protection for their personal and financial information. The Credit Information Act ensures that your transaction data receives the same level of security as your banking information. Moreover, this move signals South Korea’s commitment to creating a safer cryptocurrency environment. By holding crypto exchanges to higher standards, the government aims to build greater trust in digital assets and encourage wider adoption. The Future of Crypto Regulation in South Korea This legislation represents just the beginning of South Korea’s comprehensive approach to cryptocurrency regulation. As crypto exchanges adapt to these new requirements, we can expect further developments in the regulatory landscape. The government’s proactive stance demonstrates recognition of cryptocurrency’s growing importance in the financial ecosystem. The implementation of the Credit Information Act for crypto exchanges sets a precedent that other countries might follow. It establishes a framework that balances innovation with consumer protection, potentially influencing global cryptocurrency regulation standards. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Security South Korea’s decision to bring crypto exchanges under the Credit Information Act marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency regulation. This revolutionary approach prioritizes user protection while acknowledging the legitimate role of digital assets in modern finance. As crypto exchanges adapt to these enhanced requirements, users can expect stronger security and greater peace of mind when trading digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Credit Information Act? The Credit Information Act is South Korean legislation that governs how financial institutions handle personal and financial data. It sets strict standards for data protection, storage, and usage. When will these changes take effect? The legislation is currently in the planning phase. The FSC is pursuing the amendment, but specific implementation timelines haven’t been announced yet. How will this affect my existing crypto accounts? You’ll likely need to provide additional consent for data processing, and exchanges will implement enhanced security measures. Your existing accounts should transition smoothly with proper notification. Will this make crypto trading more complicated? While exchanges may add additional verification steps, the core trading experience should remain similar. The changes primarily affect backend data management rather than user interface. Are other countries considering similar regulations? Several countries are watching South Korea’s approach. This could set a precedent for how nations regulate cryptocurrency data protection globally. What happens if exchanges don’t comply? Non-compliant crypto exchanges could face significant penalties, including fines and potential suspension of operations in South Korea. Found this information valuable?

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $105,954 on the Binance USDT market, marking one of the most substantial single-day declines in recent weeks. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Price Drop? Several factors are contributing to this sudden Bitcoin price correction. Market analysts point to increased selling pressure from institutional investors and profit-taking after recent gains. The overall cryptocurrency market sentiment has shifted bearish, with many altcoins following the Bitcoin price downward trend. Technical indicators suggest the Bitcoin price broke through key support levels that traders were watching closely. This breakdown triggered automated sell orders, accelerating the decline. However, experienced traders know that such corrections often create buying opportunities for long-term investors. How Significant Is This Bitcoin Price Movement? The current Bitcoin price movement represents more than just a temporary dip. Falling below $106,000 indicates: Potential testing of lower support levels around $104,000 Increased volatility in the cryptocurrency sector Possible market consolidation before next major move Historical data shows that the Bitcoin price often experiences such corrections during bull markets. These pullbacks can actually strengthen the overall market structure by shaking out weak hands and establishing stronger support bases. What Should Investors Do About the Bitcoin Price Drop? For cryptocurrency investors concerned about the falling Bitcoin price, consider these strategies: Dollar-cost average into positions during dips Set stop-loss orders to manage risk Monitor trading volume for signs of reversal Diversify across different time frames The current Bitcoin price situation requires careful analysis rather than panic. Many experts believe this could be a healthy correction that sets the stage for the next upward move. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged despite short-term price fluctuations. Where Might the Bitcoin Price Go Next? Technical analysis suggests several possible scenarios for the Bitcoin price. If the $105,000 level holds, we might see consolidation before attempting to reclaim $108,000. However, if selling pressure continues, the Bitcoin price could test the $103,000 support zone. Market sentiment around the Bitcoin price will likely determine the next major move. Institutional interest, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors will all play crucial roles in determining whether this is a temporary setback or the beginning of a larger correction. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $106,000? The Bitcoin price decline resulted from combination of profit-taking, technical breakdowns, and shifting market sentiment across the cryptocurrency sector. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Many traders view price corrections as potential buying opportunities, but always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before investing. How low could Bitcoin price go? While predictions vary, technical support levels suggest $103,000-$104,000 as the next significant zone if the current decline continues. Will other cryptocurrencies follow Bitcoin price movement? Historically, altcoins often correlate with Bitcoin price movements, though the degree varies by individual cryptocurrency and market conditions. How long might this Bitcoin price correction last? Corrections can last from days to weeks. Monitor trading volume and key technical levels for signs of stabilization. What indicators should I watch for Bitcoin price recovery? Key indicators include increasing buying volume, reclaiming previous support levels, and positive shifts in market sentiment indicators. Found this analysis helpful?

54253384,https://timestabloid.com/?p=89240,1762828517,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Top 100x Meme Coin Right Now: BullZilla, Pudgy Penguins, And Brett Power Today’s Momentum",https://timestabloid.com/top-100x-meme-coin-right-now-bullzilla-pudgy-penguins-and-brett/,"Green shoots keep popping up again, but this time they glow in neon. After the Federal Reserve’s October 29 rate cut, traders are back scanning screens for the top 100x meme coin right now, wondering which name can turn liquidity into momentum. The cash tide is rising with over $7.53 trillion still parked in money funds, ready to rotate as yields slide. Meanwhile, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) soared earlier this week after a sharp 450% rally and new “Pudgy Party” game updates, while Brett (BRETT) spiked 11% in 24 hours despite lingering resistance. The market’s tone has shifted, risk is back, narratives are loud, and new money is looking for the next climb. BullZilla steps into that storm with structure and style. Its cinematic presale works like clockwork: every $100K raised or 48 hours triggers a price lift, creating a countdown that rewards conviction over hesitation. The Roar Burn tightens supply at lore milestones, the HODL Furnace turns patience into yield, and referral rewards spread momentum through the crowd. Visualize this as an elevator that keeps rising, one floor at a time, powered by mechanics rather than hype. That is why many already tag it as the top 100x meme coin right now, built for measurable scarcity in a market regaining confidence. BullZilla ($BZIL) Presale at a Glance Current Stage: 10th (Castle Bravo) – Phase: 1 Current Price: $0.00024573 Presale Tally: Over $1M Token Holders: Over 3500 Tokens Sold: Over 31 Billion Current ROI: (2045.20%) from Stage 10A to the Listing Price of $0.00527 Earliest Joiners Enjoy: 4173.56% Gain Until Stage 10A $1000 Investment = 4.069 Million $BZIL Tokens Upcoming Price Surge = 2.71% increase in 10B to $0.00025239 See Why the Earliest BullZilla Joiners Enjoyed a Massive 4173% Gain Potential. Final Countdown: Lock BullZilla At $0.00024573 Before The Next Price Step Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU): Consolidation Now, IP Flywheel Later Pudgy Penguins pushed a brand-led crypto model into the mainstream, then extended reach with the Solana-BRETT PENGU token and the “Pudgy Party” mobile game. Price action shows a sharp 2025 surge, followed by a deep correction and consolidation near a key $0.013 to $0.014 support band. Watch the $0.03 and $0.045 zones above, since reclaiming those levels can flip the structure from defense to offense. Macro helps if December or January brings another cut that loosens risk. PENGU’s IP, toys, and mobile funnel can keep new users coming, which matters when technicals reset for the next leg. Frequently Asked Questions About Pudgy Penguins Is PENGU tied to real-world products and IP? Pudgy Penguins ties on-chain assets to real products through toys, the Pudgy Party mobile game, and licensing. That IP pipeline funnels mainstream users toward token utility, which supports long arcs as technicals stabilize around defined support and resistance zones. What matters most on PENGU’s chart this week? Holding the $0.013–$0.014 support band remains key. A decisive reclaim of the $0.03 resistance would flip prior supply into demand, signaling renewed accumulation strength and potential continuation toward higher structural levels. BullZilla: Top 100x Meme Coin Right Now, Built For Measurable Scarcity BullZilla merges entertainment with precision, turning its presale into a live countdown fueled by data, design, and discipline. The Progressive Price Engine triggers an automatic price lift every $100K raised or 48 hours, giving early movers a measurable advantage and latecomers a clear entry path. Its Roar Burn slashes supply at lore milestones, while the HODL Furnace converts patience into yield, forging holders with conviction. Add a 10% referral bonus, and the cycle compounds reach organically. As of November 10, 2025, BullZilla stands at Stage 10 (Castle Bravo), priced at $0.00024573, surpassing $1M raised, with over 3,500 holders and 31B tokens sold. ROI sits near 2,045% of the listing target of $0.00527, and the next price step is just ahead at $0.00025239. Frequently Asked Questions About BullZilla What is the current BullZilla presale price? The BullZilla presale price sits at $0.00024573 in Stage 10 (Castle Bravo). Each $100K raised or 48-hour window triggers an automatic 2.71% price increase toward the next phase, keeping scarcity and demand synchronized by design. What’s the BullZilla presale price prediction for 2025? Analysts expect strong ROI potential as the listing approaches $0.00527. Early-stage holders already sit on 2,045% returns, and consistent burns plus staking yield suggest measurable appreciation once the project lists publicly. When will the BullZilla presale end? The BullZilla presale continues through its progressive stage model until the final allocation sells out or all phases are complete. With $1M+ already raised, the window tightens daily as the price climbs automatically. Your $1,200 Play, Visualized A $1,200 buy at $0.00024573 secures roughly 4.883 million BZIL, with a possible extra 10% via referral for a stronger stack. If the listing lands near $0.00527, the modeled upside from this stage becomes obvious, though markets can swing. Add staking after launch to compound conviction while the Roar Burn removes supply at lore triggers. That play stacks three drivers: price steps, burn pressure, and staking yield. It is rocket fuel for early believers, but timing still matters. Enter before the next stage increase, then monitor progress bars and chapter burns for momentum cues. How To Join The BullZilla Presale, Plus The Referral Boost Start at the official site, select “buy,” and connect a trusted wallet. Confirm the live stage, then enter the desired amount, remembering that the price moves after each $100K or after 48 hours. Use a referral code on $50+ buys for 10% bonus tokens, and share your own code to earn 10% of friends’ purchases. Rewards unlock two weeks after purchase. Track the Roarblood Vault for ecosystem fuel and check the HODL Furnace details for staking after launch. Protect funds by double-checking URLs, and avoid lookalike pages that mimic logos or countdowns. Referral page: https://www.bullzilla.com/referral/ . Fast Check: Spotting Fake Telegram Presale Channels Scammers mirror names and logos, then push fake “private rounds.” Verify links on the official site only, and avoid channels that post random contract addresses or ask for direct wallet seeds. Real teams never request seed phrases, and they never change contracts midstream without clear, signed updates. Check pinned posts against the website and scan admin handles for history. Use read-only wallets for testing small transactions first. Report suspicious groups to platform support so others stay safe. Keep a cold wallet for long-term holdings, and whitelist official URLs inside your browser for faster, safer access. Act Now: Secure Your BZIL Stack Before The Next Stage Kicks In Brett ($BRETT): Pop Today, Still Below Key Averages BRETT jumped about 11% intraday and sits near $0.0245, but higher-timeframe signals remain mixed. Price trades below the 20, 50, and 200 moving averages, which keeps trend pressure tilted lower until reclaimed. Momentum oscillators are split, hinting at a choppy range with sellers holding the edge beyond the day’s bounce. The five-day model shows a wide corridor and low odds for sustained upside unless the price breaks above the Ichimoku Kijun near $0.0271 with conviction. Watch that level, then the broader weekly range. Until then, treat strength as tactical. Keep risk rules tight and avoid overexposure. Frequently Asked Questions About Brett What could drive Brett’s next breakout? A decisive break above the Ichimoku Kijun near $0.0271, with strong volume and follow-through, can pivot sentiment. Sustained closes above the 20 and 50 averages would confirm a shift toward constructive trend development and reduce chop risk Does today’s 11% rise mean Brett has reversed? Today’s 11% pop is not a confirmed reversal. Price still sits below key moving averages. Watch for accumulation above resistance, improving RSI, and expanding volume breadth to validate a durable change in higher-timeframe trend. Conclusion This roundup spotlighted headline movers, and the top 100x meme coin right now is actively shaping today’s market pulse. PENGU continues building long-term strength through its brand ecosystem and mobile game funnel, though price action remains in consolidation. BRETT’s 11% rally hints at renewed attention, but broader recovery requires a break above key moving averages. Macro sentiment improves as the Fed’s second 2025 rate cut stirs liquidity and risk appetite, setting up December as a potential inflection point. Against that backdrop, BullZilla stands out with code-driven scarcity and community-powered growth. Its Progressive Price Engine, Roar Burn, and HODL Furnace together forge measurable momentum and yield. Stage 10, Castle Bravo, marks another timed opportunity before the next surge, momentum backed by math, not hype.

Article Summary Traders want clarity, not noise, and today’s highlights deliver it. PENGU steadies near support while its IP flywheel, toys, and a mobile game keep fresh users flowing. BRETT prints an 11% pop, yet remains capped below key moving averages until the Kijun breaks cleanly. Macro winds help after the Fed’s second 2025 cut, and record money funds give crypto a potential liquidity tailwind. BullZilla stands out with a presale that climbs by design, not luck.

The landscape of institutional investment is transforming dramatically as more than half of traditional hedge funds now hold crypto assets. This remarkable shift signals a fundamental change in how professional investors view digital currencies. Why Are Hedge Funds Embracing Crypto Assets? The percentage of traditional hedge funds holding cryptocurrency has surged to 55% this year. This represents an eight percentage point increase from last year’s 47%. The growing acceptance of crypto assets among institutional investors reflects changing market dynamics. Several factors drive this trend: Portfolio diversification beyond traditional assets Growing regulatory clarity in major markets Proven track record of major cryptocurrencies Client demand for exposure to digital assets Which Crypto Assets Are Funds Choosing? Bitcoin remains the primary choice for institutional investors. Its established position and relative stability make it attractive for hedge funds entering the crypto space. However, diversification is becoming more common as funds gain confidence. Ethereum follows as the second most popular crypto asset. Its smart contract capabilities and decentralized application ecosystem provide additional utility. Solana has also gained significant traction due to its high transaction speeds and growing developer community. What Challenges Do Funds Face With Crypto Assets? Despite growing adoption, hedge funds encounter several hurdles when dealing with crypto assets. Regulatory uncertainty remains a primary concern. Different jurisdictions have varying approaches to cryptocurrency regulation. Security considerations also play a crucial role. Funds must implement robust storage solutions for their crypto assets. Custody services have evolved to meet institutional standards, but risks persist. Volatility management requires specialized strategies Liquidity concerns in certain market conditions Accounting and reporting complexities Tax treatment variations across regions How Will Crypto Assets Impact Traditional Finance? The integration of crypto assets into traditional hedge fund portfolios represents more than just a trend. It signals a fundamental shift in investment philosophy. As more institutions allocate to digital assets, market infrastructure continues to mature. This growing acceptance of crypto assets creates new opportunities for innovation. Traditional financial products are evolving to include cryptocurrency exposure. The lines between conventional and digital finance are blurring rapidly. What Does the Future Hold for Institutional Crypto Adoption? The current 55% adoption rate likely represents just the beginning. As regulatory frameworks become clearer and infrastructure improves, more hedge funds will likely add crypto assets to their portfolios. The trend appears set to continue its upward trajectory. Smaller and mid-sized funds are now following the lead of larger institutions. The normalization of crypto assets in professional investment circles creates a virtuous cycle of adoption and development. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage of hedge funds invest in cryptocurrency? Currently, 55% of traditional hedge funds hold cryptocurrency assets, up from 47% last year. Which cryptocurrencies do hedge funds prefer? Bitcoin is the most popular, followed by Ethereum and Solana as secondary choices. Why are hedge funds adding crypto to their portfolios? They seek diversification, higher returns, and exposure to innovative technology sectors. Are there risks with hedge funds holding crypto assets? Yes, including volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and security concerns, though professional management helps mitigate these risks. Will this trend continue growing?

Price is holding the $1.90 to $3.40 band, with traders calling it a buildup zone. A clean move over $3.40 reopens targets from $4.20 to as high as $8.20.

After a steady climb, ETH now faces a crucial test near the $3,700 mark, a zone that could determine whether bulls reclaim control or if another pullback is on the horizon Ethereum’s Uptrend On The Line — Will Buyers Step In? According to Crypto King, a well-known crypto analyst, ETH has reached a crucial point on the daily chart that could determine its next major move. The analyst noted that ETH’s price action is currently hovering around a key level, making this moment critical to track the broader market structure. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Surge To $5,500: What To Watch Out For To Mark The Bottom In the post, Crypto King pointed out that the main uptrend line has been tested once again. The outcome of this test, the expert explained, will set the tone for Ethereum’s next direction, either confirming a bullish continuation or signaling the beginning of a deeper correction. Should the bulls manage to reclaim the trendline and drive the price above $4,950, Crypto King believes this could open the door for a strong move toward $5,600. Such a breakout would reaffirm the ongoing bullish trend and could attract renewed market interest. However, the analyst cautioned that failure to hold this key level may invite selling pressure, triggering a drop toward the $2,000 zone and invalidating the broader uptrend that has supported ETH in recent months. Crypto King concluded by reminding traders to stay calm and let the chart speak, emphasizing patience over panic. In volatile conditions like these, the market often rewards those who wait for clear confirmations rather than reacting impulsively to every move. Price Facing Critical Resistance At The $3,700 Mark In a more recent update from Ted Pillows, a crypto analyst, highlighted that ETH is now approaching the key $3,700 resistance level that is crucial for its next short-term direction. The market has shown renewed strength in recent sessions, but all eyes are now on how ETH reacts around this critical zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Crash Below $3,400 After Rejection From 0.618 Fibonacci Level According to Ted, if Ethereum closes a daily candle above $3,700, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum, potentially pushing the price toward $4,000. Such a breakout would likely signal that buyers are regaining control and could pave the way for further upside in the days ahead. However, Ted also warned that if ETH fails to break through resistance, a rejection could bring its price to the $3,400 support zone. This would indicate that bears are still defending the upper levels, keeping the price trapped within its current range.

That future just moved one step closer as US senators introduce groundbreaking legislation that could transform how digital assets are governed. This bipartisan effort aims to create a more streamlined approach to crypto oversight, potentially ending years of regulatory uncertainty. What Does This Crypto Oversight Bill Actually Propose? Senators John Boozman and Cory Booker have introduced legislation that would fundamentally reshape cryptocurrency regulation. The bill proposes transferring primary regulatory authority from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This shift in crypto oversight represents a significant departure from current regulatory practices. The legislation would classify most cryptocurrencies as digital commodities rather than securities. This classification change could provide much-needed clarity for the entire industry. The enhanced crypto oversight powers would give the CFTC greater supervisory authority over digital asset markets. Why This Crypto Oversight Change Matters Now The current regulatory landscape has created confusion for both investors and industry participants. Different agencies claiming jurisdiction over various aspects of cryptocurrency has led to: Unclear compliance requirements Overlapping regulatory demands Legal uncertainty for projects Slowed innovation due to fear of enforcement actions This new approach to crypto oversight could resolve these issues by establishing a single primary regulator. The CFTC’s experience with commodities markets makes it well-suited for this expanded role in crypto oversight. How Will Improved Crypto Oversight Benefit the Industry? Clearer crypto oversight brings multiple advantages to market participants. Investors would gain better protection through consistent regulation. Companies could innovate with greater confidence knowing the rules won’t suddenly change. The legislation strengthens crypto oversight by providing the CFTC with additional tools and resources. This enhanced framework could help prevent fraud while supporting legitimate innovation. The bill’s sponsors believe this approach to crypto oversight will position the United States as a leader in digital asset regulation. What Challenges Remain for Crypto Oversight Reform? Despite bipartisan support, the legislation faces several hurdles. Congress must approve the jurisdictional transfer, which requires navigating complex political dynamics. Some regulators may resist losing authority over certain aspects of crypto oversight. The bill also needs to address how existing SEC actions would transition under the new crypto oversight framework. However, the growing recognition that current regulatory approaches aren’t working provides momentum for change. The Future of Crypto Oversight in America This proposed shift in crypto oversight represents a pivotal moment for the digital asset industry. If passed, the legislation could establish a comprehensive regulatory framework that balances innovation with investor protection. The move toward clearer crypto oversight signals maturing recognition of cryptocurrency’s permanent role in financial markets. The bill’s success would demonstrate that lawmakers understand the need for specialized crypto oversight that differs from traditional securities regulation. This could pave the way for more sophisticated regulatory approaches worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions What is the main goal of this crypto oversight bill? The legislation aims to create clearer regulatory boundaries by moving primary authority from the SEC to the CFTC, classifying most cryptocurrencies as commodities rather than securities. How would this affect current cryptocurrency projects? Projects would operate under CFTC regulations instead of SEC rules, potentially simplifying compliance requirements and providing more predictable guidance. Why choose the CFTC for enhanced crypto oversight? The CFTC has extensive experience regulating commodities and derivatives markets, making it well-suited to oversee digital commodities trading. What happens to existing SEC enforcement actions? The legislation would need to address transition rules, but generally, ongoing cases would likely continue under their current jurisdiction until resolved. How likely is this crypto oversight bill to pass? While bipartisan support improves chances, comprehensive financial legislation often faces lengthy deliberation and potential amendments before passage. Would this affect how cryptocurrencies are taxed? Tax treatment would likely remain unchanged since the IRS has separate classification guidelines, though regulatory clarity might influence future tax policy.

This synergy transforms BlockDAG from a tech project into a cultural movement, blending blockchain innovation with the emotion and excitement of a global sport. Turning Spectators into Participants BlockDAG’s Formula 1® strategy isn’t just about visibility, it’s about connection. Millions of viewers who might never engage with crypto are now seeing a project that feels familiar, human, and exciting. This emotional bridge helps make blockchain accessible to audiences who once viewed it as distant or complex. With its presale currently in Batch 32 at $0.005and a confirmed launch price of $0.05, BlockDAG’s collaboration with the BWT Alpine Formula 1 Team amplifies its global footprint while linking it to major corporate sponsors and technology leaders across the F1 ecosystem. This partnership signals maturity, a calculated move that transforms BlockDAG into a gateway between traditional industries and the digital finance sector. It’s why lists of top crypto performers frequently include BlockDAG: it’s converting curiosity into participation through an event the world already loves. From Branding to Legacy This isn’t a short-lived sponsorship; it’s a sustained alliance designed to grow across multiple seasons. Just as Formula 1® evolves through precision and performance, BlockDAG is building for longevity. Its brand now reaches fans through events, digital experiences, and global activations, showing that blockchain can be fast, reliable, and user-friendly. For observers tracking top crypto performers, this strategy marks a new standard for credibility in the space. BlockDAG isn’t chasing hype; it’s establishing presence. It’s proving that authenticity and real-world integration can achieve what endless marketing never could: lasting trust. Final Thoughts BlockDAG’s partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team is a defining moment for crypto’s evolution into mainstream culture. By associating blockchain innovation with one of the world’s most prestigious sports, BlockDAG has secured something far more valuable than short-term attention; it has earned legitimacy. When BlockDAG officially launches, it won’t start from obscurity; it will already have a global audience that knows its name, its symbol, and its story. In a world where most crypto projects chase visibility, BlockDAG has built it through excellence. Among top crypto performers , few can claim a more natural or powerful route toward global adoption.

54255587,624850,1762830051,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54255587.jpeg,Cardano Faces First ‘Governance Shutdown’ — Hoskinson Responds,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-first-governance-shutdown-hoskinson/,"Cardano’s on-chain governance entered uncharted territory this weekend after the meme-mascot account HOSKY declared that the network’s Constitutional Committee (CC) was “dropping below the required seven members,” calling it “our first official government shutdown.” The post followed a formal retirement notice from the Cardano Atlantic Council, a seated CC member, which said it will “retire our CC keys on November 25th, following the epoch transition, to allow active proposals to ratify or expire.” What The Cardano ‘Governance Shutdown’ Means The proximate cause is political as much as procedural: a compensation proposal for CC members appears headed for defeat. In its thread announcing the decision, Cardano Atlantic said the “current CC Compensation governance proposal is unlikely to pass, based on the vote tally and rationales,” adding that “it appears the DRep community lacks appetite to compensate CC members… our decision is not a negotiation tactic or plea for Yes votes; it simply reflects a misalignment of expectations.” It also noted a 100% voting participation record during its term and said it “will not participate in any further proposals.” Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, downplayed the disruption, arguing that a rotating committee is a design feature, not a flaw. “The system works. Cardano is designed to be self-reflective and self-healing. People retire and others take their place,” he wrote in response to HOSKY on November 9. At issue is how the Cardano governance stack behaves when the CC slips beneath its configured minimum size. Under CIP-1694—the blueprint for Cardano’s Voltaire-era governance —there is an explicit protocol parameter, committeeMinSize, representing the minimal number of non-expired committee members. When membership falls below that floor, “the constitutional committee will be unable to ratify governance actions,” meaning actions requiring CC assent cannot be enacted until the committee is replenished. That matters immediately for categories such as treasury withdrawals and protocol-parameter changes, which require concurrent majorities from DReps and the CC. In normal operation, these actions are ratified by “at least two of these three governance bodies” (DReps, SPOs, CC), with the policy specifying exactly which bodies must co-approve each action type. Cardano’s developer documentation confirms that treasury withdrawals and parameter updates need both DRep and CC majorities; with an under-sized CC, these classes of actions stall regardless of DRep or SPO sentiment. This is the practical sense in which a “governance shutdown” occurs, even if the chain itself continues producing blocks and non-CC-dependent votes can proceed. Ecosystem reaction has been pragmatic, if tense. Jaromír Tesař, a prominent DRep operating as Cardano YOD₳ (Manda Pool), argued that the governance framework anticipated this scenario and predicted that “within a month, it will be possible to approve withdrawals again,” but he also warned of fatigue among DReps and friction over CC pay: “5 out of 7 CC members believe that their work is demanding and are asking for compensation, while DReps are strongly against their proposal… DReps are exhausted. Voting activity is decreasing every epoch.” From the DRep side, the theme of compensation—or lack of consensus about it—has become a flashpoint. Dori, a Cardano DRep, called for “more discussion around compensation,” attributing many “no” votes to “the community’s lack of prior discussion or failure to effectively communicate the reasoning behind CC rewards,” and reminding that “everyone has their own livelihood to consider.” Viewed through the lens of governance mechanics rather than social drama, what happens next is scripted by CIP-1694: the community can seat new CC members via the UpdateCommittee governance action and/or adjust thresholds; until then, actions that depend on an affirmative CC cannot be ratified.

ETH is showing positive signs but faces hurdles near the $3,650 resistance. Ethereum started a decent upward move above $3,420 and $3,500. The price is trading above $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $3,520 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it clears the $3,650 zone. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum price managed to stay above $3,250 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $3,350 and $3,420 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,920 swing high to the $3,058 low. The upward move was such that the price spiked to test the key hurdle at $3,650. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $3,520 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . If there is another recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $3,650 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,710 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,920 swing high to the $3,058 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,740 level. A clear move above the $3,740 resistance might send the price toward the $3,880 resistance. An upside break above the $3,880 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,920 resistance zone or even $3,950 in the near term. Another Pullback In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,650 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,540 level or the trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,485 zone. A clear move below the $3,485 support might push the price toward the $3,360 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,260 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,200 and $3,180.

South Korea’s Nextrade is making this vision a reality by pioneering copyright-backed digital assets that could transform how we invest in music intellectual property. What Makes Security Token Trading So Revolutionary? Security token trading represents the next evolution in digital assets. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, security tokens are backed by real-world assets – in this case, valuable K-pop music copyrights. Nextrade CEO Kim Hak-soo revealed the company’s ambitious plans to create new investment opportunities unavailable on conventional exchanges. The company has formed a strategic consortium with Musicow, a major player in music copyright management. This partnership aims to bridge the gap between entertainment intellectual property and blockchain technology. Moreover, they’ve already applied for preliminary approval to operate a fractional investment platform specifically for K-pop copyrights. How Will K-pop Copyrights Transform Security Token Trading? K-pop’s global popularity creates unique opportunities for security token trading. The industry generates billions in revenue through music sales, streaming, and merchandise. By tokenizing these copyrights, Nextrade enables fractional ownership of valuable intellectual property. Diversification opportunities for investors Access to previously illiquid assets Transparent royalty distribution through blockchain Global investment in Korean cultural content This innovative approach to security token trading could unlock billions in untapped value. Investors gain exposure to Korea’s cultural exports while artists benefit from new funding sources. What Challenges Does Security Token Trading Face? Despite the exciting potential, security token trading faces regulatory hurdles. South Korean financial authorities maintain strict oversight of digital assets. Nextrade must navigate complex securities laws while ensuring investor protection. The company’s alternative trading system status provides some flexibility. However, convincing regulators about the safety of copyright-backed tokens requires careful planning. Kim emphasized their commitment to working within regulatory frameworks while innovating security token trading products. Why Should Investors Care About This Development? Security token trading opens doors to previously inaccessible markets. K-pop copyrights represent stable, revenue-generating assets with global appeal. The fractional ownership model makes high-value copyrights available to smaller investors. This development signals broader acceptance of security token trading in mainstream finance. As traditional markets explore digital assets, early movers like Nextrade could establish crucial market positions. The success of this venture might inspire similar projects worldwide. What’s Next for Security Token Trading in Korea? Nextrade’s initiative could spark a wave of innovation in security token trading. Other intellectual property categories might follow K-pop’s lead. Movies, dramas, and even webtoons could become tokenized assets. The company’s focus on security token trading products unavailable on traditional exchanges demonstrates strategic thinking. By creating unique offerings, they avoid direct competition with established players while carving their niche. Conclusion: The Future of Music Investment Through Security Tokens Nextrade’s pursuit of K-pop copyright-backed security token trading represents a bold step toward financial innovation. This fusion of entertainment and blockchain technology could redefine how we value and trade intellectual property. As security token trading evolves, it may democratize access to valuable assets while creating new revenue streams for creators. Frequently Asked Questions What is security token trading? Security token trading involves buying and selling digital tokens backed by real-world assets like stocks, real estate, or in this case, music copyrights. How does K-pop copyright backing work? K-pop copyrights generate revenue from music sales, streaming, and licensing. Tokenizing these copyrights allows investors to share in this revenue stream. Is security token trading regulated? Yes, security token trading falls under securities regulations in most countries, including South Korea, requiring proper licensing and investor protections. Can international investors participate? This depends on final regulatory approval and whether Nextrade’s platform will be accessible to foreign investors under South Korean law. What makes this different from NFTs? Unlike NFTs which represent ownership of unique digital items, security tokens represent fractional ownership of income-generating assets and are regulated as securities. How secure is this investment? Security token trading platforms use blockchain technology for transparency, but like all investments, there are risks involving market volatility and regulatory changes.

Avalon Labs just made headlines with their impressive AVL token burn initiative, removing millions of tokens from circulation. This strategic move demonstrates their commitment to creating sustainable value for token holders. What Does This Massive AVL Token Burn Mean for Investors? Avalon Labs, a Bitcoin on-chain financial services platform, has executed a significant AVL token burn worth $1 million since October. The company removed 5.18 million AVL tokens from circulation, funded entirely by protocol revenue. This demonstrates their strong financial health and commitment to token value appreciation. The recent AVL token burn represents just part of their broader strategy. Year-to-date, Avalon Labs has burned an astonishing 100 million AVL tokens. This massive reduction represents 67% of the total circulating supply, creating significant scarcity effects. How Does Token Burning Benefit the AVL Ecosystem? Token burning serves multiple purposes in cryptocurrency ecosystems. For AVL token holders, this strategic AVL token burn provides several key benefits: Increased scarcity – Fewer tokens in circulation means each remaining token becomes more valuable Price support – Reduced supply typically leads to upward price pressure Investor confidence – Shows the project’s commitment to long-term value creation Sustainable economics – Funded by protocol revenue, not artificial mechanisms Why Is This AVL Token Burn Strategy So Effective? The effectiveness of this AVL token burn strategy lies in its funding source. Unlike many projects that burn tokens from treasury reserves, Avalon Labs funds these burns entirely through protocol revenue. This approach proves the platform’s real-world utility and earning capacity. Moreover, the consistent execution of the AVL token burn program since October shows systematic planning. The platform has maintained this initiative through various market conditions, demonstrating resilience and commitment to their tokenomics model. What Makes This Token Burn Different From Others? Several factors make this AVL token burn particularly noteworthy in the cryptocurrency space. First, the scale is impressive – burning 67% of circulating supply year-to-date is substantial. Second, the transparency and regularity of these burns build trust within the community. The Bitcoin on-chain nature of Avalon Labs adds another layer of credibility. Operating within the Bitcoin ecosystem brings additional security and reliability factors that differentiate this AVL token burn from other cryptocurrency projects. Future Implications of Continued AVL Token Burns Looking forward, the continued execution of the AVL token burn program could have significant implications. As the circulating supply continues to decrease, the remaining tokens become increasingly valuable. This creates a virtuous cycle where platform success fuels token value appreciation. The $1 million AVL token burn since October signals strong protocol revenue generation. This financial health suggests the platform is gaining traction and generating substantial income from its Bitcoin on-chain financial services. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Long-Term Value The recent AVL token burn by Avalon Labs represents a sophisticated approach to tokenomics. By systematically removing tokens from circulation using protocol revenue, they create sustainable value for investors. This strategy demonstrates how proper economic models can benefit both the platform and its token holders. As the cryptocurrency space evolves, such well-executed tokenomic strategies will likely become increasingly important. The success of this AVL token burn program could set new standards for how blockchain projects manage their token supplies and create lasting value. Frequently Asked Questions What is an AVL token burn? An AVL token burn refers to the permanent removal of AVL tokens from circulation, reducing the total supply and potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens. How many AVL tokens were burned recently? Avalon Labs burned 5.18 million AVL tokens worth $1 million since October, with 100 million tokens burned year-to-date. What funds the AVL token burns? All token burns are funded entirely by protocol revenue, meaning the platform’s operational earnings finance these supply reductions. How does token burning affect AVL price? Token burning typically creates scarcity, which can lead to increased demand and potential price appreciation for remaining tokens. What percentage of supply has been burned? Year-to-date burns represent 67% of the total circulating AVL token supply, a significant reduction. Is token burning common in cryptocurrency? Yes, many projects use token burning as a deflationary mechanism, but the scale and funding method of AVL burns are particularly notable.

This massive wave of forced closures has left traders reeling and markets volatile, with Bitcoin and Ethereum positions taking the hardest hits. What Triggered These Massive Crypto Futures Liquidations? Market volatility reached extreme levels, triggering automatic margin calls across major exchanges. When traders can’t meet margin requirements, their positions get forcibly closed – creating a cascade effect that amplifies price movements. This recent crypto futures liquidations event demonstrates how quickly conditions can change in derivative markets. Breaking Down the $166M Liquidation Carnage The damage distribution reveals fascinating patterns about trader sentiment and positioning: Bitcoin (BTC): $73.64 million liquidated, with 56.64% being short positions Ethereum (ETH): $68.95 million liquidated, dominated by 58.58% long positions Zcash (ZEC): $23.55 million liquidated, with 74.4% being long positions Why Are Crypto Futures Liquidations So Important? Understanding crypto futures liquidations helps traders gauge market sentiment extremes. When liquidations spike, it often signals potential trend reversals or exhaustion moves. The current data shows traders were heavily positioned for Bitcoin to fall while betting on Ethereum to rise – but the market had other plans. How to Protect Yourself From Future Liquidations Surviving volatile markets requires smart risk management. Consider these strategies: Use proper position sizing to avoid over-leverage Set stop-loss orders at reasonable levels Monitor funding rates and open interest Maintain adequate margin buffers The Domino Effect of Major Crypto Futures Liquidations When large positions get liquidated, they create selling pressure that can trigger additional crypto futures liquidations in a chain reaction. This phenomenon explains why markets can move so violently during these events. The recent $166 million wipeout serves as a stark reminder of derivative trading risks. What Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Mean for Market Direction? Massive crypto futures liquidations often flush out weak hands and can set the stage for new trends. With Bitcoin shorts and Ethereum longs taking significant damage, the market structure has been reset. However, traders should watch for follow-through price action to confirm any directional changes. The recent $166 million crypto futures liquidations event underscores the inherent risks of leveraged trading. While these shakeouts create opportunities for savvy traders, they also serve as painful lessons about over-leverage and proper risk management in volatile cryptocurrency markets. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto futures liquidations? Liquidations occur when traders can’t meet margin requirements after adverse price movements, forcing exchanges to automatically close their positions. Why were Bitcoin shorts liquidated more than longs? Price movements likely went against short positions, triggering margin calls for traders betting on Bitcoin’s decline. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use proper risk management, avoid over-leverage, maintain sufficient margin, and set appropriate stop-loss orders. Do large liquidations affect spot prices? Yes, forced selling from liquidations can create additional downward pressure on spot markets. What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations happen when prices fall, while short liquidations occur when prices rise against positioned traders. Are liquidations always bad for the market? While painful for affected traders, liquidations can help reset leverage and create healthier market conditions long-term. Found this analysis of the recent crypto futures liquidations helpful?

Analyst Says Not Before a Pullback to This Key Level,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-at-6-or-even-10-analyst-says-not-before-a-pullback-to-this-key-level/,"Ripple’s cross-border token benefited from the positive developments around the company behind it in recent weeks and the growing hype about a potential launch of a spot XRP ETF in the United States. One popular analyst remains highly bullish on the asset for the long run, predicting a massive surge to $6, which would mean a 140% pump from the current levels. However, Ali Martinez warned that XRP might first need to pull back to under $2 before it explodes to a new all-time high. If this bull run keeps going, $XRP could offer a solid buying opportunity at $1.90 before rallying to $6. pic.twitter.com/D7X7HRnHom — Ali (@ali_charts) November 10, 2025 The analyst with over 160,000 followers on X noted that a potential drop to $1.90 would provide a “solid buying opportunity” before the history-making rally to $6. In a separate post, Martinez outlined the “dream scenario” for XRP, which would again require a price correction to $1.90. It would complete the formation of a bullish flag that could spark an even more impressive rally that could drive Ripple’s token all the way up to $10. It’s worth noting that both of these price targets are quite ambitious at press time, to say the least. XRP’s current record level was achieved in July when it peaked at $3.65. Consequently, a surge to $10 would require a 174% increase from the ATH levels. If XRP is indeed to post such a marvelous candle, its market capitalization would skyrocket to over $600 billion, which would make it bigger than ETH. Although this sounds like a bit of a fantasy football league at the moment, XRP has completed similar impressive runs in the not-so-distant past (recall the end of 2024/early 2025 rally). It has a lot of bullish factors behind it, such as Ripple’s big moves in terms of partnerships and acquisitions. Spot XRP ETFs are also a hot subject among regulators and the crypto community, as the first batch is anticipated to launch as early as this week. The post XRP at $6 or Even $10?

According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, long-term Bitcoin holders have initiated a significant Bitcoin sell-off, liquidating 371,584 BTC since July. This massive movement represents one of the largest holder distributions in recent memory, raising important questions about market direction and investor sentiment. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Sell-Off Really Mean? The scale of this Bitcoin sell-off is truly remarkable. When long-term holders, typically the most resilient investors, begin moving such substantial amounts, it signals a potential shift in market dynamics. This Bitcoin sell-off pattern suggests that even seasoned investors are taking profits or repositioning their portfolios amid current market conditions. Several factors could be driving this unprecedented Bitcoin sell-off. Market volatility, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic pressures often influence holder behavior. However, the timing and scale of this particular Bitcoin sell-off deserve closer examination to understand its full implications. Breaking Down the Numbers: The Real Impact Let’s put this Bitcoin sell-off into perspective. The 371,584 BTC sold since July represents: Significant market liquidity injection Potential price pressure on Bitcoin Changing holder distribution patterns New buying opportunities for other investors This substantial Bitcoin sell-off doesn’t necessarily indicate bearish sentiment alone. Sometimes, long-term holders sell to rebalance portfolios or capitalize on specific market conditions. The key is understanding the context behind this Bitcoin sell-off movement. How Should Investors Respond to This Development? For current Bitcoin investors, this Bitcoin sell-off presents both challenges and opportunities. While increased selling pressure might concern some, it also creates potential entry points for new investors. The market often experiences cycles where long-term holders take profits, making room for new participants. Consider these factors when evaluating this Bitcoin sell-off: Historical holder behavior patterns Current market fundamentals Your personal investment timeline Overall portfolio diversification Market Implications Beyond the Immediate Sell-Off This Bitcoin sell-off extends beyond simple price action. It reflects changing sentiment among Bitcoin’s most committed supporters. When long-term holders engage in significant selling, it often precedes important market transitions. However, remember that market cycles are normal in cryptocurrency investing. The Bitcoin sell-off we’re witnessing could indicate several scenarios. It might represent profit-taking after substantial gains, portfolio rebalancing, or response to external market factors. Each possibility carries different implications for future price action and market stability. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Bitcoin? While this Bitcoin sell-off seems dramatic, historical patterns suggest such movements often create foundation for future growth. Market corrections and holder distribution can establish healthier price levels and attract new investors. The key is maintaining perspective during these transitional periods. Successful investors understand that Bitcoin markets move in cycles. This current Bitcoin sell-off represents just one phase in the ongoing evolution of cryptocurrency markets. By staying informed and maintaining a long-term view, investors can navigate these changes effectively. Frequently Asked Questions Why are long-term Bitcoin holders selling now? Long-term holders might be taking profits after significant price appreciation, rebalancing portfolios, or responding to macroeconomic factors affecting their investment strategies. Should I be worried about this Bitcoin sell-off? Market corrections are normal in cryptocurrency investing. While increased selling pressure can cause short-term volatility, it often creates buying opportunities for long-term investors. How does this affect Bitcoin’s price? Substantial selling from long-term holders can create temporary price pressure, but markets typically absorb this liquidity over time as new buyers enter. Is this similar to previous Bitcoin sell-off events? Yes, Bitcoin has experienced similar holder distribution phases throughout its history, often preceding new market cycles and price discovery phases. What should new investors do during this period? New investors should focus on dollar-cost averaging, thorough research, and maintaining a long-term perspective rather than reacting to short-term market movements. How long might this selling pressure continue? The duration depends on various factors including market conditions, investor sentiment, and external economic factors. Historical patterns suggest these phases typically last several months. Found this analysis helpful?

The proposal came up for discussion at a working group meeting on November 7. Regulators say the move is meant to tighten checks on outside firms that handle trading systems or custody services for exchanges. Work Group Moves To Tighten Rules Under current law, exchanges must follow strict rules for holding users’ money, including storing funds in cold wallets. But outside vendors that run trading software or custody tools operate without the same legal footprint. Regulators say that gap leaves room for mistakes and security holes. The plan would require exchanges to deal only with registered providers, creating a clearer line of responsibility. Registration Could Raise Accountability Most members of the working group that reviewed the draft supported a registration system , based on reports. They told the council that a formal list of approved providers would increase transparency and make it easier to apply consistent standards across the board. If passed, the system would likely include checks on security practices, incident reporting rules, and clearer lines for who is responsible when things go wrong. Plans For Legal Change And A Timeline The FSA plans to compile a full report of the discussions and push for changes to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act at the 2026 ordinary Diet session. That timetable gives legislators time to consider the details and for industry groups to weigh in. Some in the market warn the new rules could mean extra compliance work for smaller vendors. Others say that may be a fair trade for stronger protections for customers. Stablecoins And Pilot Projects Based on reports , the FSA is not only focused on custody. The agency has also signaled interest in nurturing regulated stablecoin work inside Japan. In October 2025, the FSA approved JPYC, the country’s first yen-pegged stablecoin, which launched shortly after. The regulator has also supported a pilot stablecoin effort involving major banks MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho Bank. The DMM Crypto Incident That Changed Views The push for change gained speed after a major hack in 2024. Reports have disclosed that hackers stole over 48 billion yen — roughly $311 million — in Bitcoin from DMM Bitcoin. Investigators later traced the breach to Ginco, a Tokyo-based firm that managed parts of DMM’s trading system. That case made it plain to many officials that outsourcing critical operations can spread risk beyond the exchange itself.

Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/could-shiba-inu-triple-analyst-sees-200-move-coming/,"According to technical commentary from analyst Javon Marks, Shiba Inu appears to have left a long accumulation zone and may be entering a fresh bullish phase. The token first showed a breakout in March 2024 and pushed up toward $0.000046. It reached about $0.00003328 on December 8, 2024, before falling hard in 2025. Related Reading: Trump’s Bitcoin Bet Grows: American Bitcoin Now Holds Over 4,000 BTC Analyst Points To Accumulation Breakout Marks highlights early bullish signals, including what he calls bullish divergences on the MACD that showed up earlier this year. Based on reports, he expects a move back into the $0.000032 area. He even projects a potential 200% rally to that level from where the token trades now. From the current quoted price of $0.00001009, a push to $0.000080 would mean a rise of roughly 700% by his estimate. Those are large swings. Traders should note the math. $SHIB (Shiba Inu) looks to be already broken out of a key accumulation and prices, which showed bull divergences early this year, can be preparing here for an ~200% move to test a resistance in the $0.000032s again. pic.twitter.com/Xw104EUT75 — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) November 9, 2025 Derivatives Activity Shows Traders Positioning For A Move Derivatives data adds another dimension. Reports show about $76 million in open interest tied to Shiba Inu contracts. Open interest jumped 15% over the weekend, and exchanges recorded 7.38 trillion tokens as outstanding futures exposure. Gate.io accounted for 47% of that total, which equals about $36 million on that platform alone. On a day of rising bets, SHIB hit a high of $0.00001032. Volatility Has Been Extreme SHIB’s path since December 2024 has been bumpy. After peaking above $0.00003 in late 2024, the token plunged to roughly $0.0000075 during the flash crash on October 10, 2025. It later recovered to about $0.00001003. Rapid moves like these show both the risk and the chance for big short-term gains. Positions in futures can make price swings bigger. What The Signals Might Mean For Traders According to the chart reading, breaking past $0.000032 would open a clear resistance band and could attract more buyers. Some market players will treat that level as a key test. Others will watch open interest and exchange concentration for signs of overstretch. Moves driven by sentiment and leverage can reverse quickly. Gains may be fast. Losses can be fast too.

But this is a trader-led setup more than a proof of long-term value. Technical signals, heavy derivatives exposure, and past wild swings all matter. Investors and traders should weigh the numbers: $0.000045, $0.00003329, $0.000032, $0.00001003, $0.0000075, $76 million, 15%, 7.38 trillion, and 47.13% are all part of the story.

Momentum has just launched its groundbreaking MMT buyback program , creating waves of anticipation among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This strategic move promises to reshape token economics while delivering substantial rewards to loyal supporters. What Exactly is the MMT Buyback Program? The MMT buyback program represents a bold step toward strengthening Momentum’s ecosystem. This decentralized exchange will use its generated revenue to systematically purchase MMT tokens from the market. The purchased tokens then get redistributed to veMMT holders, creating a sustainable reward cycle. This approach serves multiple purposes: Reduces circulating supply of MMT tokens Rewards long-term supporters Strengthens overall token value Builds community trust Why Should You Care About This Development? The MMT buyback program isn’t just another crypto announcement—it’s a game-changer for token holders. By converting MMT to veMMT, users can participate in this rewarding ecosystem. The program specifically benefits three key groups: veMMT holders receive direct token redistribution Title Deed holders get additional rewards WAGMI participants enjoy enhanced benefits How Does This Strengthen Momentum’s Ecosystem? Momentum’s leadership clearly understands the importance of sustainable tokenomics. The MMT buyback program creates a virtuous cycle where protocol success directly benefits token holders. As revenue increases, more tokens get bought back, further reducing supply and potentially increasing value. This strategic approach addresses common DeFi challenges: Token inflation concerns Holder retention issues Long-term sustainability Community engagement What Makes This Buyback Program Different? Unlike traditional buyback programs that simply remove tokens from circulation, Momentum’s MMT buyback program focuses on redistribution. This creates ongoing incentives for community participation. The program encourages users to convert their MMT to veMMT, which simultaneously reduces circulating supply while rewarding committed holders. The benefits extend beyond immediate rewards: Builds long-term holder base Creates price stability mechanisms Enhances protocol governance Fosters ecosystem growth Conclusion: A New Era for Momentum Tokenomics The launch of the MMT buyback program marks a significant milestone for Momentum and the broader Sui ecosystem. This innovative approach to token economics demonstrates forward-thinking leadership and commitment to community rewards. By aligning protocol success with holder benefits, Momentum creates a sustainable model that could set new standards for decentralized exchanges. Frequently Asked Questions How often will the MMT buyback occur? The buyback program will operate continuously using protocol revenue, ensuring consistent token purchases and redistribution to veMMT holders. What benefits do Title Deed holders receive? Title Deed holders receive special rewards within the buyback program, though specific allocation details should be verified through official Momentum channels. Can I participate if I only hold MMT tokens? To fully benefit, you need to convert MMT to veMMT. The program specifically rewards veMMT holders with redistributed tokens. How does this affect MMT token price? While no guarantees exist, reducing circulating supply through buybacks typically creates positive price pressure over time. What is the minimum veMMT required for participation? There’s no minimum requirement—all veMMT holders participate proportionally based on their holdings. How does WAGMI participation work? WAGMI participants receive additional rewards through the program, though exact mechanisms may vary based on specific WAGMI terms. Found this analysis helpful?

Analysts see growing momentum that could push BTC toward $111,000, driven by improving liquidity, bullish technicals, and easing fiscal uncertainty, signaling the next phase of crypto market recovery. Nasdaq and Cboe to Launch Regulated Spot and Leveraged Crypto Trading Next Month Nasdaq and Cboe are set to introduce regulated spot and leveraged cryptocurrency trading as early as next month, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Acting Chair Caroline Pham confirmed that the move will allow exchanges such as CME Group and Coinbase Derivatives to offer margin trading for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) under federal oversight. This marks the first time leveraged crypto spot trading will be permitted in the U.S., enhancing market transparency and investor protection. Analysts suggest that trillions in trading volume currently flowing through offshore platforms like Binance and Bybit could shift to regulated U.S. markets. JUST IN: CFTC’s Acting Chair Caroline Pham confirms push to launch leveraged spot crypto trading on U.S. exchanges. pic.twitter.com/ENyOiTI1om — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 10, 2025 The decision is widely seen as bullish for Bitcoin, with expectations that regulated leveraged trading will boost liquidity, attract institutional participation, and strengthen BTC’s upward momentum—potentially driving prices beyond $110,000 in the coming weeks. Crypto Treasury Firms Turn to Risky Tokens, Raising Market Volatility Fears As Bitcoin’s rally shows signs of fatigue, a growing number of digital asset treasury (DAT) firms, companies that hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin on their balance sheets, are shifting toward smaller, riskier tokens in search of higher returns. According to a Reuters report, more than 200 corporations now hold digital assets, but with Bitcoin’s price stabilizing, many are diversifying into altcoins that offer greater yield potential but come with elevated volatility and liquidity risks. This trend could intensify market swings, especially if firms with large holdings begin rotating capital too aggressively. Crypto treasury companies pivot to fringe tokens, stoking volatility fears https://t.co/PBcBy139Bx — BNN Bloomberg (@BNNBloomberg) November 10, 2025 The move underscores a broader risk-on sentiment among institutional crypto holders, mirroring behavior seen in previous late-cycle rallies. While some executives argue that selective exposure to DeFi and Layer-2 tokens helps offset declining Bitcoin returns, regulators and risk managers remain cautious, citing limited oversight and higher counterparty risks in these markets. With Bitcoin consolidating near $106,000, experts say a sharp shift toward speculative tokens could exacerbate price instability across the broader crypto market, especially if liquidity thins or macro conditions worsen. US Government Shutdown Nears End, Boosting Risk Assets and Crypto Confidence As the US Senate moves closer to ending the 40-day government shutdown, risk assets such as Bitcoin and the Australian dollar surged, reflecting renewed investor optimism. The prolonged closure had disrupted the release of key economic data and delayed regulatory decisions, heightening market uncertainty. The resolution will allow markets to “price in real fundamentals,” paving the way for institutional investors to increase allocations to digital assets. Once government operations fully resume, inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are expected to strengthen, restoring confidence across risk markets. Signs of compromise in Washington are giving risk assets a modest lift and softening the yen. Here's our take – and what's to be expected for FX markets over the week ahead: https://t.co/RLUJCZ3uPl — ING Economics (@ING_Economics) November 10, 2025 Following the announcement, cryptocurrency trading volumes spiked, with several altcoins posting double-digit gains. Bitcoin rose 1.67% to nearly $105,000, signaling strong buying momentum as investors positioned for a post-shutdown rebound. Market strategists view the reopening as bullish for Bitcoin, noting that reduced uncertainty and renewed ETF optimism could attract further institutional inflows. If momentum continues, BTC may retest previous highs near $126,000, supported by improving macro sentiment and easing fiscal pressures. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Eyes $111K as Rising Channel Signals Strength Bitcoin (BTC/USD) holds firm near $106,700, sustaining its advance within an ascending channel on the 2-hour chart. The pattern signals ongoing bullish momentum as buyers consistently defend higher lows. After rebounding from $104,000 support, BTC broke above $106,000, confirming short-term upside pressure. The 20-EMA remains above the 50-EMA, reinforcing buyer control, while the RSI at 68 suggests strong but not overextended momentum. A bullish engulfing candle on November 9, followed by consecutive higher closes, highlights steady accumulation. Price action now targets resistance near $108,200, with a breakout potentially opening a path toward $111,000–$113,000, where Fibonacci resistance and the channel’s upper boundary align. A drop below $105,300 would signal weakening momentum and could trigger a retest of $104,000 support. Still, the broader setup remains constructive, if momentum holds, Bitcoin could be gearing up for its next rally phase, mirroring early patterns from previous breakout runs.

This news comes just three years after the company secured major backing from one of South Korea’s largest conglomerates, raising questions about the validator landscape in Asia’s crypto hub. Why is this South Korean validator shutting down? The Seoul Economic Daily broke the news about a41’s impending closure. This South Korean validator had been operating for three years since receiving substantial investment from SK Group. The timing raises important questions about validator sustainability in current market conditions. SK’s involvement represented a significant vote of confidence in blockchain infrastructure. Their investment of 5.078 billion won (approximately $3.7 million) secured an 8.33% stake in the South Korean validator company. This backing from a major corporation made a41’s shutdown particularly noteworthy for industry observers. What challenges do validators face in South Korea? The closure of this South Korean validator highlights several industry challenges: Regulatory pressures in the Korean market Operational costs for maintaining validator nodes Competition intensity among blockchain service providers Market volatility affecting investment returns These factors combined create a challenging environment for any South Korean validator operation. The shutdown suggests that even with corporate backing, sustainable validator business models remain difficult to establish. What does this mean for blockchain infrastructure? The departure of a established South Korean validator like a41 creates ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. Validators play crucial roles in: Network security maintenance Transaction verification processes Consensus mechanism participation Blockchain decentralization efforts When a significant South Korean validator exits the market, it potentially affects network health and decentralization metrics. However, the blockchain space has proven resilient to such changes in the past. What can we learn from this validator’s journey? The three-year operation of this South Korean validator provides valuable insights for the industry. Corporate backing alone doesn’t guarantee success in the volatile crypto space. Sustainable validator operations require: Diverse revenue streams beyond basic validation Adaptive business models that can weather market cycles Strong community support and delegation Technical innovation to stay competitive The experience of this South Korean validator serves as a case study for future infrastructure projects considering corporate partnerships. Looking forward: The future of validators in South Korea Despite a41’s closure, the South Korean validator ecosystem continues to evolve. The country remains a significant player in global blockchain adoption, with: Strong developer communities Progressive regulatory developments High public interest in cryptocurrency Continued corporate exploration of blockchain technology Other South Korean validator operations will likely learn from a41’s experience and adjust their strategies accordingly. The market’s response to this shutdown will reveal much about the maturity of Korea’s blockchain infrastructure sector. Frequently Asked Questions What was a41’s role as a South Korean validator? A41 operated as a blockchain validator, participating in network consensus and transaction verification for various blockchain protocols. Why did SK invest in this South Korean validator? SK likely saw potential in blockchain infrastructure as part of their digital transformation strategy and interest in emerging technologies. How will this affect other validators in South Korea? The shutdown may lead to increased caution among investors but also creates opportunities for remaining validators to capture market share. What happens to the networks a41 validated? Blockchain networks typically have multiple validators, so other operators will absorb a41’s responsibilities without significant disruption. Could a41 restart operations in the future? While possible, most validator shutdowns tend to be permanent due to the specialized nature of the business and competitive landscape. What does this mean for SK’s blockchain strategy? SK will likely reassess their blockchain investments but probably won’t abandon the space entirely given its strategic importance.

In a surprising turn of events, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs have snapped back to positive territory with a $1.15 million net inflow after just one day of outflows. This quick recovery signals ongoing investor confidence in digital asset vehicles despite market fluctuations. What Do These Bitcoin Spot ETF Numbers Really Mean? The recent data from TraderT reveals an interesting pattern in Bitcoin spot ETFs activity. On July 10, the entire net inflow of $1.15 million (approximately 1.7 billion won) came from a single fund. This concentration suggests that while overall interest remains, investors are becoming more selective about which Bitcoin spot ETFs they trust with their capital. This selective behavior isn’t necessarily negative. Actually, it shows that the market for Bitcoin spot ETFs is maturing. Investors are now looking beyond the basic concept and evaluating individual fund performance, management teams, and track records. Why Did Only One Bitcoin Spot ETF Attract Funds? The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) stood alone in attracting new capital while all other Bitcoin spot ETFs reported zero net flows. This raises an important question: What makes certain Bitcoin spot ETFs more appealing than others? Several factors could explain BITB’s exclusive inflow: Proven track record of consistent performance Competitive fee structure that appeals to cost-conscious investors Strong marketing and visibility within investment communities Positive analyst ratings from financial research firms This pattern demonstrates that not all Bitcoin spot ETFs are created equal. As the market evolves, differentiation becomes crucial for attracting and retaining investor capital. How Should Investors Approach Bitcoin Spot ETFs Now? Given the mixed performance among different Bitcoin spot ETFs, investors need to develop a strategic approach. The days of simply buying any available Bitcoin spot ETF and expecting automatic returns are fading. Today’s successful investors conduct thorough due diligence before committing funds. Consider these actionable insights when evaluating Bitcoin spot ETFs: Monitor flow patterns over time rather than single-day movements Compare expense ratios across different Bitcoin spot ETFs Research the fund managers and their cryptocurrency expertise Diversify across multiple Bitcoin spot ETFs if appropriate for your risk tolerance Remember that small inflows like the recent $1.15 million can signal changing sentiment before larger movements occur. Savvy investors watch these subtle shifts closely. The Future Outlook for Bitcoin Spot ETFs Looking ahead, the trajectory for Bitcoin spot ETFs appears cautiously optimistic. The quick return to positive flows suggests underlying strength in investor demand. However, the concentration of inflows in a single fund indicates that competition among Bitcoin spot ETFs will intensify. Market analysts predict several developments for Bitcoin spot ETFs in the coming months: Potential new entrants to the Bitcoin spot ETFs space Possible fee reductions as competition increases Enhanced product features and investor benefits Greater regulatory clarity that could boost all Bitcoin spot ETFs These factors could make Bitcoin spot ETFs even more accessible and attractive to mainstream investors. Final Thoughts: What This Means for Your Portfolio The recent $1.15 million inflow to Bitcoin spot ETFs, while modest, represents an important psychological victory for the cryptocurrency investment space. It demonstrates resilience and suggests that educated investors continue to see value in Bitcoin spot ETFs as part of a diversified investment strategy. Rather than focusing solely on the dollar amount, consider what this movement reveals about market sentiment. The quick recovery from outflows to inflows indicates that negative periods may be temporary rather than trend-setting. For long-term investors, this stability narrative around Bitcoin spot ETFs could be more valuable than any single day’s flow numbers. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin and track its spot price, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding the cryptocurrency directly. Why did only one Bitcoin spot ETF see inflows? Investors are becoming more selective, often choosing funds with lower fees, strong track records, or better marketing visibility among competing Bitcoin spot ETFs. Is $1.15 million a significant amount for Bitcoin spot ETFs? While relatively small compared to historical flows, any positive movement after outflows signals renewed investor interest and can indicate changing market sentiment. How often do Bitcoin spot ETFs report flow data? Bitcoin spot ETFs typically report daily flow data, allowing investors to track short-term movements and identify trends in investor behavior. Should I invest in Bitcoin spot ETFs now? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and research. Bitcoin spot ETFs can provide cryptocurrency exposure but carry market volatility risks. What’s the difference between various Bitcoin spot ETFs? Different Bitcoin spot ETFs may vary in expense ratios, fund size, management teams, and additional features or services offered to investors. Found this analysis helpful?

However, a group of analysts has drawn parallels between the present performance and the significant rally observed in 2023. Positive Signals For The Bitcoin Price In a recent update shared on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), analysts from The Bull Theory highlighted that the Bitcoin price has once again closed a weekly candle above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a critical indicator that has historically supported every major uptrend over the past two and a half years. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Set For 1,200% Rally To $2.2 In This 3rd Run This EMA level has been tested multiple times, notably in August 2024 and April 2025, where Bitcoin dipped below it briefly before reclaiming the position and entering a new upward trajectory. Currently, a similar pattern appears to be forming. The analysts pointed out that Bitcoin has maintained its position within a multi-year support zone on the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Although momentum has cooled, there are no signs of an impending breakdown, the analysts asserted. In previous instances where the RSI reached this level during the current cycle, it signaled the conclusion of a corrective phase and the onset of expansion. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is resetting near its historical reversal zone, a zone that has previously triggered rallies in early 2023, late 2024, and again in the second quarter of 2025. This suggests a potential exhaustion of selling pressure rather than the beginning of a new downtrend. Strong Potential For Future Gains From a structural standpoint, the recent corrective move appears complete. Bitcoin has retraced nearly 20% from its peak of $126,000, aligning perfectly with the average correction size observed in each impulsive wave since the cycle began. When considering the signals from the reclaimed EMA, the RSI support, and the MACD reversal zone, the current structure mirrors setups that preceded major breakouts since 2023. This analysis implies that the market is not on the verge of a breakdown but rather undergoing a necessary reset.

Looking ahead, the analysts suggest that this could signify the fifth wave of the current market structure, with potential price targets ranging between $160,000 and $180,000 by the first quarter of 2026. Technically, all indicators currently favor continuation rather than collapse. When writing, the Bitcoin price was trading at $106,520, recording a nearly 2% recovery in the 24-hour time frame, according to CoinGecko data.

This initiative aims to provide “equitable access” to a broader range of tokens, ensuring clear disclosures and transparent terms for users. Coinbase Launches New Token Sales Platform At the outset, Coinbase aims to offer access to retail users across most regions worldwide, with plans for future expansion. Notably, this marks the first significant opportunity for US users to participate in such token sales since 2018. Unlike traditional “first-come, first-served” sales that often fail to engage a project’s true community, Coinbase’s new token sale design prioritizes equitable access for many, rather than favoring a select few. Token sales will be open for a defined period, such as one week, during which users can submit their requests. Once the window closes, the algorithm will determine the final allocation for all participants. Coinbase has emphasized its commitment to user-centric design, stating that the new sales model rewards genuine supporters with higher allocation priority. Users who sell their tokens shortly after listing—specifically within the first 30 days—may receive smaller allocations in future sales, thereby prioritizing access for “true enthusiasts of the projects.” MON Token Launch Scheduled For Next Week The exchange plans to host approximately one token sale each month on this new platform, utilizing its algorithm to manage token allocations. Initial purchases will be made using USD Coin, a stablecoin pegged to the dollar and issued by stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL). The Layer 1 (L1) blockchain Monad project is set to offer its highly anticipated MON token on this platform for the first time next week, between November 17 and 22. In its announcement, Coinbase stated that this initiative aims to address the challenges faced by token issuers in distributing their tokens to genuine users while simultaneously building robust exchange liquidity. The exchange also noted that initial coin offerings (ICOs), once a popular fundraising method during the 2017 crypto boom, have seen a decline due to increased regulatory scrutiny over investor protection and disclosure. Looking ahead, Coinbase has plans to enhance the token sales platform with additional features, including limit orders and greater allocations for issuers’ target user bases. This launch is described as just the beginning of a new era for token distribution. At the time of writing, the exchange’s native token, COIN, was trading at $316—a little over 4% increase on Monday. This increase was also fueled by a recovery in broader cryptocurrency prices, with tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP leading the way.

The message was framed as a hypothetical future conversation about having missed the chance to acquire XRP at a much lower price. The point of the scenario was not to guarantee any particular price outcome but to emphasize individual responsibility in market research and decision-making. Imagine trying to explain to your grandkids why you didn't buy XRP. ""Pappa, weren't you there in 2024 when XRP was $0.50?"" ""Well, there was this other coin called Bitcoin, and everyone told us to buy that instead, we didn't know any better. It wasn't our fault. I mean, who… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 27, 2025 The Core Message of the Post In the post, Vincent Van Code illustrated a conversation between a grandparent and future grandchildren, in which the grandparent explains why they did not purchase XRP when it was valued near $0.50. The scenario suggested that the individual followed general market sentiment at the time and opted for Bitcoin instead. It then described a hypothetical situation in which XRP reached $5,000 , implying that the grandparent missed what is portrayed as a significant opportunity. The tone of the example is structured to highlight hindsight regret rather than provide a prediction or assurance of future performance. The narrative concludes with the suggestion to conduct thorough personal research before making investment decisions. The phrase “Don’t be that Grand pappa, DYOR” served as a reminder that digital asset markets require independent evaluation rather than relying on prevailing sentiment or external pressure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Responses to the Post Several X users contributed comments expressing similar reflections. One user, identified as John, expanded on the scenario. He stated that some individuals may have missed early opportunities with Bitcoin and may repeat the same pattern with XRP. Another user, Paul Roussel, responded with a more optimistic perspective. He noted that he still considers there to be time to evaluate and potentially take action. He added that even a price level of $3 would, in his view, still represent a favorable opportunity for some market participants depending on their individual circumstances and strategies. His comment reflected a belief that strategic entry points do not always require extreme highs or lows to be considered beneficial. The conversation initiated by Vincent Van Code underscores a widely recognized principle in digital asset investing: outcomes are shaped by individual choices, research, and timing rather than hindsight narratives. The comments illustrate how investors often reflect on missed opportunities. However, they also highlight that decisions in these markets are personal and contingent on one’s risk tolerance, objectives, and access to information at the time. The emphasis remains on informed decision-making rather than speculation. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The acquisition brings BitMine’s total Ether holdings to 3,505,723 tokens at an average price of $3,639 per token. BitMine chairman Tom Lee highlighted the opportunity presented by recent Ether price dips. “To me, it is evident that Wall Street is very interested in tokenizing assets onto the blockchain, creating greater transparency and unlocking new value for issuers and investors. This is the key fundamental story and supports our view that Ethereum is a super cycle story over the next decade,” Lee said. Originally a cryptocurrency mining firm, BitMine has evolved into the largest Ethereum treasury company. The firm’s ETH holdings are now valued at around $12.5 billion, representing approximately 2.9% of the total 120,696,594 ETH supply. BitMine has set a long-term goal of acquiring 5% of all Ethereum tokens. Lee, who is also co-founder of financial research firm Fundstrat, remains highly bullish on ETH’s potential. In mid-October, he forecasted Ether could reach between $10,000 and $12,000 by the end of 2025. At the time of writing, ETH trades at $3,561, down 13.4% over the past two weeks and 4.7% in the past month. This means BitMine’s treasury is currently in a paper loss, requiring a roughly 180% increase in price to reach Lee’s $10,000 target by year-end. Meanwhile, BitMine’s stock, BMNR, has surged over 400% in 2025, trading at $41.15.

However, the exchange saw a net loss of $159.5 million, equaling about $6.67 per share. In the latest shareholder letter , the company highlighted that it netted nearly $50 million, a strong 52% growth in revenue from the previous quarter. The firm reported a steeper loss than analysts’ expectations, according to a Bloomberg survey . Analysts anticipated a $3.24 loss per share, while the company posted a loss of $6.67.

The surge is attributed to the exchange’s new features and expansion into new markets. The firm reported 111% surge in services revenue to $19.9 million. The surge reflects “continued diversification of Gemini’s business mix and growing contributions from credit card, staking, and custody products,” the New York-based company said. “The Gemini Credit Card delivered record performance, surpassing 100,000 open accounts and more than $350 million in quarterly transaction volume, more than doubling quarter over quarter,” said Cameron Winklevoss, President and Co-Founder, Gemini, during the earnings call . Additionally, the exchange introduced a self-custody wallet in August that aims to streamline user access to Web3 protocols, DeFi platforms, and on-chain applications. Besides, it is also preparing to launch prediction market contracts , competing with dominant players – Kalshi and Polymarket. Gemini See Mounting Losses The crypto platform has logged a massive $159.5 million loss in Q3, as Gemini’s operating expenses more than doubled from the same period last year. The loss is largely due to stock-based compensation and its September IPO marketing, with adjusted EBITDA at negative $52.4 million. “We expect spend levels in upcoming quarters to depend on the performance opportunities we see in the market,” said Marshall Beard, COO at Gemini, during Monday’s earnings call.

The answer lies in one critical price level that every trader should be watching right now. According to recent market analysis, the $2.50 support level has become the make-or-break point for XRP’s ongoing bullish momentum. Why the XRP Uptrend Hinges on $2.50 The recent failure to break through the $2.57 resistance level has put all eyes on the crucial support zone below. Market data reveals that order books on major exchanges show substantial buying interest between $2.48 and $2.52. This concentration of buy orders creates a strong foundation that could propel the XRP uptrend forward if maintained. Analysts emphasize that the $2.50 to $2.52 range represents more than just a number. It’s a psychological barrier where: Institutional buyers have placed significant orders Retail traders see value in accumulating positions Technical indicators converge to form strong support What Happens If Support Holds? Maintaining above $2.50 could trigger the next phase of the XRP uptrend. A daily close above $2.57 would serve as a strong confirmation signal for continued upward movement. This breakthrough would likely attract additional buyers who have been waiting on the sidelines for clear direction. The current market structure suggests that holding this level could lead to: Renewed buying pressure from both retail and institutional investors Breakthrough of key resistance levels Acceleration of the existing XRP uptrend momentum Warning Signs: When the XRP Uptrend Faces Risk However, failure to maintain the $2.50 support level presents clear risks. A breakdown below this critical zone could trigger a short-term correction toward the $2.45 to $2.47 range. Traders should monitor these key indicators for potential weakness: Volume patterns during support tests Order book depth changes Market sentiment shifts Strategic Trading Approaches for the Current XRP Uptrend Successful navigation of this critical juncture requires careful planning. Traders should consider implementing risk management strategies that account for both scenarios. Position sizing becomes particularly important when trading near key support levels that could determine the future XRP uptrend direction. Remember that the overall XRP uptrend remains valid as long as the asset maintains its position above the identified support zone. The current consolidation phase represents either a pause before the next leg up or a potential reversal point, making disciplined trading essential. Conclusion: The XRP Uptrend Crossroads The $2.50 support level represents a pivotal moment for XRP’s price action. While the broader XRP uptrend narrative remains intact, traders should remain vigilant and prepared for either outcome. The coming days will reveal whether this support level can fuel the next upward surge or if a temporary pullback is necessary before continuation. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is the XRP uptrend referring to? The XRP uptrend describes the consistent upward price movement that XRP has been experiencing, characterized by higher highs and higher lows on the price chart. Why is the $2.50 level so important for XRP? The $2.50 level represents a major support zone where significant buying interest exists, making it crucial for maintaining the current XRP uptrend momentum. What happens if XRP breaks below $2.50? A break below $2.50 could trigger a short-term correction toward the $2.45-$2.47 range, potentially pausing the current XRP uptrend temporarily. How can traders confirm the XRP uptrend continuation? Traders should watch for a daily close above $2.57 resistance with strong volume to confirm the XRP uptrend continuation. What time frame should I watch for XRP price action? Daily and 4-hour charts provide the clearest picture for monitoring the XRP uptrend and key support levels. Are there any additional indicators to watch besides price? Yes, monitor trading volume, order book depth, and relative strength index (RSI) alongside price action for comprehensive analysis of the XRP uptrend. Found this XRP uptrend analysis helpful?

This shocking Gemini Q3 loss comes despite the platform more than doubling its revenue compared to the same period last year. What’s behind these contradictory financial results, and what does it mean for the future of cryptocurrency exchanges? What Caused the Massive Gemini Q3 Loss? Gemini’s third-quarter financial results present a complex picture of growth and challenge. The exchange reported $50.6 million in revenue, representing more than double last year’s Q3 performance. However, this impressive revenue growth was overshadowed by a net loss that widened significantly to $159 million. The primary driver behind this substantial Gemini Q3 loss appears to be strategic investments made in preparation for the company’s planned Nasdaq listing in September. Industry analysts suggest that the timing of these expenses created a perfect storm. The exchange incurred higher operational costs, regulatory compliance expenses, and technology upgrades simultaneously. These investments, while necessary for long-term growth, created short-term financial pressure that resulted in the notable Gemini Q3 loss. How Did Revenue Growth and Loss Coexist? The simultaneous occurrence of revenue growth and significant losses might seem contradictory at first glance. However, this pattern often appears in scaling technology companies pursuing aggressive expansion strategies. Gemini’s situation mirrors similar growth phases seen in other tech giants during their pre-IPO periods. Key factors contributing to this financial dynamic include: Infrastructure scaling costs for handling increased trading volume Regulatory compliance expenses across multiple jurisdictions Technology development for new product offerings Marketing and user acquisition campaigns Legal and advisory fees for the Nasdaq listing process What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For cryptocurrency investors and traders, the Gemini Q3 loss raises important questions about exchange stability and market health. While the loss figure appears alarming, context is crucial. The planned Nasdaq listing represents a significant milestone that could bring enhanced credibility and regulatory oversight to the cryptocurrency space. However, investors should consider several implications: Exchange financial health affects user fund security Strategic losses may indicate future growth potential Market competition is driving increased operational costs Regulatory compliance becomes increasingly expensive Will the Nasdaq Listing Change Gemini’s Fortune? The planned Nasdaq listing in September represents both the cause of current financial strain and potential future salvation. Public listing typically provides access to capital markets, enhanced credibility, and liquidity for early investors. However, it also brings increased scrutiny and quarterly performance pressure. The substantial Gemini Q3 loss reflects the high costs associated with preparing for this transition. Public company requirements demand: Enhanced financial reporting systems Strengthened corporate governance Expanded compliance frameworks Increased transparency and disclosure What’s Next for Gemini and Crypto Exchanges? The cryptocurrency exchange landscape continues evolving rapidly, with the Gemini Q3 loss serving as a case study in industry maturation. As regulatory frameworks solidify and competition intensifies, exchanges face mounting pressure to balance growth investments with financial sustainability. Looking forward, several trends will shape the exchange ecosystem: Consolidation through mergers and acquisitions Increased focus on profitability over pure user growth Diversification into adjacent financial services Enhanced security and insurance offerings The Gemini Q3 loss story ultimately reflects the growing pains of an industry transitioning from startup phase to mainstream financial infrastructure. While the $159 million deficit appears dramatic, it represents strategic positioning for future growth rather than fundamental business failure. As cryptocurrency continues its march toward institutional adoption, such investments in compliance, technology, and market position may prove prescient. Frequently Asked Questions How much revenue did Gemini generate in Q3? Gemini reported $50.6 million in third-quarter revenue, more than double the revenue from the same period last year. Why did Gemini experience such a large loss despite revenue growth? The $159 million net loss resulted from significant costs incurred ahead of the company’s planned Nasdaq listing, including regulatory compliance, technology upgrades, and operational scaling expenses. Is user fund security at risk due to the Gemini Q3 loss? While the loss raises questions about financial health, exchanges typically maintain separate operational accounts from user funds. However, investors should always practice proper security measures. When is Gemini planning to list on Nasdaq? The company planned its Nasdaq listing for September, though specific timing may depend on market conditions and regulatory approvals. How does this loss compare to other cryptocurrency exchanges? Many cryptocurrency exchanges experience similar growth-phase losses as they invest heavily in infrastructure and compliance ahead of anticipated market expansion. Will this affect Gemini’s services or fees? While exchanges may adjust fee structures to improve profitability, the Q3 loss primarily reflects strategic investments rather than immediate operational challenges.

TeraWulf’s latest quarterly report reveals some fascinating insights into the world of professional Bitcoin mining operations. The company just announced staggering Q3 results that demonstrate both the challenges and opportunities in today’s cryptocurrency landscape. What Makes TeraWulf’s Bitcoin Mining Performance Remarkable? TeraWulf reported $50.6 million in third-quarter revenue, representing an impressive 87% increase compared to the same period last year. This substantial growth highlights the company’s effective scaling strategies in the competitive Bitcoin mining sector. However, the path to profitability in Bitcoin mining isn’t always straightforward. The company mined 377 BTC during the quarter, which actually decreased from the 555 BTC mined in Q3 of the previous year. This contrast between revenue growth and Bitcoin production decrease tells a compelling story about the evolving Bitcoin mining industry. How Does Bitcoin Mining Revenue Increase While Production Decreases? Several factors contribute to this seemingly contradictory outcome in Bitcoin mining operations: Bitcoin price appreciation throughout the quarter Operational efficiency improvements in mining infrastructure Energy cost optimization strategies Enhanced mining equipment performance Strategic timing of Bitcoin sales This scenario demonstrates that successful Bitcoin mining isn’t just about producing more coins. It’s about creating a sustainable business model that can thrive despite market fluctuations and increasing mining difficulty. What Challenges Do Modern Bitcoin Mining Operations Face? Bitcoin mining companies like TeraWulf must constantly adapt to several industry challenges. The decreasing Bitcoin production despite higher revenue suggests they’re navigating these obstacles effectively. Key challenges in today’s Bitcoin mining landscape include: Increasing global mining difficulty Energy consumption concerns Regulatory uncertainty Equipment maintenance and upgrades Market volatility management TeraWulf’s ability to grow revenue amid these challenges showcases their strategic approach to Bitcoin mining operations. Why Is Efficient Bitcoin Mining Crucial for Long-Term Success? The future of Bitcoin mining depends heavily on operational efficiency and strategic planning. Companies that master these elements position themselves for sustained success in the competitive cryptocurrency space. Effective Bitcoin mining requires balancing multiple factors simultaneously. Operations must maintain profitability while investing in future capabilities and navigating regulatory landscapes. TeraWulf’s Q3 performance suggests they’re finding this balance successfully. Conclusion: The Evolving Landscape of Professional Bitcoin Mining TeraWulf’s Q3 results paint a picture of an industry in transition. The company’s impressive revenue growth combined with decreased Bitcoin production highlights how professional Bitcoin mining operations are evolving beyond simple coin production. They’re becoming sophisticated businesses that must manage multiple variables to achieve sustainable profitability. The future of Bitcoin mining will likely see continued emphasis on operational efficiency, energy management, and strategic business practices rather than pure production volume. Frequently Asked Questions Why did TeraWulf’s revenue increase while Bitcoin production decreased? The revenue growth despite lower Bitcoin production is primarily due to Bitcoin price appreciation throughout the quarter and improved operational efficiencies in their Bitcoin mining operations. How does Bitcoin mining difficulty affect companies like TeraWulf? Increasing Bitcoin mining difficulty means companies need more powerful equipment and better strategies to maintain production levels, which can impact profitability if not managed properly. What makes Bitcoin mining profitable despite energy costs? Successful Bitcoin mining operations optimize energy consumption, use efficient equipment, and strategically time their Bitcoin sales to maximize returns. How do Bitcoin mining companies adapt to market volatility? They employ various strategies including hedging, diversifying revenue streams, maintaining operational flexibility, and careful financial planning. What is the future outlook for Bitcoin mining companies? The industry is moving toward greater professionalization, with emphasis on sustainable practices, energy efficiency, and sophisticated business management. How important is location for Bitcoin mining operations? Extremely important. Access to affordable energy, favorable regulations, and stable infrastructure are crucial factors in Bitcoin mining profitability.

Miners, such as Bitdeer Technologies, report significant revenue gains, and whales appear to be holding steady. This is a pattern strikingly similar to the pre-rally phase seen four years ago. Remittix (RTX) is a relatively new project that is also drawing attention as investors seek early-stage tokens that could replicate Bitcoin’s explosive growth curve in the upcoming cycle. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Could Bitcoin Get a 500% Rally? BTC is changing hands for about $105,493 as the tone shifts from terror to calm accumulation. Analysts suggest that Bitcoin’s recent consolidation may resemble the pattern seen in 2020. BTC was around $10,000 for months before it suddenly increased by over 500% within a year. For weeks, the Bitcoin price has been fluctuating between $100,000 and $120,000. However, the key indicators suggest that another significant move is forthcoming soon. According to data, firms like Bitdeer Technologies Group have been aggressively expanding operations. Revenue increased 173.6% year-over-year to $169.7 million, while treasury holdings rose to 2,029 BTC, valued at approximately $214 million. While Bitdeer did post a net loss of $266.7 million, its expansion of hashrate to 41.2 EH/s and progress with the SEAL04 chip indicate long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s network growth. If it does even a portion of what it did in 2020, that target zone would extend out to $500,000–$525,000, which is roughly a 400%–500% rally from here. No one can promise that it will happen, but to many traders, the setup certainly has a familiar look and feel. Remittix (RTX): The Next Big Gainer Beyond Bitcoin While Bitcoin may still be the safest bet, early investors are increasingly searching for smaller-cap projects that could outperform it in percentage terms. One such contender is Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi token bridging crypto and traditional banking systems. The project’s fundamentals are proving strong. Over $28 million has already been raised, with more than 684 million tokens sold at $0.1166. Its 15% USDT referral program, which pays daily through a transparent dashboard, continues to attract community engagement and new buyers. Here’s why traders now include RTX in their altcoin watchlists: Active Payments Network: Users are already testing live crypto-to-bank transfers. CertiK Verified: The project is ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens for 2025 security audits. Exchange Growth: Remittix is listed on BitMart and LBank, with the third major listing in the works. Solid Metrics: $28 million raised and 684 million tokens sold show strong demand. Bitcoin Price Prediction Meets Real-World Adoption The newest Bitcoin price prediction cycle replaces hype with conviction as a source of tangible gains. Whether BTC will repeat its 500% rally or not, the setup replicates that of 2020, with strong miner performance and steady accumulation. Still, while Bitcoin steals headlines, Remittix (RTX) is a fast-rising PayFi project actually delivering on real-world payments. The mix of mature, such as BTC, and highly growth-related tokens, like RTX, for example, divides investors’ portfolios to capture both stability and explosive upside in the next bull market.

CEO James Nathanielsz described the crypto treasury initiative as a “transformative phase” for the company, and said that it will strengthen its balance sheet and advance its proenzyme-based cancer treatment platform. While Propanc did not disclose which digital assets it plans to buy, Hexstone’s portfolio includes investments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Injective, and other cryptocurrencies. The move places Propanc among the growing number of biotech companies, like Sonnet BioTherapeutics and Sharps Technology, that have turned to crypto strategies to attract new investors. Despite the bold initiative, Propanc’s stock price fell 12% on the Nasdaq after the announcement. This certainly reflects some of the market sentiment toward crypto treasury strategies, which recently struggled due to declining valuations for major Bitcoin-holding companies.

The Japanese yen has plunged to its lowest level in nine months, while other Asia FX pairs struggle to maintain footing. This dramatic shift comes as Washington makes significant progress toward avoiding a government shutdown, boosting dollar sentiment globally. Why Asia FX Markets Are Under Pressure The collective decline in Asia FX values represents one of the most significant regional currency movements this quarter. Multiple factors are converging to create perfect storm conditions for Asian currencies. The US dollar strength appears unstoppable as political developments in Washington reduce uncertainty about government funding. Meanwhile, the yen low situation has become particularly concerning for Japanese policymakers. Yen Low Crisis Deepens as Intervention Fears Grow The Japanese yen’s descent to nine-month lows has market participants watching for potential Bank of Japan intervention. The currency has broken through several key technical levels, raising alarms about sustained weakness. This yen low environment creates both challenges and opportunities for traders and investors. Currency Current Level Change vs USD Key Support Japanese Yen 148.50 -1.2% 150.00 Chinese Yuan 7.2950 -0.8% 7.3000 Korean Won 1335.00 -1.1% 1350.00 Dollar Strength Accelerates on US Shutdown Progress The remarkable dollar strength we’re witnessing stems directly from reduced political risk in Washington. As lawmakers move closer to a funding agreement, the traditional safe-haven appeal of the US currency is being amplified. This dollar strength phenomenon is creating ripple effects across global currency markets, with Asia FX bearing the brunt of the pressure. How US Shutdown Developments Impact Global Currencies The US shutdown progress represents a critical turning point for market sentiment. When Washington functions smoothly, it typically strengthens the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency. This US shutdown resolution removes a major uncertainty that had been weighing on investor confidence. Reduced political risk boosts dollar appeal Asian central banks face intervention decisions Export-dependent economies benefit from weaker currencies Import costs rise, potentially fueling inflation Navigating Currency Markets During Turbulent Times Currency markets are experiencing heightened volatility as these fundamental shifts unfold. The combination of yen weakness and broad Asia FX declines creates both risks and opportunities. Understanding the interplay between these currency markets movements is essential for informed decision-making. FAQs Which Asian currencies are most affected by dollar strength? The Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and Korean won are experiencing the most significant pressure. The Bank of Japan is closely monitoring the yen’s movement. How does US political stability affect Asian currencies? When the US demonstrates political stability, particularly regarding the US government shutdown risks, it typically strengthens the dollar and weakens Asia FX pairs. What levels are traders watching for the yen? Market participants are closely monitoring the 150 yen per dollar level, as breaching this could trigger intervention from the Japanese Ministry of Finance . How are cryptocurrency markets reacting to these currency movements? Digital assets often move inversely to dollar strength, making them potential beneficiaries of Asia FX weakness, though correlation patterns can vary. The dramatic shifts in Asia FX values, particularly the yen’s steep decline, highlight the interconnected nature of global financial markets. As dollar strength continues on the back of US shutdown progress, Asian central banks face difficult decisions about intervention and monetary policy. The coming weeks will be crucial for determining whether current trends represent temporary volatility or a more sustained realignment in currency relationships.

The Senate passed a funding deal late Monday that would restore federal operations, and the bill now moves to the House for a vote, before heading to President Trump for signoff. Asian equities were mostly higher. South Korea’s Kospi rose 1.3% as it clawed back last week’s losses, and Japan’s Nikkei added 0.4%. Hong Kong and mainland China traded slightly lower by mid-morning, suggesting investors there were more cautious. S&P 500 futures were steady. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $105,373, down 0.9% Ether : $3,548, down 1.4% XRP : $2.48, up 1.4% Total crypto market cap: $3.64 trillion, down 0.7% Markets Recover As US Senate Moves To End 40-Day Government Shutdown The relief trade extended beyond equities. Gold jumped nearly 3% overnight and held comfortably above $4,100 in Asia hours. The Nasdaq climbed 2.3 percent, recovering much of last week’s slide when traders punished expensive AI-linked names and questioned the sustainability of their margins. The backdrop shifted after the US Senate approved a 60-40 deal to fund federal agencies and end the shutdown, which has run for more than 40 days. The bill keeps the government funded through Jan. 30, 2026, restores pay and jobs for laid-off federal workers, protects food assistance through Sept. 2026, and promises a December vote on Affordable Care Act subsidies. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he wants to move quickly, with a House vote as soon as Wednesday. The market is already pricing in an early reopening, with prediction platforms showing high confidence the shutdown will end this week. Markets Ease Into Risk As Shutdown Progress Offsets Softer Fed Expectations Safe havens eased as investors leaned back into risk. The yen weakened and US Treasury yields initially ticked higher, showing less demand for protection. Some of that move later faded as Federal Reserve officials pushed back on the idea of a rapid rate cut, and bond traders reassessed how much easing the Fed will tolerate in December. Fed tone matters for crypto. Bitcoin tends to trade as a high beta macro asset when liquidity expectations shift. A credible path to ending the shutdown removes one source of fiscal stress, steadies risk sentiment and reduces the odds of further forced selling in digital markets that had been bracing for prolonged instability in Washington. Clearer Rules And Macro Relief Encourage Institutional Flows Into Crypto “Global risk appetite surged today as US equities rallied, led by NVIDIA’s 5.8% jump, its largest daily gain since April,” said Riya Sehgal, research analyst at Delta Exchange. She said the rebound in big tech had reignited optimism across risk assets and that some of that renewed appetite is bleeding into crypto. Sehgal said regulatory moves are adding to that momentum. She pointed to the Senate action to reopen the government, a bipartisan draft in the Agriculture Committee that would give the CFTC clearer authority over digital commodities, and fresh IRS guidance that allows crypto ETFs and trusts to earn staking rewards. She said those signals are supporting inflows and backing Bitcoin’s move off $100,000 toward $107,000, with Ether above $3,600. She added that if Bitcoin can clear resistance in the $107,000 to $111,000 zone, the market could see a broader uptrend in major digital assets. Gracy Chen, CEO at Bitget, said she views the Senate’s shutdown deal as a step toward restoring economic stability. She also called the push to define CFTC oversight of crypto a long-awaited break for the industry, saying it gives the market more predictability and trust. “Together, these developments signal a maturing regulatory landscape, one that encourages innovation without stifling growth, fostering greater predictability and trust across digital asset markets,” Chen said. She added that with macro stress easing, institutional money is more likely to come in under clearer rules, which could lift liquidity, trading volumes and overall participation into year end.

The automaker trimmed its annual outlook by 20%, citing higher electric vehicle costs and supply disruptions related to chipmaker Nexperia , which the Netherlands took over from China’s Wingtech on September 30. Kaihara says automakers have to reduce prices to draw in customers The company forecast a 385 billion yen ($2.6 billion) loss from U.S. tariffs, an improvement from the 450 billion yen ($ 2.9 billion) it had previously projected. Nevertheless, shares weakened by 4.7% at one point on Monday as concerns grew about Japan′s waning automotive influence in Southeast Asia. For years, Japanese automakers felt their Southeast Asian markets were safe from the headwinds battering China. But that safety net is disappearing. Executive Vice President Noriya Kaihara said at a media briefing, “In markets like Thailand, the competitive landscape is quite intense and overall we have lost our competitive edge in terms of pricing.” Kaihara also warned that automakers are now under pressure to lower prices and offer more promotions to maintain consumer interest. Honda now expects operating profit of 550 billion yen ($3.6 billion) for the year through March 2026, down from a previous forecast of 700 billion yen ($4.5 billion). Vehicle sales guidance was also cut to 3.34 million units following disruptions from China’s export halt of Nexperia semiconductors. With supply easing, the carmaker expects production to pick up from the week of November 21. Though recently, Honda had to push back the launch of its Ye Series electric vehicles in China, blaming high costs and software shortcomings for the setback. Nonetheless, seeking to regain momentum in China, Honda has teamed up with Momenta to advance its autonomous driving capabilities. Honda saw its Indonesian sales tumble by nearly 30% Honda now anticipates selling 925,000 vehicles in Asia this year, including China, a drop of over 10% from its earlier projection of 1.09 million. The expected dip in sales outside China has widened dramatically to 75,000 cars from the initial 5,000. According to an industry insider, Japanese domestic automakers are being increasingly squeezed by Chinese EV brands, such as BYD, in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Indonesia, due to their competitive advantage. He stated, “Southeast Asia is starting to be significantly impacted by Chinese players. The growth of Chinese EVs in Thailand over the past two years has been extraordinary.” Overall, Honda’s sales in Southeast Asia declined considerably, with a nearly 30% drop in Indonesia through the first nine months of the year, as well as falls of 18% in Malaysia and 12% in Thailand. Still, Honda and other Japanese automakers are increasingly focused on India, a market that has yet to be captured by Chinese EV makers. The company last month announced that it would use India as a manufacturing and export base for one of its planned electric vehicles. However, some analysts note that Honda faces a more fundamental, perhaps systemic challenge compared to other automakers. Yoshio Tsukada called the company’s profit gap “unbalanced.” He recommended that splitting off Honda’s motorcycle business from its auto operation would enable the bike unit to prosper worldwide. However, the car division would continue facing challenges under its present administrative framework. Get seen where it counts.

According to a recent research report, the planned 2027 implementation of the South Korean crypto tax might be postponed for the fourth time, raising serious concerns about the government’s ability to effectively regulate and tax the growing digital asset market. Why is the South Korean crypto tax facing another delay? Kim Kap-rae, a senior research fellow at the Korea Capital Market Institute, recently published a concerning analysis. The report highlights that a proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act submitted on September 3rd contained almost no significant improvements to the crypto tax framework. This failure to address fundamental issues means the same problems that caused three previous delays remain unresolved. The current South Korean crypto tax proposal has been controversial since its inception. Key challenges include: Unclear classification of different cryptocurrency types Technical difficulties in tracking transactions across multiple exchanges Lack of consensus on valuation methods for tax purposes Concerns about privacy and data security What are the risks of repeated South Korean crypto tax delays? Each postponement of the South Korean crypto tax implementation creates more significant problems. The research warns that continued delays could provoke substantial tax resistance from cryptocurrency users. When taxpayers lose confidence in the system’s stability and fairness, they may become less cooperative with future collection efforts. The pattern of delays has already created uncertainty in South Korea’s cryptocurrency market. Investors and exchanges struggle to plan for the future when tax rules keep changing. This uncertainty affects: Long-term investment strategies Exchange compliance systems development International business operations Market stability and growth How does the South Korean crypto tax compare globally? South Korea isn’t alone in facing challenges with cryptocurrency taxation. However, the repeated delays put the country behind other major economies that have established clearer frameworks. The ongoing uncertainty around the South Korean crypto tax creates competitive disadvantages for local exchanges and investors compared to jurisdictions with more stable regulations. Other countries have successfully implemented cryptocurrency taxes by: Providing clear guidance documents Offering transition periods for compliance Creating simplified reporting systems Educating taxpayers about requirements What’s next for the South Korean crypto tax? The possibility of a fourth delay for the South Korean crypto tax implementation cannot be ruled out according to the research. The government faces mounting pressure to either fix the systemic issues or acknowledge that the 2027 timeline might not be realistic. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency users continue operating in regulatory limbo. Stakeholders should prepare for several potential scenarios: Another formal delay announcement Revised legislation with substantial changes Phased implementation approach Increased enforcement of existing tax laws Conclusion: The critical crossroads for South Korean crypto taxation The South Korean crypto tax situation has reached a pivotal moment. Continued delays risk undermining the government’s credibility and the tax system’s effectiveness. However, rushing implementation without resolving fundamental issues could create even bigger problems. The path forward requires balancing urgency with careful planning to ensure the South Korean crypto tax framework works for everyone involved. Frequently Asked Questions When was the South Korean crypto tax originally supposed to start? The tax was initially scheduled for implementation in 2022 but has been delayed multiple times, with the current target set for 2027. What tax rate is proposed for cryptocurrency in South Korea? The proposed tax rate is 20% on gains exceeding 2.5 million won (approximately $1,900) annually. Why is implementing cryptocurrency taxation so challenging? Challenges include tracking cross-exchange transactions, determining cost basis, classifying different crypto assets, and ensuring taxpayer compliance without overwhelming the system. How have cryptocurrency exchanges responded to the delays? Exchanges have expressed frustration with the uncertainty but continue preparing for eventual implementation while advocating for clearer guidelines. What happens if there’s another delay? Another delay would maintain the current tax-free status for cryptocurrency gains but extend regulatory uncertainty for investors and businesses. Are other countries facing similar cryptocurrency tax challenges? Yes, many countries struggle with cryptocurrency taxation, though South Korea’s repeated delays are particularly notable in major economies. Found this analysis helpful?

Easing lockdown concerns and reports of a potential new stimulus plan aimed at boosting liquidity have raised questions about whether Bitcoin can maintain its momentum or whether a new pullback is imminent. In the program broadcast on “The Wolf Of All Streets” and hosted by Dave Weisberger (CoinRoutes CEO), James Lavish (CIO & Macro Strategist) and Mike McGlone (Bloomberg Senior Commodity Strategist), macroeconomic factors affecting the markets and the future of Bitcoin were discussed. Experts believe the recent market volatility stems from the easing of the threat of a US government shutdown. James Lavish and Dave Weisberger predict that once the government reopens, the approximately $150 billion in liquidity sitting in the Treasury General Account (TGA) will begin to flow back into the economy, supporting markets. Related News: After Zcash, Another Altcoin Jumps at the Possibility of Collaboration with ZEC Mike McGlone maintained his long-standing cautious stance on Bitcoin, arguing that the asset needs to close above $110,000 to demonstrate its strength. He also noted that traditional commodities like gold are overstretched and could experience a correction. Dave Weisberger and James Lavish, on the other hand, argue that market sentiment indicators don't indicate a peak for Bitcoin. They cite data from Grock, noting that social media and other indicators, including the Fear and Greed Index, are overwhelmingly “extremely bearish,” which is unusual for a bull market peak. Weisberger also adds that Bitcoin’s network power (hash rate) continues to grow steadily and strongly, making it the most important long-term indicator of the eventual demand for Bitcoin. Experts have stated that Bitcoin has now entered its “distribution phase,” with existing investors who held it since day one able to sell large amounts without depressing the price thanks to increased liquidity. Weisberger believes that the assumption that Bitcoin's supply is “inelastic” to the price in 2025 proved false, and that there is selling pressure at current levels, but this will subside before the next major price move. *This is not investment advice.

BOE Moves Forward With Stablecoin Holding Limits On Monday, the Bank of England released a new consultation paper on its proposed regulatory framework for sterling-denominated systemic stablecoins, addressing backing rules and holding limits. The BOE’s new framework is built on feedback received on the November 2023 Discussion Paper, reflecting the Bank’s efforts to draft “robust, future-proof” rules that are aligned with the regulator’s strategy to modernize UK retail payments. Notably, the Bank has moved forward with a controversial proposal to cap stablecoin ownership to “mitigate financial stability risks stemming from large and rapid outflows of deposits from the banking sector.” As reported by Bitcoinist, the central bank has been exploring restrictions on stablecoin ownership in the country for months, seeking to impose limits of £10,000 to £20,000 for individuals and £10 million for businesses. The plan resembles its proposed approach to the digital pound, also aimed at addressing financial stability risks. Some crypto industry and payment groups heavily criticized the central bank’s proposal, arguing that it would put the UK at a disadvantage against the US and the European Union (EU). Following the backlash, news media outlets reported that the BOE was exploring granting exemptions to businesses that need to hold large amounts of stablecoins, like crypto exchanges. The consultation paper confirmed the holding limits proposal “to safeguard continued access to credit as the financial system gradually adapts to new forms of digital money.” However, it clarified that the limits would be “temporary” and would be removed “once the transition no longer poses risks to the provision of finance to the real economy.” It also noted that an exemption regime will allow the largest businesses to hold more stablecoins if required. New Regime Eyes Joint Regulatory Approach As the announcement explained, the regime will only apply sterling-pegged stablecoins. Meanwhile, stablecoins used for non-systemic purposes, such as the buying and selling of crypto assets, will be supervised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The BOE unveiled a joint regulatory approach with the FCA, with a document clarifying how rules will apply in practice set to be published in 2026. “If recognised as systemic by HM Treasury (HMT), they will transition into the Bank’s regime and will be jointly regulated, with the Bank overseeing prudential and financial stability risks, and the FCA continuing to supervise conduct and consumer protection,” the Bank detailed. Among the key policy proposals covered in the consultation paper, the Bank suggested that systemic stablecoin issuers be allowed to hold up to 60% of backing assets in short-term UK government debt. The BOE will provide issuers with unremunerated accounts at the Bank for the remaining 40%, aiming to ensure “robust redemption and public confidence, even under stress.” Additionally, issuers considered systemic at launch or transitioning from the FCA regime will initially be able to hold up to 95% of their backing assets in short-term UK government debt to support viability as they grow. A new policy also proposes central bank liquidity arrangements to issuers in times of stress, reinforcing financial stability by “providing a backstop should systemic issuers be unable to monetise their backing assets in private markets.” Sarah Breeden, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, affirmed that the BOE’s objective “remains to support innovation and build trust in this emerging form of money.” “We’ve listened carefully to feedback and amended our proposals for achieving this, including on how stablecoin issuers interact with the Bank of England. These proposals are fit for a future where stablecoins play a meaningful role in payments, giving the industry the clarity it needs to plan with confidence,” she concluded.",Crypto News|Bank of England (BOE)|Bank of England deputy governor|bitcoin|BOE Stablecoin|btc|BTCUSDT|FCA|Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)|Stablecoin framework|Stablecoin regulation|systemic stablecoins|UK regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-11 06:00:13

XRP Realized Profit Is Up 240% Since Late September In a post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Realized Profit of XRP. The “Realized Profit” here refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of profit investors as a whole are “realizing” through their transactions every day. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each token being transacted on the chain to see what price it was last moved at. If the previous selling price for any coin was less than the current spot price, then that coin’s sale is leading to the realization of some net profit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Craze: OI Looks Set To Keep Printing ATHs, Glassnode Says The exact degree of the profit involved in the transfer is naturally equal to the difference between the two prices. The Realized Profit sums up this value for sales across the blockchain on any given day. A counterpart indicator called the Realized Loss takes care of the transactions of the opposite type. That is, the sales involving a cost basis higher than the latest selling price. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the 14-day moving average (MA) of the XRP Realized Profit over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Realized Profit has been following an uptrend since late September, indicating investors have been ramping up their profit taking. During this period, daily profit realization volume has gone up from $65 million to $220 million, an increase of a whopping 240%. This growth in the metric has come as the asset’s price has plummeted from $3.09. In the chart, the analytics firm has also highlighted the other profit-taking sprees that the cryptocurrency has faced in the current cycle so far. Interestingly, all the other selloffs coincided with rallies in the price. The recent XRP trend has naturally been different, coming alongside a drawdown instead. “This divergence underscores distribution into weakness, not strength,” noted Glassnode. While the Realized Profit is sitting at a significant level, XRP has still managed to turn itself around during the past day, implying a sudden influx of demand has come in that has outweighed the selling. The recovery surge arrives as spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) related to the coin are potentially nearing approval. Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an underlying asset without having to directly own it.

In a conversation shared by crypto enthusiast BankXRP, Garlinghouse addressed Ripple’s recent acquisitions, the growing importance of its stablecoin RLUSD, and the company’s engagement with pro-innovation policies under President Donald Trump. Garlinghouse explained that the stablecoin sector is expanding faster than many projections suggest. While major institutions like JPMorgan forecast a $750 billion market, Garlinghouse believes the figure could reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion, driven by cross-border payments and institutional use cases. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse sits down with CNBC’s Liz Napolitano at #Swell2025 They dive into Ripple’s 6 major acquisitions and the blockbuster $2B private share buyback marking one of the company’s boldest moves yet pic.twitter.com/tNmamejr9R — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) November 6, 2025 Ripple’s RLUSD, launched less than a year ago , has already surpassed a $1 billion market capitalization. He noted that the company’s focus remains on institutional integration, emphasizing that RLUSD complements existing payment corridors where stablecoins can enhance efficiency alongside XRP. The Ripple CEO added that RLUSD’s distribution strategy is largely centered on institutional collateral through Ripple Prime , allowing clients to use the token as regulated collateral within prime brokerage operations. This, he said, positions RLUSD as distinct from many retail-focused stablecoins in the market. Engagement With Pro-Crypto Policy Under President Trump Garlinghouse also reflected on Ripple’s political involvement and the changing stance of U.S. regulators. He criticized the previous administration’s approach to digital assets, describing it as unnecessarily hostile. Ripple, he explained, backed the FairShake SuperPAC to support candidates from both political parties who favor clear regulatory frameworks and innovation. Under President Trump, Garlinghouse acknowledged that the policy environment has become more open to digital assets, citing the passage of the Genius Act, which provides guidelines for stablecoin issuance. He expressed optimism that ongoing discussions around the Clarity Act would help define what constitutes a digital asset, a security, or a commodity—an issue that has long affected the broader crypto industry. U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve and Market Transformation When asked about discussions around the proposed U.S. “strategic crypto reserve,” Garlinghouse stated that while he had not heard any recent updates, he supports recognizing cryptocurrencies as modern stores of value. He noted that, just as the nation maintains a gold reserve, holding digital assets such as Bitcoin could strengthen the country’s financial position in an increasingly digital economy. Garlinghouse underscored that the United States, which accounts for 22% of global GDP, is now “leaning in” on crypto under Trump’s leadership, a shift he believes the market has not yet fully appreciated. Ripple’s multi-billion-dollar acquisitions—including G-Treasury and Hidden Road —reflect its strategy to merge traditional financial infrastructure with crypto-enabled solutions, particularly for corporate treasury management. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Financial Strength and IPO Outlook Addressing questions about a potential initial public offering, Garlinghouse said Ripple would now prioritize a U.S. listing, citing the nation’s deep and efficient capital markets. However, he clarified that an IPO is not a near-term objective, as the company remains focused on expansion and maintaining a robust balance sheet. Ripple has executed over $2 billion in private share buybacks this year, providing liquidity to early investors while sustaining its capacity for large-scale acquisitions. Garlinghouse concluded that Ripple’s position in the evolving digital asset landscape is stronger than ever, combining institutional utility, regulatory engagement, and financial resilience.

Key Takeaways: Brazil’s central bank will require all crypto service providers to obtain authorization by November 2026. The new framework classifies stablecoin transactions and cross-border crypto transfers as foreign exchange operations. The rules aim to make Brazil’s $319 billion crypto market more secure and transparent. The move marks one of the most significant steps yet in Brazil’s push to integrate virtual assets into its financial system while curbing illicit activity. Brazil to Require Crypto Firms to Obtain Central Bank Approval by November 2026 The rules, announced Monday , will take effect in February 2026 and will require virtual asset service providers (VASPs), including intermediaries, custodians, and brokers, to obtain authorization from the central bank before operating. The framework mandates strict compliance measures on governance, transparency, internal controls, cybersecurity, and risk management, bringing crypto firms under the same supervisory standards as traditional financial institutions. Companies will have until November 2026 to meet the requirements or cease operations. Under the new regulations, any purchase, sale, or exchange of fiat-pegged stablecoins will be treated as a foreign exchange transaction, as will the use of crypto for international transfers or settlements. If such transactions involve unauthorized counterparties, they will be capped at $100,000, the bank said. Banco Central regulamenta o uso de ativos virtuais e o funcionamento e a autorização das instituições que atuam nesse mercado https://t.co/USHJNe602H — Banco Central BR (@BancoCentralBR) November 10, 2025 The rules are part of Brazil’s broader effort to tighten oversight following a surge in stablecoin usage, which authorities say is increasingly being used for payments and cross-border transfers rather than investment. “New rules will reduce the scope for scams, fraud, and the use of virtual asset markets for money laundering,” said Gilneu Vivan, the bank’s director of regulation, at a press briefing. The framework builds on Brazil’s 2022 crypto law, which established a legal basis for virtual assets but required additional central bank regulations to take effect. With the new measures, Brazil aims to cement its status as Latin America’s regulatory leader in digital finance. According to Chainalysis, Brazil is now the fifth-largest crypto market globally, handling nearly $319 billion in crypto transactions between mid-2024 and mid-2025, roughly a third of all Latin American activity. The central bank expects the updated rules to make the country’s fast-growing digital economy more secure, transparent, and aligned with international financial standards. Brazil Debates $19B Bitcoin Reserve Plan to Hedge Against Dollar As reported, Brazil’s Congress is debating the creation of a $19 billion Bitcoin strategic reserve, dubbed RESBit, aimed at diversifying the country’s financial holdings and reducing reliance on the US dollar. The proposal, part of Bill 4501/24, was discussed during a public hearing on August 20 led by the Economic Development Commission in Brasília. Lawmakers, economists, and crypto experts argued that Bitcoin could serve as a digital commodity similar to gold, providing a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risks. If approved, Brazil would become one of the first major economies to formally hold Bitcoin as part of its national reserves, joining efforts already underway in El Salvador, the US, and parts of Asia. The initiative would place the Central Bank of Brazil and the Finance Ministry in charge of custody and oversight, requiring biannual reports on performance and risk exposure to ensure transparency. However, the plan faces significant hurdles. It must pass through four congressional committees, including Economic Development, Science and Technology, Finance, and Justice, before reaching the Senate.

Here’s how much the company has expanded its holdings with this buy. Strategy Has Added Another 487 BTC To Its Treasury In a new post on X, Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor has revealed the latest routine Monday purchase for the company’s Bitcoin treasury. With this buy, the firm has added another 487 BTC to its treasury, taking its total holdings to 641,692 BTC. The purchase involved an average token price of $102,557 and cost Strategy a total of $49.9 million. The company’s recent acquisitions have been relatively modest, and it seems this new one is no different. Strategy funded the buy, which occurred between November 3rd and 9th, using sales of its STRF, STRK, STRD, and STRC at-the-market (ATM) stock offerings, according to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has identified an interesting pattern when it comes to Strategy purchases: the firm tends to buy around weekly highs in the Bitcoin price. But as the new chart shared by Maartunn in an X post shows, the latest acquisition hasn’t fit the pattern. As displayed in the above graph, this Strategy purchase has come near a local bottom in the cryptocurrency’s price instead. Thus, these tokens haven’t immediately gone underwater like some of those purchased earlier. The company’s total investment into its Bitcoin stack has increased to $47.54 billion following the latest purchase, putting the average buying price of all tokens at $74,079. This means that as long as BTC’s spot price trades above this level, Saylor’s firm wouldn’t go underwater. At the current exchange rate, Strategy’s treasury is valued at almost $67.7 billion, so the company is in a profit of more than 42%. A significant figure, despite the bearish action BTC has faced recently. While Strategy has continued its Bitcoin buying spree, outflows have occurred elsewhere in the sector: the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . As the below data from SoSoValue shows, the last week saw a negative netflow from these funds. From the chart, it’s apparent that Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a red netflow of $1.22 billion in the last week, continuing the trend of outflows from the previous week, which saw almost $800 million exiting from these investment vehicles. The BTC price has started the new week with a recovery surge, however, so it only remains to be seen how the netflow will develop in the coming days. BTC Price Bitcoin broke above $106,000 during its rally earlier on Monday, but the asset has since seen a small pullback as its price is now back at $105,800.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Buy|Bitcoin Strategy|btc|BTCUSDT|Strategy,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-11 07:00:03

Analyst Reveals What Could Be The Spark,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-to-10-analyst-reveals-what-could-spark/,"An analyst has explained a dream scenario for XRP based on a Bull Flag that the cryptocurrency has potentially been following on the monthly chart. XRP Could Be Trading Inside A Bull Flag Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about how XRP has been forming a Bull Flag recently. The “Bull Flag” is a type of Flag from technical analysis (TA). Related Reading: XRP Jumps To $2.56 Despite 240% Increase In Profit Taking A Flag pattern looks like, as its name suggests, a flag on a pole. A consolidation channel with two parallel trendlines forms the “flag” portion, while an initial sharp move represents the “pole.” In a Bull Flag, the pole is charted by a move in the up direction. Generally, Flags are considered to be continuation patterns, meaning that a breakout tends to happen in the same direction as the preceding trend. In a Bull Flag, as the pole corresponds to a rally, the breakout move is also in the bullish direction. Like the Bull Flag, there is also a pattern in TA called the Bear Flag, appearing when the pole is made up by a sharp downward move. Naturally, the breakout is considered more probable in the down direction in this case. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Bull Flag that the 1-month price of XRP has possibly been traveling inside for the past year: As displayed in the above graph, XRP is currently trading inside the consolidation channel of the Bull Flag. Martinez has noted that a dream scenario for the cryptocurrency could now be to retest the $1.90 level, then observe a rally that ends in a bullish breakout. The $1.90 mark is where the lower level of the flag channel is located. This level usually acts as a support barrier, helping keep the price above it. A rebound at this level could be the spark to a run to $10, according to the analyst. This target is based on the fact that a Bull Flag breakout is considered to be of the same height as the pole. It now remains to be seen whether XRP will find a break beyond this flag, and if it will follow a path anything like that charted out by the pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Craze: OI Looks Set To Keep Printing ATHs, Glassnode Says The 1-month price isn’t the only timeframe on which XRP is trading inside a parallel channel right now. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, the 3-day price is also stuck in a similar consolidation pattern. “If this bull run keeps going, XRP could offer a solid buying opportunity at $1.90 before rallying to $6,” said the analyst, based on this pattern. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.53, up 10% over the last 24 hours.

The price faces a short-term technical risk, forming a “double top” near $744 that must hold the $500 support level. The macro bull case, supported by Arthur Hayes, is targeting a $1,500 price, fueled by a recent $1B Open Interest peak. Zcash (ZEC) price signals a parabolic rally ahead with Binance exchange market data showing large-scale buy orders for ZEC earlier since Tuesday. More than $30 million was used to purchase ZEC coins from Binance. The buyers used approximately $1.2 million per transaction to acquire lots of 2,200 ZEC coins each.

Recent analysis suggests this ambitious Bitcoin price prediction might become reality if a crucial market metric maintains its current strength. The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with renewed optimism as technical indicators point toward potential massive gains. What Makes This Bitcoin Price Prediction So Compelling? CryptoQuant analyst AxelAdlerJr has identified a critical pattern that could signal Bitcoin’s next major move. The Market Value to Realized Value ratio for short-term holders has climbed to 0.95, indicating growing investor confidence. This specific metric often serves as a reliable predictor of market direction. Understanding the MVRV Ratio: Your Key to Market Timing The MVRV ratio compares Bitcoin’s market value against its realized value. When this ratio rises above certain thresholds, it typically suggests that investors are sitting on unrealized profits. Currently, the 0.95 level indicates that short-term holders are approaching break-even points, which often precedes significant price movements. Here’s why this matters for your Bitcoin price prediction strategy: The ratio has climbed from recent lows Historical patterns show similar movements before major rallies Maintaining above 0.92 could trigger sustained upward momentum How Realistic Is the $115K-$120K Bitcoin Price Prediction? While the numbers might seem astonishing, they align with several technical and fundamental factors. The cryptocurrency market has shown remarkable resilience during recent corrections, and institutional adoption continues to grow. However, investors should remain cautious and consider multiple factors before making decisions. Key considerations for this Bitcoin price prediction include: Market sentiment shifts Regulatory developments Global economic conditions Adoption rates across platforms What Should Investors Watch For? Monitoring the MVRV ratio provides valuable insights, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Successful cryptocurrency investing requires watching multiple indicators and understanding market psychology. The current Bitcoin price prediction depends heavily on whether the ratio can maintain its position above the critical 0.92 level. Remember these essential points: No single indicator guarantees market movements Diversification remains crucial Risk management should guide all investment decisions Navigating Market Volatility With Confidence Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, and even the most promising Bitcoin price prediction carries uncertainty. The potential movement toward $115,000 represents an exciting possibility, but investors should approach with balanced expectations and thorough research. This Bitcoin price prediction highlights the importance of: Staying informed about market developments Understanding technical indicators Maintaining realistic expectations Frequently Asked Questions What is the MVRV ratio? The MVRV ratio compares Bitcoin’s market capitalization against its realized capitalization. It helps identify whether assets are overvalued or undervalued relative to their purchase prices. How reliable is this Bitcoin price prediction? While based on solid technical analysis, all cryptocurrency predictions involve uncertainty. The MVRV ratio has historically been a reliable indicator, but market conditions can change rapidly. What time frame does this prediction cover? The analysis doesn’t specify an exact time frame, but similar patterns have typically played out over several weeks to months in past market cycles. Should I invest based on this prediction? Never make investment decisions based solely on one analysis. Consider multiple factors, assess your risk tolerance, and consult financial advisors if needed. What happens if the MVRV ratio drops below 0.92? The analyst suggests this would weaken the bullish case and potentially signal continued market consolidation or correction. Are there other indicators supporting this prediction? Yes, several other technical and on-chain metrics currently show positive signals, though the MVRV ratio remains the primary focus of this specific analysis.

By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $8,519.96 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. In September 2020, Binance introduced BNB Smart Chain, which was initially designed for trading and transferring tokens and runs parallel to Binance Chain and What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond?

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s price also decreased to $982.5. If traders continue selling, the BNB price might see a further decrease and reach $959. On the other hand, a success in attracting buying demand might result in a recovery. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate resistance at $998. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $8,519.96 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance, and the price moved toward $982.5, as bears target $959. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 2.3 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-11 07:11:56

The bankruptcy estate of the now-defunct crypto exchange, which collapsed in November 2022, has taken almost three years to reach this stage. Next Distribution Lined Up for January According to his latest update on X, FTX distributed $454 million on February 18 to claims under $50,000, followed by a much larger $5 billion payout on May 30 that covered both sub-$50,000 and larger claims. A third tranche of $1.6 billion was paid out on September 30, again across both claim categories. Kavuri estimated that the total FTX assets at around $16-17 billion, and said the next distribution round is currently expected in January 2026, pending a record date confirmation in December. The latest development emerged just days after the FTX Recovery Trust withdrew its request to restrict payouts to creditors in nearly 50 foreign jurisdictions, including China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Ukraine, following intense backlash from affected creditors. The motion was originally filed in July and aimed to pause distributions in countries with unclear or restrictive crypto rules. But even as funds are steadily being returned, the political, legal, and reputational battle around this case has not faded, as the convicted founder of the exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried, continues trying to influence the narrative from federal prison. SBF Pops Up, Again Earlier this month, Bankman-Fried re-entered the bankruptcy conversation to again question the motives of the bankruptcy estate and to imply that the collapse of FTX was not due to fraud, misappropriation, or reckless leverage, but something closer to sabotage or bureaucratic obstruction. Even this week, SBF replied to a satirical post accusing current CEO John J. Ray III of intentionally keeping a “perfectly solvent” platform in bankruptcy just to generate record professional fees and destroy estate value, a claim he partly endorsed by saying “this is basically what happened,” even though forensic accountants, prosecutors, and bankruptcy experts have repeatedly said this narrative is false and misleading. His comments instantly triggered a backlash. On-chain investigator ZachXBT directly asked him to explain the alleged $40 million payment to Chinese authorities that he claims SBF hid from the public and prosecutors. At the same time, venture capitalist Adam Cochran stated that this continued attempt to recast the collapse shows SBF remains unrepentant and unwilling to accept responsibility for the damage done to millions of users. That controversy followed an episode when Bankman-Fried’s long-dormant X account posted a 14-page document claiming FTX “was never insolvent” and could have been sitting on a $136 billion portfolio today if lawyers had not intervened. Legal experts and former creditors quickly pointed out that the claim was almost identical to arguments already rejected in court throughout 2023 and 2024, and that forensic audits traced billions in missing customer funds.

Bitcoin is trading near $105,300, slipping just under 1% in 24 hours but still holding above important support levels. Ethereum follows the same trend, priced at around $3,560, also down slightly. Despite the pullback, trading volume remains strong. Among altcoins, XRP stands out, rising more than 6% this week to $2.49.

According to fresh analysis, the world’s leading cryptocurrency faces a potentially sharp decline if this critical threshold fails. This Bitcoin price prediction comes from 10x Research CEO Markus Thielen, who warns that breaking below $100,000 could trigger a rapid descent toward $93,000. Why This Bitcoin Price Prediction Matters Now Thielen’s analysis reveals staggering numbers behind the current market situation. Approximately 5.9 million BTC, valued at $588 billion, have changed hands in the $100,000 to $126,000 range recently. This massive trading volume creates what analysts call a ‘liquidity zone’ – an area where many investors entered positions. The concern stems from who holds this supply. Thielen identifies two key groups: Retail investors with weak conviction Institutional investors facing internal pressure These holders might sell quickly if prices drop below their entry points, creating a domino effect. What Happens if $100K Support Fails? This Bitcoin price prediction highlights a dangerous scenario. If Bitcoin breaks below the $100,000 support line, selling pressure could intensify dramatically. Thielen describes this as falling into a ‘liquidity void’ or ‘air pocket’ around $93,000. Think of it like this: when many stop-loss orders cluster around a price level, breaking through that level triggers automatic selling. This creates a vacuum where prices can drop rapidly with little buying support. The $90,000 Volatility Trigger Point This Bitcoin price prediction becomes even more concerning below $93,000. Thielen notes that volatility would likely spike sharply around the $90,000 mark. Why is this level so significant? $90,000 represents the average purchase price for spot Bitcoin ETFs. This means institutional investors who bought through ETFs would see their positions turn negative, potentially triggering more selling from risk-averse funds. How Should Investors Approach This Bitcoin Price Prediction? While this analysis sounds alarming, remember that price predictions are probabilistic, not certain. However, understanding key support levels helps investors make informed decisions. Consider these approaches: Monitor the $100,000 level closely Have a risk management plan ready Diversify your cryptocurrency holdings Avoid panic selling based on single analyses Frequently Asked Questions What is the main risk to Bitcoin’s price according to this analysis? The primary risk is breaking below the $100,000 support level, which could trigger accelerated selling pressure and a rapid drop to $93,000. Who is Markus Thielen and why should I trust his analysis? Markus Thielen is the CEO of 10x Research, a respected market analysis firm. His research is based on trading volume data and market structure analysis. What happens if Bitcoin stays above $100,000? If Bitcoin maintains support at $100,000, it could consolidate and potentially build strength for another upward move, invalidating the bearish prediction. How reliable are cryptocurrency price predictions? While based on data and analysis, all price predictions carry uncertainty. They should inform your strategy rather than dictate it entirely. What is a liquidity void or air pocket in trading? It’s a price zone with minimal buy orders, meaning prices can drop rapidly when sell orders overwhelm the limited buying interest. Should I sell my Bitcoin based on this prediction? Investment decisions should consider your risk tolerance, time horizon, and overall portfolio strategy rather than single predictions.

The shared analysis says XRP’s next major move may depend on how the asset behaves around the $2 region, a level the chart suggests could act as a foundation for further expansion if maintained on higher timeframes. $XRP : Defend $2 for the run to $10+ https://t.co/c3x22RVVlM pic.twitter.com/ltfiLyOL3R — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 9, 2025 Analysis of the Shared Chart The chart presented shows XRP price activity extending back nearly a decade, with specific emphasis on several recurring support zones. The $0.50 region appears as a mid-range structure that has been tested multiple times in prior cycles, while the $0.175 level marks a historical macro floor. Below that sits $0.005, representing an early accumulation phase. The recent market structure places XRP above these historical levels, with current price action moving within proximity of the projected $2 threshold. Green markers on the chart highlight past periods of accumulation that preceded upward momentum, suggesting repeated instances in which long-term holders strengthened positions before subsequent recoveries. The chart positions the $2 level as the next meaningful area of defense, implying that the monthly closing strength around this zone could determine whether XRP enters another extended bullish phase. Comments Highlight Outlook for a Potential Upside Run Alongside the chart, ChartNerd referenced commentary from another market researcher who proposed that XRP could consolidate or defend the $2 level on the monthly timeframe until conditions align for a move toward $10 or higher. According to that viewpoint, the timing of such a move remains uncertain. The researcher stated that this transition could occur soon or several months from now, but expressed minimal expectation that the asset would remain below $2 for an extended period if bullish conditions take hold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community reaction included differing opinions. One user, identified as Jay, responded dismissively to the idea, stating “lol. No chance,” indicating skepticism regarding both the sustainability of the $2 level and the likelihood of a move toward double-digit pricing in the near term. The focus on the $2 level reflects broader sentiment that market structure rather than short-term volatility may define XRP’s next major directional move . Whether the asset experiences a sustained consolidation phase or tests lower levels before attempting higher targets will depend on market participation, liquidity conditions, and broader economic influences. For now, ChartNerd’s analysis underscores the importance of monitoring monthly closes and structural strength at this key price area, as market participants watch for confirmation of either renewed momentum or extended hesitation.

With the world, and especially the cryptocurrency industry, continuing to focus on large tokens such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, investors are now exploring the DeFi sector and identifying cheaper cryptos with tangible potential. One of the new projects that draw a lot of attention is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently one of the most discussed tokens of 2025. Early investors think that it might be the most promising crypto to invest in by 2026 through its fast presale pace and its ambitious development plan. Presale Growth of Mutuum finance The presale of Mutuum Finance has drawn the attention of many people within the DeFi crypto community. In its Phase 6 current token is at a value of $ 0.035 and has increased 250% over its original Phase 1 price of $ 0.01 earlier this year. The project has so far raised more than $18.6 million, it has more than 17,900 holders on board and its tokens have sold to the tune of about 800 million tokens. Phase 6 is already allocated more than 85% and the interest is ever-growing as investors look forward to the next V1 launch in Q4 2025. Having great strength and developing visibility, MUTM is turning into one of the most successful cryptos to purchase in the present time before the next market cycle has fully reached maturity. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Building? Mutuum Finance is an emerging project of the decentralized lending and borrowing DeFi in the cryptocurrency market that aims to provide transparency, efficiency and sustainability. The system is designed to allow one to lend assets to receive an interest or borrow against the assets, which automates transactions via smart contracts, which require no middlemen. Mutuum Finance has a central system of the mtToken model. When users put their assets, they get a minted token, which is a receipt yielding token that appreciates in value as the borrowers utilize the liquidity. The model also has the ability to enable lenders to earn passive income directly through protocol activity, which makes the system fair and fully based on the on-chain. A buy-and-distribute model is the distribution of a part of protocol fees to purchase the MUTM tokens on the open market. Such tokens are again reshared among the users who would stake mtTokens in the safety module of the platform. This brings in steady need of MUTM and long term participants are rewarded. Security is the core concern of the staff. The project passed a CertiK audit with a score of 90/100, and also runs a bug bounty program of $50,000 to find possible threats ahead of the debut of the mainnet of the platform. This emphasis on transparency and safety makes it different compared to most new crypto projects that do not focus on technical validation. Price Outlook, Stablecoin and Oracles The roadmap of Mutuum Finance goes beyond lending markets. The team is coming up with USD-pegged stablecoin, it would be minted and burned on request. The interest gained in the system will be redirected to the treasury of the platform, which will contribute to the stability over the long term and the development of the ecosystem. The protocol also plans to incorporate strong price oracles, which is a combination of feeds provided by Chainlink and others to provide correct collateral values and secure liquidations. They are necessary to keep the operations fair in all lending markets, minimizing risks in regards to market volatility or delays in data. According to some commentators, realistic utility, visibility in revenues and a broadening use case in DeFi could give MUTM a much higher valuation than the valuation that it is gaining in presale. In a bullish market context, it would be projected at the 5x-10x upside which coincides with the milestones of the Mutuum roadmap and future listing. V1 Takeoff, Whale Traffic Energy Buy The second significant milestone of Mutuum Finance is the launch of V1 Testnet on Sepolia on Q4 2025. The launch will come with a range of fundamental capabilities, such as Liquidity Pools and mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and a Liquidator Bot, which will be involved in providing the efficient mechanism of borrowing, lending and liquidation. Whale inflows have also turned out to be a recurring theme in the recent weeks as the process of development went on. On-chain analytics indicate that big investors have been hoarding MUTM in the expectation that there would be subsequent presale leaps. It is an extra confidence boost to an already very vibrant DeFi presale of the year 2025. The 24-hour leaderboard by Mutuum Finance has also increased interaction. At the end of every day, the highest contributor will be rewarded with $500 worth of MUTM tokens to keep engaging in the program and promoting openness throughout the community. Why It Matters The difference between Mutuum Finance and its competitors is its ability to balance between early-stage growth and long-term fundamentals. The technical architecture of the platform solves one of the largest problems of DeFi: the generation of sustainable yields without an overabundance of risks and influx forces. Having already sold almost all the presale, audited smart contracts, and V1 testnet right around the corner, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already synthesizing a top crypto investment to make in 2025. With the greater market set to initiate into the next bull, most of the new investors anticipate the project to provide an opportunity to combine accessibility with innovation and long-term as a rare feature in the current crypto market.

The amount is 25% higher than E&P spending in the last six months. Bloomberg reported that the amount was enough to make PetroChina the biggest investor in exploration and production globally. The largest producer of offshore crude oil and natural gas in China, CNOOC, announced last month that its pipeline network had expanded to 10,000 kilometers. China boosts local oil production All of this is becoming a huge headache for the world’s largest oil & gas producers From Exxon to Shell, Big Oil has grown used to having China as the engine for global fossil-fuel demand. Indeed, for much of the last decade, it accounted for 60% of global oil demand growth pic.twitter.com/mWTRZNMqOz — Stephen Stapczynski (@SStapczynski) November 5, 2025 The Chinese oil heavyweight also said that the network would soon expand to 13,000 km. The initiative comes as CNOOC announced a fresh offshore discovery in the South China Sea. The firm, along with all Chinese oil companies, has been ramping up domestic oil and gas supply. Chinese state oil giants CNOOC, Sinopec, and PetroChina recently discontinued purchases of Russian oil as the heightened sanctions situation on the mainland becomes clearer. The initiative came as the U.S. made a new attempt to squeeze Russian oil revenues by imposing sanctions directly on two of the country’s largest oil exporters. The report revealed that exporters to Beijing were turning back, and others were being canceled. Beijing reported a drop in oil imports in October, from 11.5 million barrels per day in September to 11.4 million barrels per day in the following month. However, Beijing experienced a surge in oil imports from the previous year. Beijing has increased its crude oil import rates despite the commodity’s demand remaining weaker than in previous years for much of the year. Stock-building has been the main driver behind China’s higher import rates. China has been building its crude oil inventories at a rate of nearly 1 million barrels per day, which are currently estimated to be between 1.2 billion and 1.3 billion barrels. The country is also building new storage capacity, indicating that it will likely continue to expand its oil reserves in the future. Beijing’s new storage capacity, planned at 169 million barrels in total, is scheduled to be built over the next two years. The country is simultaneously expanding domestic production of both crude oil and natural gas, while boosting import supply to mitigate potential disruptions. “In the last few years, we have seen an energy crunch all around the world. Gas and LNG are like tap water and bottled water. Tap water is cheaper and is more reliable, and the logistics are easier. So we push for domestic production.” – Huang Yingchao , Vice President of Natural Gas at PetroChina International. According to Bloomberg’s report on China’s energy supply strategy, the initiative won’t be favorable for Big Oil. Beijing has driven global demand growth and profits in the energy sector for several decades. China’s recent trends in demand growth have had a significant impact on prices, as market perceptions shift, which has also affected Big Oil’s net profits. The country has maintained 60% of global oil demand growth over the past decade; however, the demand is dropping due to China’s surge in domestic supply. China ramps up its gas exports and imports China has also been ramping up its gas output and imports from parties other than Big Oil. The country partnered with Russia two months ago to construct the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline. According to the announcement, the initiative would result in an annual export capacity of over 100 billion cubic meters. Beijing has also been building up its energy self-sufficiency, which includes wind and solar. The country built out the largest wind and solar capacity in the world, reducing demand for other energy resources. Michael Meidan, director of China research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, argued that Chinese oil majors have surprised themselves by exceeding production targets. He also believes that China is gaining a sense of control, especially as oil demand is declining. Get seen where it counts.

Key Takeaways: Ethereum whales holding 10,000–100,000 ETH have accumulated 7.6 million ETH since April, signaling renewed confidence. Spot trading volume spikes since early November suggest a potential compression phase ahead of an Ethereum upswing. Improving macro sentiment and a possible US government shutdown resolution have lifted risk appetite. According to CryptoQuant, wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH, often referred to as whales, have added 7.6 million ETH since late April, a 52% rise in total holdings. In contrast, smaller wallets with 100 to 1,000 ETH have cut their balances by 16%, suggesting retail investors remain cautious. Ethereum’s Repeated Spot Volume Spikes Signal Possible Major Upswing: Analyst CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets noted that surges in spot trading volume have occurred several times since Ethereum’s early-November dip, a behavior typically seen in “late-stage compression phases before major upswings.” The shift comes amid improving macroeconomic sentiment, with optimism growing that the US government shutdown could soon end, a development that has lifted risk appetite across digital assets. Analysts believe whale accumulation at current levels could mark the early stages of an Ethereum recovery if broader market conditions continue to stabilize. New Whales Are Feeling the Heat Since Oct 28, Bitcoin has traded below the average cost basis of new whales (~$110.8K), triggering significant realized losses: Nov 4: -$286.4M Nov 5: -$90.7M Nov 6: -$107.5M Nov 7: -$515.1M Nov 8: -$5.1M The lower Bitcoin prices are building… pic.twitter.com/1pnlY9aBM2 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 10, 2025 Optimism over a potential US government shutdown resolution boosted risk sentiment across global markets, with Bitcoin rebounding to $106,000 after several dips below $100,000, according to a new report by QCP Capital . The firm noted that despite ongoing spot ETF outflows and selling from long-term holders (“OGs”), crypto joined equities in a broad relief rally. Risk reversals also showed fading demand for downside protection, signaling reduced fear of another major liquidation. The report compared the current wave of OG selling to past events like Silk Road and Mt. Gox distributions, noting that deeper market liquidity has allowed these supply shocks to be absorbed without breaking structural momentum. The firm said Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) remain a key sentiment driver but have shown limited activity amid tight trading ranges. While Bitcoin’s strong rejection of the $100K level offers some technical support, QCP expects continued range-bound trading in the medium term. Any push above $118K could meet renewed selling from OG wallets unless macro tailwinds and ETF inflows strengthen meaningfully. Institutional Investors Pull $1.17B From Crypto Funds As reported, institutional outflows from crypto investment products accelerated last week , reaching $1.17 billion, the second consecutive week of heavy withdrawals amid renewed market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. Data shows trading volumes in ETPs remained high at $43 billion, but optimism from midweek progress on resolving the U.S. government shutdown quickly faded, sparking further redemptions by Friday. The US market drove most of the outflows, totaling $1.22 billion, while Germany and Switzerland saw modest inflows of $41.3 million and $49.7 million, respectively. Bitcoin funds led the losses with $932 million in outflows, followed by Ethereum at $438 million, though short Bitcoin ETPs logged $11.8 million in inflows, their strongest week since May 2025.

Technical analysis suggests Avalanche is bearish. The charts show it turned red over the last 24 hours as an attempted recovery failed to break resistance at $18. The shorter timeframes show that its positive momentum is dropping. Recent news 700,000 AVAX ($12.59M) will be unlocked on November 13 as part of the scheduled vesting. While this represents only 0.33% of the circulating supply, it aligns with a broader $476M token unlock wave this week. Historical data show such events often precede short-term volatility, as recipients may take profits Why is AVAX down? AVAX’s dip reflects a trifecta of profit-taking, token supply inflation, and technical weakness. However, its +8.83% weekly gain still outpaces Bitcoin (+0.13%), hinting at underlying strength in its subnet adoption narrative. Will AVAX reach $50?

A groundbreaking survey reveals that despite recent market turbulence, the majority of major financial institutions are planning to significantly increase their crypto allocation. This surprising trend signals a major shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. Why Are Institutions Increasing Their Crypto Allocation? A comprehensive survey by Swiss crypto bank Sygnum surveyed 1,000 global institutions and found that 61% plan to boost their cryptocurrency investment allocation. This decision comes despite the sharp market correction experienced in October, showing remarkable confidence in the long-term potential of digital assets. The primary motivation behind this growing crypto allocation is clear: 73% of respondents cited the expectation of higher future returns as their main driver. This demonstrates that institutions see cryptocurrency as a valuable addition to their investment portfolios rather than just a speculative asset. What Types of Crypto Investments Interest Institutions? Institutional interest extends far beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. The survey revealed some fascinating insights about where these investors want to place their capital: Over 80% expressed interest in various crypto ETFs beyond just the two largest cryptocurrencies 70% indicated they would expand their investments if staking rewards were permitted Most institutions are looking for regulated, secure ways to access the crypto market This diversified approach to crypto allocation shows that institutions are thinking strategically about how to build balanced digital asset portfolios. When Will We See More Crypto ETF Approvals? According to Lucas Schweiger, Head of Crypto Asset Ecosystem Research at Sygnum, the regulatory landscape is about to change dramatically. He explains that the SEC could approve a wave of altcoin ETFs once the U.S. government shutdown concludes. This regulatory shift would likely trigger significant institutional capital inflow into the crypto space. The approval of additional ETFs would provide the regulated framework that many institutions require before committing substantial capital to their crypto allocation strategy. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The growing institutional crypto allocation represents a fundamental shift in market dynamics. As more traditional financial players enter the space, we can expect: Increased market stability and reduced volatility Greater regulatory clarity and oversight More sophisticated investment products and services Enhanced credibility for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem This institutional validation could accelerate mainstream adoption and potentially lead to more sustainable market growth. What Challenges Remain for Institutional Crypto Adoption? Despite the optimistic survey results, institutions still face several hurdles when considering their crypto allocation. Regulatory uncertainty remains the primary concern, along with custody solutions, market volatility, and the need for clearer accounting standards. However, the survey results suggest that these challenges are becoming less significant as the infrastructure around digital assets continues to mature. The growing interest in crypto ETFs indicates that institutions are finding ways to navigate these obstacles. Conclusion: The Future of Institutional Crypto Allocation The message from institutional investors is clear: cryptocurrency is becoming an essential component of modern investment portfolios. The planned increase in crypto allocation by 61% of surveyed institutions represents a watershed moment for digital assets. As regulatory frameworks evolve and more investment vehicles become available, we can expect this trend to accelerate, bringing unprecedented stability and growth to the crypto markets. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage of institutional investors plan to increase crypto allocation? According to the Sygnum survey, 61% of institutional investors plan to increase their cryptocurrency allocation despite recent market volatility. Why are institutions interested in increasing their crypto exposure? The primary motivation is the expectation of higher future returns, cited by 73% of respondents. They see long-term potential in digital assets. What types of crypto investments interest institutions most? Over 80% are interested in crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, while 70% would invest more if staking rewards were permitted. When might we see more crypto ETF approvals? Experts suggest the SEC could approve more altcoin ETFs once the U.S. government shutdown concludes, potentially triggering significant institutional capital inflow. How will institutional investment affect crypto markets? Increased institutional participation typically brings more stability, reduced volatility, and enhanced credibility to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What challenges do institutions face with crypto investments? Key challenges include regulatory uncertainty, custody solutions, market volatility, and the need for clearer accounting standards for digital assets.

LN was rejected by more than 80% of participants as not real Bitcoin. The gap shows a growing disconnect with LN’s inertia, technical issues, and concerns about its long-term role in the BTC ecosystem. Over the course of the weekend, the poll, which asked thousands of X users if Lightning was succeeding as a Bitcoin alternative, generated intense discussion on the site. Advocates like Alex Gladstein and Matt Corallo defended LN against detractors like Paul Sztorc. Breadman, the author of the poll, referred to Bitcoin inside the LN as “a separate token on a separate network,” despite Lightning BTC’s lack of a separate market capitalization from Bitcoin. Debate on LN’s actual purpose breaks out Is Lightning real bitcoin? — Breadman (@BTCBreadMan) November 8, 2025 In response to the poll’s findings, Paul Sztorc, CEO of LayerTwo Labs, stated that it is very clear that the LN is not a genuine BTC. He further noted several of LN’s challenges, such as the requirement that nodes maintain their internet connection or the reliance of users on large liquidity suppliers. Paul Sztorc claimed that although Lightning may appear spectacular at first, it becomes evident after six years that the system does not function as planned. Under Sztorc’s thread on X, some users claimed to have been using LN, and the network has been working efficiently. “I have been part of a global grant program this week that is sending Bitcoin over Lightning to projects in more than 20 countries…the recipients of which are in turn redistributing sats locally to community members, over Lightning, followed by which these sats are then being spent, over Lightning, at local merchants. I’m not sure which alternate reality you inhabit.” – Scott Wolfie , Global Coordinator at FBCE Global. However, Sztorc further argued that the users are being tricked by at least 95% of them (probably 99%). He claimed that LN users are victims of fraud and don’t understand what “custodial” means, causing them to repeat misinformation unintentionally. Gladstein, a Chief Strategy Officer at the Human Rights Foundation, disagreed, calling Sztorc’s remarks “truly amazing” and restating his conviction that LN makes it possible to utilize Bitcoin as digital currency. Matt Corallo, an analyst, also disagreed with Sztorc, citing LN’s high transaction volume for small payments and projecting that “well into double-digit percent of BTC transactions are now Lightning.” Additionally, Corallo named deniers of Lightning’s success “disconnected from reality.” LN struggles as growth stalls further According to Protos, LN is the largest and longest-running effort to reduce the cost of Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees. Memepool Space reveals that Lightning transaction fees frequently cost minuscule fractions of 0.10. The small fraction of transaction fees differs from the costly on-chain transaction fees for Bitcoin (BTC), which could cost hundreds of basis points for small, daily transactions. Protos claimed that the network was marketed as the least expensive method of sending and receiving Bitcoin while retaining complete self-custody for many years. However, it has stagnated over the past three years, despite experiencing rapid expansion from 2019 to 2022. Factually, Lightning’s network health metrics have been stagnant for years. According to Protos, the publicly visible network’s total BTC capacity is approximately 4,800 BTC, which has remained unchanged since September 2022. Since March 2022, the overall number of Lightning nodes has also remained constant. Additionally, since March 2022, the number of payment channels on the LN has decreased from over 80,000 to more than 45,000. According to Protos, BTC-pegged assets, such as Coinbase’s cbBTC and other wrapped products like spot ETFs, dwarf LN transactions. Protos claimed that these options require more centralized control and demand greater trust in intermediaries. Udi Wertheimer, a long-time Bitcoin advocate and customer support intern at Taproot Wizards, cited the success of programs like Moonshot, Base, and FOMO. He pointed out that these programs quickly drew millions of users and produced more Bitcoin-pegged transactions than on-chain activity.

Why Licensing Matters in Bitcoin Gambling Licensing is often misunderstood in the crypto gambling space. While it doesn’t guarantee perfection, it ensures accountability — operators must meet regulatory standards for fairness, responsible gaming, and fund transparency. Licensed platforms typically: Operate under audited smart contracts or external compliance checks Maintain fund segregation for user protection Provide access to third-party dispute resolution In contrast, unlicensed casinos can shut down or freeze funds without recourse. A license signals that a platform meets baseline security and fairness requirements — critical when gambling with crypto. FAQ 1. Are licensed crypto casinos safe? Yes. Licensing from recognized authorities like Curaçao or Anjouan ensures platforms operate legally and maintain transparent fund management. 2. Can I gamble anonymously on licensed sites? Yes, some — like Dexsport and CoinCasino — offer no-KYC options even while holding a license, allowing players to stay private while remaining within regulatory frameworks. 3. How are licensed Bitcoin casinos audited?

Which licensed casino offers the highest bonus? Dexsport leads with 480% on three deposits, up to $10,000, plus 300 free spins and 15% weekly cashback.

However, recent reports from Reuters indicate that this focus is beginning to shift towards less popular altcoins. DAT Firms Explore New Opportunities Beyond Bitcoin As of September, there are at least 200 DAT companies, predominantly concentrating on Bitcoin, with a combined market capitalization of approximately $150 billion. This figure reflects a more than threefold increase from the previous year. New companies are launching daily, many of which are penny stocks looking for avenues to enhance profits. Yet, as Bitcoin’s value declines, these firms are increasingly turning to new tokens in hopes of achieving greater returns. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Holds Strong as Analysts Target $4,400 Despite ETF Outflows In recent weeks, companies such as Greenlane, OceanPal, and Tharimmune have announced plans to acquire tokens like Berachain (BERA), Near protocol (NEAR), and Canton Coin (CC), respectively. Peter Chung, head of research at crypto-focused Presto Research, noted that while the initial hype surrounding DATs has diminished, there remains potential for a resurgence. In a recent interview with Reuters, an OceanPal representative stated that their acquisition of NEAR tokens was intended to leverage the asset’s integrated artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Retail Investors Lose $17 Billion In Crypto Treasuries Earlier in the year, many digital asset treasury companies traded at a premium to their crypto holdings as investors believed these firms could leverage credit to acquire more tokens. However, with Bitcoin’s recent struggles and an influx of Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) imitators, some companies are beginning to falter. Reuters indicates that at least 15 Bitcoin treasury companies were trading below the net asset value of their tokens as of last Friday. Retail investors, significant buyers of high-profile Bitcoin treasury companies, reportedly lost around $17 billion on these trades, according to estimates from Singapore-based 10x Research. Additionally, digital asset treasuries focusing on other leading cryptocurrencies are also facing challenges; ETHZilla and Forward Industries have recently approved share repurchases, a strategy typically employed to support share prices. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could See 4,440% Rally To $5 If This Macro Cycle Repeats Despite the potential for higher gains, analysts warn of the risks associated with this strategy. Cristiano Ventricelli, vice president and senior analyst of digital assets at Moody’s Ratings, cautioned that expanding into “exotic” and less liquid cryptocurrencies could significantly heighten risk. According to Ventricelli, when market conditions worsen, companies that invest in these assets face greater pressure on their equity. Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, also expressed concern that most digital asset treasury companies may ultimately trade at a discount to their digital assets.

His post was a response to a statement from Charles Hoskinson, Cardano creator, who referenced ISO 20022 as part of an effort to align ADA with evolving financial messaging standards. In his post, Vet wrote, “Friendly reminder: XRP and ADA are not ISO20022 compliant. No cryptocurrency is.” He supported this point with an image taken directly from the ISO 20022 website, which states that cryptocurrencies “are not inherently ISO 20022 compliant.” The site adds that “there is a lot of confusion and misleading information on the web referring to ISO 20022 compliant cryptocurrencies.” The renewed focus on the issue follows ongoing public references that often suggest XRP’s infrastructure has been built to meet ISO 20022 standards . However, as Vet emphasized, the standard defines a messaging format for the secure transmission of data between financial institutions, not for digital assets or their ledgers. Friendly reminder: XRP and ADA are not ISO20022 compliant. No Cryptocurrency is. https://t.co/rHCYdF7pDJ pic.twitter.com/IaXqNG0b5R — Vet (@Vet_X0) November 10, 2025 Ripple’s System and ISO 20022 Support While XRP itself is not ISO 20022 compliant , Ripple’s payment solutions are designed to interact with this messaging framework. Ripple’s enterprise products, including RippleNet and related payment software, have integrated ISO 20022 support to enable financial institutions using their network to communicate in that format. This distinction is essential, as it separates the XRP token from Ripple’s broader software infrastructure. Vet reiterated this in a follow-up comment after another user suggested the word “compatible” might be more appropriate. He agreed that XRP, like any other system, could technically interact with ISO 20022-based networks “with the right software.” To illustrate the point, he shared another post clarifying that some of Ripple’s software is ISO 20022 compliant ; however, it is unrelated to XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ISO 20022 Compatibility ISO 20022 is a global standard for exchanging financial information, designed to create consistency across banks and financial institutions worldwide. It defines how messages, such as payments or securities instructions, are structured and transmitted. The framework applies to systems that manage or send this information, not to currencies or digital assets themselves. Cryptocurrencies operate independently from ISO 20022 protocols. Their compliance would require integration at the system or software level, not through the blockchain’s token. In Ripple’s case, the company’s integration of ISO 20022 within its enterprise products enables institutions using RippleNet to align with the financial industry’s migration to the new standard, but this does not extend to the XRP ledger or the XRP asset.

Key Takeaways: TeraWulf’s Q3 revenue jumped 87% to $50.6 million, fueled by higher Bitcoin prices and growing AI infrastructure income. The miner produced fewer Bitcoins but offset the decline with an average BTC price of $114,390. TeraWulf is diversifying into AI and data hosting, securing multi-billion-dollar deals with Fluidstack and Google. In its Q3 earnings report released Monday , the US-based company said total revenue rose 87% to $50.6 million, driven largely by higher Bitcoin prices and additional income from high-performance computing (HPC) leasing. Of that total, $43.4 million came from “digital asset revenue.” TeraWulf Offsets Lower Bitcoin Output With Higher Prices, Boosting Revenue TeraWulf mined 377 Bitcoin during the quarter, down from 555 a year earlier, but compensated with stronger pricing, the average Bitcoin price during the period was $114,390, compared with $61,023 in Q3 2024. “The increase in revenue was primarily due to higher average Bitcoin prices, partially offset by a decrease in Bitcoin mined,” the company said. The firm also attributed the results to expanded mining capacity and the start of AI-related lease revenue. Following the April 2024 halving that cut block rewards, several miners, including TeraWulf, have begun repurposing part of their operations for AI and high-compute workloads to diversify income streams. Good morning, everyone. Reminder that tonight, at 4:30 pm ET, $WULF will host its Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. See you there Link to join here: https://t.co/QcTe3lPbYy — TeraWulf (@TeraWulfInc) November 10, 2025 CEO Paul Prager said the company remains “squarely focused on execution while advancing the next phase of growth for 2027 and beyond.” He highlighted an expanded partnership with Fluidstack and Google at TeraWulf’s Lake Mariner site in New York, with additional development underway at the Abernathy joint venture in the Southwest Power Pool. To support its data center build-out, TeraWulf announced a $3.2 billion senior secured notes offering in October and signed three 10-year lease deals worth $6.7 billion with Fluidstack for AI infrastructure hosting. Shares of TeraWulf (WULF) rose as much as 6% on Monday to $14.85 before paring gains to close at $14.30, up 0.49% for the day. The strong quarterly performance underscores how miners are adapting to Bitcoin’s shifting economics, balancing AI hosting expansion while still riding the momentum of a stronger BTC market recovery. Bitcoin Mining Profitability Hits Multi-Month Lows As reported, Bitcoin miners are facing mounting pressure as profitability plunges to its lowest level in months, driven by rising power costs, declining Bitcoin prices, and reduced block rewards following April’s halving. The key profitability metric, known as hash price, has dropped to around $42 per PH/s, nearing break-even levels that threaten smaller operations and squeeze industry margins. The downturn has rippled across the supply chain, with hardware sales slowing and equipment manufacturers struggling as miners delay purchases or cancel orders. Some firms, like Bitdeer, have turned to self-mining , while others are pivoting to AI and high-performance computing (HPC) to capitalize on stronger margins and steady demand. Major US miners are leading this shift. Cipher Mining recently secured a $5.5 billion AI computing deal with Amazon Web Services, and IREN signed a $9.7 billion agreement with Microsoft for GPU-based AI services. As Bitcoin’s total hashrate surpasses 1 zetahash per second (ZH/s) for the first time, the industry is increasingly transforming from traditional crypto mining toward powering the broader AI and data infrastructure economy.

This substantial movement of 872 BTC represents one of the most significant institutional Bitcoin transactions recently recorded, highlighting growing institutional confidence in the digital asset space. What Does This Major Bitcoin Withdrawal Signal? The recent Bitcoin withdrawal by Matrixport from Binance represents more than just a routine transaction. When institutions move this volume of Bitcoin, it typically indicates strategic positioning. This substantial Bitcoin movement suggests several possible scenarios: Long-term holding strategy – Moving Bitcoin to cold storage for extended periods Institutional confidence – Demonstrating belief in Bitcoin’s future value Market timing – Capitalizing on current price levels Why Are Large Bitcoin Withdrawals Important? Major Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges like Binance often signal reduced selling pressure. When institutions withdraw Bitcoin from trading platforms, they’re effectively removing those coins from immediate market circulation. This Bitcoin withdrawal pattern typically suggests accumulation rather than distribution, which can be bullish for long-term price appreciation. Moreover, this specific Bitcoin withdrawal follows a trend of increasing institutional participation in cryptocurrency markets. The scale of this transaction demonstrates how traditional financial players are becoming more comfortable with large-scale Bitcoin operations. How Does This Bitcoin Withdrawal Impact Market Dynamics? The timing and scale of this Bitcoin withdrawal create interesting market implications. When $91.7 million worth of Bitcoin leaves an exchange like Binance, it affects liquidity and available supply. This particular Bitcoin withdrawal occurred during normal trading hours, suggesting deliberate timing rather than automated execution. Market analysts often watch for such large Bitcoin withdrawals as potential indicators of institutional sentiment. The fact that this Bitcoin withdrawal involved Matrixport, a well-established cryptocurrency services provider, adds credibility to the transaction’s significance. What Can We Learn From This Bitcoin Movement? This substantial Bitcoin withdrawal teaches us several valuable lessons about current market conditions. First, institutional players continue to accumulate Bitcoin despite market volatility. Second, the infrastructure supporting large Bitcoin transactions has matured significantly. Finally, this Bitcoin withdrawal demonstrates the growing sophistication of institutional cryptocurrency strategies. The efficiency of moving 872 Bitcoin worth $91.7 million highlights how far cryptocurrency infrastructure has developed. Such large-scale Bitcoin withdrawals would have been considerably more challenging just a few years ago. Conclusion: The Bigger Picture of Institutional Bitcoin Activity This massive Bitcoin withdrawal represents more than just a single transaction—it symbolizes the ongoing institutionalization of cryptocurrency markets. As more established financial players like Matrixport execute significant Bitcoin withdrawals and other large-scale operations, the entire ecosystem matures. This particular Bitcoin withdrawal reinforces the trend toward institutional adoption and suggests continued growth in professional cryptocurrency management. Frequently Asked Questions Why would Matrixport withdraw Bitcoin from Binance? Companies typically withdraw Bitcoin from exchanges for long-term storage, security reasons, or to move funds between different custody solutions. This reduces exchange risk and indicates holding intentions. How does a large Bitcoin withdrawal affect prices? Large Bitcoin withdrawals can reduce immediate selling pressure since those coins are no longer available for quick trading. This often has a neutral to positive effect on prices over time. Is this the largest Bitcoin withdrawal ever recorded? While substantial at $91.7 million, larger Bitcoin withdrawals have occurred. However, this transaction remains significant due to its size and the parties involved. Should retail investors follow institutional Bitcoin movements? While institutional activity provides valuable market signals, retail investors should make decisions based on their own research and risk tolerance rather than blindly following large transactions. How quickly can institutions move large Bitcoin amounts? Modern cryptocurrency infrastructure allows institutions to move hundreds of millions in Bitcoin within minutes, though large transactions often occur in stages to minimize market impact. What security measures protect such large Bitcoin transfers? Institutions use multi-signature wallets, cold storage solutions, and sophisticated security protocols to protect large Bitcoin transfers from potential threats.

The partnership will set out in Singapore, with expansion to other key markets after that. Standard Chartered will serve the demand for regulated stablecoin payments, as well as convenience through DeCard. The card brand tapped one of the biggest global banking institutions, which has spoken in favor of on-chain payments. DeCard is now powered by one of the world’s most trusted financial institutions. We’re proud to partner with @StanChart to bring secure, transparent, and efficient stablecoin payments to the mainstream. More on the partnership 👉 https://t.co/3BIjrXZ76r pic.twitter.com/5eAMDXvVRM — DeCard (@DCS_DeCard) November 11, 2025 Singapore has already signaled demand for electronic payment solutions, bridging the gap between banking and crypto. “ This partnership is in line with our continued efforts to offer banking solutions for innovative Fintech partners and is central to our strategy of supporting clients in navigating the evolving digital assets space. Our investments in our platforms, capabilities and solutions allow us to be the trusted banking partner bridging TradFi to DeFi ,” said Dhiraj Bajaj, Global Head of TB FI Sales at Standard Chartered. Standard Chartered has spoken in favor of crypto adoption. The bank’s CEO Bill Winters has talked about of the possibility for moving all financial transactions on-chain. Standard Chartered to offer banking settlement for crypto-based card Standard Chartered will use its virtual account and API to partner with DCS and create virtual accounts for DeCard holders. The card will immediately verify and clear incoming payments across multiple channels. On the user side, the card will offer a seamless experience, even as multiple transactions are settled. The bank will also handle all bank-side services and potentially connect to financial markets. The service will be regulated and limited to Singapore holders after the initial launch. DeCard on its side will offer D-Vault for crypto settlement and payment tracking. The DCS club evolved from Diners Club Singapore, and will now grow into a next generation payment gateway. The card’s connection to Web3 will unlock additional incentives and experiences. While stablecoins are growing more popular, finding reliable banking is still important. As crypto-friendly banks are still rare, Standard Chartered is boosting the adoption of crypto spending cards. As the global stablecoin supply is now at a record of over $301B , cards remain one of the most convenient use cases, with added regulations and security. DeCard focuses on stablecoins DeCard continues to focus on stablecoins as a low-risk crypto ownership option. The card issuer has suggested stablecoin positions may be key in securing reserves, especially during market turbulence. DeCard is one of the few card issuers to use Polygon, one of the earliest L2 chains that scale Ethereum interactions. The card issuer also expands its stablecoin selection, recently adding USDC and USDT. DeCard accounts are also linked to a Polygon wallet, allowing for direct balance recognition when owning stablecoins. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Bitcoin Hyper targets speed and cost via a rollup model that anchors settlement to Bitcoin while running a high-throughput execution layer. Participation and pricing data show $26.8M+ raised at a live presale stage near $0.013255, pointing to persistent liquidity depth. The project’s utility-first roadmap aligns with growing demand for $BTC-native payments and DeFi, a setup whales historically front-run. Whale wallets are leaning into presales again, and the order flow just backed it up. In a single 24-hour stretch, three large buys of Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) stacked roughly a quarter-million dollars’ worth of allocations, with on-chain prints showing one purchase north of $224K and three follow-ups above $35K, $24K, and 21K respectively. That’s real money, not Discord chatter. For a presale that’s already racked up momentum, the timing wasn’t random. Why now? Presales tend to catch a bid when broader markets chop and traders look for asymmetric setups they can size into without chasing a green candle. $HYPER ’s pitch is straightforward: a Bitcoin Layer-2 designed for fast, cheap transactions and an app layer that doesn’t feel like a science project. If it onboards users who want Solana-level speed without sacrificing Bitcoin’s security, that’s a narrative whales know how to price. Momentum also shows up in participation data and the going rate for tokens. Recent figures from market guides track the presale at $26.8M+ raised with a live stage price of $0.013255, suggesting sustained bid depth rather than a one-off pump. That helps explain the clustering of bigger tickets in a single day. Whales like liquidity, and $HYPER’s presale has it. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – $BTC Layer-2 Built For Throughput, Not Vibes The core proposition is utility. Bitcoin Hyper sets out a ZK rollup architecture that bridges native $BTC into a high-throughput execution layer, then commits state back to Bitcoin. The design leans on Solana’s Virtual Machine for speed, while framing proof and settlement to keep Bitcoin-grade security intact. The upshot for you is simple: payments, DeFi moves, and dApp interactions with near-instant finality while staying tethered to $BTC as the monetary base. That’s the wedge Bitcoin needs if it wants more than store-of-value status. The product map matters here. Public materials detail a canonical bridge that verifies Bitcoin block headers and transaction proofs, a sequencing model to order transactions cleanly, and commitments back to Bitcoin’s L1 using zero-knowledge proofs. The team’s updates emphasize developer tooling and observability, which is the unsexy work that makes a chain usable. If you’ve ever tried building on immature infra, you know why that’s a bullish signal. That’s the narrative whales are front-running when they scoop presale inventory: utility first, then distribution. If an L2 can make Bitcoin move like a payments rail while preserving security guarantees, liquidity aggregates. For traders watching risk rotations, it’s a cleaner thesis than hoping for meme-beta alone. Join the $HYPER presale today. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Presale Order Flow Turns Heads Let’s talk receipts. One on-chain purchase executed yesterday shows 63.16 $ETH routed through the presale contract, valued around $224K at the time. Three additional buys in the same window added roughly $35K, $24K, and $21K . Even if you adjust for $ETH price drift, you’re still staring at a day where whales allocated about $286K into a single presale. That kind of cluster usually means either price is about to step up or supply at the current stage is getting thin. Price discovery favors projects with traction. Data trackers list the current stage at $0.013255 with total commitments above $26.8M. A presale with that level of intake has enough depth for big wallets to enter without slipping, yet it’s early enough for them to mark a position before exchange liquidity shows up. If you’re sizing a ticket, those are the two conditions you actually want. There’s also the utility-to-token loop. $HYPER is positioned as the native asset for fees, governance, and staking within the ecosystem, with multi-chain claims and a bridge planned for $ETH, $SOL, and Bitcoin Hyper itself; mechanics that smooth user onboarding. None of this guarantees performance, but it does set a higher bar than ‘number go up’. For a market hungry for credible Bitcoin-aligned throughput, that’s enough to justify whale-level darts. Check what all the fuss is about at the $HYPER presale now. This article is educational commentary, not financial advice.

""BTC could experience a rapid decline to this level!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-faces-588-billion-risk-btc-could-experience-a-rapid-decline-to-this-level/,"With the end of the government shutdown in the US, the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a partial recovery. Bitcoin has climbed above $107,000, and the rise is expected to continue after the crashes experienced in the historically bullish month of October. While $120,000 levels are expected at this point, a popular analyst said that BTC is at risk of a sharp decline to $93,000 if the $100,000 support cannot be maintained. Lock Level for Bitcoin! Speaking to Coindesk, 10x Research CEO Markus Thielen said that if Bitcoin breaks below the key $100,000 support level, it could drop to as low as $93,000. Thielen said that approximately 5.9 million BTC (worth $588 billion) has been traded in the $100,000 to $126,000 range over the past few months, a staggering amount of transaction value during what was considered a relatively stagnant trading period. Stating that a significant portion of these Bitcoins are held by individual investors with weak faith or institutional investors under pressure from company executives, Thielen stated that these investors may make panic sales if the price declines slightly. “Many of these BTC are held by investors under pressure. And a slight decline could lead investors to close these positions. At this point, if BTC is pushed below the $100,000 support line, it could trigger selling by weaker investors, and selling pressure could intensify. Consequently, BTC could quickly fall into a liquidity gap around $93,000. Thielen recently noted that if Bitcoin falls below $93,000, it could lead to increased volatility as the average purchase cost of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs is close to $90,000. *This is not investment advice.

Despite this, data suggests that the asset is in “a moment of tension rather than confirmation.” Its fate now hinges on the $2.41 backtest. Crucial Fibonacci Level In a recent market update, CasiTrades warned traders against chasing breakouts and highlighted the need to wait for a backtest of support before entering positions. According to the crypto analyst, an important level to watch is $2.41 on Coinbase, which represents critical Fibonacci support. A reaction in this zone could determine XRP’s next major move. While a short-term bounce toward $2.50 is possible, the analyst noted it remains uncertain whether such a move would sustain or lead to further downside. If the $2.41 level fails to hold, the macro 0.5 Fibonacci retracement near $2 will come into play as the next logical target. This zone fits within the broader correction pattern the analyst has been tracking. Measuring the subwaves, the structure still points toward a potential test of that $2 support before any major recovery. The outlook is also influenced by Bitcoin’s price action, as it has yet to break its key resistance levels. CasiTrades observed that Bitcoin remains vulnerable to a pullback toward $97,000 or even $94,000, with invalidation only occurring if it closes above $107,000 on the 4-hour chart, a level it briefly tested but was quickly rejected from. Overall, the analyst described the market as being in a “moment of tension rather than confirmation,” with clear invalidation points and a defined structure. The reaction around $2.41 will likely dictate whether XRP resumes its upward continuation or falls to retest its macro support near $2. Structural Factors, Not Short-Term Sentiment In a statement to CryptoPotato , Alexis Sirkia, Chairman of Ripple-backed Yellow Network, said XRP’s recent price rise is mainly due to growing expectations for the launch of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Several issuers have updated their filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), while the DTCC has listed up to nine possible XRP tickers. Investors are positioning early, expecting strong retail and institutional inflows once the ETFs go live, possibly around November 13. Sirkia also pointed to Ripple’s $500 million investment and $40 billion valuation as signs of growing confidence in the XRP ecosystem. He said that major financial players like Citadel and Fortress investing in Ripple show a strong belief in the XRP Ledger’s utility. According to Sirkia, XRP’s next big move will likely depend on these long-term structural developments rather than short-term market sentiment.

The move resembles the 2020 correction, when the asset fell from $490 to $308 before starting a major rally. Analysts are drawing comparisons between both events as ETH begins to recover. Price Drop Matches 2020 Correction Crypto analyst Galaxy pointed out that both corrections saw a drop. In 2020, the price bounced back strongly after hitting a low of $308. In 2025, ETH fell to $3,064 and is now trading above $3,500. Galaxy said the market could be repeating the same pattern. $ETH went trough a similar correction back in 2020. 2020: $490 to $300 2025: $4900 to $3000 If you ask me, we’re just getting started. pic.twitter.com/l0P3SEZvxh — Galaxy (@galaxyBTC) November 10, 2025 Notably, the key support zone is now between $3,000 and $3,100. A clear hold above support could lead to a strong recovery, as seen in the previous cycle. In addition, Cas Abbé pointed to similar setups in 2025. Earlier this year, ETH dropped, then bounced 100%. They believe the recent move towards $3,000 may have been another false breakdown. Key Support and Resistance Levels Lark Davis said ETH is still holding above a trendline that has supported the price since April. That support line is intact, but short-term pressure remains. The 20-day EMA is acting as resistance around $3,695. ETH has not yet closed above it. Meanwhile, the MACD indicator is close to a bullish cross. Davis said, “Support vs. resistance vs. momentum – something’s about to give.” ETH is being squeezed between levels. A breakout or breakdown could follow soon, depending on which side gives way first. Source: Lark Davis/X Whale Activity and Liquidity Targets Bitcoinsensus shared that ETH reversed quickly after sweeping lows around $3,350. This move may have been driven by a liquidity grab. The next area of interest is near $4,950, where there is resistance and more liquidity. PRIME 𝕏 reported that large holders began buying ETH when the price hit $3,200. If support between $3,000 and $3,400 holds, targets around $4,500 to $4,800 are in play. Whale activity in this range may support a continued move higher. However, Ali Martinez reported that 23 of the largest ETH whales sold or redistributed holdings over the past week. This comes as ETH trading volume and open interest have reached record levels, as CryptoPotato reported . Some market watchers now say speculation is driving prices more than long-term holding. Moreover, BitMine also released its latest holdings on November 10, 2025. The company reported 3.5 million ETH valued at $3,639 each, as well as holdings in BTC and other assets. The reported position indicates continued institutional exposure to Ethereum despite market fluctuations.

Best Wallet Token targets the wallet bottleneck with app-first UX and staking designed to retain users through launch and beyond. $BEST presale dynamics: $16.9M+ raised, 77% staking, $0.025925 token price, offer timed exposure to the $BTC payments flywheel. Square just put Bitcoin at the register for more than four million sellers. The payments giant flipped the switch on native $BTC payments across its merchant network, letting shoppers pay via Lightning and merchants settle near-instantly. The company announced the news with a blunt, yet comprehensive, ‘Bitcoin payments are now live,’ which garnered over 1.2M impressions. Operationally, Square’s own materials emphasize one-tap enablement inside the seller dashboard and Lightning invoice QR codes at POS, a UX choice that cuts friction where it matters: the counter. The official press release reports the rollout targets millions of sellers globally, with ‘zero processing fees’ messaging in early comms designed to nudge adoption. Block’s own site positions $BTC payments as part of a longer arc that includes Cash App’s Lightning support, Bitkey self-custody, and open-source mining. The flip side is discipline. Square’s parent, Block, has tightened compliance after regulatory settlements earlier this year, following a hefty $40M fine . Stronger controls are exactly what large merchants want to see before they lean in. Put the pieces together, and you get a cleaner runway for wallet-centric products. If millions of points of sale start accepting $BTC, user onboarding, custody, and staking all come into view. That’s why investors are kicking the tires on Best Wallet Token ($BEST) — a wallet-first ecosystem with live presale economics and staking designed to convert new users into long-term participants. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) — Wallet-First Rails Built for a $BTC-at-Checkout World Square’s move surfaces a simple bottleneck: most ‘mainstream curious’ users still lack a wallet that feels like mobile banking, not a command line. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) aims directly at that gap. The project’s materials describe a non-custodial, app-first wallet designed to streamline $BTC and multi-chain asset management, with staking soon to be built into the user journey rather than tacked on in a separate dApp. The pitch is less about chasing unsustainable yields and more about turning idle balances into on-platform activity through governance, rewards, and sticky retention. Numbers help ground the story. Recent roundups put $BEST’s presale haul north of $16.9M, with staking rewards advertised at 77% for early participants. High APYs nearly always signal bootstrapping mechanics; here the design goal is to attract early liquidity, incentivize holding through the post-launch window, and seed a governance base before listings tighten token velocity. The takeaway for you: if $BTC payments make wallets the new homepage of crypto, the projects that own that homepage earn a structural bid. This is where Best Wallet ecosystem makes its entry, offering top security, a user-friendly UI, and a multitude of upcoming services, including support for over 60 chains, the Best Card, and iGaming partnerships.

With Square normalizing $BTC at checkout, there’s a near-term window where ‘wallet UX that just works’ becomes an investable narrative, not just a roadmap bullet. $BEST leans into that with a token price of $0.025925 and outstanding long-term potential. Based on Best Wallet Token’s presale performance, utility narrative, and investor interest, our price prediction for $BEST positions the token at $0.62 by the end of 2026. This makes for an ROI of 2,291% if you buy $BEST at today’s price. The presale’s performance supports this prediction thanks to the growing investor participation, which already recommends Best Wallet Token as one of the best presales of 2025. The project rewards early participation, so if you want to invest, get your $BEST today before the next price increase. This isn’t financial advice. Do your own research before investing.

In history, certain of the largest gains are made via early-phase token holdings of robust technology and long-term usefulness, which Solana accomplished when it was still young. Today, however, a new decentralized finance (DeFi) token under the name Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a token of similar reasons because its momentum is gaining traction and its development is approaching a major product milestone. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that aims to introduce a greater level of openness and efficiency to digital asset markets. The purpose of the platform is to bridge the depositors and the borrowers in automated smart contracts that eliminate middle men yet have complete on-chain accountability. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables users to place deposits in the supported assets, including ETH or USDT, in liquidity pools and receive variable APY interest. To illustrate, when a user loans out 10 ETH to a pool with an approximate APY of 7%, it lends that amount to the pool and they are given back in the form of mtTokens, also known as yield-Sensitive tokens that reflect its loans. These mtTokens automatically grow in value due to accumulating interest, so there is no issue in yield collection and it is transparent. Mutuum Finance is also a supporter of Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending of assets not belonging to the key liquidity pools. Borrowers are able to make their own loan conditions as they use crypto as collateral with the loan-to-value (LTV) ratios dictating the number of loans they can take. An example is an asset of 70% LTV that gives a borrower the option of borrowing 70% of his asset value. When the collateral is less than the liquidation threshold the liquidator bot intervenes to preserve the balance in the system, automatically repaying the loans by selling the collateral to keep the system in balance. Healthy Demand and Well-defined Organization The presale of Mutuum Finance is now one of the most active DeFi crypto funding rounds in 2025, which draws both retail and institutional crowds. More than 17,950 holders were already brought into the project and over 800 million tokens have been sold to date. In Phase 1, the token was priced at $0.01, and currently in Phase 6, the price is $0.035, and this represents a 250% increase among those who held the token in Phase 1. The official price after the presale will be $0.06 given the gradual upward trend of the project. Phase 6 is more than 85% sold and this points to the growing demand with every phase selling out before advancing to the next price bracket. The presale will include a fixed-price, set-price system that will promote early attendance because subsequent purchasers will have to pay more to get in. To enhance the level of activities, Mutuum Finance operates a 24 hours leaderboard, which gives winners of the day a gift of $500 worth of MUTM tokens. The program has ensured that there is an everyday momentum and has made the fundraising process to have a clear competitive aspect so that the community remains involved in the daily activity. Security and Growth Potential The development roadmap of Mutuum Finance indicates that the project is at Phase 2: Building Mutuum which is focused on testing smart contracts, front-end and back-end DApps, and risk parameter integration. The team has ensured that the V1 protocol will start on the Sepolia Testnet in the fourth quarter of 2025, and development will then be replaced with live testing. The launch will also come with the key elements such as Liquidity Pools, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and the Liquidator Bot that will be the staple blocks of the functionality of the protocol. Security is the main point of concern. Mutuum Finance has a CertiK audit (score: 90/100 Token Scan), and has already a $50,000 program of bug funding available (has to be identified and remediated) before the actual debut of the mainnet. According to some market commentators, should Mutuum Finance continue with this rate of growth and development, MUTM has a 500-650% price growth potential within the first year post-launch, particularly as lending transactions take off as anticipated. One of the Promising DeFi Cryptos? Since Phase 6 is approaching full allocation, it is evident that Mutuum Finance has drawn in much investor interest. Audited security, presence of a sustainable tokenomics, and actual utility put it in a league of its own among new cryptocurrencies below the $0.05 price bracket. Even though early investors of Solana have already realized returns of more than 1,000x in the past, some in the market think that the next wave of a successful project will be on a DeFi platform that integrates innovation and functionality in the market. To date, the project remains on the list of the most promising cryptos to purchase at present at less than a dollar and enjoy a high demand in presales, a funded development strategy, and a community that is expanding on a daily basis.

The Senate reportedly reached an agreement to end the standoff, with President Donald Trump stating that “a deal is near.” Because WLFI is closely tied to Trump’s brand and his market narrative, traders quickly jumped in. As a result, WLFI surged more than 30% today, now trading above $0.16 after weeks of stagnation. However, it’s worth noting that WLFI is still down nearly 80% from its all-time high. Many holders remain underwater despite the short-term excitement. This volatility highlights a crucial distinction between hype-driven political tokens and utility-driven projects that generate long-term value. That’s where Digitap ($TAP) comes in: a crypto presale that’s rapidly gaining traction thanks to its real use cases and sustainable growth model. WLFI Price Analysis—Falling Wedge Breakout Popular chart analyst Don, who has over 223,000 followers on X, shared a bullish chart of WLFI earlier today. His explained: “I called the bottom on $WLFI and it’s already up around 63%. This is why I love falling wedge patterns—they almost always deliver. The green line is still the target!” Source: X/@DonaldsTrades Don’s chart shows a textbook falling wedge pattern, with WLFI breaking out above the upper resistance line after weeks of compression. The breakout around $0.13 led to a strong rally toward $0.16, confirming his call. The green line on his chart ( located around $0.24) marks the next key target zone, where traders expect profit-taking to begin. However, despite the breakout, WLFI still faces heavy resistance from prior sell zones. The project’s fundamentals remain heavily narrative-driven, and without solid ecosystem growth, sustaining momentum could prove difficult. That’s why analysts say short-term pumps like this should be treated with caution, especially when altcoins to buy like $TAP are showing real, measurable adoption and audited progress. Digitap—Real Utility, Real Growth While WLFI trades on speculation, Digitap is rewriting what a crypto project can be. It’s the world’s first omni-bank, combining crypto, fiat, and DeFi in one live, user-friendly platform. The app is already available on the App Store and Google Play, which allows users to exchange fiat and crypto instantly, stake tokens, and make payments with non-KYC Visa cards linked to Apple Pay and Google Pay. This makes Digitap ideal for freelancers, digital nomads, and remote workers who want fast, borderless access to their funds. No more waiting for banks to process transfers or paying high fees—everything can be done within seconds inside the Digitap app. $TAP’s Tokenomics: A Masterclass in Value Capture But what really sets Digitap apart is its buyback-and-burn model. As shown in the chart above, 50% of the platform’s profits are used to buy back $TAP tokens, with half of those tokens burned permanently and the other half distributed as staking rewards. This system steadily reduces circulating supply while rewarding holders, Momentum around the crypto presale is enormous. Digitap has now sold over 110 million tokens, raising more than $1.6 million from early supporters. The current presale price is $0.0297, with the next increase to $0.0313 scheduled soon, ahead of the confirmed listing price of $0.14. That’s a potential nearly 4x upside before the token even reaches exchanges. This combination of live utility, deflationary tokenomics, and audited transparency (by Solidproof and Coinsult ) makes Digitap one of the best cryptos to buy now, even as broader markets remain volatile. USE CODE “DIGITAP20” FOR 20% MORE $TAP TOKENS! Why $TAP Is the Best Crypto to Buy Now Despite WLFI’s impressive rebound today, its rally is largely fueled by political news—not product strength. Digitap, on the other hand, is a working financial platform that solves real-world problems. It bridges the gap between traditional banking and crypto in a way no meme or narrative-driven coin can match. As traders search for crypto to buy now that can withstand market dips, $TAP continues to stand out. Its omni-bank model, audited structure, and steady growth are turning it into the go-to altcoin to buy for investors seeking utility rather than speculation. With the next price increase from $0.0297 to $0.0313 just days away, early buyers still have a short window to enter before Digitap’s presale moves into its later stages and the $0.14 exchange listing approaches. In a market full of temporary rallies, Digitap is a project building for the long run—the best altcoin to buy this November for those who prefer lasting growth over fleeting hype.

For cryptocurrency investors watching traditional finance trends, the yen’s struggle offers crucial insights into how central bank policies and economic fundamentals can create ripple effects across all asset classes, including digital currencies. Japanese Yen Faces Mounting Pressure The Japanese yen has been experiencing significant downward momentum against major currencies, particularly the US dollar. This trend reflects fundamental economic disparities between Japan and other developed economies. The USD/JPY pair has been testing multi-decade highs, raising alarms among policymakers and market participants alike. Currency Intervention Becomes Increasingly Likely Japanese authorities have been vocal about their willingness to intervene in currency markets to support the yen. The Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan have repeatedly warned that they are prepared to take decisive action if yen movements become excessive or disorderly. Historical precedent shows that Japan has intervened successfully in the past, but current global economic conditions present unique challenges. Key Factors Driving Yen Weakness Diverging monetary policies between Japan and other major economies Persistent interest rate differentials favoring US dollar assets Japan’s structural economic challenges including aging population Global risk sentiment and carry trade dynamics Commodity price inflation impacting trade balance USD/JPY Technical Analysis and Market Sentiment The USD/JPY pair has broken through several key resistance levels, with technical indicators suggesting further upside potential. Market sentiment remains overwhelmingly bearish on the Japanese yen, with speculative positioning data showing significant short positions. However, these extreme positions also create conditions for sharp reversals if intervention occurs or sentiment shifts unexpectedly. Support Levels Resistance Levels Key Psychological Levels 145.00 152.00 150.00 142.50 155.00 155.00 140.00 158.00 160.00 Bank of Japan Policy Dilemma Intensifies The Bank of Japan faces a complex policy challenge. While other central banks have been aggressively tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, the BOJ has maintained its ultra-accommodative stance. This policy divergence has been a primary driver of yen weakness. The central bank must balance supporting economic growth with addressing currency stability and imported inflation pressures. Forex Market Implications and Global Spillover Effects The yen’s movements have significant implications for the broader forex market. As a major funding currency for carry trades, yen weakness can fuel risk appetite across global markets. However, excessive volatility or disorderly moves could trigger risk-off sentiment and impact liquidity conditions. The situation also affects other Asian currencies and emerging market assets through competitive devaluation concerns. Potential Intervention Scenarios Verbal intervention and jawboning to influence market expectations Direct market intervention through currency purchases Coordinated action with other central banks Policy adjustments including yield curve control modifications Investment Implications and Risk Management For traders and investors, the yen situation presents both opportunities and risks. The high probability of intervention creates potential for sharp reversals, making risk management crucial. Position sizing, stop-loss placement, and monitoring official communications become particularly important in this environment. The situation also highlights the importance of understanding central bank policies and their impact on currency markets. FAQs What is causing the Japanese yen’s weakness? The primary driver is the divergence between the Bank of Japan’s accommodative monetary policy and other major central banks’ tightening cycles. How does currency intervention work? Intervention involves the Japanese Ministry of Finance buying yen and selling foreign currencies, typically US dollars, to influence exchange rates. What are the risks of intervention? Intervention can be costly and may not succeed if market fundamentals remain unchanged. It can also strain diplomatic relations if perceived as competitive devaluation. How does this affect cryptocurrency markets? Yen movements can impact global liquidity conditions and risk sentiment, which often correlate with cryptocurrency market performance. Who decides on currency intervention? The decision involves the Ministry of Finance , with the Bank of Japan executing the operations in markets. Critical developments in the Japanese yen situation highlight the delicate balance central banks must maintain in today’s interconnected global economy. The potential for intervention creates a high-stakes environment where policy missteps could have far-reaching consequences across financial markets.

The bank said it will offer overseas companies and banks loans, trade financing, and yuan bonds to make the currency easier to trade and invest worldwide. The People’s Bank of China offers funding overseas through the yuan The central bank will now offer foreign companies direct loans in yuan to help them buy domestic bonds and to cover the costs of imports or exports through trade financing. The bank aims to eliminate any challenges that foreign users encounter when attempting to access the yuan and to encourage more nations to utilize the currency for their business projects. Borrowing in yuan is also cheaper than borrowing in U.S. dollars because China has robust domestic economic policies that make loans and bonds denominated in yuan more affordable. Overseas companies will be able to save a significant amount of money and make their projects more profitable due to low interest rates. Economist Xiaojia Zhi from Credit Agricole CIB said lower yields in China will encourage more overseas firms to borrow in yuan or issue panda and Dim Sum bonds. As a result, the yuan will become stronger and more widely accepted globally. The PBOC also aims to increase the supply of yuan available outside China, enabling banks and governments to borrow without concern for a potential shortage. These options will help China’s trade and industrial supply chains in other countries grow, as businesses will be able to pay suppliers and partners in yuan. More institutions use the yuan as China expands its financial ties globally The global financial messaging network, Swift , reported that the yuan was the second most used currency in trade finance markets in September, with its settlement volume accounting for 7.3% of all transactions. More companies are now preferring to trade and settle payments in yuan instead of using traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar or the Euro. China is utilizing swap lines and other financial arrangements to fund trade and investment projects that involve Chinese partners in other countries. This strategy will enhance the yuan’s international circulation and strengthen the country’s connections with global markets. Foreign governments use swap lines to borrow and use the yuan without facing shortages, and overseas financing has grown significantly over the past few years. Last year alone, panda and Dim Sum bonds raised about 1.4 trillion yuan, while offshore commercial bank loans denominated in yuan reached 2 trillion yuan (a 14% increase from the previous year). Bond markets and bank lending channels continue to expand steadily, and as more institutions use the yuan, they create a larger pool of offshore liquidity for the currency. The yuan’s influence has extended beyond domestic borders and is spreading to emerging-market countries such as Hungary, Kazakhstan, and Kenya. These growing economies borrow in yuan to support national projects and increase the currency’s circulation. Private-sector companies are also joining the trend, with UK-based payments firm Ebury expanding its operations in China to manage the growing demand for yuan settlement related to Chinese businesses and trade. It’s not just governments and banks using the yuan, but also privately owned companies, and very soon, individual investors may be conducting their activities in the currency. China is gradually establishing an international role for the yuan, and its efforts support the country’s goal of being 100% independent of the U.S. dollar.

Many traders have begun calling the higher-time-frame structure “weak,” describing the recent range as uninspiring and directionless. But EGRAG disagrees. In an update on X, he argues that what many interpret as a lack of momentum is actually a classic pre-breakout compression, similar to the 2017 and 2021 setups that preceded XRP’s largest rallies.

Among them, Noomez ($NNZ) stands out for its structured design, deflationary mechanics, and visible transparency. The presale is now in Stage 3 , with $20,831 raised from 125 holders, and the token price is at $0.0000151. Every stage brings higher prices and smaller supply, giving early participants the best possible entry point. While most new tokens rely on hype, Noomez coin is built around verifiable value. The project’s clean audits and community-driven reward system make it one of the smartest moves for investors eyeing long-term growth. 5 Projects With Real Utility Noomez ($NNZ) – The most utility-packed presale right now. It features 28 total stages , on-chain burns after each phase, and the exclusive Stage X Million Airdrop that rewards holders automatically. Liquidity Lock: 15% of total supply locked forever. Audits: Verified third-party contract audit before launch. Rewards: Each stage closes with real giveaways, not promises. Fun Fact: The Vault activates at Stage 14 and again at Stage 28, permanently removing unsold tokens from circulation. Noomez token delivers transparency, fairness, and scarcity, the three ingredients behind every 100x chart in crypto history. Pump.fun (PUMP) – Trending with a $1.45B market cap, but most of its growth depends on social virality, not utility. Bonk (BONK) – Solana’s meme king. Fast growth, but minimal token mechanics to sustain long-term value. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) – NFT-backed, great branding, but token utility remains limited. FLOKI (FLOKI) – Strong marketing and community, though its ecosystem growth has slowed recently. Project Utility Level Supply Control Community Rewards Transparency Noomez ($NNZ) High Yes (Burns Every Stage) Stage Airdrops Audited + KYC Pump.fun Low No None No Bonk Medium No Yes No Pudgy Penguins Medium No Yes No FLOKI Medium No Yes Yes Pro Tip: Use your referral code during the Noomez presale to earn an extra 10% in $NNZ tokens instantly. Presales or Listed Tokens? When it comes to timing, presales consistently outperform listed tokens. The upside of entering early is what drives amazing gains . Listed coins like FLOKI or BONK have already seen their biggest pumps, while presales like Noomez token still sit at entry-level prices. With each stage, the price increases, and the circulating supply tightens. Early buyers are rewarded automatically through stage-end burns and vault events. The FOMO kicks in once prices double after the next stage, and hesitation could mean paying twice as much for the same NNZ coin later. Why Utility Will Rule 2025 Speculative hype fades fast, but utility never does. The next market cycle will reward projects with measurable use cases and strong tokenomics. Noomez leads this charge with: Smart Contracts: Independently audited before launch. Liquidity Lock: 15% supply locked for life. Team Wallets: 6–12 months vesting to prevent early dumps. Deflationary Supply: Stage-end burns and vault-triggered reductions. Unlike meme-driven coins, the Noomez token proves that transparency and functionality can still drive insane growth. The design ensures constant scarcity, giving NNZ the power to outperform even the best presales now . Best Crypto Presales 2025 The Best Crypto Presales that last aren’t built on speculation but on systems that sustain growth. Noomez ($NNZ) combines fair distribution, permanent burns, and anti-bot protection, all verified on-chain. It’s a presale that rewards believers through real mechanics, not empty marketing. With 28 stages planned, each closing with visible progress and controlled supply, Noomez coin offers an entry into one of the few deflationary ecosystems designed for long-term gains. If you plan to buy crypto presales in 2025 , this is the one that could deliver explosive returns once the market starts to move again.

XRP ETF Release Date Announced!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/altcoin-etf-news-continues-to-roll-xrp-etf-release-date-announced/,"Altcoin ETF decisions, which were expected to be announced in October, could not be announced due to the US government shutdown. However, with the new rules adopted by the SEC in recent months, Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC) and Hedera (HBAR) ETFs began trading in recent weeks without separate SEC approval. While the lack of an XRP ETF is still noteworthy, the launch date of XRP ETFs is very close. ETF Store President Nate Geraci shared on his X account that the end of the US government shutdown has paved the way for a number of XRP ETFs. Among the first to launch at this point is the Canary Capital spot XRP ETF, which will begin trading on Nasdaq on November 13. The Canary Capital spot XRP ETF is being followed by ETFs from several major financial institutions: Franklin Templeton is set to launch its XRP ETF on the CBOE on November 18th. Following this, 21Shares, Bitwise, and CoinShares are expected to launch XRP ETFs between November 20th and 22nd. Grayscale and WisdomTree's XRP ETFs will then launch on the New York Stock Exchange around November 25th. While the XRP ETF is expected to start trading very soon, it was reported that five spot XRP ETFs have also completed their registration with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) as part of the ETF launch process. These included Franklin Templeton as 'Franklin XRP Trust (XRPZ)', 21Shares as 'XRP ETF (TOXR)', Bitwise as 'XRP ETF (XRP)', Canary Capital as 'XRP ETF (XRPC)' and CoinShares as 'XRP ETF (XRPL)'.

VALR CEO Farzam Ehsani certainly thinks so, making a bold Bitcoin price prediction that has the crypto community buzzing with excitement. Why This Bitcoin Price Prediction Matters Now The US Senate’s decisive 60-40 vote to end the government shutdown has created unexpected momentum for cryptocurrency markets. According to VALR CEO Farzam Ehsani, this political development could push Bitcoin to astonishing new heights. His Bitcoin price prediction suggests we might see the digital asset reach $130,000 in the near future. How Government Decisions Impact Bitcoin’s Value Political stability often translates to market confidence, and the Senate’s action appears to be no exception. Ehsani explains that the resolution removes uncertainty that had been weighing on investors. This Bitcoin price prediction stems from clear technical indicators showing: Strong upward momentum following the Senate vote Potential for breaking through key resistance levels Increased institutional interest in stable political environments The Path to $130K: Understanding This Bitcoin Price Prediction Ehsani’s analysis suggests Bitcoin needs to reclaim the $110,000 level first. Once this crucial barrier falls, the path to $130,000 becomes much clearer. This Bitcoin price prediction isn’t just speculative—it’s based on market patterns we’ve seen during previous bull cycles. The House of Representatives’ scheduled Wednesday vote could provide the final catalyst needed. Market watchers are closely monitoring whether political consensus will translate into financial market gains. What Makes This Bitcoin Price Prediction Different? Unlike many optimistic forecasts, this Bitcoin price prediction comes from an established exchange CEO with direct market insight. Ehsani emphasizes that we’re not just seeing temporary price movement but potentially the beginning of a new bull cycle. His track record and position in the industry lend credibility to this bold projection. Key Factors Supporting the Bitcoin Price Prediction Several elements combine to make this Bitcoin price prediction plausible: Political stability reducing market uncertainty Historical patterns of Bitcoin performance post-government resolutions Growing institutional adoption during stable political periods Technical indicators showing strong breakout potential Frequently Asked Questions What exactly triggered this Bitcoin price prediction? The US Senate passing a bill to end the government shutdown created positive market sentiment, which VALR’s CEO believes could propel Bitcoin to new highs. How reliable is this Bitcoin price prediction? While all predictions carry uncertainty, this comes from an established industry leader and is supported by clear market indicators and political developments. What price level does Bitcoin need to hit first? According to the analysis, Bitcoin must reclaim $110,000 before the path to $130,000 becomes viable. When might we see this Bitcoin price prediction materialize? If the pattern holds, we could see movement toward these levels in the short term, especially if the House vote confirms the Senate’s decision. Could other factors affect this Bitcoin price prediction? Yes, broader market conditions, global economic factors, and unexpected regulatory developments could all influence the actual outcome. Is this the start of a new bull market? VALR’s CEO suggests this could indeed mark the beginning of a new bull cycle for Bitcoin and potentially other cryptocurrencies.

Most altcoins have erased significant portions of yesterday’s gains as well, with ZEC and ICP leading on the way south. BTC Halted at $107K It was just a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency felt the selling pressure as its price dumped from over $111,000 to under $100,000 in the span of just 48 hours. As such, it dipped within a five-digit price territory for the first time since June. The bulls finally stepped up after this substantial correction and quickly helped BTC rebound to over $100,000. The recovery attempt was stopped at $104,000, and the subsequent retracement pushed bitcoin south to just over $99,000. Nevertheless, the asset quickly returned to a six-digit price tag and remained calm over the weekend at around $102,000. On Sunday afternoon, though, US President Trump promised dividend payments of $2,000 for non-high-income Americans, in what felt like a stimulus check déjà vu. BTC reacted with an immediate surge to $104,000 on Sunday and up to $106,500 on Monday. After a brief retracement, reports emerged that the US government might reopen soon, which drove bitcoin above $107,000 for the first time in a week. However, it couldn’t keep climbing and has dropped by two grand since then. Its market cap has dipped below $2.1 trillion, while its dominance has settled below 58% on CG. BTCUSD.

ETH is back to $3,550 after a 2% daily decline, while XRP has dropped by more than 3% to $2.45. BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, LINK, HYPE, and XLM have posted some notable losses as well.

The collaboration marks a major step for Base-based decentralized finance ( DeFi ) platforms seeking to expand their offerings with professional-grade derivatives infrastructure. With the integration, TrebleSwap users gain access to deep liquidity, customizable leverage, and efficient execution through Orbs’ modular, fully managed perps stack. The deployment builds on Orbs’ proven Layer-3 infrastructure and follows a series of successful integrations of Perpetual Hub’s earlier version. Building on Orbs’ Layer-3 infrastructure Developed by Orbs in collaboration with Symm.io, Perpetual Hub Ultra is a comprehensive perpetual futures protocol that equips DEXs with everything needed to deploy a high-performance derivatives platform. This includes integrated hedging, liquidation, oracles, and a professional trading interface. Built for scalability and capital efficiency, Ultra supports routing of liquidity from both onchain and offchain sources, including major centralized exchanges such as Binance, allowing DEXs to achieve deep execution without building their own backend systems. As intent-based trading continues to shape decentralized markets, Perpetual Hub Ultra extends this model to perpetuals, enabling DEXs to match centralized exchanges in execution speed, flexibility, and user experience while maintaining full decentralization. TrebleSwap expands trading tools on Base TrebleSwap offers an all-in-one decentralized trading environment on Base that brings together token swaps, concentrated liquidity pools, cross-chain functionality, and a permissionless launchpad. The integration with Orbs’ Layer-3 technology strengthens TrebleSwap’s position as a key liquidity hub within the Base ecosystem and reflects Orbs’ continued expansion as a core infrastructure provider powering advanced onchain trading.

Its transparent roadmap, real-world lending mechanics, and robust presale activity have made it one of the most promising DeFi crypto projects of the year. The upcoming V1 Protocol launch in Q4 2025 on Sepolia testnet will mark a pivotal moment for investors, combining operational innovation with measurable utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to bring simplicity and real rewards to both retail and institutional participants, creating an ecosystem where activity drives value. Presale Momentum and Investor Opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, offering 170 million tokens at $0.035. This phase will be 90% sold out as demand surges. The next phase price will rise to $0.040, representing a 15% increase. Across all phases, total holders have surpassed 17,900, and the funds raised will reach approximately $18.65 million. With the introduction of card payments and no limits on purchase size, participation will be easier than ever. This presale phase will create urgency, giving early investors a rare chance to enter before the price rises and the platform’s V1 launch brings initial functionality. These dynamics make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out as the next crypto to hit $1 for early supporters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate as a decentralized protocol with two lending models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system will support established assets like ETH, USDT, and BTC, enabling lenders to earn automatic yield through liquidity pools. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system will facilitate agreements for tokens not suitable for pooled lending, offering higher returns with customizable terms. This dual engine will balance institutional-level security with community-driven opportunity, creating broad appeal across investor profiles. By allowing both structured and flexible lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will position itself as a leading DeFi crypto for active participation. What Pulls MUTM Demand? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch its platform and list the token at the same time. This synchronized rollout will provide immediate engagement, giving users a working product on day one. Unlike many presales that release tokens long before any utility exists, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deliver live lending, borrowing, and staking modules simultaneously. This coordinated launch will attract attention from Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchanges, as platforms with functional products often meet listing criteria more rapidly. Traders, lenders, and borrowers will have the opportunity to use the protocol fully, stake mtTokens, and earn rewards right from the start. This integration of product and token is a key driver behind analysts’ $1 projection. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) differentiates itself from hype-driven tokens by linking value to platform activity. Each interaction, from lending and borrowing to staking and buybacks, will increase token circulation. The protocol will include an over-collateralized stablecoin system, allowing users to mint a $1-pegged decentralized asset using ETH, SOL, or AVAX as collateral. Every stablecoin mint or repayment will generate transactional demand, reinforcing the token’s utility. As the ecosystem expands, features like multi-chain integration, advanced analytics, and institutional onboarding will further increase demand for MUTM, creating a sustainable foundation for growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement a buy-and-distribute system where part of the protocol’s revenue, generated from fees and platform activity, will be used to repurchase MUTM tokens on open markets. These tokens will then be distributed as rewards to mtToken stakers. This cycle will create dual benefits: long-term participants will receive regular rewards, and continuous buybacks will introduce price support in the market. The more the platform is used, the higher the revenue and the more tokens are repurchased and redistributed, ensuring consistent ecosystem-driven demand. Community Incentives and Investment Example Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reward early supporters through staking and the ongoing $100,000 community giveaway. Ten winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM, encouraging long-term participation and active involvement in the ecosystem. These initiatives will foster loyalty, strengthen community ties, and drive ongoing use of the protocol. An investor who joined Phase 3 at $0.02 with $5,000 will hold 250,000 MUTM. At the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, the stake will be valued at $8,750. Once MUTM reaches $1, the same investment will be valued around $250,000 — a 50x increase. This example highlights why early accumulation is critical, and why investors are moving quickly before the next phase raises the entry price. Phase 6 is already 90% complete, and the price will rise to $0.040 soon. With V1 approaching, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned for rapid adoption and on-chain activity. Analysts are confident that this DeFi crypto project will reach $1, supported by platform readiness, consistent engagement, and transparent execution. With the launch and price hike imminent, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another presale — it is the opportunity analysts say you will wish you joined sooner.

54265174,625217,1762855211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54265174.jpeg,Hedera Hashgraph Added To Google BigQuery Public Datasets,https://bitcoinist.com/hedera-hashgraph-google-bigquery-public-datasets/,"Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) data has been added to Google BigQuery’s public datasets, expanding the roster of chains available for large-scale, cross-chain analytics on Google Cloud. Importantly, the integration was not initiated by Google; it was led and executed by HBAR-aligned entities. In the Hedera Foundation’s words, the listing is “the result of a collaborative initiative led by the Hedera Foundation, focused on transparency, usability, and support for open-source development.” Hedera Hashgraph Data Now Live On Google BigQuery In a post amplifying the rollout, the foundation highlighted the practical upshot for developers and analysts: “Hedera’s inclusion in BigQuery public datasets allows developers, analysts, and enterprises to query the full transaction history of the Hedera network, just as they can for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche , Polkadot, Tron, and other blockchains,” positioning HBAR’s ledger data alongside the industry’s most widely queried chains. The Foundation characterizes the work as a cross-organizational effort “led by the Foundation” and supported by Ariane Labs as well as engineers from Hashgraph and Hedera, with Google’s role framed as infrastructure provider via Google Cloud. The Foundation’s public messaging on X reinforced that context—this is an HBAR-side push into Google’s existing analytics venue rather than a Google-driven product initiative. The announcement post states that Hedera “has been added to Google Cloud BigQuery public datasets,” and directs readers to the Foundation’s blog for details, underscoring that the dataset onboarding flows through HBAR’s own open-source ETL and deployment pipelines. The move adds an institutional-grade window into HBAR’s on-chain activity without forcing users to run their own indexing stack. According to the Foundation’s technical note, the dataset targets parity with other BigQuery-hosted chains to enable like-for-like comparisons. That includes analyzing execution and fee dynamics, tracking HTS-based tokenized assets and NFTs, and studying smart-contract and DeFi activity across networks. The Foundation also says it has open-sourced the ETL scripts and deployment frameworks so the broader community can contribute and keep the schema aligned with network upgrades—another signal that the effort is community-led rather than Google-owned. The listing arrives against a long-running backdrop of collaboration between Hedera and Google Cloud . In February 2020, Google Cloud announced it would join the Hedera Governing Council, operate a network node, and make ledger data available “alongside GCP’s other public DLT datasets.” For developers and analysts, the significance is pragmatic, not flashy. Hedera now sits in the same analytics corridor that many shops already use for Bitcoin and Ethereum studies, which means existing SQL-based research pipelines, BI dashboards, and even ESG-oriented supply-chain audits can query Hedera side-by-side with other networks without bespoke infrastructure. Market response was constructive at the margin. At press time, HBAR has outperformed the broader crypto market over the past 24 hours, rising roughly 3.8% while many large-caps traded lower over the same window. At press time, HBAR traded at $0.188.",Crypto News|Google Cloud|HBAR|HBAR News|HBAR price|Hedera|Hedera Hashgraph|Hedera news|Hedera Price,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|HBAR|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-11 10:00:11

From an Oct. 6 level of $123,500, the coin tumbled almost 20% to a low of $99,900 on Nov. 4 before recovering to about $106,350. Reports show the move left Bitcoin roughly 14% below its earlier October peak.

The immediate technical test is the 200-day moving average, which sits near $110,000.

Full report on the… pic.twitter.com/n4MMZfhuL3 — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) November 10, 2025 According to his view, Bitcoin needs to push back above that level to make a clear case for renewed upside. If it can’t, the risk is that sellers regain control and prices slip further below the current band between $100,000 and $110,000. Resistance And Momentum Signals Reports have highlighted other warning signs. Long upper wicks have appeared on recent candles, a sign that buyers were checked near the top. The 12-month simple moving average has started to flatten after a steady climb, suggesting the buying drive is slowing. Trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe has pointed to strong resistance in the $108,000–$110,000 zone. According to him, breaking through that range could open the door back to the highs, and if that happens, altcoins may run harder than Bitcoin. Institutional Moves And Market Mood Institutional buyers remain active. Michael Saylor’s firm purchased 487 BTC worth close to $50 million today, bringing reported holdings to 641,692 BTC. At the same time, exchange-traded funds saw outflows totaling $1.22 billion last week. Market sentiment has nudged up: CoinMarketCap’s Fear and Greed Index rose to 29 from 24, and Bitcoin is up about 3.6% in the past 24 hours after lawmakers advanced a US government shutdown deal. Traders are pricing event-contract probabilities that place a 28% chance Bitcoin reaches $130,000 or higher this year and a 9% chance it tops $150,000. Short-Term Triggers Could Tip The Scale Near-term catalysts are in play. US President Donald Trump’s mention of a possible $2,000 tariff “dividend” and progress toward ending the shutdown appear to have helped the recent bounce. Timothy Misir, head of research at Blockhead Research Network, said the market has cleaner positioning and could see a constructive November if fiscal clarity and ETF flows stabilize. He also warned about risks: continued ETF outflows, delivery delays on fiscal measures, and rising market leverage could reverse the recovery. Related Reading: Trump Media Takes $55M Hit As Bitcoin Holdings Surge In Value What To Watch Next For now, Bitcoin sits in a tight trading range. Reclaiming $110,000 would be read as a positive signal and might restore buying confidence.

Traders and institutions will watch price action around those levels closely — and those moves will shape whether this moment is remembered as a short pause or a major turning point.

This brings its total holding to a significant 641,692 $BTC, cementing its status as the largest corporate $BTC holder. The move showcases a disciplined accumulation plan even amid a choppy market. $BTC is currently at around $105K – down 16.64% from its October 6 $126.2K ATH. However, Strategy’s long-term conviction remains clear, backed by an average purchase price of $74,079 per $BTC and a 26.3% year-to-date yield. Giant players may be doubling down on $BTC, but retail investors are looking elsewhere. That includes the best meme coins on presale, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . This Bitcoin Layer-2 project promises to deliver Solana-like transaction speeds and costs. Plus, you’ll also finally be able to use $BTC to unlock DeFi, NFTs, and other on-chain utilities Bitcoin’s native can’t execute. The $HYPER presale has raised $26.8M, with tokens currently priced at $0.013255 and staking at 43% APY. Discover more about $HYPER’s Layer-2. Square Rolls Out $BTC Payments to 4M Merchants – Best Meme Coin to Buy Now November 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Block Inc, parent of Square, is rolling out Bitcoin payments to 4M+ merchants globally, offering instant, zero-fee settlement until 2027. Square CEO Jack Dorsey announced the update as part of his vision to merge digital assets with traditional payments, reinforcing $BTC’s role in everyday commerce. Merchants can activate the feature from the Square dashboard and settle in $BTC or fiat, with built-in tools that automatically convert a portion of sales into Bitcoin. Analysts view this latest $BTC integration as a major step toward faster, cheaper, mainstream crypto-powered transactions. Dorsey’s premise is similar to what a new presale project, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , is also proposing. It plans to introduce a Bitcoin Layer-2 platform that will unleash the OG’s true potential. That includes lower fees, faster speeds, and access to DeFi, NFTs, and other Web3 functionality. With $26.8M already raised, $HYPER is on track to be among the best meme coins of 2025. Tokens are currently available through its presale website for $0.013255, with staking at 43% APY. Check out our $HYPER price prediction for our take on this project’s potential.

The Liquidity Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-own-xrp-or-be-left-behind-the-math-is-simple-the-liquidity-is-coming/,"Crypto commentator Pumpius has highlighted what he describes as a significant shift in global liquidity conditions, pointing to recent economic data, corporate investment trends, and upcoming fiscal actions by the United States government. His position presents XRP as a strategically positioned digital asset capable of facilitating high-volume, real-time cross-border settlement in an environment where liquidity is expected to increase sharply. The central argument is that this emerging wave of capital movement requires infrastructure that is already operational, scalable, and institution-ready. Own XRP or get left behind. The next liquidity wave is here, and it is larger than anyone realizes. The United States government is preparing to distribute over 400 billion dollars in new stimulus payments, the first since 2021. At the same time, the Federal Reserve is… pic.twitter.com/MASwuM58EQ — Pumpius (@pumpius) November 9, 2025 Stimulus Measures and Market Liquidity According to Pumpius, the U.S. government is preparing to issue over $400 billion in new stimulus payments, marking the first major direct fiscal injection since 2021. The chart attached to his post shows the continued rise in the U.S. national debt, which has now surpassed $38 trillion. Previous stimulus rounds in the $160 billion to $410 billion range are also displayed on the chart, each associated with an increase in liquidity availability. The claim is that this new stimulus enters markets at a time when inflation remains above 3% and labor indicators weaken, suggesting that the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cuts may introduce even more liquidity rather than curb price pressures. This combination of fiscal expansion and lower interest rates historically increases capital circulation across financial markets. Pumpius asserts that such conditions tend to move funds quickly across regions and asset classes, amplifying the need for settlement systems that can efficiently transfer value across borders. Corporate Investment and Infrastructure Buildout He also points to the ongoing capital expenditure by major U.S. technology companies, often referred to as the “Magnificent 7.” These companies are reportedly deploying over $100 billion per quarter into artificial intelligence infrastructure. Pumpius characterizes this as one of the largest private-sector investment cycles in recent market history. The argument is that this level of spending increases institutional capital flows. This again raises the demand for settlement systems capable of transferring cross-border liquidity in real time. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Positioned as a Liquidity Bridge Pumpius states that XRP is currently the only digital asset built specifically to function as a bridge asset at institutional settlement scale. He emphasizes that Ripple’s infrastructure is already deployed and able to support real-time global capital movement. The claim is that this positions XRP to act as a settlement rail for the liquidity expansion expected from combined stimulus, monetary easing, and corporate spending. His conclusion is direct. The liquidity is increasing, systems requiring efficient transfers are expanding, and XRP has aligned structurally with these conditions.

Conviction builds when company fundamentals and onchain activity confirm the same trend. Active positioning across market cycles helps capture innovation while protecting against excess. We examine how disciplined research and active judgment, not hype, guide investing decisions in the emerging onchain economy. Active Management Starts with Discipline In our previous post , we explored why active management matters in crypto, how adaptability helps investors navigate powerful cycles and shifting opportunities. But adaptability alone isn’t enough. True active management comes from discipline : applying structured research, judgment, and balance to every decision. In the onchain economy, this means blending traditional financial analysis with blockchain-specific insights, knowing how to assess, adjust, and remain composed when conditions change. 1. Building the Investable Universe Every active strategy begins with defining the opportunity set. In digital assets, that means identifying publicly traded companies meaningfully exposed to Bitcoin and the broader adoption of digital assets. This wide universe includes companies across every GICS sector, predominantly spanning fintech, e-commerce, energy infrastructure, and AI computing. From thousands of global equities, we narrow the universe through three filters: Relevance: Companies must derive real revenue or strategic value from blockchain or digital assets. Scale and Strength : We focus on listed equities with meaningful size, liquidity, and sound balance sheets. Governance: Transparency and prudent financial management are essential; excessive leverage or weak oversight is screened out early. This disciplined foundation identifies companies built for endurance from data center operators powering AI workloads to fintechs integrating blockchain payments. 2. Combining Fundamental and Onchain Research Traditional equity analysis still matters because cash flow growth, profitability, and competitive advantage form the backbone of long-term success. But active research goes further. If research is like coaching a college football team, it’s about evaluating the play calls, execution, and game management, not just looking at the final score. A single flashy win doesn’t make a championship team, and one bad quarter doesn’t define a season. The same applies to digital asset companies. We care about consistency, execution, and how they perform under pressure. Onchain metrics like transaction volumes or network fees provide real-time visibility into blockchain activity. Macro indicators like global liquidity, dollar strength, or policy shifts help us understand the playing field. And fundamental research reveals whether a company has a sustainable game plan. Just as a coach desires to build a team with a solid run game, disciplined defense, and a quarterback who protects the football, we favor companies with reliable revenue, manageable leverage, and leadership we can trust. Those are the teams that may not always dominate the highlight reel but are most poised to endure and come away victorious. When fundamentals, onchain data, and macro context align, conviction builds. When they diverge, it’s time to reassess the playbook. 3. Positioning Across Market Cycles Crypto markets remain cyclical, with volatility often centered around Bitcoin’s halving cycle. For active managers, the goal isn’t to predict each turn but to position intelligently through them. Bitcoin Expansion vs. Contraction- Last 10 Calendar Years Source: Morningstar as of December 2024. Expansion: Periods beginning at a market trough and continuing until the next 10% decline. Expansions encompass recovery through the prior peak or a new all-time high. Contraction: Periods beginning at a market peak and continuing through the subsequent trough that includes a decline of 10% or more. References to Bitcoin market cycles are based on historical data and are provided for illustrative purposes only. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see important disclosures at the end of the presentation. Just as great coaches adjust the game plan depending on their opponent, active managers adapt exposure based on where we are in the market cycle. In expansion phases, exposure tilts toward higher-beta areas—miners and exchanges that thrive on liquidity and optimism. In downturns, companies with diversified revenue and durable balance sheets, such as semiconductor or infrastructure firms may get added exposure. It’s about sticking to the game plan, protecting against turnovers, keeping it manageable on third down, and taking your shot when the opportunity arises. The process generally underweights leverage, avoiding companies or instruments reliant on borrowed exposure. That discipline helps reduce the impact of speculative excess that often defines crypto bull markets. 4. Continuous Monitoring and Risk Management Markets, like seasons, shift quickly. Constant evaluation ensures the strategy stays disciplined even as conditions change. Teams track earnings, governance, and onchain data alongside macro signals that influence sentiment. The goal is to spot subtle cracks before they widen, such as rising leverage, slowing network activity, or liquidity stress. Sentiment indicators such as futures funding rates and Relative Unrealized Profit help identify overheated or oversold markets, offering cues to adjust before volatility spikes. When red flags emerge, exposure can be trimmed or exited, an option passive strategies lack. Meanwhile, new entrants are continuously assessed as innovation reshapes the opportunity set. 5. From Research to Real-World Impact The payoff of this process is clarity. Decisions rest on measurable fundamentals and data-backed conviction, not momentum or hype. Active management provides a framework to participate in one of the most dynamic corners of global markets while maintaining a balance between opportunity and risk. Much like a team that plays a complete game, successful active management means not being one-dimensional or careless with the football. It’s about preparation, adaptability, and execution across every phase of the market, putting investors in a position to win over the long run. Lasting Advantage Comes from Discipline Active management in the onchain economy is ultimately about discipline: integrating research, real-time data, and risk awareness to navigate an evolving market. For investors seeking a structured, research-driven approach, VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ( NODE ) applies active management to companies leading the digital asset transition. Important Disclosures The Fund may invest nearly all of its net assets in either Digital Transformation Companies and/or Digital Asset Instruments . The Fund does not invest in digital assets or commodities directly. An investment in the Fund involves a substantial degree of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Investors in the Fund should be willing to accept a high degree of volatility in the price of the Fund’s Shares and the possibility of significant losses. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit with a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Therefore, you should consider carefully various risks before investing in the Fund, each of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may be subject to risks which include, among others, risks related to investing in digital transformation companies, digital asset instruments, commodities and commodity-linked instruments, subsidiary investment, commodity regulatory (with respect to investments in the subsidiary), tax (with respect to investments in the subsidiary), gap, liquidity, derivatives, new fund, regulatory, non-diversified, small- and medium-capitalization companies, foreign securities, emerging market issuers, market, operational, active management, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount risk and liquidity of fund shares, industry concentration, cash transactions, underlying investment vehicle, and affiliated investment vehicle risks, all of which may adversely affect the fund. Emerging market issuers and foreign securities may be subject to securities markets, political and economic, investment and repatriation restrictions, different rules and regulations, less publicly available financial information, foreign currency and exchange rates, operational and settlement, and corporate and securities laws risks. Small- and medium-capitalization companies may be subject to elevated risks. Digital asset instruments may be subject to risks associated with investing in digital asset exchange-traded products (“ETPs”), which include the historical extreme volatility of the digital asset and cryptocurrency market, as well as less regulation and thus fewer investor protections, as these ETPs are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”) or commodity pools for the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”). The technology relating to digital assets, including blockchain, is new and developing and the risks associated with digital assets may not fully emerge until the technology is widely used. Digital asset technologies are used by companies to optimize their business practices, whether by using the technology within their business or operating business lines involved in the operation of the technology. The cryptographic keys necessary to transact a digital asset may be subject to theft, loss, or destruction, which could adversely affect a company’s business or operations if it were dependent on the digital asset. There may be risks posed by the lack of regulation for digital assets and any future regulatory developments could affect the viability and expansion of the use of digital assets. Commodities and commodity-linked instruments may be subject to further risks, including tax and futures contracts risk. This risk may be adversely affected by “negative roll yields” in “contango” markets. The Fund will “roll” out of one futures contract as the expiration date approaches and into another futures contract with a later expiration date. The “rolling” feature creates the potential for a significant negative effect on the Fund’s performance that is independent of the performance of the spot prices of the underlying commodity. The “spot price” of a commodity is the price of that commodity for immediate delivery, as opposed to a futures price, which represents the price for delivery on a specified date in the future. The Fund would be expected to experience negative roll yield if the futures prices tend to be greater than the spot price. A market where futures prices are generally greater than spot prices is referred to as a “contango” market. Therefore, if the futures market for a given commodity is in contango, then the value of a futures contract on that commodity would tend to decline over time (assuming the spot price remains unchanged), because the higher futures price would fall as it converges to the lower spot price by expiration. Extended period of contango may cause significant and sustained losses. Additionally, because of the frequency with which the Fund may roll futures contracts, the impact of contango on Fund performance may be greater than it would have been if the Fund rolled futures contracts less frequently. Investing involves substantial risk and high volatility, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing.

Ploughing its usual sideways furrow, how much longer can the Bitcoin price stay depressed in the low $100,000s? Bitcoin sideways chop continues Source: TradingView The $BTC price is now in a corrective impulse. That said, the price is generally going sideways. If the bulls can keep this up, when the next upward impulse begins, there will be a greater chance of forming a higher high. As can be seen in the 4-hour chart above, the price has broken through the downtrend (faint dotted line) and is now heading sideways. If the small uptrend line is respected there could be some more upside, perhaps as far as the $107,500 horizontal resistance. Is the bulls fightback now underway? Source: TradingView The daily chart view for $BTC illustrates that the price is still below the 200-day simple moving average (red line). Once holding strongly above this it can probably be said that the bulls are in charge again. The Fibonacci levels (in blue) are taken from the all-time high down to the $99,000 local bottom. They show that the price has reached the first of these levels at $105,000. What the bulls really need to do is to battle through them one by one, aiming to set a higher high at just above the key 0.618 Fibonacci at $115,750. High time frame indicators close to signalling next bullish wave Source: TradingView The weekly chart still looks clearly in favour of the bulls. It is expected that the $BTC price comes down to tag the major trendline once more, giving this line more validity, but actually falling through it is not a likely scenario. The Stochastic RSI indicators are practically at the bottom now, and they could show a cross-up as early as the beginning of next week. The Relative Strength Index at the bottom of the chart is showing that the indicator line is just above the 44.00 line which has provided support and resistance throughout this and previous bull markets. Such a strong support line is very likely to continue to be so, until the time it confirms a bear market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The 2020 theft of 127,000 BTC from the LuBian mining pool now carries shocking new implications that could reshape how we view government involvement in cryptocurrency security. What Really Happened in This Bitcoin Hack? The National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) in China has released a report suggesting US government involvement in the sophisticated Bitcoin hack. This isn’t just another cryptocurrency theft – the agency claims to have uncovered multiple signs of government-level technological expertise in the hacking methods used. Here’s what makes this Bitcoin hack investigation so compelling: 127,000 BTC remained dormant for four years after the initial theft The stolen funds recently moved to a wallet identified as US government-controlled Analysis shows sophisticated techniques beyond typical criminal capabilities The timing coincides with US legal actions against the alleged pool operator Why Would Governments Target Bitcoin? The CVERC report raises disturbing questions about potential government motives in this Bitcoin hack. The agency suggests the US government might have supported the hackers initially, only to later confiscate the massive cryptocurrency haul. This theory gains weight when you consider the recent US announcement about indicting Chen Zhi and seizing exactly 127,271 BTC. This Bitcoin hack case reveals several concerning patterns: Government-level resources potentially used against private cryptocurrency operations The four-year dormancy period suggests strategic planning Legal actions following the fund movements create suspicious timing International tensions affecting cryptocurrency security How Does This Bitcoin Hack Affect Crypto Security? This revelation about the Bitcoin hack sends shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community. If governments are actively targeting cryptocurrency operations, it changes the entire security landscape. The sophisticated nature of this Bitcoin hack suggests that even well-protected pools might be vulnerable to state-level attacks. The implications are profound for cryptocurrency investors and operators: Traditional security measures might not protect against government-level attacks International political tensions now directly impact cryptocurrency safety The line between legal seizure and illegal hacking becomes dangerously blurred Trust in cryptocurrency infrastructure faces new challenges What’s Next in This Bitcoin Hack Investigation? As the Bitcoin hack investigation continues, the cryptocurrency world watches closely. The Chinese agency’s claims demand thorough verification, while the US government maintains its position about legal seizure procedures. This Bitcoin hack case could set important precedents for how governments interact with cryptocurrency operations globally. The ongoing developments in this Bitcoin hack story highlight critical issues: The need for transparent international cryptocurrency regulations Improved security protocols for mining operations Clear boundaries for government involvement in cryptocurrency matters Protection for legitimate cryptocurrency businesses This shocking Bitcoin hack revelation serves as a wake-up call for the entire cryptocurrency industry. The potential involvement of government entities in such operations raises fundamental questions about security, sovereignty, and the future of digital assets. As investigations continue, one thing becomes clear: the rules of cryptocurrency security are being rewritten before our eyes. Frequently Asked Questions What is the LuBian Bitcoin mining pool? LuBian was a Chinese Bitcoin mining pool allegedly operated by Chen Zhi, chairman of the Prince Group. The pool was targeted in the 2020 hack that resulted in the theft of 127,000 BTC. How did investigators link the US government to the Bitcoin hack? Chinese investigators analyzed the hacking methods and found signs of government-level technological involvement. The connection strengthened when the stolen BTC moved to a wallet identified as US government-controlled. Why did the stolen Bitcoin remain dormant for four years? The four-year dormancy period suggests strategic planning. Investigators believe this delay might have been intended to avoid detection or wait for optimal conditions to move the funds. What evidence supports China’s claims about US involvement? The CVERC report points to sophisticated hacking techniques, the wallet identification by Arkham, and the timing coincidence with US legal actions as supporting evidence for their claims. How much was the stolen Bitcoin worth? At current market values, 127,000 BTC represents billions of dollars, making this one of the largest cryptocurrency thefts in history. What does this mean for cryptocurrency security? This case suggests that cryptocurrency operations may need to protect against not just criminal hackers but potentially state-level threats, requiring enhanced security measures.
