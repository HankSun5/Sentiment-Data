Related Reading: US Gov’t Shutdown Deal Sparks Hope For Crypto Market Relief Reports of a bipartisan Senate deal lifted global investor sentiment, sending Bitcoin above $106,000 and Ethereum past $3,600 for the first time in nearly two weeks. The overall crypto market capitalization jumped 4.4% to $3.6 trillion, according to CoinGecko data. Shutdown Relief Sparks Market Optimism The Senate voted 60–40 to advance a funding bill, which is expected to restore federal operations by midweek. President Donald Trump is set to sign the legislation once it passes the House. Analysts say the reopening could revive economic data flows and provide the Federal Reserve with the clarity needed to resume rate cuts as early as December. Jeff May, COO at BTSE, noted that “without key data during the shutdown, the Fed had to wait. Once operations resume, policymakers will have the confidence to adjust rates more actively, potentially easing liquidity pressures across markets.” Bitcoin Leads the Rebound as Liquidity Returns Bitcoin rallied more than 4% in 24 hours, reclaiming the $105,000–$106,000 range, while Ethereum gained over 5%. Other major cryptos, including XRP and BNB, also advanced, reflecting renewed risk appetite. Analysts attribute the rebound to an anticipated recovery in liquidity as government functions and Treasury flows normalize. Peter Chan of Presto Research said, “Removing the shutdown factor opens the door to a repricing of risk assets in a favorable macro setting, looser monetary policy, fiscal incentives, and reduced uncertainty.” Despite the bullish tone, whale movements remain in focus. On-chain data from Lookonchain revealed that early investor Owen Gunden transferred 3,549 BTC ($361 million) to Kraken, sparking speculation of continued profit-taking. Yet analysts like “Darkfost” believe these sales represent “a healthy rotation of long-term holders,” noting that institutional demand and ETF inflows have provided sufficient liquidity to absorb large sell orders. Fed Policy, Inflation, and Crypto’s Path Forward The prospect of a reopened government has also fueled bets on another Federal Reserve rate cut in December, with CME data showing a 63% probability. Lower borrowing costs would likely benefit both equities and digital assets. Related Reading: Why Are Bitcoin OGs Dumping Billions Of Dollars In BTC? While macro optimism drives short-term gains, experts warn that lasting recovery depends on consistent liquidity and policy stability.

Following a sharp drop below the $3,300 level, bulls are now attempting to reclaim $3,600, with the next major objective set at $4,000 — a level that could confirm a shift in market momentum if conquered. Related Reading: SharpLink Gaming Wallet Moves Freshly Redeemed Ethereum to OKX – Details Amid this recovery effort, key on-chain data highlights a surprising move from one of the market’s most closely watched traders — the so-called Anti-CZ Whale. This investor gained notoriety for shorting ASTER shortly after Changpeng Zhao (CZ) — the former CEO of Binance and one of the most influential figures in crypto — publicly mentioned buying it. The whale’s timely short turned out to be highly profitable, reinforcing their reputation as a contrarian yet precise market player. Now, this same whale has flipped bullish on Ethereum, opening a significant long position after having shorted ETH last week. The move signals growing confidence in Ethereum’s recovery potential and could hint at an upcoming market reversal. As sentiment begins to stabilize and liquidity rotates back into major altcoins, Ethereum’s price action in the coming days will be crucial in determining whether this bounce evolves into a sustained uptrend. The Anti-CZ Whale Flips Bullish on Ethereum According to new on-chain data shared by Lookonchain, the trader known as the Anti-CZ Whale has once again demonstrated his sharp market timing. After shorting Ethereum (ETH) during last week’s market correction, the whale has now flipped bullish — taking a major long position that reflects growing confidence in the asset’s recovery. The data reveals that the whale currently holds 32,802 ETH, valued at roughly $119.6 million, with more than $15 million in unrealized profit so far. This strategic pivot came shortly after Ethereum’s rebound from its recent lows near $3,200, suggesting that the trader anticipated a relief rally as selling pressure began to ease. What makes this move even more significant is that the Anti-CZ Whale is still maintaining profitable short positions in other assets — notably ASTER and PEPE. This indicates a selective, tactical approach rather than a broad market shift. His ETH long aligns with improving sentiment around Ethereum, while the other shorts suggest caution toward more speculative altcoins. Historically, the Anti-CZ Whale has earned a reputation for trading against major narratives — including his successful short on ASTER after Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Binance’s former CEO, tweeted about buying the token. His latest move toward ETH could therefore signal that smart money is beginning to rotate back into high-conviction assets. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Trim Positions – 4M ADA Sold in 7 Days ETH Price Analysis — Signs of a Short-Term Recovery Ethereum’s price action on the 4-hour chart shows a notable recovery following last week’s sharp decline. After dipping below $3,300, ETH found strong buying interest and has since rebounded toward the $3,600 region — a key short-term resistance level. This rebound coincides with increased trading volume, suggesting renewed confidence among bulls after several days of panic-driven selling. The structure now shows early signs of a potential trend reversal, as Ethereum has formed a short-term higher low pattern, with buyers defending the $3,350–$3,400 support zone. If momentum continues, the next target for bulls lies near $3,800, where previous breakdowns occurred. A clear break and close above that level would confirm a bullish continuation toward the $4,000 mark.

The broader market remains fragile, and the asset is yet to reclaim its 200-period moving average, which currently acts as dynamic resistance. Failure to sustain momentum above $3,600 could lead to renewed selling pressure, potentially retesting support near $3,250.

The exchange announced on Nov. 10 that it will debut a dedicated token sales platform, starting with the layer-1 blockchain Monad, whose sale is scheduled to run from Nov. 17 to 22, offering 7.5% of its total supply. Token launches just got a whole lot better. → Early access to your favorite tokens → Real supporters are prioritized → Sustainable token distribution → US users can finally join Now possible with token sales on Coinbase. Oh, one more thing: the @monad sale starts Nov 17. pic.twitter.com/ox5VRAqfiH — Coinbase (@coinbase) November 10, 2025 The move marks Coinbase’s first public token sale since 2018 and indicates a broader shift in how projects distribute their tokens. Coinbase’s New Token Sales Put Structure Over Speed According to the company , the initiative is an effort to set “a new standard” for sustainable and transparent token launches. Under the new framework, Coinbase plans to host around one token sale per month, each governed by an allocation algorithm designed to ensure broader participation and fairness. Unlike the chaotic “first-come, first-served” sales that dominated the 2017–2018 ICO boom, Coinbase’s model gives investors a one-week window to submit purchase bids in USD Coin (USDC). When the window closes, an algorithm determines allocations, favoring smaller orders to promote wider token distribution. Coinbase also added a rule to curb speculative flipping: users selling within 30 days of listing may receive smaller allocations in future sales, rewarding long-term supporters. Only verified and compliant Coinbase users will be eligible to participate, while issuers will undergo vetting based on team credentials, token economics, and vesting structures. Projects launching through the platform will be required to lock their tokens for at least six months, with any over-the-counter or secondary sales needing Coinbase’s approval and public disclosure. The exchange said there will be no participation fees for users, with issuers paying a percentage fee on the funds raised. For Coinbase, the new platform extends a string of major product rollouts in recent weeks as the company deepens its on-chain and retail services. Earlier this month, Coinbase introduced DEX trading within its mobile app for U.S. users (excluding New York), allowing access to Base-native tokens before formal listings. @Coinbase has rolled out DEX trading directly within its mobile app for U.S. users, expanding the platform’s on-chain capabilities. #Coinbase #DEX https://t.co/rhNl9TEAuz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 9, 2025 It also activated staking for New York residents and applied for a National Trust Company Charter with the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. Coinbase Launches Token Sales Platform After $375M Echo Acquisition The token sales platform comes shortly after Coinbase’s $375 million acquisition of Echo , an on-chain capital-raising startup founded by crypto trader Cobie. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong envisions moving the complete startup lifecycle onchain after acquiring Echo for $375 million to democratize capital formation. #Coinbase #Echo #Startup https://t.co/5wsDdA065a — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 26, 2025 Echo’s infrastructure now forms the foundation of Coinbase’s new system, allowing direct project-to-community fundraising. The company said the integration will “create more accessible, efficient, and transparent capital markets” for crypto issuers. The timing coincides with a resurgence of public token offerings in the broader market. Last month, rival project MegaETH raised $50 million in five minutes through a sale hosted on Echo’s Sonar platform, attracting more than $300 million in pledges. Kraken and Andre Cronje’s Flying Tulip have also entered the new generation of ICOs, with compliant, regulated models. Unlike the 2017 ICO frenzy, when lax oversight led to widespread fraud, today’s market is marked by tighter regulation, institutional participation, and increased transparency. Coinbase’s initiative represents a bid to revive the spirit of community-driven fundraising while aligning it with compliance standards that were absent in the past. Monad, which has raised $248 million across prior funding rounds, including a $225 million Series A in 2024, will become the first project to sell tokens directly to U.S. retail investors in more than seven years. Source: tracxn.com Coinbase has confirmed that tokens launched through its sales platform will later be listed on its exchange, offering a seamless bridge from early access to secondary trading. The launch also follows Coinbase’s strong Q3 2025 earnings , reporting $432.6 million in net income, a fivefold increase from the same quarter last year. CEO Brian Armstrong said the company’s recent moves advance its “Everything Exchange” vision, one platform for every part of the crypto economy.

BNY Mellon’s latest report reveals an incredible projection: the stablecoin market could reach a staggering $3.6 trillion by 2030. This represents one of the most significant growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency space, fundamentally changing how institutions manage money and collateral. What Does the Stablecoin Market Projection Really Mean? The current $300 billion stablecoin market could quintuple to $1.5 trillion within just five years. This explosive growth reflects increasing institutional adoption and the practical utility of stablecoins in global finance. Moreover, tokenized deposits and digital money market funds are expected to contribute an additional $2.1 trillion to this expanding ecosystem. Why Are Institutions Embracing Stablecoins? Financial institutions are discovering multiple benefits that make stablecoins increasingly attractive: Enhanced collateral management for institutional operations Faster settlement times compared to traditional systems Reduced counterparty risk through blockchain transparency Global accessibility without traditional banking limitations How Will Tokenized Cash Transform Finance? Tokenized cash represents the next evolution in digital assets. BNY Mellon’s report highlights that tokenized deposits and digital MMFs will create new efficiency layers in financial markets. These innovations enable institutions to optimize their treasury operations while maintaining regulatory compliance. The transition toward tokenized assets marks a fundamental shift in how value moves globally. What Challenges Does the Stablecoin Market Face? Despite the optimistic projections, the stablecoin market must overcome several hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains a primary concern for widespread adoption. Additionally, technological infrastructure needs continued development to support massive scale. However, the potential rewards justify the ongoing investments and regulatory discussions happening worldwide. Practical Implications for Investors and Institutions The growth of the stablecoin market creates numerous opportunities. Institutional investors can leverage these assets for improved liquidity management. Meanwhile, traditional finance players must adapt to remain competitive. The convergence of traditional banking and digital assets is accelerating, creating new business models and revenue streams. The projected $3.6 trillion stablecoin market represents more than just numbers—it signals a fundamental restructuring of global finance. As institutions increasingly adopt these digital assets, we’re witnessing the birth of a new financial ecosystem that combines traditional reliability with blockchain innovation. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are stablecoins? Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, designed to maintain consistent value unlike volatile cryptocurrencies. How does tokenized cash differ from stablecoins? Tokenized cash represents traditional bank deposits on blockchain networks, while stablecoins are typically issued by private companies and backed by reserves. Why are institutions interested in stablecoins? Institutions value stablecoins for their settlement efficiency, transparency, and ability to optimize collateral management across global operations. What risks does the stablecoin market face? Key risks include regulatory uncertainty, reserve management transparency, and technological scalability challenges as adoption grows.

Today’s strong uptick favors a bullish XRP price prediction , and here’s why. Canary Capital and 21Shares finally filed Form 8(a).

Canary’s ETF will trade under the ticker symbol XRPC. Meanwhile, 21Shares does not seem to have received an official ticker yet. Thus far, the only spot ETF for XRP that has already been listed is the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR). Since its launch, it has brought in over $100 million in assets. XRP Price Prediction: 41% Upside Potential in the Short-Term The 4-hour chart shows that XRP broke a symmetrical triangle that had been forming since the token started its latest downtrend in late October. The $2.2 level acted as strong support lately. The market seems ready to take off after a brief period of turmoil. A break above $2.35 and the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) emphasizes the strength of the latest wave of buying pressure. As a result, we could witness a much stronger move toward, $3 at least if the uptrend breaks past the $2.65 area. The price should continue to move toward $3.60 if positive momentum gains further steam, indicating a 41% total gain ahead. Although a $1,000 XRP may still be out of reach this year, a move to $10 looks far more realistic as institutional adoption accelerates and real-world use cases expand. Beyond XRP, early-stage crypto presales are where the biggest upside lies — and few are making waves like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). The project has already raised more than $26 million to build a high-speed, Solana-powered Layer 2 for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Lets BTC Holders Earn Passive Income for the First Time For years, Bitcoin’s biggest limitation has been its lack of scalability and utility beyond simple transfers. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) changes that. By bringing Solana-level speed and efficiency to the Bitcoin network, it allows BTC holders to stake, lend, and earn yield directly on their assets — unlocking passive income opportunities that were once impossible on the original chain. As the presale nears completion, early buyers are positioning themselves ahead of what could be one of Bitcoin’s most transformative upgrades yet. With the help of the more efficient Solana blockchain, the Hyper L2 supports lighting-fast transaction speeds at a low cost to create the best environment for launching decentralized apps, meme coins, and payments platforms. Investors can safely send their BTC tokens to a designated Bitcoin wallet through the Hyper Bridge to get started. This allows them to access DeFi applications without leaving the Bitcoin OG network. As the demand for the solution progressively rises, analysts agree that the price of $HYPER could skyrocket. To grab this token at a discounted presale price, you can simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper official website and connect a compatible wallet like Best Wallet .

The draft is a significant step toward passing long-sought legislation that would help create clearer regulations in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies by giving the CFTC more authority. The bill was introduced by Senate Agriculture Chair John Boozman (R-Ark.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who have been working quietly behind closed doors for months to thaw the frigid relations between Democrats and Republicans over cryptocurrency. Their alliance is a rare example of bipartisan cooperation on an issue that has long been a source of political contention. Many parts of the bill remain in parentheses, a sign that negotiations are ongoing over issues such as consumer protections, the requirement for exchanges to register, and how to classify different types of digital tokens. Legislators say they are working through those sticking points so that a bill can move forward. The process is heavily influenced by the Agriculture Committee, which has oversight of the CFTC. Under this draft, the CFTC would have primary jurisdiction over digital commodities — a category that includes cryptocurrencies that are not deemed securities. CFTC moves to widen oversight If approved, the bill would grant the CFTC new authority to register and regulate digital commodity exchanges . To protect new kinds of businesses, these platforms would have to adhere to clearer standards for custody, trading transparency, auditing, and cybersecurity. Advocates for the CFTC expanding its role believe that the crypto market has grown too powerful and too large to allow for rampant speculation without oversight. Bitcoin and Ether alone are worth hundreds of billions of dollars. However, many trading platforms are currently operating under a fragmented or inconsistent regulatory framework. Industry groups have long complained about the lack of uniform regulations, which they say has led to enforcement by surprise, in which agencies penalize companies after the fact instead of providing clear guidance upfront. The draft attempts to address this by providing a predictable regulatory framework. However, not all digital currencies would be subject to the CFTC. Determining which tokens are securities — and therefore subject to the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — is among the biggest hurdles. The SEC has contended that many crypto tokens are more akin to investment contracts and should be classified as securities. Bipartisan negotiations persist as lawmakers seek a final agreement Legislation for the structure of the cryptocurrency market is being crafted across two top committees. The digital commodities and CFTC authorities provisions fall under the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Agriculture. Meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee has jurisdiction over the sections of the bill that deal with securities laws and the SEC. Republicans on the Banking Committee released their own market structure proposal earlier this year. Now they are negotiating with Democrats to draft a unified version. Those discussions are likely to cover how responsibilities are divided between the two financial regulators, a perennial source of friction in Washington. Crypto exchanges, financial firms, and even large asset managers have urged Congress to develop a clearer regulatory environment. A lack of clear regulations has deterred investment and driven innovation overseas, many argue — pointing to Europe and Singapore as other locations that have already established comprehensive digital asset frameworks. The bill is one of President Donald Trump’s priority items, which he considers advancing policies that ensure technological competitiveness while also protecting against fraud and market manipulation. If lawmakers reach a compromise, the bill would rank among the most significant pieces of crypto legislation in American history. It would determine which federal agency should have authority over different market segments, establish guidelines for how trading platforms operate, and implement protections that help insulate investors and shape how the United States competes with other countries when companies begin issuing a new form of money on a large scale. So, for now, it’s progress to see it at all. However, lawmakers concede that the most difficult part lies ahead. They need language that serves the interests of both Republicans and Democrats, reconciles the outright conflicting approaches of the SEC and CFTC on climate change, and appeals to an industry still deeply divided on the subject.

What Does 250 Million USDC Minted Actually Mean? When the USDC Treasury mints new coins, they’re essentially creating fresh digital dollars backed by real assets. This recent 250 million USDC minted represents one of the larger single transactions we’ve seen recently. The process involves Circle, the company behind USDC, creating new tokens that are fully collateralized by US dollar reserves. This substantial amount of USDC minted typically indicates one of several scenarios: Growing institutional demand for stablecoin exposure Preparation for major market movements or investments Increased liquidity needs across cryptocurrency exchanges Strategic positioning by large investors or institutions Why Should Crypto Investors Care About USDC Being Minted? The timing and scale of this 250 million USDC minted operation matter significantly. Large-scale minting events often precede important market developments. When substantial amounts of USDC get minted, it usually means big players are preparing to make moves in the crypto space. Moreover, this massive USDC minted transaction demonstrates the growing importance of stablecoins in today’s digital economy. These coins serve as the backbone for trading, lending, and decentralized finance operations across countless platforms. How Does Massive USDC Minting Affect Crypto Markets? When the treasury releases such a large amount of USDC minted into circulation, it creates several immediate effects. First, it increases available liquidity across exchanges and DeFi protocols. This additional capital can fuel trading activity and potentially influence price movements. Second, the sheer scale of this USDC minted transaction suggests confidence in the stablecoin ecosystem. Institutions don’t commit hundreds of millions without thorough due diligence and clear use cases for these digital dollars. What’s the Real Impact of This USDC Minted Event? The 250 million USDC minted represents more than just numbers on a blockchain. This development signals several key trends in cryptocurrency adoption. The growing institutional interest in stablecoins continues to validate the entire digital asset space. Furthermore, each time significant amounts of USDC get minted, it reinforces the coin’s position as a trusted digital dollar alternative. The transparency of these minting operations, verified by independent observers like Whale Alert, builds trust throughout the crypto community. Key Takeaways From the 250 Million USDC Minted This substantial USDC minted event teaches us valuable lessons about the current state of cryptocurrency markets. The continued growth of stablecoin usage demonstrates their crucial role in the digital economy. The scale of this particular USDC minted transaction highlights the maturing infrastructure supporting these assets. Most importantly, the 250 million USDC minted shows that despite market volatility, institutional players remain committed to building within the crypto ecosystem. Their actions speak louder than words, and this massive minting operation speaks volumes about their confidence in digital assets. FAQs About USDC Minting What does it mean when USDC is minted? When USDC is minted, new tokens are created by the USDC Treasury and added to circulation, backed by equivalent US dollar reserves held in regulated financial institutions. Why would someone mint 250 million USDC? Large institutions or exchanges typically mint substantial amounts of USDC to meet growing demand for stablecoin trading pairs, provide liquidity, or facilitate large transactions. Is minting new USDC inflationary? No, each USDC token is fully collateralized by real US dollars or equivalent assets, so minting doesn’t cause inflation in the traditional sense. How does USDC minting affect cryptocurrency prices? Increased USDC minting can indicate growing institutional interest and potentially lead to increased trading activity, though it doesn’t directly cause price changes. Who can mint USDC tokens? Only authorized institutions working with Circle can mint USDC tokens, ensuring proper collateralization and regulatory compliance. How transparent is the USDC minting process? The process is highly transparent, with minting events publicly reported and reserve holdings regularly audited by independent accounting firms. Found this analysis helpful?

Millions of tokens were burned last week as well, favoring a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction . In the past 24 hours, SHIB has jumped by 1.7%, above the $0.000010 mark. Meanwhile, trading volumes have increased by 14% to $160 million, accounting for nearly 3% of the token’s market cap. HOURLY SHIB UPDATE $SHIB Price: $0.00000975 (1hr 0.27% ▲ | 24hr -2.13% ▼ ) Market Cap: $5,744,495,553 (-2.15% ▼) Total Supply: 589,247,184,047,940 TOKENS BURNT Past 24Hrs: 919,747 (-78.31% ▼) Past 7 Days: 32,297,688 (-47.20% ▼) — Shibburn (@shibburn) November 9, 2025 Data from Shibburn, a website that tracks Shiba Inu’s automatic token burns, indicates that, in the past 7 days alone, 32.3 million tokens have been taken out of circulation forever. Although this represents a small percentage of the token’s circulating supply, it reflects that trading and network activity has been rising. Since the year started, SHIB has lost 52% of its value as the market. Nonetheless, Shiba Inu has one of the strongest communities in the meme coin space. Once altcoin season resumes, it could be one of the first tokens to benefit from a wave of positive momentum. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: 110% Gain Ahead If SHIB Breaks Out Of Its Price Channel The daily chart shows that SHIB just bounced off a key trend line support. This could mark the start of the token’s net leg up, as it eyes the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). This EMA coincides with the upper bound of Shiba Inu’s trend line resistance, increasing its relevance from a technical standpoint. If the price rises above this level, we could witness a strong move toward $0.00001650 first, and then to $0.000021, meaning a total upside potential of 110%. Moreover, if altcoin season kicks off again, we could expect a retest of the $0.000030 area that the token hit back in December. Although the top meme coins have lost their shine lately, early crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI), have kept attracting investors. With exchange listings coming soon, now could be a great time to get involved. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Aims to Build a Community of Risk-Taking ‘Degens’ Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a new Ethereum-based meme coin that creates a social hub for traders to share setups, flex wins, and compete in viral contests . It blends the hype of Doge with the energy of retail speculation, offering a space where users can swap ideas, spot trends early, and climb leaderboards through bold, high-reward plays. From trading competitions to meme-fueled community events, $MAXI is building a tribe of traders who treat the market like a game worth winning. The project gamifies trading with weekly challenges like Max Gains and Max Ripped, rewarding top ROI hunters with prizes and recognition. In addition, it will invest 25% of the presale’s proceeds in top meme coins and use the gains to finance additional marketing efforts. As cryptos recover, $MAXI could hit full send once its presale ends and listings start. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, visit the Maxi Doge official website , and connect your wallet (e.g., Best Wallet ). You can swap USDT or ETH to complete the transaction or use a traditional bank card instead. Buy $MAXI Here.

Prices have enjoyed some relief after last week’s losses, with Bitcoin up by 4% in the past 24 hours and Ethereum up by 6.5%. Other altcoins (e.g., World Liberty Financial, Pump.fun) have rebounded even more strongly, underlining their potential for when the market enters a bull rally. And some of the most promising alts right now are new presale coins, such as new ERC-20 token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE). PEPENODE has been gaining momentum in its sales, and given its exciting features, it could rally strongly once it launches. Crypto Price Prediction: Here’s One Crypto That Could 100x As of writing, PEPENODE has raised $2.1 million in its presale, which it kicked off in September. This figure indicates the interest that’s growing around PEPENODE, which is planning to launch crypto’s first-ever mine-to-earn platform. The new Mt.Rushmore is looking mighty fine https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/dr3W5CnVKo — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 9, 2025 This platform will provide users with the ability to build and operate their own virtual mining rigs, earning themselves considerable rewards – paid out in coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin – in the process. Given that traditional mining is now so expensive that only large companies or pools can engage it, PEPENODE is aiming to make mining more accessible to the wider crypto market. All users will need to acquire some PEPENODE , which they can use to buy more mining nodes. The more mining nodes they own, the greater their mining rewards will be. What’s bullish about this is that it will provide a strong incentive to acquire more PEPENODE, which in turn should help to push the token’s price up over time. Staking will also drive demand for PEPENODE, since holders will be able to stake the coin, which currently offers an APY of 614%. This all makes PEPENODE one of the more promising new meme tokens to hit the market in recent weeks, which is why it has such a promising crypto price prediction. It could potentially surge once it lists in the coming weeks, especially if it gains listings from big exchanges. How to Buy PEPENODE Before Presale Ends Investors may therefore want to join the PEPENODE presale before it ends, and before the coin’s price rises, since its launch could coincide with a big market rally. They can do so by visiting the official PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet and MetaMask. The token is currently selling at a price of $0.0011408, although this price will rise at regular intervals until the sale ends, so buyers should act quickly. As a coin, PEPENODE has a max supply of 210 billion tokens, with 35% of this supply going to its treasury, 35% to development, 15% to marketing, 7.5% to node rewards, and 7.5% to growth and listings.

The Bitcoin treasury and asset management firm added 7,525 BTC to its portfolio, sourced directly from the open market at a total purchase price of approximately $162 million. This latest purchase places Strive ahead of Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital , which owns approximately 6,894 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. The sale is the latest sign of a burgeoning arms race among publicly traded companies that view an investment in Bitcoin as a means to increase their holdings. It is a harbinger of a larger macro trend, where investment institutions and companies are starting to view Bitcoin as a key treasury asset, especially amid fluctuations in monetary policy, which is driving further global interest in digital reserves. Strive dips into IPO funds to grow Bitcoin treasury Strive purchased the asset with proceeds from its recent initial public offering of new issue SATA noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, which was offered at $80 per share. It was an oversubscribed IPO that had been upsized before going public — a strong signal of demand from institutional investors, if there ever was one. In a press release , Strive CEO Matt Cole stated that the move to perpetual preferred equity, rather than selling common stock or corporate debt, is an “innovative model” for corporate Bitcoin buying and holding. The offering provides Strive with an opportunity to expand its Bitcoin portfolio while ensuring that ASST’s common stockholders are not diluted. Cole said it was a “make or break” moment for the company. He added that Strive is the first Bitcoin treasury firm to reach this milestone through strategic investments in perpetual preferred equity, demonstrating that Bitcoin can serve as a disciplined foundation for long-term value creation. Corporate buying of Bitcoin has been active across all sectors. Among those that have increased their holdings in recent weeks are the digital currency company CleanSpark, Trump Media and Technology Group, formed by Donald J. Trump, and Tesla. Institutional inflows to Bitcoin ETFs and structured investment vehicles are also continuing to increase, with unconfirmed reports that JPMorgan has been allocated $340 million of BlackRock’s BTC ETF. For Strive, the rise in Saudi Arabia is just the first snowflake before their intended accumulation avalanche. The company has indicated it’s likely to make more purchases of Bitcoin if market conditions remain conducive to its corporate treasury model. SATA’s dividend strategy delivers a 12% return on capital The SATA preferreds pay an adjustable payout, which, in its simplest form, is intended to yield 12% per year, known as the Return of Capital (ROC). That permits payouts to be handled differently for tax purposes if there is an advantage to any given investor. Strive said that it would adjust the dividend rate to keep the stock trading between $95 and $105 per share. SATA is what CIO Ben Werkman called a financial vehicle that merges the yield-stabilizing nature of a conservative type of fixed income with Bitcoin’s capital dollarization efficiency. He said the design is intended to provide investors with a predictable yield, while enabling Strive to grow its Bitcoin treasury over time. Bitcoin’s liquidity, transparency, and round-the-clock global trading make it an attractive asset for treasury-backed yield strategies, said Jeff Walton, the company’s Chief Risk Officer. Walton stressed that Bitcoin’s track record and market structure enable Strive to model risk and return more easily than in many alternative asset classes. With the most recent acquisition, Strive now sits just below GD Culture Group and above Galaxy Digital in terms of corporate Bitcoin holdings. The velocity with which the company has grown is a testament to its unabashed approach and willingness to place Bitcoin at the heart of its capital formation model. At a time when Bitcoin-supported corporate structures are gaining popularity worldwide, it is reasonable to assume that Strive’s approach will be of interest not only to traditional market investors but also to crypto-oriented players.

Die Aussicht auf Stabilität und neue Finanzhilfen sorgt für bessere Stimmung an den Märkten. Davon kann besonders BTC profitieren, der deutlich an Stärke gewinnt. Der wochenlange Stillstand in der US-Regierung sorgt für Unsicherheit – doch nun scheint sich endlich etwas zu bewegen. Eine mögliche Einigung im Kongress lässt Investoren aufatmen. Besonders der Kryptomarkt reagiert spürbar: BTC legt kräftig zu. Die Hoffnung auf Stabilität und frisches Geld weckt die Risikofreude der Anleger – und könnte den Startschuss für eine neue Rally bedeuten. US-Senat stimmt für Öffnung – Anleger atmen auf Ein wichtiger Schritt im US-Senat sorgt für neue Hoffnung: Am Sonntag stimmten die Senatoren für einen Gesetzentwurf, der die Regierung wieder öffnen soll. Dieses Signal hat die Stimmung an den Finanzmärkten deutlich verbessert. Viele Experten sind überzeugt, dass ein Ende des Shutdowns Unsicherheit beseitigt und die Risikobereitschaft stärkt. Besonders der Kryptomarkt, der oft auf politische Signale reagiert, zeigt positive Reaktionen. The US government shutdown is ended. House Speaker Johnson gives briefing.Some Democrats finally joined the Republicans to end the pains and nightmare. pic.twitter.com/BgeqYw7Wjw — The Knight News (@Knight981311) November 10, 2025 Laut Ryan Lee, Chefanalyst bei Bitget, könnte das Ende des Stillstands kurzfristig mehr Vertrauen schaffen und die Liquidität erhöhen. Das würde Bitcoin und anderen Kryptowährungen helfen, ihren Aufwärtstrend fortzusetzen. Die Aussicht auf politische Stabilität sorgt also auch bei digitalen Anlagen für frischen Schwung. Wetten auf baldige Einigung nehmen zu Auch Prognoseplattformen wie Myriad, betrieben vom Mutterunternehmen von Decrypt, zeigen die wachsende Zuversicht. Nutzer dort schätzen die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass der Shutdown bis zum 15. November endet, inzwischen auf 91 Prozent – doppelt so hoch wie noch vor wenigen Tagen. Dieser Optimismus überträgt sich direkt auf den Kryptomarkt. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass Bitcoin bald die Marke von 115.000 Dollar erreicht, liegt nun bei 68 Prozent. Anleger glauben wieder an steigende Kurse – und das spiegelt sich in höheren Handelsvolumen und steigender Nachfrage wider. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Trump kündigt mögliche Geldzahlungen an Für zusätzlichen Auftrieb sorgte ein Beitrag von Präsident Donald Trump auf Truth Social. Er schrieb, dass jeder Bürger eine Zahlung von mindestens 2000 Dollar erhalten solle – ausgenommen seien Besserverdiener. Diese Nachricht erinnert viele an die Corona-Stimulus-Checks von 2021, die damals für einen großen Geldzufluss in den Kryptomarkt sorgten. Solche direkten Zahlungen erhöhen meist den Konsum und das Vertrauen in die Wirtschaft. Analyst Ryan Lee meint, dass dies den Appetit auf riskantere Anlagen wie Aktien und Kryptowährungen stärken würde. Schon jetzt ist die Stimmung an den Märkten deutlich optimistischer als noch vor einer Woche. Finanzminister bremst Erwartungen Trotz der Euphorie trat Finanzminister Scott Bessent auf die Bremse. In einem Fernsehinterview erklärte er, dass die angekündigte „Dividende“ möglicherweise keine direkten Schecks, sondern Steuererleichterungen sein könnten. Das würde zwar weniger sofortiges Geld in Umlauf bringen, aber immer noch die Kaufkraft stärken. Auch wenn die Maßnahmen kleiner ausfallen könnten, bleibt der positive Effekt auf die Stimmung bestehen. Viele Anleger hoffen weiterhin auf Impulse, die direkt in die Wirtschaft fließen. Der Kryptomarkt reagiert sensibel auf solche Zeichen – und hat den Optimismus bereits eingepreist. Ausblick: Wie weit kann Bitcoin noch steigen? Analysten blicken nun gespannt auf die kommenden Wochen. Wenn der Shutdown tatsächlich bald endet, erwarten viele eine Fortsetzung der Rally. Jay Jo von Tiger Research rechnet mit weiter steigenden Kursen, falls zusätzlich Finanzhilfen fließen. Mehr Liquidität im Markt bedeutet oft steigende Nachfrage – auch bei Kryptowährungen. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Trotzdem mahnen Experten zur Vorsicht. Eine anhaltend hohe Inflation, geopolitische Spannungen oder ein stärkerer Dollar könnten den Aufschwung abbremsen. Dennoch bleiben die Prognosen ehrgeizig : Tiger Research sieht BTC zum Jahresende bei bis zu 200.000 Dollar, während Bitget eine Spanne zwischen 90.000 und 160.000 Dollar erwartet. Viel hängt davon ab, wie die US-Notenbank ihre Zinspolitik gestaltet. BTC Hyper: Mehr technische Tiefe, mehr Zukunftschancen Der Kryptomarkt steht vor einer spannenden Wende: Mit dem angekündigten Ende des drohenden US-Government Shutdowns kommt neues Vertrauen in die Märkte, und besonders bei Bitcoin (BTC) könnte damit eine neue Ära beginnen. BTC hat sich als sicherer Hafen etabliert – durch seine Dezentralität, starke Netzwerksicherheit und breite institutionelle Akzeptanz. Genau darauf setzt Bitcoin Hyper auf: Es greift die Stärke von Bitcoin auf und kombiniert sie mit modernster Technik. Bitcoin Hyper verwendet die Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) – eine leistungsstarke Blockchain-Engine, bekannt für hohe Transaktionsraten – und verbindet diese mit Bitcoins Sicherheitsanker. Über eine sogenannte Canonical Bridge wird BTC auf Layer 1 gesichert, gleichzeitig wird auf der Layer-2-Kette von Hyper eine Wrapped-Version erstellt, die dann blitzschnell, günstig und in hoher Zahl bewegt werden kann. Damit werden Smart Contracts, dApps, DeFi-Funktionen und Zahlungsanwendungen möglich – Dinge, die Bitcoin alleine bislang technisch limitiert sind. Langfristige Perspektive: Wenn Bitcoin gewinnt, könnte Bitcoin Hyper mitziehen Wenn Bitcoin durch institutionelle Investments, ETFs und eine gestiegene Marktakzeptanz weiter an Bedeutung gewinnt – und die kürzlich positive politische Signalgebung in den USA ein solches Umfeld begünstigt –, dann wächst nicht nur der Wert von BTC, sondern auch das Ökosystem rund um BTC. Hyper steht genau in diesem Ökosystem: Es bietet die technische Erweiterung, die Bitcoin braucht, um von Wertaufbewahrung zu aktiver Nutzung überzugehen. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! Mit dem Ausbau von BTC als stabiler Wertanlage und Zahlungsnetzwerk steigt auch der Bedarf nach Lösungen, die Bitcoin nutzbar machen – nicht nur als digitales Gold, sondern als Funktion in echten Anwendungen. Insofern ergibt sich für Hyper ein langfristiges Potenzial: Wenn Bitcoin wächst, gewinnt auch die Infrastruktur – und $HYPER als Token dieser Infrastruktur – an Bedeutung, Nutzen und damit potenzieller Performance. Natürlich gilt: Jede Investition bringt Risiken mit sich und technische Versprechen müssen sich erst in der Praxis bewähren.

Die XRP-Community feiert das als lange erwartete Anerkennung durch die Wall Street. Doch Experten fragen sich, ob die Worte wirklich für das ganze Unternehmen BlackRock gelten. Was viele Krypto-Fans seit Jahren hoffen, scheint nun Wirklichkeit zu werden: Die großen Finanzhäuser öffnen sich der Blockchain-Technologie. Auf der Ripple Swell 2025 Konferenz sprach ein BlackRock-Manager offen über Ripples Bedeutung – und brachte damit die XRP-Gemeinschaft in Feierlaune. Doch hinter der Euphorie stehen noch einige Fragezeichen. BlackRock spricht über Ripple und die Zukunft der Blockchain Die Ripple Swell 2025 Konferenz in New York hat einen Moment geschaffen, der vielen in Erinnerung bleiben wird. Maxwell Stein, Mitglied des Digital-Assets-Teams von BlackRock, sprach auf der Bühne über die Zukunft der Finanzwelt – und über Ripple. Er sagte, der Markt sei nun bereit, Blockchain im großen Stil einzusetzen. Dabei lobte er Ripple als wichtigen Teil dieser Entwicklung. Stein erklärte, dass Ripple bereits Anleihen, Stablecoins und andere Vermögenswerte auf der Blockchain abgebildet habe. Diese Technologie könne bald Kapitalströme in Billionenhöhe bewegen. Für viele im Publikum klang das wie der Beweis, dass Blockchain nicht mehr nur ein Traum, sondern Realität ist – und Ripple einer der Motoren dieser Bewegung. XRP-Community feiert den großen Moment Für die Anhänger von XRP war diese Aussage fast wie ein Ritterschlag. Jahrelang wurde Ripple als Nischenprojekt belächelt. Nun lobt einer der größten Finanzverwalter der Welt öffentlich seine Arbeit. Die Stimmung in der Community war entsprechend ausgelassen. BREAKING: White House Crypto Chief Says “Bitcoin Is Not XRP” — and “Tens of Trillions Are Coming by The Year End” at Ripple Swell This might’ve been the most electric interview of @Ripple Swell 2025. Ripple CEO @bgarlinghouse sat across from @patrickjwitt Executive… pic.twitter.com/EUy3QGxus5 — Diana (@InvestWithD) November 5, 2025 Auf der Plattform X (früher Twitter) verbreiteten sich begeisterte Posts im Minutentakt. Viele nannten Steins Worte den Beweis, dass XRP endlich ernst genommen wird. Für sie war es ein Symbol: Die Brücke zwischen alter Finanzwelt und neuer Blockchain-Ökonomie ist nicht mehr nur Theorie – sie entsteht gerade. Von Experiment zu Standard: Blockchain wird ernst genommen Steins Worte zeigten auch, wie sehr sich die Sicht auf Blockchain verändert hat. Noch vor wenigen Jahren galt sie als riskante Spielerei für Technik-Freaks. Heute sprechen führende Finanzmanager von ihr als kommender Standard. BlackRock hat damit – gewollt oder nicht – eine neue Botschaft gesendet: Die Zeit des Zögerns ist vorbei. Ripple wird so immer mehr zu einem Symbol für den Wandel. Statt nur Transaktionen in der Krypto-Welt zu ermöglichen, arbeitet das Unternehmen daran, die Finanzinfrastruktur selbst zu verändern. Was früher utopisch klang, könnte bald Alltag sein: globale Geldströme, die über Blockchain laufen. Rechtliche Fragen bremsen den Jubel Nicht alle sehen das Lob so unkritisch. Der australische Anwalt und XRP-Fan Bill Morgan fragte öffentlich, ob Stein im Namen von BlackRock oder nur privat gesprochen habe. Diese Frage ist wichtig, denn eine offizielle Stellungnahme von BlackRock wäre ein starkes Signal für die gesamte Branche.

Minutes after the interview, analysts spotted… pic.twitter.com/3pGoI5WPrx — COACHTY (@TheRealTRTalks) November 10, 2025 Sollte es sich aber nur um eine persönliche Meinung handeln, bleibt die Bedeutung begrenzt – auch wenn sie symbolisch wichtig ist. Viele Beobachter weisen darauf hin, dass rechtliche Unsicherheit weiterhin eine Hürde bleibt. Zwischen Begeisterung und Realität liegt noch ein weiter Weg. Regulierung als Schlüssel für die Zukunft Auch Adena Friedman, die Chefin der Nasdaq, sprach auf der Konferenz über den Reifeprozess des Marktes. Sie sagte, dass die Finanzwelt zwar interessiert sei, aber noch klare Regeln brauche, bevor sie voll einsteigen könne. Banken testen bereits tokenisierte Anleihen und Stablecoins, doch ohne eindeutige Gesetze bleibt das Risiko groß. Ihre Worte erinnerten daran, dass technologische Fortschritte allein nicht reichen. Vertrauen und Regulierung sind nötig, damit Institutionen wirklich aufspringen. Die Swell 2025 zeigte damit nicht nur Begeisterung, sondern auch die Hürden auf dem Weg zur echten Integration von Blockchain in die Finanzwelt. Fazit: Ripple steht im Rampenlicht – aber der Weg ist noch lang Die Swell 2025 machte deutlich, dass Ripple längst kein Außenseiter mehr ist. Mit der Unterstützung eines BlackRock-Managers hat das Unternehmen einen Meilenstein erreicht. Doch der Krypto-Markt bleibt volatil: Der XRP-Preis fiel zuletzt um über vier Prozent auf 2,21 US-Dollar. Trotzdem scheint der Trend klar. Blockchain ist dabei, die Finanzwelt zu verändern – und Ripple ist mittendrin. Was als Vision begann, wird Schritt für Schritt Wirklichkeit. Vielleicht war die Swell 2025 der Moment, in dem die Finanzelite begriff, dass Blockchain gekommen ist, um zu bleiben. Bitcoin Hyper: Gewinner einer neuen Phase der Krypto-Adoption Die zunehmende Institutionalisierung von Ripple (XRP) zeigt, dass Kryptowährungen endgültig in der Finanzwelt angekommen sind. Immer mehr Banken und große Investoren nutzen Ripple, um internationale Zahlungen schneller und günstiger abzuwickeln. Das stärkt das Vertrauen in die gesamte Branche – und besonders in Bitcoin, der für viele weiterhin das sicherste und verlässlichste Krypto-Asset bleibt. Wenn Banken und Institutionen verstärkt auf Blockchain-Technologie setzen, steigt auch die Nachfrage nach Bitcoin als digitales Wertaufbewahrungsmittel. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! Bitcoin Hyper: Aufgebaut auf Vertrauen und Innovation Bitcoin Hyper ist eng mit Bitcoin verbunden und profitiert von diesem wachsenden Vertrauen. Das Projekt nutzt die Sicherheit des Bitcoin-Netzwerks und kombiniert sie mit der Geschwindigkeit und Flexibilität von Solana. So entsteht eine Erweiterung, die Bitcoin nicht ersetzt, sondern verbessert: schnellere Transaktionen, geringere Gebühren und echte Alltagstauglichkeit. Wenn durch Ripple immer mehr institutionelle Investoren und Banken in den Kryptomarkt einsteigen, wächst auch die Bedeutung von Bitcoin – und damit die Chancen für Bitcoin Hyper, als moderne und praktische Ergänzung mitzuwachsen.

But beneath the surface of this seemingly straightforward enterprise AI expansion lies a disturbing pattern of circular money flows that could undermine the entire AI investment ecosystem. As cryptocurrency investors who understand real economic value creation, we need to ask: are these massive AI deals generating genuine innovation or just moving capital in circles? What Are AI Investments Really Creating? The SoftBank-OpenAI partnership represents more than just another corporate collaboration. SoftBank, already a major investor in OpenAI through its Vision Fund, is now both investor and customer in the same ecosystem. This creates a troubling scenario where investment returns might be artificially inflated through internal transactions rather than genuine market demand. The SoftBank OpenAI Partnership Breakdown The Crystal Intelligence joint venture aims to sell enterprise AI tools in Japan, but the financial structure reveals deeper complexities: SoftBank invests in OpenAI through Vision Fund OpenAI forms joint venture with SoftBank SoftBank becomes both investor and primary customer Revenue flows back to OpenAI, potentially boosting valuation Circular Money Flows in Major AI Deals This pattern isn’t unique to SoftBank and OpenAI. Several major AI investments show similar circular characteristics: Company Investment Structure Circular Elements Microsoft-OpenAI Strategic partnership with equity Microsoft both invests and uses services Amazon-Anthropic Cloud credits for equity Revenue flows back through AWS usage Google-Various AI Startups Investment plus cloud partnerships Multiple circular revenue streams Measuring Real Economic Value in AI Genuine economic value creation in AI should demonstrate: Independent customer adoption beyond investors Clear productivity improvements for end-users Sustainable revenue models not dependent on circular flows Tangible cost savings or revenue generation Enterprise AI Adoption Challenges While Crystal Intelligence targets Japanese enterprises, real adoption faces significant hurdles: Integration complexity with existing systems Data privacy and security concerns ROI measurement difficulties Employee training and change management The Future of AI Investment Sustainability The current circular money patterns raise serious questions about long-term sustainability. As cryptocurrency investors know from previous market cycles, artificial valuation inflation eventually corrects. The AI sector must transition from circular investments to genuine value creation to avoid a similar fate. FAQs About AI Investments and Circular Money What is SoftBank’s investment history with OpenAI? SoftBank has invested significantly in OpenAI through its Vision Fund , creating the circular money concerns discussed in this article. How does the OpenAI partnership with Microsoft compare? OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft shows similar circular characteristics, with Microsoft being both investor and primary cloud provider. What is the Crystal Intelligence joint venture? Crystal Intelligence is the 50-50 joint venture between SoftBank and OpenAI focused on enterprise AI tools in the Japanese market. How can investors identify circular money patterns? Look for investments where the same entities appear as both investors and customers, creating artificial revenue streams that don’t represent genuine market demand. What are the risks of circular AI investments? The primary risk is valuation inflation based on artificial metrics, which can lead to significant corrections when genuine market demand fails to materialize. The circular money problem in AI investments represents a fundamental challenge to the sector’s long-term viability. As we’ve seen in cryptocurrency markets, artificial valuation inflation eventually meets reality. The AI industry must prioritize genuine economic value creation over financial engineering to avoid repeating history’s investment mistakes.

For XRP holders, the shift could prove pivotal. As the Fed prepares to inject fresh reserves, the XRP could once again benefit from an environment of expanding liquidity and easing financial conditions. XRP holders are paying close attention as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signals that the Fed will soon add reserves to its balance sheet, subtly setting the stage for the next phase of US monetary policy where digital reserves are not optional. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull has noted on X that President Donald Trump had recently mentioned that the US maintains a crypto stockpile, and XRP was among the assets held. Why Fed Reserve Growth Could Be The Spark XRP Has Been Waiting For The claims that Ripple is not just another startup, but a US-born solution to a quadrillion-dollar global payment challenge. This infrastructure is led by individuals who have met with presidents and policy architects like Brad Garlinghouse and Stuart Alderoty. Meanwhile, XRP has already held legal clarity and enterprise utility in the US. “What if XRP is not merely surviving regulation, but being positioned for integration?” XFinanceBull asked.

A publisher, Wilberforce Theophilus, highlighted that the Ripple XRP US patent number 10,902,416, and the US patent number 11,998,003 make XRP the undisputed cryptocurrency in the world. The publisher predicts that the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will eventually rest on the Chainlink ledger, and every asset will be hosted on the XRPL. At the same time, LINEA will serve as the secure messaging system connecting banks, while HBAR will provide the security layer that will underpin the entire network. These protocols form a coordinated framework to position XRP as the reserve asset currency, and its market capitalization could multiply exponentially. XRP was designed to replace the old financial system. Theophilus concluded that “once everything is properly positioned, individuals will be glad they joined crypto at this stage,” and he will be writing on why there are several regulations coming from the white house.” How XRP Is Inheriting The World’s Payment Rails The XRP Ledger is entering an unexpected moment that the crypto market has not seen before. JackTheRippler has stated that XRP holders should pay attention that the true value is about to be unlocked beyond imagination. He claims that a clear view of what’s unfolding will provide insights into why $10,000 and even $35,000 per XRP is not just a fantasy, but is entirely possible.

54250815,624642,1762819258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54250815.jpeg,"Old Bitcoin Whales Exit, New Whales Enter — The Market’s Natural Rotation in Action",https://bitcoinist.com/old-bitcoin-whales-exit-new-whales-enter-rotation/,"Bitcoin is showing early signs of recovery after last week’s sharp dip below the $100,000 mark. Bulls have managed to hold the line, but momentum remains cautious as the market digests a complex mix of profit-taking and structural change. According to top analyst Darkfost, the recent selling activity among long-term holders — or “old whales” — is not necessarily a bearish sign but a natural part of the market’s evolution. “Yes, it’s true that many old whales are waking up and selling,” Darkfost explains. “But that’s happening simply because they can now.” In previous cycles, Bitcoin’s smaller market capitalization and lack of deep institutional liquidity made it difficult for large holders to exit without causing severe price disruptions. Now, thanks to the growth of ETFs, deep asset tokenization (DAT), and even government-level participation, these investors can offload large amounts of BTC more efficiently. This ongoing distribution phase is seen as a healthy process that redistributes coins across new market participants, building a stronger, more liquid foundation for the next leg of growth. While short-term volatility persists, analysts argue that this transition reflects a maturing Bitcoin ecosystem capable of absorbing large flows without structural damage. Whales Resume Accumulation After Temporary Distribution According to Darkfost, the broader on-chain picture reveals that Bitcoin’s whales — large entities holding significant BTC balances — remain active participants in this cycle, and many continue to accumulate. The 1-Year Change in Whale Holdings , a key long-term metric, has been steadily increasing since 2023, suggesting that despite recent volatility and headline-driven fear, large players are not abandoning the market. Zooming into recent activity, however, the data tells a nuanced story. After a strong August rally, when Bitcoin climbed toward $123,000, whale holdings experienced a sharp drawdown — falling from roughly 398,000 BTC to 185,000 BTC by October. This period aligned with profit-taking and renewed selling from older cohorts, as prices reached psychologically significant resistance zones. Yet, by early November, the trend shifted again. Whale accumulation resumed, with holdings rising to about 294,000 BTC. This rebound suggests that while some early whales are distributing, a new wave of capital — possibly institutional or strategic investors — is entering the market at these levels. Darkfost emphasizes that this structure is very different from the late 2021 distribution phase, which preceded a prolonged bear market. Instead, the current cycle reflects a rotational accumulation process, where selling by older whales is offset by steady demand from newer, high-conviction participants. This dynamic points to an evolving, more mature Bitcoin market capable of absorbing distribution without triggering systemic weakness. Bitcoin Regains Ground After Sharp Correction Bitcoin is showing early signs of strength after last week’s sharp correction pushed prices briefly below the $100,000 level. On the 4-hour chart, BTC has rebounded firmly, reclaiming the $106,000 area after forming a short-term base near $101,000. This recovery follows a period of heavy selling pressure, which flushed out over-leveraged traders and helped reset market positioning. Price action now shows BTC testing the $106,500–$107,000 resistance zone, which aligns with a previous local breakdown point from early November. A confirmed breakout above this level could open the door for a move toward $110,000, though volume remains modest, signaling cautious participation from traders. On the downside, $103,000 serves as immediate support, while a more significant demand zone lies between $100,000–$101,000, where buyers previously defended the market with high volume. Holding this range would reinforce the case for a gradual recovery.

This explosive growth represents more than just numbers—it’s transforming how businesses innovate and compete in the AI era. How Lovable AI Coding is Reshaping Corporate Innovation The Stockholm-based platform has seen user numbers surge from 2.3 million active users in July to nearly 8 million today, representing one of the fastest-growing AI tools in history. What’s driving this massive adoption? According to CEO Anton Osika, it’s the platform’s ability to democratize software creation for the 99% of people who don’t know how to code. Startup Growth That Defies Expectations Lovable’s metrics tell a story of unprecedented startup growth: 100,000 new products built daily on the platform $228 million in total funding raised $1.8 billion valuation from recent $200 million round Rumors of potential $5 billion valuation from new investors Despite questions about the sustainability of the vibe coding trend, Osika points to strong retention metrics, including more than 100% net dollar retention, indicating users are spending more over time. Corporate Employees Driving Enterprise Adoption The platform’s user base spans from Fortune 500 companies to individual creators. More than half of Fortune 500 companies now use Lovable to “supercharge creativity” among their corporate employees. The platform enables rapid prototyping, allowing teams to test ideas with users before committing significant resources.

This increase follows the announcement that the company’s assets under management have escalated by 76%, reaching a total of $20.8 billion for the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Apart from this report, eToro made public a 28% surge in net contribution, reaching $215 million. Reports indicated that this figure is up from $167 million recorded the previous year. Additionally, the eToro board approved a share repurchase plan of up to $150 million, including an initial accelerated tranche of approximately $50 million. eToro shifts its focus towards developing new products and innovations eToro’s net income following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a set of standardized regulations and guidelines for financial accounting and reporting used in the United States, soared by 48% to reach $57 million. On the other hand, the number of funded accounts increased by 16%, attaining a total of 3.73 million. This growth was partly attributed to the integration of Australia’s Spaceship app, a micro-investing and wealth management application. Following these moves, reports dated Monday, November 10, revealed that eToro’s stock climbed about 7% during intraday trading on Nasdaq. This was after the company’s users made 5 million cryptocurrency trades last month. The cryptocurrency trades marked an increase from the same time last year. In the meantime, the average investment for each trade skyrocketed by 52% to reach $320 while interest-earning assets grew to $8.7 billion, demonstrating a 55% year-over-year increase. In light of this significant accomplishment, eToro sought to generate further excitement in the crypto ecosystem with news of the launch of its crypto wallet. According to the company, the introduction is expected within the next few quarters. According to reliable sources, this crypto wallet will provide users with access to tokenization, lending products, and prediction markets. Yoni Assia, the CEO of eToro, commented on the topic of discussion. Assia outlined the company’s current focus, stating that its goal is to develop new products and embrace innovations. Concerning innovation, the CEO stated that eToro will particularly focus on sectors such as AI and copy trading. To demonstrate the company’s commitment to solidifying its position as a leader in finance, eToro recently launched Tori, an AI-driven analyst that offers customized investment insight. Trump’s pro-crypto stance encourages eToro to explore the crypto ecosystem In September 2024, eToro ceased trading most cryptocurrencies in the US following a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also stated that it had agreed to pay $1.5 million to resolve allegations that it operated an unregistered brokerage and clearing agency through its cryptocurrency platform. However, following the growing adoption of cryptocurrency among nations, analysts realized that the perspective towards crypto has gradually changed. Their finding was released after it was discovered that the US government’s view on digital assets had evolved since eToro’s incident. Sources acknowledged that President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance is behind this positive change in perspective towards the crypto world. Trump had pledged to make his country a world leader in developing crypto and AI innovation. In September, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said, “most crypto tokens are not securities.” These efforts created a conducive environment for crypto-related activities. As a result, eToro outlined plans to tokenize 100 top US-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on ERC-20 tokens, which will be available for 24/7 trading on the Ethereum blockchain starting in July. The news came after Robinhood launched a layer-2 network on Arbitrum to tokenize US stocks, allowing European investors to trade over 200 tokenized equities and ETFs, available 24/5.

The number beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.29 billion, based on figures from LSEG. But despite the revenue surge, the company still recorded a net loss of $110 million, though that’s down significantly from the $360 million loss CoreWeave reported in Q3 last year. Earnings for the quarter came in at a loss of 22 cents per share. The numbers reflect a company growing fast, spending hard, and trying to prove it belongs at the center of the AI infrastructure race. The business, headquartered in the U.S., rents out Nvidia GPUs to companies building out AI tools. CoreWeave has secured customers like Google and Microsoft, both of whom rely heavily on the compute power it provides. That demand helped balloon CoreWeave’s contract backlog to $55.6 billion, up from $42.3 billion just three months earlier. The company also reported having 2.9 gigawatts of contracted power, up from 2.2 gigawatts at the end of Q2. Deals with OpenAI and Meta push backlog past $55 billion In Q3, CoreWeave announced a $6.5 billion expansion of its contract with OpenAI, a company known for developing ChatGPT. It also signed a new six-year agreement with Meta worth up to $14.2 billion. These deals, alongside a new contract signed with what CoreWeave called “a leading hyperscaler”, are what pushed the revenue backlog up by over 30% in a single quarter. The name of that sixth hyperscaler was not disclosed. CoreWeave’s public debut came earlier this year, when it listed on the Nasdaq in March, selling shares at $40 each. On Monday, those same shares closed at $105.61, reflecting a 164% return since the IPO. That’s more than five times the 32% gain in the Nasdaq index during the same stretch. But even with that performance, CoreWeave’s stock dropped in extended trading after the earnings were released. The company tried to expand further in Q3 with a $9 billion proposed acquisition of data center infrastructure operator Core Scientific. But that plan collapsed after Core Scientific’s shareholders voted against it. That rejection left CoreWeave without a key expansion path, despite the momentum it had been building. Michael Intrator, who co-founded CoreWeave and now serves as both CEO and Chairman, said the company had delivered “an exceptional third quarter” and praised its team for hitting new records. “We almost doubled our revenue backlog to more than $55 billion,” Michael said in the earnings release. He added that the company was growing by focusing on infrastructure, capacity, customer expansion, and new software tools. Kerrisdale Capital attacks CoreWeave’s valuation and revenue model Not everyone is impressed. Kerrisdale Capital, a New York-based short seller, published a scathing report last month accusing CoreWeave of being “the poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble.” They dismissed the company’s growth as cosmetic, writing that CoreWeave is nothing more than “an undifferentiated, heavily levered GPU rental scheme.” In the report, Kerrisdale criticized CoreWeave for being overly reliant on Microsoft, which they claimed accounts for 70% of the company’s revenue. The firm also said Microsoft had recently declined to extend its business with CoreWeave, choosing instead to sign a larger contract with Nebius, a competitor. Kerrisdale described this customer concentration as a serious risk for investors. They also pointed to CoreWeave’s rapid transformation from a crypto mining startup in a founder’s grandfather’s garage, just three years ago, to a self-declared “AI hyperscaler” now valued at $75 billion. Kerrisdale said this jump lacked financial support and sustainability. The short seller went further, slamming CoreWeave’s economics. Their report stated the company “generates returns below its cost of capital,” which they said results in destroying shareholder value instead of creating it. They assigned a fair value target of $10 per share, a number that would imply a 90% drop from the current trading price. CoreWeave has not publicly addressed the Kerrisdale report in detail. But with deals stacking up and critics circling, the company is now caught between wild growth and deep skepticism.

The move has generated a lot of buzz within the crypto community as it finally addresses long-standing restrictions that had limited ETPs’ ability to generate and on-chain yields to potential customers. Today @USTreasury and the @IRSnews issued new guidance giving crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) a clear path to stake digital assets and share staking rewards with their retail investors. This move increases investor benefits, boosts innovation, and keeps America the… — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) November 10, 2025 Treasury Secretary makes the announcement The guidance was announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent via a post on X, and it laid emphasis on how the move gives ETP issuers a “clear path” to stake digital assets on behalf of their holders. In the past, the U.S. limited how ETPs could generate on-chain yield, restricting them primarily to holding spot assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, the new guidance changes that as it effectively allows issuers to provide staking-based returns—similar to how traditional funds offer dividends—while ensuring transparency and accountability. Industry analysts expect the move to accelerate institutional adoption of proof-of-stake assets and stimulate demand for staking-based ETPs . It also places the United States ahead of other major financial jurisdictions in formalizing staking within its regulatory perimeter. According to Bessent, the policy is a significant step toward expanding investor participation in digital assets without compromising on oversight. “This move increases investor benefits, boosts innovation, and keeps America the global leader in digital asset and blockchain technology,” he wrote. The announcement comes as the U.S. inches towards ending the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Record-breaking U.S. government shutdown nears end As of the time of this writing, the government shutdown in the U.S. has lasted 41 days, beating the previous record of 35 days, which was set over five years ago, but there is now an end in sight. Late on Sunday, November 9, the Senate advanced a bipartisan compromise bill in a key procedural vote, the first major breakthrough after 14 failed attempts, which paves the way for the government to reopen as soon as later this week. “After 40 long days, I’m hopeful we can bring this shutdown to an end,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said shortly before the vote. The 60-40 vote to take the first step toward ending the shutdown came hours after a considerable number of Democrats agreed to support a package that would fund multiple agencies and programs for the full fiscal year, and all others until January 30, 2026. In exchange, the Trump administration promised to rehire government workers fired at the start of the funding lapse, and the promise of a Senate floor vote in December on legislation to extend expiring Obamacare tax credits. As uncertainty thaws in response to the bill advancing, confidence can be expected to slowly return. Already, cryptocurrencies have been showing signs of a rebound, with Bitcoin showing strength and altcoins like Ethereum, Solana , and Avalanche showing signs of recovery from earlier declines. The treasury’s move could further strengthen the recovery, as market observers have suggested the new announcement could drive significant inflows into upcoming Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano-based funds, potentially reshaping how crypto investment products operate in the U.S. Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Regulation|ETPs|U.S Treasury,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-11 00:25:44

The revolutionary Coinbase savings account has arrived in the United Kingdom, bringing crypto convenience to everyday banking with impressive 3.75% variable interest rates. What Makes the Coinbase Savings Account Special? Coinbase has officially launched its highly anticipated savings product for selected UK users. This innovative Coinbase savings account represents a significant step in bridging traditional finance with digital asset convenience. The platform leverages infrastructure from established payments firm ClearBank to ensure reliability and security. Unlike conventional savings options, this Coinbase savings account offers daily interest payments without locking up your funds. The variable annual percentage rate currently stands at 3.75%, significantly higher than most high street banks. Moreover, there are no minimum deposit requirements, making it accessible to savers at all levels. How Does the Coinbase Savings Account Protect Your Money? Security remains paramount when considering any financial product. The Coinbase savings account provides substantial protection through the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This government-backed insurance covers deposits up to £85,000, matching the security levels of traditional UK banks. The account features several key benefits: Instant deposits and withdrawals with no lock-up periods Daily interest payments calculated on your balance No minimum deposit requirements Full FSCS protection up to £85,000 Seamless integration with existing Coinbase services Who Can Access This Revolutionary Savings Option?

Eligible customers receive notifications within their Coinbase applications inviting them to open accounts. The selection criteria consider factors like account history, verification status, and geographic location. However, Coinbase plans to expand access gradually to all qualified UK residents. This measured expansion demonstrates the company’s commitment to responsible financial innovation. Why Choose a Crypto-Based Savings Account? Traditional banking often fails to keep pace with digital innovation. The Coinbase savings account bridges this gap by combining crypto-platform efficiency with familiar banking security. The 3.75% variable rate substantially outperforms most conventional savings accounts while maintaining equivalent protection. Furthermore, the absence of minimum deposits and instant access to funds provides unprecedented flexibility. Savers can adjust their holdings according to changing financial needs without penalties or processing delays. This responsiveness represents a significant advantage over traditional savings vehicles. What Does This Mean for UK Savers? The introduction of the Coinbase savings account signals a transformative shift in UK personal finance. It demonstrates how cryptocurrency platforms can expand beyond trading into mainstream financial services. This development potentially heralds increased competition and better options for British consumers. As digital assets gain wider acceptance, products like the Coinbase savings account help normalize crypto services while addressing consumer concerns about security and reliability. The FSCS protection particularly reassures cautious savers considering alternative financial platforms. Final Thoughts on Coinbase’s UK Savings Innovation The Coinbase savings account represents a bold step toward integrating digital asset platforms with traditional financial security. With competitive interest rates, robust protection, and user-friendly features, it offers UK savers an attractive alternative to conventional banking options.

The Altcoin Season Index just dropped to 30, indicating a significant shift in market dynamics. This crucial metric helps investors understand whether altcoins or Bitcoin are leading the charge – and right now, the numbers tell a compelling story. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as your market compass. It measures how the top 100 cryptocurrencies perform against Bitcoin over 90 days. This calculation excludes stablecoins and wrapped coins to give you pure performance data. When 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin, we officially enter altcoin season. Think of the index as a market thermometer. Scores closer to 100 signal strong altcoin momentum, while lower numbers like today’s 30 indicate Bitcoin dominance. The recent one-point drop might seem small, but it reflects broader market sentiment shifts that could impact your investment decisions. Why Should You Care About This Index Drop? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index helps you make smarter investment choices. The drop to 30 suggests that Bitcoin is currently outperforming most alternative cryptocurrencies. This information becomes valuable when you’re deciding where to allocate your funds. Market Timing : Helps identify optimal entry points Risk Assessment : Indicates overall market sentiment Portfolio Strategy : Guides asset allocation decisions Trend Identification : Shows broader market movements Many experienced traders watch this index closely because it often precedes significant price movements. The current reading suggests caution for altcoin investors and potential opportunities for Bitcoin-focused strategies. How Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Work? CoinMarketCap calculates this index by comparing price performance across multiple timeframes. The system tracks whether each of the top 100 cryptocurrencies has outperformed Bitcoin during the measurement period. This methodology ensures you get a comprehensive view of market leadership. The index uses a simple but effective approach: it counts how many altcoins beat Bitcoin’s returns. When the majority succeed, we see higher index values. The current score of 30 means only about 30% of top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin – a clear signal of changing conditions. What Can We Learn From Current Market Conditions? The declining Altcoin Season Index often correlates with increased Bitcoin dominance. This pattern typically occurs when investors seek safety in established cryptocurrencies during uncertain market periods. However, remember that crypto markets are highly volatile, and conditions can change rapidly. Historical data shows that low index readings sometimes precede strong altcoin rallies. Savvy investors use these periods to research promising projects and prepare for potential market shifts. The key is maintaining a balanced perspective and not making impulsive decisions based on single data points. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So what should you do with this information? First, understand that the Altcoin Season Index is just one tool among many. Combine it with other indicators and your investment strategy. Consider these practical steps: Diversify Wisely : Don’t abandon altcoins completely Monitor Closely : Watch for index trends, not just single readings Research Thoroughly : Identify strong projects during quieter periods Set Alerts : Track when the index crosses key thresholds Remember that successful crypto investing requires patience and multiple data sources. The Altcoin Season Index provides valuable context, but it shouldn’t dictate your entire strategy. Final Thoughts: Navigating the Crypto Landscape The Altcoin Season Index dropping to 30 signals a market in transition. While Bitcoin currently shows strength, crypto history teaches us that conditions can change unexpectedly. The most successful investors maintain flexibility and use tools like this index to inform rather than control their decisions. Stay informed, stay diversified, and remember that market metrics are guides, not guarantees. The current Altcoin Season Index reading suggests careful evaluation of your portfolio and potential adjustment of your risk management strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What does the Altcoin Season Index measure? The index compares the performance of top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over 90 days, excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins. How often does CoinMarketCap update this index? They update it regularly, typically daily, to reflect current market conditions and price movements. What score indicates a true altcoin season?

Use the index as one of many factors in your decision-making process rather than making impulsive moves. Can the index predict future price movements? While it indicates current trends, it cannot guarantee future performance. Always combine it with other analysis methods. Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index?

Related Reading: Trump’s Bitcoin Bet Grows: American Bitcoin Now Holds Over 4,000 BTC The plan would pay at least $2,000 to most adults and has been described as part of a broader push to use tariff receipts for direct payments. Tariff Dividend Sparks Market Moves According to reports, the proposal is being presented as a way to convert tariff revenue into direct payments to citizens, with proponents linking the move to stronger consumer spending and higher risk appetite among investors. Trump said the government could afford the new payout because tariffs had brought in massive revenue and because factories across the country were attracting record levels of investment. He mentioned that the money would go to most Americans, except those earning higher incomes. “People that are against tariffs are fools,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post. “We are taking in trillions of dollars and will soon begin paying down our enormous debt, $37 trillion.” Trump also pointed to record highs in 401(k) savings and the stock market, saying tariffs helped the economy grow instead of slowing it down. The figure being cited publicly as backing for the program is about $400 billion, though analysts and budget experts say the math and legal pathway remain unclear. Crypto Prices Tick Higher The cryptocurrency market reacted within hours following news of the dividend. Bitcoin climbed above $106,000, while Ether moved into the mid-thousands, reflecting a short, sharp lift in sentiment among traders who expect fresh liquidity could flow into risk assets. These price moves followed a week when some crypto indexes had fallen sharply, so the announcement helped reverse part of that pullback. Market watchers said the reaction was driven more by sentiment than by a confirmed funding mechanism. Some commentators compared the potential effect to past stimulus checks, noting that when households get direct dividend payments they often boost spending and, in some cases, channel money into markets. Still, regulators and budget experts are asking how the plan would work under existing law and whether tariff receipts are a reliable source for recurring payouts.

Volume spiked on some platforms as short-term buyers tried to ride the sentiment. Observers cautioned that rallies tied to political announcements can be volatile and may fade if the policy stalls in Congress or runs into legal challenges. Legal and political questions are front and center. Treasury officials have suggested parts of the payout could be handled through tax changes already on the books, while court challenges over the scope of tariff powers may complicate any quick roll-out.

The analyst, known for his bullish takes on XRP, says the cryptocurrency is still “missing the fifth wave,” implying that the next leg could push its price far into new all-time highs. Despite recent consolidation just above $2.2, Elliott Wave projections show that the cryptocurrency is only just gathering strength before launching into price targets as high as $27. XRP Is Still Missing Its 5th Wave EGRAG CRYPTO’s latest update on X presents XRP’s price action within an extended five-wave structure typical of the Elliott Wave Theory. His analysis, which was done on the 5-day timeframe chart, proposes that XRP is currently completing a fourth impulsive wave, which is a corrective period that leads to massive bullish extensions. In his words, the “Power of 5” is about to unfold, setting up what he expects to be the “most explosive fifth wave yet.” The historical context highlighted by the analyst supports his claim. Similar fourth corrective wave patterns in 2017 and 2021 preceded XRP’s strongest rallies, each time occurring after a lengthy consolidation. Furthermore, EGRAG’s chart highlights repeating cycles of impulse and correction, highlighted by cyan and pink EMA bands that have consistently acted as support zones before a rally. The current setup shows XRP is holding above its support zone, and bullish traders have prevented it from falling below $2.20. This successful hold suggests that the fourth wave might be nearing its end. Fibonacci Extensions Point To $27 Target According to EGRAG, the fifth wave is designed to break disbelief in the market. This is a stage where many traders bet against the trend only to get caught on the wrong side of history. His post referenced an infamous case of a trader who lost $30 million shorting XRP during its 2024 leg-up, using it as a reminder that history repeats itself. The technical projection is reinforced by Fibonacci extension levels plotted on EGRAG’s chart. The analyst’s framework identifies notable price resistance targets for the next leg higher, with the 1.272, 1.414, 1.618, and 2.618 extensions aligning around $4.78, $5.515, $6.755, and $18.25, respectively, while higher extensions extend to the $27 range. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.49 after rebounding from lows of $2.12 last week. The token has gained 9% in the past 24 hours, reflecting growing confidence among market participants as bullish setups begin to take shape. Despite market hesitation and low volatility across most cryptocurrencies, the entire market appears to be changing in conviction. At the time of writing, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased by about 4.4% over the past 24-hour period.",XRP|Egrag Crypto|Elliott Wave|Fibonacci Extension Level|ripple|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-11 01:00:33
