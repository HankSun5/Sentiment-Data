In other words, XRP’s liquidity reality may be far smaller than its theoretical supply, meaning smaller inflows of capital could trigger disproportionately large price reactions. Understanding the Market Cap Multiplier In a recent video, Jake Claver, managing partner at Digital Wealth Partners, tackled the growing debate head-on: “People look at total supply of XRP when, in reality, the supply-demand dynamics are going to be on the available supply of XRP,” he explained. This distinction — between XRP’s total supply of 100 billion and the much smaller circulating amount that actually trades — is at the heart of the multiplier effect. Let's look at what the XRP market cap multiplier effect means pic.twitter.com/5tiUdpHt6i — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 3, 2025 Claver illustrated this with a practical example: “There might be 2 billion XRP left on exchanges — probably less than that if you include retail and what they’re going to exit or sell.” He added that even if XRP’s price skyrockets to $10, $20, or even $50, some retail investors would inevitably sell portions of their holdings, adding perhaps another billion XRP to the liquid market. But that still represents a small share of total supply. The Math Behind the Multiplier Claver broke down the logic simply: “If you only had, let’s say, 2 billion [XRP] out of 100 billion, you’d be that 50x that Zach Rector talks about. It’s total supply versus available supply — and that’s why you get a shift in how much liquidity moving in is going to cause the market cap to rise in a multiplier effect.” When buyers enter the market, their demand impacts a smaller pool of available tokens, rather than the total supply. This limited float magnifies price movements, which in turn amplifies market capitalization faster than would occur in a fully distributed asset. Institutional Holdings and Market Liquidity Claver also revealed that his firm, Digital Wealth Partners, currently manages around 200 million XRP, accounting for roughly 8% of retail-owned XRP, based on his estimates. This institutional custody further concentrates holdings, reducing the amount of XRP readily available on exchanges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 “Retail doesn’t hold more than maybe 1.2 to 2 billion total XRP in my opinion,” he said, emphasizing that these liquidity dynamics are critical for understanding XRP’s future price behavior. Broader Context and Implications While the multiplier concept doesn’t change XRP’s total supply — which remains capped at 100 billion — it reframes how market participants should interpret liquidity and price discovery. Ripple’s monthly escrow releases , typically capped at 1 billion XRP, also control how much new supply enters circulation, keeping active liquidity relatively tight. The takeaway is clear: XRP’s potential price response is not purely a function of total supply, but of how much XRP is actually tradable. As Claver summarized, “It’s total supply versus available supply. That’s the reason there is a multiplier effect.” The XRP market cap multiplier effect shows how small changes in liquidity can lead to significant price movements. It’s not speculation — it’s a structural feature of how XRP trades in real-world conditions, where limited availability magnifies every dollar of demand that flows into the asset.

But what you've heard or seen so far doesn't necessarily align with what's actually coming out.” The company announced that the new program will be called MetaMask Rewards and will not be a farming-focused system. It was announced that more than $30 million in LINEA token rewards will be distributed in the first season (Season 1).

Timing is crucial: the best stories sync with industry cycles like regulation, restaking, or stablecoins. Syndication multiplies reach: one article can turn into dozens of pickups across CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, Yahoo Finance, and more. Long-term PR builds reputation and trust — moving projects from short-term hype to lasting influence. For many founders, PR begins and ends with a press release. You raise a round, launch a feature, or announce a partnership — so you send a statement to the media and hope it lands somewhere. But in crypto, where attention cycles move at breakneck speed and skepticism is the default, a press release alone rarely does the job. The projects that break through are the ones that treat PR not as a one-off announcement, but as a way to shape narratives, influence conversations, and build credibility over time. Crypto PR Turns Features Into Stories That Matter The crypto industry is littered with updates that sound alike: staking pools, wallet upgrades, bridge integrations. On their own, they blur together. What cuts through is when a feature becomes part of a bigger story. Take gas fees: no journalist is writing about a dashboard redesign. But if a protocol slashes fees at a time when high costs are throttling DeFi activity, that update suddenly taps into one of the space’s biggest debates. Agencies like Outset PR build entire campaigns on this principle. They argue that newsworthiness comes not from the feature itself, but from the tension it addresses in the wider market. It’s a simple filter: if it matters beyond the company’s walls, it matters to the press. Why Timing Is Critical in Web3 Narratives In crypto, timing can be as important as substance. The industry shifts focus every few weeks: one moment it’s restaking, the next it’s stablecoins, then regulation. The strongest stories can fall flat if they land just a few days too late. This is why timing is often cited as the biggest mistake projects make in their outreach — assuming that because something is big for them, it will automatically matter for everyone else. PR done well is less about hype and more about syncing with the rhythm of the industry. Get it right, and your project feels relevant. Miss the window, and even a solid story disappears. Tailoring for Media and Community Crypto PR also has to work on two fronts: journalists and communities. Both care about the same story, but they consume it differently. Media want clarity and independence. They need verifiable data, not just claims. Communities want belonging. They want to feel like progress is happening because of them and with them. Smart PR reframes the same narrative for both. For the press: “Our protocol reduced gas fees by 70%, backed by hard numbers.” For the community: “We heard your feedback, and together we solved one of the biggest pain points.” It’s the same story, just told through different lenses — and that balance is what builds trust. Syndication in Crypto PR: From One Press Release to Dozens of Mentions One of the most overlooked aspects of crypto PR is what happens after an article runs. A single placement can spark dozens of secondary mentions across aggregators, media hubs, and community feeds. This ripple effect is often invisible to teams who only track traffic from the first article. Yet it’s what determines whether a project’s story feels like a blip — or like it’s everywhere. For example, Outset PR tracked how a tier-1 feature for StealthEX turned into 92 republications across platforms like CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance. The outreach from those pickups reached billions, far beyond what the original article could have achieved alone. Outset PR even developed a syndication map , a tool that identifies which outlets trigger the most secondary coverage. It’s a rare data-driven approach in a space that usually treats PR results as intangible. From Attention to Reputation Ultimately, PR isn’t about a single headline. It’s about compounding. Each story, AMA, and narrative that ties back to a project’s mission builds over time. Journalists begin to view the team as credible commentators. Communities start to see the project not just as another token, but as part of the industry’s direction. That shift — from chasing attention to earning reputation — is what separates projects that flash and fade from those that last. Why Crypto PR Is More Than Announcements A press release says you exist. PR, at its best, explains why you matter. It frames features as part of larger narratives. It aligns with industry cycles instead of fighting them. It adapts to different audiences without losing authenticity. And it ensures stories don’t just land once, but echo across the ecosystem. As cases from Outset PR show, crypto PR is not about vanity mentions. It’s about giving every story both meaning and momentum. For founders trying to figure out if PR is worth the effort, some common questions always come up. Let’s tackle them. FAQ: Crypto PR and Web3 Storytelling Q: Is a press release enough to promote a crypto project?A: Not really. A press release can announce your update, but it won’t shape the narrative or guarantee visibility. Effective crypto PR connects your update to industry-wide conversations and ensures amplification across media, aggregators, and communities. Q: What’s the difference between PR and marketing in crypto?A: Marketing drives direct results — clicks, traffic, signups. PR builds reputation and credibility by shaping how your project is perceived in the media and among investors. In crypto, where trust is often the barrier, PR makes marketing more effective. Q: How does PR help with investor trust?A: Third-party validation. When investors see your project covered by credible outlets, it reduces skepticism. PR places you in those outlets and frames you as part of the broader conversation. Q: What is syndication in crypto PR?A: Syndication is when one article gets echoed across dozens of platforms like CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, or Yahoo Finance. It multiplies your visibility far beyond the original hit — sometimes 10x over. Q: How do I choose the right crypto PR agency?A: Look for agencies with a track record in Web3, that understand narrative cycles, and that can show data on outcomes — not just placements, but the ripple effects of coverage.",More News,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BNB|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-04 20:51:38

Tether To Launch Digital Asset Treasury Firm With XAUT: Report On Friday, October 3rd, Bloomberg reported that Tether and financial services firm Antalpha Platform Holding are leading an effort to raise at least $200 million to set up a digital asset treasury company. Citing unnamed sources close to the matter, this public vehicle would use the capital to purchase XAUT, Tether’s gold token. Bloomberg revealed that Antalpha Platform Holding has close ties to Bitmain Technologies, the world’s largest Bitcoin hardware supplier based in China. According to a report from the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, the Bitcoin hardware manufacturer supplies about 82% of the world’s crypto mining machines. Bloomberg posited that this capital-raising effort would further strengthen the relationship between two of the largest companies in the global crypto industry. Meanwhile, this venture would represent a continuation in digital asset treasury companies’ craze happening this year, with more than 80 firms set up so far in 2025. Furthermore, the report revealed that asset manager Cohen & Company is the lead advisor on the deal, with further talks kept private. While most parties declined to comment, Tether reportedly pointed out a post on the social media platform X about its recent announcement with Antalpha. As per the post on X , Antalpha revealed that it would be integrating Tether Gold into its Real-World Assets (RWA) Hub, offering tokenized gold-backed lending and infrastructure solutions. The financial services firm also announced that it would set up physical vaults in major financial centers around the world to allow holders to exchange the tokens for gold bars. This move to offer XAUT-backed lending came after Tether had purchased an 8.1% stake in Antalpha during its initial public offering (IPO) earlier in May 2025. Tether Gold, launched in 2020, offers investors an exposure to gold without physically owning the metal. With a market capitalization of about $1.5 billion, Tether claims that the almost 250,000 XAUT tokens in circulation are backed by an equivalent of more than 7.66 tons of gold . USDT Market Cap At $175 Billion At the same time, Tether owns the largest dollar-backed stablecoin and the fourth-largest digital asset in the cryptocurrency market, with a market cap of more than $175 billion.",Tether (USDT)|Antalpha|Bitmain|Bloomberg|crypto|gold|Tether|USDT|xaut,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDT|FIAT|XAUT|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 21:00:06

With recent price gains and steady market momentum, many are wondering if ADA can finally break through the barrier and push beyond the dollar mark. This article looks at the key indicators shaping ADA’s next move—and also highlights how Outset PR applies data-driven clarity to help crypto projects, much like ADA itself, position for lasting growth in a competitive environment. Cardano on the Rise: Potential Growth Amidst Recent Gains Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is on an upward swing, trading between about 75 to 88 cents. In the past week alone, its price has jumped over 12%. Heading towards the 95-cent resistance mark, Cardano shows promise. If it breaks this barrier, it could target a rise beyond one dollar, which implies a sharp climb. Over the last six months, Cardano has seen a growth of over 31%. Key support at around 69 cents could act as a cushion if prices dip. With a relative strength index near 50, Cardano seems balanced between overbought and oversold, suggesting room for potential further upward movement.

Analyst Identifies 2 Conditions For Uptrend,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-to-160000-by-early-2026-analyst/,"The price of Bitcoin made a dreamy start to the last quarter of the year, beginning the historically bullish month of October with a reclaim of the $120,000 level. After over a month of choppy price action, the world’s largest cryptocurrency seems to be resuming its bullish uptrend. With the price closing in on its all-time high price above $124,000, investors will be looking to see how far and long the premier cryptocurrency can go in the latest leg up. According to an on-chain analyst on social media platform X, the price of BTC could rise as high as $160,000 in the current run. Why A Break Above $128k Is Critical To BTC’s Bull Run In an October 3 post on X, crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. put forward a $160,000 target for the Bitcoin price at the start of next year. According to the online pundit, the sustained progression of BTC’s price action to this unprecedented high hinges on two primary conditions, or two price levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forecast: Expert Predicts Final Impulse Wave Targeting $18,000 This bullish analysis revolves around the historical price performance of Bitcoin following the halving event. Typically, the halving event is viewed as a catalytic event that triggers long-term price rallies for BTC, as it involves slashing by half the volume of the premier cryptocurrency created at a time. As observed in the chart above, the scenario-based model shows through a trend-based forecast that each halving cycle produces an exponentially higher peak for the Bitcoin price. According to this model, the price of BTC printed a post-halving peak around $57,000 following the 2020 event, beating the previous high of $4,250. Adler Jr. revealed that the Bitcoin price could head for $160,000 after the 2024 halving event, which saw miner rewards fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. However, for this rally to be confirmed, the first condition is that the flagship cryptocurrency will need to break above the $128,000 and hold above this “base” level on multiple weekly closes. In the second condition, the on-chain analyst shared that Bitcoin’s upward movement toward the $160,000 mark could be at risk of invalidation should the price fall below the $102,000 level. According to Adler Jr., a breakdown beneath this level could lead to a quick scenario reset, potentially changing the target or overall trend for the Bitcoin price. Ultimately, the price action of BTC in the short term is one to look out for, as the market leader looks to reclaim its current all-time high. Moreover, a break above the record-high price could clear the path for Bitcoin to reach the ‘base” level of $128,000. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $122,710, reflecting a 2% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the top cryptocurrency is up by more than 12% in the last seven days.

TON price faces a critical test at $2: buyers must reassert control with clear volume support and declining exchange inflows to prevent a slide to $1.60–$1.20. Current taker CVD and netflow signals favor sellers, so momentum confirmation is essential for a sustainable defense. How does taker CVD reflect current market bias? Toncoin’s spot taker CVD chart shows dominant red zones, indicating aggressive taker sells. Short, repeated red spikes suggest sellers are executing market orders more frequently than buyers. Without a sustained shift to green CVD, the bias remains bearish and hinders meaningful recoveries. TON’s extended consolidation near key support — what does it mean? TON has traded inside a prolonged channel between $2.50 and $3.68, retesting mid-range levels without conviction. Price indecision points to a balance between weak bulls and persistent bears. If $2.50 collapses, downside momentum may accelerate; holding near $2 supports the case for a gradual rebound. Buy-side weakness around $2 diminishes the probability of an immediate recovery. Traders should treat the $2 zone as a make-or-break area: a sustained hold can open recovery targets at $3.20–$3.50, while failure increases the chance of reaching $1.60 or $1.20. Source: TradingView Do inflows and cooling volumes confirm a bearish market outlook for TON? Yes. Weekly Netflow data shows steady inflows—most recently around $4.12M—consistent with tokens moving to exchanges for potential liquidation. At the same time, the Spot Volume Bubble map shows shrinking bubbles, signaling declining trading conviction. These combined metrics support a bearish outlook until they diverge. How should traders interpret cooling spot volumes? Cooling spot volumes indicate reduced participation. Historically, declining volumes often precede major moves—either accumulation or distribution. For TON, diminished volumes alongside selling inflows suggest distribution, increasing the likelihood of lower prices unless buyer capital returns. Source: CryptoQuant How do exchange inflows affect downside risk for TON? Exchange inflows raise downside risk because they increase sell-side supply. The latest weekly netflow reading (~$4.12M) aligns with weak CVD and fading volumes, reinforcing the seller-controlled narrative. Without a notable shift to outflows, accumulation signals remain absent and rallies are likely to struggle. Source: CoinGlass Frequently Asked Questions What price targets should traders watch if $2 fails? If $2 fails, the next meaningful targets are $1.60 and then $1.20, driven by increased selling pressure and exchange inflows. Watch for accelerating taker sells and expanding outflow volumes for confirmation of those moves. How quickly can TON recover if buyers return? Recovery speed depends on volume intensity: a sustained shift to green taker CVD and measurable outflows from exchanges could push TON toward $3.20–$3.50 over several sessions. Absent strong volume, recoveries are likely to be shallow and short-lived. Which indicators provide the clearest signals for TON right now? Primary indicators to watch: taker CVD (aggression), Spot Volume Bubble map (conviction), and weekly exchange netflows (supply/demand balance). Together they reveal whether buyers or sellers control the next directional move. Key Takeaways $2 is TON’s pivotal level : A sustained defense requires renewed buyer volume and reduced exchange inflows. Seller dominance on CVD : Persistent red zones and shrinking spot volumes point to distribution, not accumulation. Actionable watchlist : Monitor taker CVD, spot volume bubbles, and weekly netflows for early signs of reversal or continued breakdown. Conclusion Toncoin (TON) remains in a fragile state around the $2 support; current metrics favor sellers and emphasize the risk of a slide to $1.60–$1.20. Traders should prioritize volume-confirmed signals and exchange flow shifts.

This isn’t about hype or speculation—it’s a data-driven analysis of what could be a defining moment for XRP’s price movement. According to a prominent analyst, this setup might be the very opportunity XRP holders have been waiting for. A Defining Moment for XRP Holders In a video shared on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO sounded the alarm: “XRP holders, this could literally be the moment we have been waiting for here on the channel.” He explained that XRP had been consolidating within a bull flag pattern since mid-July and is now beginning to show “very bullish signs.” Steph emphasized that this pattern could lead to a major breakout in the coming days or weeks if confirmed, saying, “I want you guys to be prepared for this. I want to show you exactly what my game plan is, what my expectations are. Is the momentum bullish? Is there a potential bull trap? What’s the best thing right now?” IF YOU HOLD #XRP I GOT NEWS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!! (urgent) pic.twitter.com/AkTJkXiv6i — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 3, 2025 The Key Confirmation Level: $3 Daily Close The analyst stressed that confirmation is essential before calling a full breakout: “For me to absolutely call and to confirm this breakout, I would need to see the daily candle of today close above three dollars.” According to Steph, a confirmed daily close above this level would strongly suggest that XRP is “most likely heading a lot higher in the next days and the next weeks.” He maintained a technical target of around $5 , derived from the height of the bull flag’s pole, but cautioned traders to remain realistic. “There are no guarantees on the way up,” he said. “Maybe XRP is not going to go to five dollars—maybe we’re going to stop at four dollars or $4.50. It’s important that you have an exit strategy and that you secure profits on the way up.” Bullish Momentum Confirmed by EMA Ribbons Steph also highlighted a significant technical signal—the EMA ribbons on the daily chart. He noted that XRP is “right now actually breaking above daily ribbons, which is a strong sign and shows a lot of bullish momentum, a lot of buying pressure going on.” Historically, when XRP breaks above these ribbons, it often indicates the start of a larger upward move, especially if accompanied by increasing volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He added that the broader market context supports this potential surge. “Historically, October and November tend to be very bullish for crypto and for XRP,” he explained. “I think Q4—the next few days and the next few weeks—could be very bullish for XRP . But once again, for absolute confirmation, wait for the daily candle of today to close above three dollars.” Market Context and Outlook As of now, XRP trades just below the critical $3 threshold, consolidating after several attempts to break higher. Analysts widely agree that this level represents a major resistance zone. A confirmed breakout above it could open the door to a sustained rally toward $4–$5, while rejection might lead to renewed consolidation or a temporary pullback. For long-term investors, Steph’s message serves as both encouragement and caution. The current technical setup appears promising, but as he reminded his audience, “There are no guarantees on the way up.” Ultimately, the coming days will determine whether XRP confirms its long-awaited breakout. Traders and holders alike are watching the charts closely—because in crypto, decisive moments often arrive without warning, and being prepared can make all the difference.

The report noted that Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT) holdings have reached approximately $135 billion, with institutional investors, in particular, continuing to accumulate and stake ETH. VanEck noted that this creates a dilution risk for investors outside of staking. The report also touched on Ethereum's upcoming Fusaka upgrade in December. This update is expected to reduce Layer-2 rollup costs by increasing blob capacity and improve network efficiency by allowing nodes to perform block validation using probabilistic sampling. According to VanEck's report, 23 of the 35 major tokens closed the month lower. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 5%, while Ethereum (ETH) fell 5%. The overall decline in market volatility has dampened both price action and blockchain revenue, causing stagnation in the sector. According to the report, blockchain revenues fell by 16% month-over-month: Ethereum revenues: -6% Solana revenues: -11% Tron revenues: -37% VanEck stated that the primary reason for this decline was the decrease in market volatility. In September, volatility fell by -40% for ETH, -26% for BTC, and -16% for SOL. While decentralized spot exchange (DEX) volumes remained at August levels of approximately $365 billion, futures volumes increased by 30%. Much of this increase was driven by the token launch of the Aster platform within the Binance ecosystem and incentivized trading pairs.

Network revenue fell 16% MoM in September Ethereum fees down 6%, Solana down 11%, Tron fees dropped 37% after a governance fee cut. Volatility fell sharply: ETH -40%, SOL -16%, BTC -26% — reducing arbitrage-driven fee demand. Blockchain network revenue fell 16% in September due to lower crypto volatility; read the full analysis, data, and investor takeaways. Learn how fees and fundamentals changed. Asset manager VanEck attributed the broad decline in blockchain network revenue in September to lower volatility in the crypto markets. What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September? Blockchain network revenue declined 16% month-over-month in September primarily because lower crypto volatility reduced traders’ need to pay priority fees, decreasing total fees across major networks. VanEck’s analysis cites reduced arbitrage and fewer high-priority transactions as the main drivers. VanEck reported that overall network revenues across the blockchain ecosystem dropped by 16% month-over-month in September, linked to diminished volatility and lower transaction fee demand. Ethereum network revenue fell by 6% and Solana’s by 11%. The Tron network recorded a 37% reduction in fees, which VanEck attributes to a governance proposal that halved gas fees in August. Most cryptocurrencies experienced reduced volatility in September. Source: VanEck How did volatility changes affect crypto network fees? Reduced volatility curtailed arbitrage and time-sensitive trading that typically pushes users to pay higher fees for faster settlement. Ether (ETH) volatility dropped about 40% in September, SOL volatility fell 16%, and BTC volatility declined 26%, according to VanEck’s figures. Lower volatility means fewer rapid price moves and thus fewer priority transactions, translating directly into lower network revenue and smaller fee pools for validators and miners. Why did Tron lead revenue metrics despite lower fees? Tron remains the top revenue-generating crypto ecosystem, producing roughly $3.6 billion over the last year, according to Token Terminal data cited in market reporting. This leadership stems largely from stablecoin activity — 51% of circulating Tether USDt supply is issued on the Tron network. A comparison of crypto network fees over the last year. Source: Token Terminal By comparison, Ethereum generated about $1 billion in annual revenue despite ETH reaching all-time highs in August and a market capitalization near $539 billion — roughly 16x TRX’s market cap of about $32 billion. Stablecoins continue to expand: the stablecoin market cap crossed $292 billion in October 2025, per RWA.XYZ data, reinforcing Tron’s role in settlement and recurring fee generation. How should investors interpret network revenue and fees? Network revenues and fees are a core metric for assessing blockchain economic activity and protocol health. Monitor fees as a short-term gauge of transaction demand and revenue as a longer-term indicator of platform monetization and product fit. Analysts track fundamentals such as active addresses, transaction value, and fee revenue to evaluate project trajectories and ecosystem resilience. Frequently Asked Questions How large was the month-over-month revenue decline in September? The blockchain ecosystem saw a 16% month-over-month decline in network revenue in September, driven largely by reduced volatility and lower priority-fee transactions. Did any networks buck the trend in September? Tron continued to lead annual revenue generation despite a 37% monthly fee drop, thanks to heavy stablecoin settlement activity and prior fee-structure changes. What role did governance changes play in fee reductions? On Tron, a governance proposal reduced gas fees by over 50% in August, contributing to a 37% drop in network fees in September as reflected in revenue data. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Reduced crypto volatility lowered arbitrage and priority-fee demand, leading to a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why did Tron still lead revenue metrics?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Tron generated the most annual revenue due to heavy stablecoin settlement activity, with 51% of circulating USDT issued on Tron, supporting recurring fee volume."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Blockchain network revenue drops in September as volatility falls"", ""description"": ""VanEck reports a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September driven by reduced crypto volatility and lower transaction fees."", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199b0f3-c6e7-7260-b34f-183b28f6d0b8""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret a drop in blockchain network revenue"", ""description"": ""A brief step-by-step guide for investors to assess causes and implications of falling network fees and revenue."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check volatility metrics"", ""text"": ""Compare ETH, SOL, and BTC volatility changes to see if lower price swings explain fee reductions."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review protocol governance changes"", ""text"": ""Identify recent fee-structure proposals, such as Tron’s gas fee cut, which can materially reduce revenue."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Analyze stablecoin flows"", ""text"": ""Assess stablecoin issuance and settlement trends, as stablecoin volume can sustain fee revenue even in low-volatility markets."" } ]} Key Takeaways Revenue decline: A 16% MoM drop in September shows fees are sensitive to volatility and governance changes.

Conclusion September’s 16% fall in blockchain network revenue reflects lower crypto volatility and targeted protocol changes that cut fees.

What are Defiance Investments’ proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Defiance Investments’ prospectus requests 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs , offering triple daily exposure to crypto firms, token-linked ETFs and select tech names. The filing lists single-stock, ETF and crypto ETP targets and repeatedly warns these funds are suited only for aggressive, short-term traders. How do the proposed 3X leveraged crypto ETFs differ from existing 2X products? Three-times leveraged ETFs aim to deliver approximately 3X the daily return of an underlying asset, versus 2X funds that seek double daily moves. Because leverage compounds daily, 3X funds amplify volatility and path dependency, increasing the chance of significant losses over multi-day holding periods.

Defiance targeted crypto firms and token-linked ETFs to meet rising investor demand for direct and derivative exposure to digital assets. The surge in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows — with Bitcoin-related funds commanding sizable assets according to CoinGlass — encouraged issuers to explore leveraged versions despite higher risk. What specific companies and token ETFs are named in the filing? The prospectus lists funds tied to Coinbase, MicroStrategy (Bitcoin treasury exposure), Robinhood, BitMine Immersion (Ethereum treasury exposure), Circle (USDC issuer), Grayscale mini-trust ETFs tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a Solana ETF from Volatility Shares. The filing proposes both 3X long and 3X inverse share classes for many of these exposures.

Recent filings — including Defiance’s — indicate the SEC is receiving applications for higher-leverage products. Market analysts, such as ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy, note the regulator may permit more volatile products, but approvals will depend on disclosures, structure and investor-protection considerations. How should investors evaluate proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Evaluate leverage objectives, daily rebalancing mechanics, expense ratios, underlying liquidity, and prospectus risk disclosures. Compare historical one-day return replication and understand compounding effects for multi-day holdings. These funds are primarily for experienced, short-term traders. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to evaluate a 3X leveraged ETF"", ""description"": ""Steps to assess whether a 3X leveraged ETF aligns with a trader's objectives and risk tolerance."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Read the prospectus"", ""text"": ""Review leverage goal, daily reset rules, and risk warnings contained in the fund's prospectus."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Analyze volatility and liquidity"", ""text"": ""Check historical intraday and daily volatility of the underlying asset and the ETF's trading volume."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Simulate multi-day scenarios"", ""text"": ""Model multi-day returns to understand compounding effects and potential drawdowns for holding periods beyond one day."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Compare costs"", ""text"": ""Compare expense ratios and transaction costs relative to alternative exposure methods."" } ]} Key Takeaways Defiance filed for 49 3X ETFs : Proposals include crypto firms, token ETFs and tech stocks, with both long and inverse classes. Higher leverage increases risk : 3X daily leverage amplifies volatility and can produce large multi-day divergences from expected returns. Investor due diligence required : Read prospectuses, assess liquidity and model compounding before trading these products. Conclusion The Defiance prospectus signals a push to expand 3X leveraged ETFs across crypto and tech exposures, reflecting issuer interest in meeting aggressive trader demand. 3X leveraged ETFs may arrive if approved, but their complexity and high risk make careful evaluation essential. Monitor regulatory decisions and read fund disclosures before trading. NEW: @Defiance_ETFs has just filed for just shy of 50 3X levered ETFs. Some on single stocks, some on other ETFs, some on crypto ETPs.

Investors are curious whether these quirky coins can trigger a new wave of excitement in the market. Could these underdogs lead to a fresh rally? Explore the potential growth drivers and market sentiment in the full article. Dogecoin on the Rise: Is a Surge Around the Corner? Source: tradingview Dogecoin is currently trading between twenty-two and twenty-six cents. Its recent upward trend has seen a price surge of over 15% this week and nearly 20% for the month. The coin's momentum hints at breaking through the nearest resistance level of about twenty-eight cents. If it continues this path, it might soon challenge the second resistance level of roughly thirty-two cents. This could signal a potential growth of over 25%. With its popularity and community backing, Dogecoin remains a digital currency to watch, as its price movements suggest more potential climbs in the future. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Pepe (PEPE) Price Watch: What to Expect from this Crypto Adventure Source: tradingview Pepe (PEPE) is showing mixed signals. Its current price range swings between a few thousandths of a cent, landing at around $0.000009. Despite it passing a week with almost a 9% rise, the momentum is cautious. It's below the 10-day moving average but slightly above the 100-day average, which points to stable but slow progress. If Pepe breaks the nearest resistance level, it could see a growth of about 15% from its current spot. However, dropping below support could mean a slide of 20%. With its RSI below 50, Pepe’s current potential leans more towards recovery than rapid growth. Conclusion DOGE and PEPE have both shown potential for growth. DOGE remains popular with a strong community backing. PEPE has recently gained attention due to its memes and social media trends. If interest in meme coins continues, both could see price increases. However, market dynamics always play a big role. Keeping an eye on market trends and investor interest is crucial for predicting future movements of these coins. Just as crucial as crafting a narrative that fits the market, the key ability of Outset PR.

The SEC is reviewing 21 such ETF filings amid government shutdown delays. SEC review of 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs underway Funds propose staking exposure to altcoins including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SUI and others. Up to 40% of assets may be allocated to non-U.S. crypto ETPs from issuers like 21Shares and CoinShares. Meta description: staking crypto ETFs under SEC review — 21 REX-Osprey filings offer yield plus price exposure to ADA, AVAX, NEAR; follow regulatory updates on en.coinotag.com. SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs offering yield and price exposure to altcoins like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR amid shutdown delays. SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs as shutdown delays approval and review timelines. New ETFs include staked tokens like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR, offering both yield and price exposure. Up to 40% of ETF assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto ETPs from 21Shares, CoinShares, and Valour. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing multiple staking-based crypto ETF filings while operating with reduced staff during a government shutdown. REX Shares and Osprey Funds have proposed 21 spot ETFs that combine staking rewards with token price exposure, broadening regulated access to altcoins for institutional and retail investors. What are the REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs under SEC review? REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs are proposed funds that would hold and stake selected proof-of-stake tokens, paying staking rewards to the ETF while tracking token price movements. The filings name tokens such as ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI and SUI and outline use of Cayman subsidiaries to meet regulatory and tax requirements. How do these ETFs combine yield and price exposure? The funds are structured to both participate in on-chain staking (generating rewards) and provide market exposure to token price changes. Staking rewards would be retained or distributed according to each fund’s prospectus. Issuers emphasize the ability to deliver staking yield without investors directly managing private keys. Why is the SEC review delayed and what are the regulatory implications? The SEC’s standard review period for ETF filings is approximately 75 days, but reduced staffing from the government shutdown has slowed processing. Past shutdowns, such as in 2018, caused notable approval delays; analysts expect a similar impact now. Any approvals will still need to satisfy custody, custody-provider oversight, and compliance requirements for staking activities. Which tokens and issuers are named in filings? Filings list staked tokens including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI, SUI, TAO and HYPE. The documents reference allocation flexibility allowing up to 40% of fund assets to be invested in non-U.S. exchange-traded products from issuers named in plain text: 21Shares, CoinShares and Valour. Issuers plan Cayman Islands feeder structures to preserve regulated investment company status under U.S. tax rules. How might investor exposure differ compared to existing spot ETFs? Staking crypto ETFs differ from spot ETFs by adding a yield component from protocol-level staking. Investors gain passive yield (subject to slashing and validator performance) in addition to price appreciation or depreciation. The funds aim to reduce operational friction for institutional investors while preserving tradability on U.S. exchanges. Summary comparison of proposed ETFs (example allocation) ETF Primary Token Staking Enabled Potential Non‑U.S. Allocation Target Investor REX-Osprey ADA Staked ETF ADA Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey AVAX Staked ETF AVAX Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey NEAR Staked ETF NEAR Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional When could decisions resume and what should investors watch? Approvals are likely to resume once full SEC operations return; October 2025 is noted as a key month for several pending crypto ETF deadlines. Investors should monitor SEC notices, prospectus amendments, and custody disclosures for staking mechanics, fee schedules, and counterparty arrangements. Frequently Asked Questions Will staking ETFs increase investor access to altcoins? Yes. Staking ETFs aim to broaden access by allowing investors to gain price and yield exposure through regulated vehicles, avoiding direct custody and staking complexities. Product terms will determine yield distribution and fee impact. Can fund assets be invested in non-U.S. ETPs? Yes. Filings state up to 40% of a fund’s assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto exchange-traded products from issuers referenced in the filings. This may diversify access to European and Canadian markets within a U.S.-listed wrapper. Are staking rewards guaranteed? No. Staking rewards depend on network conditions, validator performance and protocol rules. Rewards can fluctuate and may be subject to penalties such as slashing for misbehavior or downtime. Key Takeaways Regulatory review active : The SEC is reviewing 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETF filings; approval timelines are delayed by a government shutdown. Yield + market exposure : Proposed ETFs combine staking rewards with token price exposure for altcoins like ADA, AVAX and NEAR. Cross-border allocation : Up to 40% non-U.S. ETP allocation may link funds to international issuers while using Cayman subsidiaries for tax and regulatory alignment. Conclusion The SEC’s review of staking crypto ETFs from REX and Osprey could expand regulated yield-bearing access to major altcoins, but approval timing remains uncertain due to the government shutdown.

Keep Eye On These 3 Coins,https://bitzo.com/2025/10/fear-greed-increase-is-crypto-preparing-for-the-next-explosive-rally-keep-eye-on-these-3-coins,"The mood in the crypto market is shifting as excitement and caution begin to blend. Amid this atmosphere, three cryptocurrencies appear ready for significant movement. Experts are analyzing patterns and signals that hint at a possible surge. This article delves into which coins show promise and why they might be on the brink of explosive growth. TRON (TRX) Eyes Growth Amid Steady Price Range Source: tradingview TRON is trading between thirty-three to thirty-four cents. It's facing resistance at thirty-five cents, while support stands at thirty-two cents. With a six-month increase of almost fifty percent, the coin shows strong growth potential. If TRX breaks through the thirty-five cents resistance, it could target thirty-six cents, suggesting a rise of about three percent. The Relative Strength Index indicates the coin is far from overbought, and its momentum is growing. This stability around the thirty-four cents moving averages suggests TRON might continue its gradual climb. Keep an eye on market shifts, as the coin's current positioning hints at further upward movement. Hedera (HBAR) Shows Promise Even Amid Market Fluctuations Source: tradingview Hedera , a rising player in the crypto market, currently trades between twenty and twenty-three cents. It hovers just below the twenty-five-cent resistance, suggesting room for upward movement. If the price breaks this, it could target over twenty-eight cents, almost a twenty percent rise from its upper range. Over the past six months, Hedera has climbed nearly fifty-eight percent, showing strong growth potential. Despite slight dips recently, it continues to maintain a steady course with key support holding at just under nineteen cents. With positive signs, including a six-month surge, Hedera's future looks promising for those watching closely. Arbitrum (ARB) Eyes Potential Bounce After Recent Lows Source: tradingview Arbitrum's current price stays within x cents to a few cents below half a dollar. Though it saw a big drop over the month, it still holds a considerable rise over six months. The coin is near its support, which might hint at a bounce. Its nearest challenge lies above the half-dollar mark, needing a climb of around a fifth more to get there. If enthusiasm grows, it could shoot to a price that is a bit more than five dimes. While past patterns show mixed signals, the coin's price holds room for recovery. If it gains ground, investors might see significant jumps in the coin's value. Conclusion TRX, HBAR, and ARB show strong potential in the current market. TRX focuses on fast transactions and low fees, which attracts many users. HBAR offers high efficiency and unique technology, making it appealing to developers. ARB is gaining interest due to its innovative features in governance. These coins may see significant growth if the market remains favorable. Keeping an eye on them could be worthwhile for those interested in the crypto space.

Technical structure shows higher highs and higher lows after two channel breakouts, supported by increased trading volumes that confirm active buying. How did analysts interpret the technical setup? Chart analysts, including Captain Faibik, identify a descending channel breakout from late 2022–April 2023 and a confirming breakout in October 2023 that formed a bullish flag continuation pattern. The pattern’s measured move places a near-term target near $140,000, assuming volume supports the advance. $BTC #Bitcoin Bulls are in Complete Control.. pic.twitter.com/QEWWLwItN8 — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) October 4, 2025 The pattern demonstrates strong technical strength, showing that selling pressure was absorbed within the consolidation phase. Historical data confirms that after each breakout, Bitcoin maintained upward momentum, indicating sustained buying strength. Trading volumes during breakout phases provide factual confirmation of active market participation from both institutional and retail investors. Source: MichaelvandePoppe (X) Market expert Michael van de Poppe noted that “Bitcoin has held the 20-week moving average as support, broken the downtrend at $112,000, and is on track for the highest weekly close in history.” He added that recent price action included “a 7% weekly candle,” confirming renewed bullish control. Why does institutional demand and seasonality matter for Bitcoin’s outlook? Institutional inflows and historical seasonality amplify bullish momentum and help sustain higher price levels. Citigroup’s published forecast and other institutional commentary point to substantial upside scenarios, while seasonality data shows October historically favors Bitcoin performance. According to Citigroup’s forecast (plain text citation), Bitcoin’s base case target sits near $181,000 with a bullish scenario up to $231,000 over a 12-month horizon. Institutional adoption, growing trading desks, and derivatives activity are cited as primary drivers in institutional research notes (plain text reference). Data compiled by The Bull Theory on X shows Bitcoin closed October in the green in 10 of the last 12 years, with an average October return of 20.62%. Those historical tendencies, paired with improving macro conditions, support a scenario where Bitcoin could extend toward $150,000 in the coming quarter if institutional flows continue. How are domestic retail premiums and macro policy influencing flows? Analysts note domestic demand disparities—U.S. investors have paid premiums on certain exchanges—indicating stubborn retail participation. As the Federal Reserve signals a more cautious stance, macro liquidity conditions could remain supportive for risk assets, allowing institutional allocations to increase. Frequently Asked Questions What is the immediate technical target for Bitcoin after the bullish flag breakout? BTC’s technical setup points to an initial upside target near $140,000 based on the measured move of the bullish flag, supported by rising volume and sustained buying pressure. How likely is a sustained rally to $150K or higher? With institutional demand rising, favorable October seasonality, and easing macro conditions, a rally to $150,000 is plausible within a quarter. Broader analyst scenarios range higher but depend on continued inflows and macro stability. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the immediate technical target for Bitcoin after the bullish flag breakout?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""BTC’s technical setup points to an initial upside target near $140,000 based on the measured move of the bullish flag, supported by rising volume and sustained buying pressure."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How likely is a sustained rally to $150,000 or higher?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""With institutional demand, positive October seasonality, and easing macro risks, a rally to $150,000 is plausible within a quarter, while longer-term analyst scenarios range higher and depend on continued inflows."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Breakout Confirms Bullish Flag, Targets $140K"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin bullish flag breakout signals upside to $140K; rising volume and institutional demand boost momentum."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/article-image-44.png"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T00:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T00:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo.png"" }, ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-bullish-flag-140k"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin's bullish flag breakout"", ""description"": ""A short, actionable guide to reading Bitcoin's bullish flag and assessing price targets."", ""totalTime"": ""PT10M"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Identify the breakout"", ""text"": ""Confirm a clear price break above the flag's upper trendline with increasing volume."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Measure the target"", ""text"": ""Measure the flagpole height from prior swing low to the start of consolidation and add it to the breakout point to derive a target near $140K."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm with volume and moving averages"", ""text"": ""Ensure rising trading volume supports the breakout and that key moving averages, such as the 20-week, act as support."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor macro and institutional flows"", ""text"": ""Track institutional desk activity and macro policy shifts that could either reinforce or undermine the breakout."" } ], ""supply"": [], ""tool"": []} Key Takeaways Bullish Flag Breakout : Bitcoin’s technical breakout targets near $140,000 based on pattern measured move.

The rise of these meme coins is stirring excitement and speculation in the market. As traders scramble to catch the next big thing, the question remains: which meme coin will dominate in 2025? Dogecoin Drifts Amid Market Uncertainty, Potential for a 25% Rise in View Source: tradingview Dogecoin's recent price movements show it trading between 21 and 26 cents. With a rise of over 66% in the past six months, DOGE holds potential for future gains. Eyes are on the resistance levels at 28 and 32 cents. If DOGE breaks these barriers, it could see a rise of around 25% from its current price. The support levels stand at 19 and 15 cents, serving as safety nets. Despite a weaker short-term momentum reflected by the RSI and other metrics, the semi-optimistic price change over recent months hints that DOGE could regain strength if market conditions improve. Pepe (PEPE) Shows Steady Growth with Potential for Breakout Source: tradingview Pepe's price now sits snugly between nine and ten-thousandths of a cent. The coin's journey over the past six months shows a remarkable growth of more than 50%. Recently, it rose by a little over 5% in just a week, hinting at bullish momentum. If trading gathers steam, it might rise to just above one cent, a jump of about 25% from where it stands now. The current movement suggests it can test the first hurdle set slightly higher, around the twelve-thousandths mark. Support sits a bit lower, below eight-thousandths of a cent. With its strength yet mild, attention focuses on when it might decisively break upward. Bonk Sees Steady Gains, Eyes Higher Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Bonk (BONK) is experiencing a steady price movement, trading between $0.00001789 and $0.00002185. The coin has the potential to rise toward its first resistance level at $0.00002413. If it gains momentum, it could aim for the second resistance level at $0.00002809. Bonk's price has increased by over 3% in the last week, showing potential for further growth. Over six months, it has seen an impressive increase of over 100%. With stable support levels and promising resistance targets, Bonk may continue to demonstrate growth, capturing the attention of investors looking for emerging cryptocurrencies with upward momentum. Conclusion DOGE has been underperforming recently, while PEPE and BONK have shown impressive gains. The question remains which coin will come out on top by 2025. DOGE has a strong community and established presence. PEPE and BONK, with their recent performance, could attract more interest. The deciding factor will likely be the ability to maintain momentum and continue to engage users. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The stablecoin, called A7A5, is pegged to the ruble and has been used heavily by Russian users since its launch in January. Despite being part of a sanctioned network, A7A5 was visible at the TOKEN2049 event with a booth, staff wearing its logo, and a speaking slot for one of its executives. TOKEN2049 is a top-tier global crypto event held annually and registered in Hong Kong. This year, it drew more than 25,000 attendees, over 500 exhibitors, and a lineup of high-profile speakers, including Donald Trump Jr., chairman of U.S. brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald Brandon Lutnick, and senior executives from major crypto companies. The appearance of A7A5 at such a high-profile event came even after it was sanctioned by both Washington and London in August. A7A5 sponsors TOKEN2049 despite U.S. and U.K. sanctions The U.S. and Britain said in August that they had sanctioned several companies linked to A7A5, which they described as part of a network designed to help Russians evade Western sanctions. The stablecoin was created in Kyrgyzstan by a Russian defense lender and a payments firm. On the official TOKEN2049 website, A7A5 had been listed as one of more than 20 platinum sponsors. Event staff were seen wearing A7A5-branded shirts, and its director for regulatory and overseas affairs, Oleg Ogienko, appeared on stage to speak about the project. By 1300 GMT on Thursday, references to A7A5 had been removed from the conference’s website and Ogienko was no longer listed as a speaker after Reuters contacted the event for comment. TOKEN2049’s organizers did not respond to multiple requests for comment about why A7A5 had been included. When approached at the conference, Ogienko confirmed that the operation in Singapore was part of the sanctioned group. “We were sanctioned several times,” he told Reuters on Thursday from the sidelines of the event. He added that A7A5 had no ties to money laundering and complied with Kyrgyz regulations. “We just regularly applied for our participation, and the organisers confirmed the participation (at TOKEN2049),” he said. Trading volumes surge as sanctions struggle to stop flows A7A5’s presence at TOKEN2049 underscores how difficult it has been for Western governments to restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in sanctions evasion. Neither Singapore nor Hong Kong has imposed sanctions on the companies connected to A7A5. Three lawyers who specialize in sanctions told Reuters that the U.S. has no jurisdiction in cases where no U.S. persons are involved. Western sanctions following Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, especially the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT global payment system, have forced Moscow to search for alternative payment channels. A7A5 has quickly become one of them. According to blockchain research firm Elliptic, more than $70.8 billion of A7A5 has been transferred since its January launch, up from $40 billion recorded in July. Elliptic also said the daily number of A7A5 transactions had doubled over the past month. Reuters was unable to independently verify the source of the funds or the purpose of the transfers. Ogienko, who is based in Russia, told Reuters that A7A5 is mainly used for cross-border payments by Russian companies and their trading partners. He said its target markets are Asia, Africa, and Latin America. “There are many countries who trade with Russia, and some of them, many of them, use our stablecoin… and these are billions of dollars,” he said. The Singapore event’s scale made the visibility of A7A5 even more striking. TOKEN2049 remains one of the largest industry gatherings, featuring not just high-profile U.S. figures like Donald Trump Jr. but also senior leaders from top crypto companies worldwide.

The enthusiasm for AI was reignited this week following global partnerships involving Nvidia Corp., pushing the MSCI All-Country World Index to an all-time high. Twelve companies, including Accelleron Industries AG, Arcadis NV, Legrand SA, National Grid Plc, Nokia Oyj, Orange SA, OVH Groupe SA, Prysmian SpA, Siemens Energy AG, and Veolia Environnement SA, have surpassed traditional tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple in percentage gains this year. AI infrastructure trades boom in Europe A custom basket of ten European data center operators , grid providers, and infrastructure companies has surged 23% this year, outpacing both the 12% gain in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index and the Nasdaq 100. The Stoxx 600 Technology Index has gained only 6.7% this year. However, the 23% surge is still significantly lower than the 69% jump in U.S. power stocks. The basket includes major players such as Accelleron Industries AG, Arcadis NV, Legrand SA, National Grid Plc, Nokia Oyj, Orange SA, OVH Groupe SA, Prysmian SpA, Siemens Energy AG, and Veolia Environnement SA. “It’s not as sexy to talk about infrastructure as it is to talk about some of the big U.S. tech names,” Helen Jewell, the Chief Investment Officer for EMEA fundamental equities at BlackRock, said . “But we are literally just at the beginning of it. Power infrastructure, grid stability, energy efficiency—that is the AI story in Europe, less on the software side.” Investors light up stocks powering AI As artificial intelligence models grow more complex, they demand vast energy resources , which is advantageous for power and infrastructure companies. Siemens Energy AG, for instance, has seen its shares soar 111% this year, making it a top pick in Ninety One’s European equity fund, which manages $192B in assets. “It is absolutely mission critical in getting power from the grid to data centers,” Ben Lambert, the fund manager at Ninety One, said. Despite the gains, Siemens Energy still trades at a 60% discount to its U.S. peer GE Vernova Inc., based on price-to-earnings ratios. The energy firm’s prospects were boosted in January when President Donald Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank Group, OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. to fund billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Siemens, GE Vernova, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries together account for over 70% of global gas turbine production capacity. The Italian cable manufacturer Prysmian SpA has also benefited from AI-driven infrastructure demand. Its stock has surged 41% in 2025, trading at 20 times forward earnings, which is a significant discount to chip-equipment leader ASML Holding NV, which trades at 35 times. Prysmian’s cables are key for transmitting electricity and data across growing AI networks. Legrand SA, a French producer of electrical and digital infrastructure, has seen its shares climb 52% this year after raising full-year sales guidance in July. About 20% of its revenues now come from data centers. “We’re seeing European industrials really benefit from the surge in data center growth driven by AI,” Alexandra Sentuc, the European equity portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, said. Telecom firms like Orange SA, France’s largest telecom operator, manages over 70 data centers, and plans to expand its AI-ready capacity. Similarly, Nokia Oyj is a critical part of Europe’s AI infrastructure due to its network switch technology used in data centers. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that Nokia’s 2026 revenue could rise by €300M if hyperscaler-linked sales continue to grow. “It’s still a tangible play from the geopolitical standpoint,” Xiadong Bao, the co-manager of the Edmond de Rothschild Fund Big Data, said. He noted that European governments prefer local suppliers over U.S. or Chinese switch makers. Despite the optimism, challenges like thin liquidity and limited passive investment exposure to infrastructure-focused AI themes raise concerns for investors. There’s also regulatory scrutiny around AI and energy use that could also temper growth. However, both public and private investments are accelerating. Nvidia is expanding its European footprint with new technology centers in the U.K., France, Spain, and Sweden. “The AI world is a bit like the Cold War, where everybody wants to get to the moon,” Bao said. “But for us, especially European investors, it’s better to look at the AI race as a marathon—monetization will increase progressively.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Business|Nasdaq,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-04 21:55:51

Despite market cycles, their capacity to surprise investors with sudden rallies has ensured that they maintain positions in the investors’ portfolios. Among them, Dogecoin remains a subject of interest for its suggested climb near the symbolic $1 milestone. However, Dogecoin is not the only coin that is being watched over by analysts. Predictions of explosive growth surround a newly established presale project, MAGACOIN FINANCE. Some analysts argue it might repeat Dogecoin’s early stages and provide a 75x breakout in 2025 . This tie between the two tokens has led to increasing interest from retail and institutional investors alike. Dogecoin Builds Toward $1 Target Dogecoin is currently trading within an ascending megaphone pattern. Historically, this feature has produced big breakouts in the price. Analysts note the growing formation has a target of $1. The rising megaphone has higher lows gradually increasing and higher highs spreading, indicating increasing momentum. In the case of Dogecoin, the pattern has been developing since mid-2023 and is still holding in 2025. This pattern sets up a structure for potential rallies as long as the buyers maintain control. Historical Rallies Confirm Uptrend This outlook is also supported by historical evidence. Since 2023, Dogecoin has been following a consistent pattern of accumulation, breakout, and consolidation. For instance, the meme coin consolidated around $0.06 in late 2023, then rose to above $0.15 in early 2024. After each upward move, DOGE retreated into consolidation zones before repeating the cycle. Analysts believe this action gives weight to the overall bullish framework that might ultimately drive DOGE to $1. Tight Consolidations Before Steep Rallies One analyst, Trader Tardigrade, points out other shorter-term cycles that put Dogecoin’s strength in perspective. His chart displayed repetitive tight consolidations followed by strong rallies. The same compression and expansion cycle was seen in July and September 2025. Source: X Most recently, Dogecoin consolidated between $0.22 and $0.23, then broke higher to $0.25. If the same pattern is to continue, there is another spike above $0.34. This is similar to the megaphone structure, which gives both short and mid-term confirmation. Higher Highs and Higher Lows Strengthen Trend Furthermore, Dogecoin’s historical price performance establishes the upward trend. The coin had hit a low of $0.055 in October 2023 before jumping back above $0.42 in March 2024. Another high exceeded $0.38 in April 2025. Even amid corrections, DOGE held near major support at $0.16 in September 2024 and August 2025 near $0.19. The higher lows and highs confirm the long-term bullish channel. The Relative Strength Index is close to 55, which corresponds to a balanced momentum. Analysts point out that as long as demand remains, there is room for the indicator to continue upward pressure. MAGACOIN FINANCE Analysts Call It the Next 75x Breakout Play While Dogecoin continues to capture headlines with its push toward $1, analysts are also turning their attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE. A number of market watchers describe it as the next breakout token, forecasting a potential 75x return within a year . According to analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trajectory mirrors the early days of Dogecoin. When DOGE first entered the market, it was dismissed as a meme before proving its staying power through repeated rallies. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now showing similar signs, with strong community backing driving momentum. One recurring point among analysts is the striking resemblance between MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early growth curve and Dogecoin’s initial breakout cycles. Both projects began with grassroots community energy and active participation in social channels. That combination has historically fueled explosive rallies, and MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be repeating the formula. Analysts argue this timing could amplify returns, setting up MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most closely watched breakout plays in 2025 . Conclusion Dogecoin’s climb toward $1 underscores its resilience as a leading meme coin. With clear bullish patterns, strong support levels, and repeated breakout cycles, the coin continues to attract both retail traders and institutional interest. Analysts believe that if current momentum holds, DOGE could eventually achieve the symbolic $1 milestone. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be the breakout play of 2025 as analysts see echoes of Dogecoin’s early rallies. For investors seeking a balance between established momentum and high-growth potential, Dogecoin and MAGACOIN FINANCE represent two of the most compelling opportunities in the current market.

But what is surprising most analysts is that these same whales are not putting all of their capital into Bitcoin, they are investing in high-upside altcoins, and one of the best picks is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . At just $0.035 and already over 55% sold out in Stage 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance is attracting whale-sized attention due to its two-layer lending infrastructure built to generate sustainable returns. With more than 16,750 investors and $16.8 million+ raised, many institutional investors now are diversifying into Mutuum Finance as a high-conviction hedge alongside Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s Strategic Position Enlarges as U.S. Legislators Call for a National Reserve Bitcoin’s role in the global financial system could surge to the level of billions with U.S. legislators calling for its inclusion in the country’s strategic reserves. Rep. Nick Begich and Sen. Cynthia Lummis have introduced the BITCOIN Act, a landmark bill that would purchase one million BTC in five years via budget-neutral mechanisms. The bill follows the lead of an executive order signed by former President Donald Trump, blocking the government from selling off seized crypto assets and instead keeping them as a permanent “digital stockpile.” Begich argues that diversifying the gold-dominant national balance sheet with Bitcoin would make America economically safer and more competitive in the digital economy. With institutional belief in Bitcoin becoming more firm, the large traders are diversifying too, and it is here that young altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are increasingly finding themselves on their radar screens as second-tier high-upside wagers. MUTM Presale Momentum Picks Up Pace MUTM tokens are currently going for $0.035 in Presale Round 6, an increase of 16.17% over the previous round. Demand from investors remains very high with over 16,750 investors already pouring in over $16.8 million to date. While attempting to make the platform safer, Mutuum Finance has launched recently a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat developers and hackers are invited to report bugs. Four severity levels of bugs, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, have been used so that bugs could be detected and corrected early on. The protocol is supported by strong collateral management that makes the network and participants secure. Unlimited collateral ratio, lending ability, and deposit ability are among the security attributes that make it safe. Remedy of real-time undercollateral positions and fees and penalties stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Efficiency is at the core of the Mutuum Finance model. By maximizing Loan-to-Value (LTV) rates and taking overcollateralized positions, the protocol interacts with all available capital with aggressive guards. Reserve requirements provide to serve as a cushion against market volatility with overlying reserves to borrow against in riskier assets to hedge against volatility. Mutuum Finance Announces Upcoming Lending & Borrowing Protocol Launch Mutuum Finance has unveiled the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , reiterating its commitment to providing wider decentralized finance solutions. The release V1 will be available in the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will feature vital elements such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be the initial assets for borrowing, lending, and collateral and the backbone of a dynamic and strong DeFi platform. Mutuum Finance is reshaping decentralized finance on three fundamental axes: long-term viability, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable borrowing and lending platform is introducing DeFi to institutions and retail investors. Whereas lawmakers are calling for a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, whales are diversifying their bets away from BTC, and the top pick among them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). As $0.035 and over 55% sold with $16.8M raised, MUTM’s twin lending architecture, solid security, and imminent DeFi protocol launch make it a high-leverage hedge and one of the strongest altcoins in 2025.

52677237,https://nulltx.com/?p=152262,1759615980,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"BNB Chain Tops Active Addresses in September, Surpassing Solana and NEAR",https://nulltx.com/bnb-chain-tops-active-addresses-in-september-surpassing-solana-and-near/,"BNB Chain has emerged as the leading blockchain by active addresses in September. Data shows the chain recorded 52.5 million monthly active addresses, surpassing both NEAR Protocol’s 51.8M and Solana’s 45.8M. It marks the first time since August 2024 that Solana has been dethroned in this metric. The shift signals a major momentum swing in the battle for user activity across top Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. BNB Chain is the top chain by active addresses in September With 52.5M, @BNBCHAIN surpassed @NEARProtocol (51.8M) and @solana (45.8M). It’s the 1st time since Aug 2024 that Solana was dethroned by this metric. BNB Chain's spike in activity is fueled by the hype around Aster. pic.twitter.com/LZ7bv99Ofg — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) October 3, 2025 Aster Hype Fuels BNB Chain’s Surge The sudden spike in BNB Chain activity ties closely to the buzz surrounding Aster, a new project driving engagement across the ecosystem. On-chain data points to users flocking toward Aster-related activity, pushing BNB Chain into the spotlight. BNB Chain’s core Layer 1 logged a 22% month-on-month increase in active addresses. But that’s only part of the story. The chain’s Layer 2 solution, opBNB, built on Optimism’s tech stack, exploded with a 66.4% surge in active addresses. That dual growth has set BNB Chain apart from competitors. The surge isn’t just a one-off blip,it shows increasing demand from users who are actively transacting, not just holding tokens. I knew there was some activity on the Binance Chain, but I wasn’t expecting this level of traction. This map shows the evolution of active addresses over one month, essentially for September, and the numbers speak for themselves. The BNB Chain Layer 1 recorded a 22%… pic.twitter.com/FCcB3BIlEy — Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) October 3, 2025 Solana Slips After Holding the Crown For over a year, Solana maintained dominance as the chain with the highest active addresses, consistently outpacing rivals. Its low-cost transactions and thriving memecoin culture gave it strong grassroots traction. But the September data shows a clear shift. At 45.8M active addresses, Solana now trails behind both BNB Chain and NEAR. While still one of the most active ecosystems, its lead has narrowed. This dethroning in September is a reminder that even the most dominant networks can lose momentum when rivals capitalize on new trends. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL trades at $228.45, down 1.2% on the day but still up 10.4% in the past month, reflecting solid investor confidence despite activity shifts. NEAR Holds Strong at Second Right behind BNB Chain, NEAR Protocol posted 51.8M active addresses in September. That keeps it competitive, with only a narrow gap separating it from the top. NEAR’s ecosystem continues to benefit from its push into Web3 gaming and user-friendly dApps. Unlike Solana, NEAR hasn’t had to rely on memecoins to maintain its user activity. Instead, it’s building steady growth through core ecosystem plays. On CoinMarketCap, NEAR is priced at $2.94, up 8.6% over the past week, suggesting both retail and institutional traders are paying close attention to its progress. Ethereum and Base Trail Behind While BNB Chain, NEAR, and Solana battle for the top three spots, other ecosystems lag behind in activity. Ethereum, despite being the leading Layer 1 by total value locked and DeFi dominance, continues to lose ground in active address metrics due to higher gas fees. Similarly, Base, Coinbase’s Layer 2 network, is gaining traction but hasn’t yet matched the scale of BNB Chain or NEAR. The latest numbers put it well behind the leaders, even though it benefits from one of the largest centralized exchange ecosystems in the world. ETH currently trades at $4500, slightly up 0.8% in 24 hours, while BASE’s native activity token metrics remain outside the top traded assets on CoinMarketCap. The Significance of opBNB’s Growth What stands out most in September is the growth of opBNB. Built on Optimism’s OP Stack, the Layer 2 solution was designed to make transactions on BNB Chain cheaper and faster. With a 66.4% increase in active addresses, it’s clear users are adopting it at a rapid pace. This move mirrors the broader trend across the industry,where Layer 2 solutions are increasingly becoming the real battleground for user engagement. Just as Arbitrum and Optimism compete for Ethereum’s Layer 2 crown, opBNB is helping Binance’s ecosystem strengthen its footprint. BNB, the native token, trades at $1147.20, up 17.8% this week. The token’s price movement reflects renewed interest from traders betting that higher user activity will translate to long-term value capture. What This Means for the Market The fact that BNB Chain overtook Solana and NEAR in active addresses suggests a dynamic shift in user interest. Instead of one chain holding a dominant lead, we’re seeing a back-and-forth battle where hype cycles, new dApps, and Layer 2 innovation play major roles. For now, BNB Chain’s rise is powered by Aster and the rapid adoption of opBNB. But history shows that activity can shift just as fast,whether to Solana with memecoins, NEAR with gaming, or Ethereum with DeFi. What’s clear is that the market no longer belongs to one single chain. Users are moving between ecosystems depending on cost, speed, and opportunity. That keeps competition fierce and innovation constant. BNB Chain’s climb to the top in September is more than a vanity metric. With 52.5M active addresses, it proves users are actively engaging, not just passively holding tokens. The Layer 1’s 22% growth combined with opBNB’s 66.4% surge show Binance’s ecosystem is attracting real traction. Whether this momentum sustains or fades will depend on how long projects like Aster can capture attention and how effectively the ecosystem continues to expand. For now, BNB Chain leads the pack. But as Solana, NEAR, Ethereum, and Base fight back, the race for active users is far from over. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This week, the non-profit sold 1,000 ETH through decentralized exchange CoWSwap, using a TWAP (time-weighted average price) strategy. The swap brought in $4.5 million USDC, marking the Foundation’s largest on-chain move in recent months. The sale is not random. Funds are officially allocated to research, grants, and donations,the backbone of Ethereum’s long-term ecosystem growth. But every time the Foundation moves ETH, traders take notice. This latest sale comes at a critical point for the market. Why Traders Care About Foundation Moves Ethereum’s price sits around $4,500 today, according to CoinMarketCap, up nearly 10% this past week. On-chain activity is also surging, fueled by new DeFi flows, NFT transactions, and institutional inflows. Against this backdrop, the Foundation’s $4.5M conversion to stablecoins raised eyebrows. Historically, when the Foundation sells ETH, the market interprets it as a signal of caution or profit-taking. Past sales have coincided with short-term dips. Traders know that when one of Ethereum’s biggest holders moves tokens, the ripple effects are real. This is why blockchain watchers and analysts scan Foundation wallets closely. Every move sets off speculation: Are they predicting volatility? Or simply managing their treasury responsibly? The Strategy: Using TWAP via CoWSwap The Foundation didn’t just dump tokens into the market. Instead, they used TWAP, a strategy that spreads out sales over time to reduce slippage and avoid spiking volatility. Executed on CoWSwap, the method ensured that the sale looked more like a risk management play than a market shock. This also signals sophistication. Rather than destabilizing ETH price, the Foundation chose a method that preserves liquidity. For traders, it’s a subtle reminder that Ethereum’s core stewards balance development needs with market sensitivity. Why Now? The Timing Behind the Swap The timing of the move is key. Ethereum has been climbing steadily, riding the wave of institutional interest and broader crypto optimism. Spot Ethereum ETFs are under review in multiple regions. Meanwhile, Layer-2 activity is soaring, with networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base driving traffic and fees. At the same time, volatility is intensifying. Bitcoin dominance is softening, altcoin rotations are in play, and ETH sits at a critical resistance level. In such moments, large treasury moves can be interpreted as profit-taking at the top of a rally. By moving to USDC, the Foundation shows it’s not betting recklessly on price action. Instead, it’s ensuring stable resources for ongoing projects. For developers and researchers, that’s reassurance. For traders, it’s a reason to pause and reassess bullish bets. What the Funds Will Support The Ethereum Foundation clarified that proceeds are earmarked for: Research: advancing Ethereum protocol development, scaling upgrades, and next-gen cryptography. Grants: supporting builders, open-source projects, and infrastructure teams. Donations: contributing to ecosystem-aligned initiatives that extend Ethereum’s reach. This allocation reinforces the Foundation’s role as more than just a holder of ETH. By cycling value back into the ecosystem, it ensures Ethereum stays competitive as rivals like Solana and Avalanche attract attention. Market Signals: Stablecoins as a Treasury Tool The Foundation’s choice of USDC over other assets is also telling. Stablecoins remain the most reliable hedge for organizations managing large treasuries. By parking $4.5M into USDC, the Foundation highlights the role stablecoins play in reducing exposure while preserving liquidity. This isn’t just about managing risk. It’s about signaling discipline to the market. Stablecoins have become the crypto-native equivalent of cash reserves. For traders, seeing Ethereum’s core organization lean on them validates their role in treasury management. How Traders Interpret the Move Blockchain sleuths often joke that when the Ethereum Foundation sells ETH, a dip follows. While correlation doesn’t always mean causation, history shows that these events coincide with increased sell pressure. 1/ Today, The Ethereum Foundation will convert 1000 ETH to stablecoins via @CoWSwap 's TWAP feature, as part of our ongoing work to fund R&D, grants and donations, and to highlight the power of DeFi. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 3, 2025 Already, analysts on X (formerly Twitter) are flagging the move. Ethereum Foundation’s official announcement confirms the sale. Market watchers, including CryptoPost Official, are tracking sentiment shifts. For retail traders, the lesson is simple: Foundation sales often signal caution. For institutions, it’s a sign that even Ethereum’s core players diversify when volatility looms. Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem. With ETH trading near $4,500 and demand for block space rising, the long-term outlook is strong. But Foundation moves like this remind everyone that markets are not one-directional. By selling 1,000 ETH for USDC, the Ethereum Foundation demonstrated strategic treasury management. It ensures that development, grants, and donations continue,regardless of short-term price swings. For traders, the signal is mixed. On one hand, the ecosystem gains funding security. On the other, the move injects caution into bullish momentum. In crypto, perception often drives price. And when Ethereum’s most influential entity makes a treasury adjustment, the market listens. The Ethereum Foundation’s $4.5M ETH-to-USDC swap isn’t just a trade,it’s a message. It’s about sustainability, funding, and risk management. For the community, it reassures that growth is supported. For traders, it sparks speculation about what comes next. As Ethereum pushes through a volatile market, one thing is clear: every Foundation transaction is more than just a number on the blockchain. It’s a signal. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

Bitcoin has broken above the $120,000 price level. XRP, on the other hand, hasn’t found it as easy to establish a firm breakout, although it has pushed as high as $3.10 in the past 24 hours. Technical analysis points to possible short-term price gains if resistance levels holds, but it also outlines a scenario where both Bitcoin and XRP could face another round of declines in the coming week. Related Reading: Space Meets Crypto—Spacecoin Executes 1st Blockchain Transaction Beyond Earth XRP’s Struggle Against The Downtrend Technical analysis of XRP’s daily candlestick timeframe chart, which was posted on the social media platform X by a crypto analyst called Guy on the Earth, shows that XRP’s price action in the past 48 hours is pushing above a downtrend resistance, with the top of its consolidation rectangle at $3.12 now in focus. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency narrowly missed this target during its latest surge, stalling at $3.10 before slipping back to $3. However, XRP has so far managed to retest and find support on the downtrend line, which suggests there is still a chance for continuation higher. However, the analyst noted that the rally could fade quickly, unless XRP can closes the week and hold above the $3.12. A drop back below $3.00 would invalidate the breakout attempt and reopen the possibility of a breakdown to the $2.72 support. The pink circle drawn on the chart below shows the risk of XRP falling back to retest the ascending trendline around $2.40 to $2.50 if $2.72 is broken. XRP Daily Price Chart: @guyontheearth Bitcoin, on the other hand, has been displaying stronger momentum. The breakout above $120,000 has been decisive, and this can be seen as a healthier technical structure compared to XRP. The Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) is also pointing higher, meaning Bitcoin could continue leading the market regardless of whether the next move is up or down. A Big Weekend Ahead For Both Bitcoin And XRP The next few days will be important for both XRP and Bitcoin. The three-day candle closes within hours, and the weekly candle will confirm the broader direction soon after. For XRP, holding above the $3.00 downtrend retest is important to maintain bullish momentum. On the other hand, Bitcoin maintaining strength above $120,000 could confirm its breakout and establish new grounds for further rallies. Failure for Bitcoin to hold above $120,000, would likely usher in another bloody phase next week, with XRP at risk of dropping back toward $2.72 or even lower. The week’s close will determine whether this rally has legs or whether the correction scenario plays out instead.

The move is an evolution in how public blockchain companies raise capital, blending traditional debt instruments with decentralized infrastructure models. Why This Move Redefines Capital Formation For Ethereum DATs In an X post , BitDigital_BTBT revealed that the company has made history as the first publicly traded Ethereum Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) to deploy unsecured leverage through a convertible notes offering, marking a new milestone in blockchain-based corporate finance. The latest move by the financial behemoth will be beneficial to the company shareholders. However, this initiative will enhance capital efficiency for shareholders, without immediate dilution notes due in October 2030. The proceeds will be used to acquire ETH, expand BitDigital’s treasury, and increase institutional staking capacity. This strategic financing deepens BitDigital’s exposure to ETH, while positioning the asset as a programmable treasury instrument capable of generating institution-grade staking yield. By leveraging traditional debt structures within a decentralized framework, BitDigital reinforces its leadership in ETH-native treasury management and staking strategies. The move also signals ETH’s advanced role in institutional finance, bridging the gap between Web3 infrastructure and legacy capital markets. Amid the growing exposure to Ethereum, multiple potential projects are being consistently launched on the leading chain. Kriptoloji, an ambassador at Irys_xyz, points out that their restaking design project’s focus isn’t on flashy incentive yields, but on building genuine utility and layering right on top of ETH’s ecosystem. Kriptoloji noted that most projects in DeFi tend to chase the same hype cycles and loops, but Ekoxofficial is building something different with this move. Instead of creating another yield, it aims to make network participation more seamless, efficient, and sustainable. Meanwhile, the early indicators suggest that a well-received testnet, growing momentum from the Arichain collaboration, and a pipeline of upcoming integrations are starting to establish the foundation for credibility as a long-term infrastructure play rather than a fleeting experiment. “This is not financial advice, but the way they are structuring it’s definitely something worth paying attention to.” Kriptoloji mentioned. Institutional Adoption Strengthens ETH Long-Term Outlook Ethereum is still very much recognized at the institutional level. Goldman Sachs’ latest report reveals a powerful trend unfolding as institutional investors are deepening their involvement with ETH, with over $3.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM) now linked to the ecosystem. This level of exposure highlights the ETH transformation from a speculative blockchain into a critical layer of institutional-grade infrastructure. According to Crypto Patel, Elite KOL CoinMarketCap and Binance, this institutional pivot is one of the strongest bullish signals for ETH’s future.",Ethereum|Assets Under Management|AUM|binance|BitDigital|Coinmarketcap|Crypto Patel|DAT|digital asset treasury|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|goldman sachs|Kriptoloji,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 22:30:47

Source: Annbessa (X) On-chain observers note XRP remains above the one-week 50 EMA at $2.77 after a prolonged consolidation that preceded the 2024 breakout. With Bitcoin trading above $123,000, altcoin rotation has favored XRP’s short-term momentum. Frequently Asked Questions What are the immediate support and resistance levels for XRP? Immediate resistance sits at $3.10; support levels to watch are $3.00 (pivot), $2.90, and $2.80. Maintaining $3.00 is critical for a push toward $3.30–$3.50. How much institutional interest is there in XRP ETFs? Early ETF adoption is measurable: the XRPR ETF holds $77.6 million in assets, suggesting growing institutional allocation to XRP via spot ETF exposure. Key Takeaways Pivot level : $3.00 is decisive for next directional move. ETF tailwinds : XRPR ETF assets ($77.6M) show institutional demand forming.

His latest analysis comes as the asset continues to face resistance below $3.10 despite Bitcoin’s strong rebound. At the time of writing, XRP trades around $2.95 , up roughly 45% since the start of the year but still significantly below its historical peak. In contrast, Bitcoin recently reclaimed $122,000, reinforcing its dominance during the current market recovery. The Historical Role of the Chasm Line According to EGRAG’s multi-year price analysis, the Chasm Line has historically served as a marker for XRP’s cyclical tops. His chart review, based on three-week intervals, shows that XRP has approached or interacted with this trendline in previous market cycles, with each retest signaling a major turning point. #XRP – The Chasm ($10.30) : As of today, the price of touching The Chasm is $10.30 . As time goes on, the price of the Chasm continues to rise. ONLY FEW AND PATIENCE TRULY GETS IT #XRPFamily STAY STEADY and STRONG , Together We Rise and Soon We Shall Fly… pic.twitter.com/rTA4YAkvta — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 3, 2025 For instance, XRP peaked at $1.96 in April 2021 during the 2020-2021 bull run. This price coincided with the Chasm Line, which subsequently acted as resistance. The token struggled to break above that level and later entered a period of correction as overall market momentum slowed. XRP demonstrated similar behavior in the 2017–2018 cycle. In May 2017, the token surged to $0.3988, aligning with the Chasm Line at the time. Although it experienced a short-term pullback, XRP later exceeded the trendline, rising to a record high of $3.31 by January 2018. EGRAG classified this breakout as an exception rather than the norm but noted that it underscored the importance of this technical level as a long-term reference point. What the Chasm Line Means for Today’s Market In the current cycle, the Chasm Line appears much higher, now positioned near $10.3. EGRAG’s analysis suggests that XRP would need to rally to at least this level to retest the trendline. Achieving that target would represent a more than threefold increase from current prices and could mark the lower boundary of a potential cycle top if the pattern continues to hold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While such a move may appear ambitious, EGRAG pointed out that historical cycles indicate that XRP has the potential to extend beyond this line under favourable conditions. In the 2017 cycle, XRP advanced more than 600% above the Chasm Line before its eventual peak. Applying a similar trajectory in the current context could imply prices exceeding $70, although he acknowledged that such levels may not be realistic within this market phase. Market Outlook and Analyst Commentary EGRAG emphasized that investors who maintain long-term positions may be best positioned to benefit from the next significant rally, reiterating the importance of patience. This perspective aligns with comments from financial educator Coach JV, who has consistently advised that meaningful movements in XRP tend to occur rapidly once market catalysts align, leaving little time for late entrants to participate. Other analysts have also weighed in on potential price targets. Market observer Mikybull recently suggested that XRP could be approaching the final upward phase of its current cycle, projecting a conservative target between $6 and $10 , with an extended target of $21 under ideal conditions. The Chasm Line remains a focal point in EGRAG’s technical framework, serving as both a benchmark for XRP’s cyclical performance and a reference for assessing its future potential. If XRP were to approach or surpass this line again, it could signal a new phase of market expansion. However, reaching such levels would depend heavily on sustained momentum across the broader cryptocurrency market and renewed investor demand for XRP.

The discussion highlighted that the two agencies intend to cooperate on crypto regulation, despite having little history of collaboration. Alignment on Crypto Rules Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham acknowledged at Monday’s roundtable that while the SEC and CFTC have had many opportunities to work together for market participants and global capital markets, unclear regulatory boundaries have sometimes caused friction and difficulties for the public. Pham said she was pleased that both regulators are now aligning rules to reduce unnecessary costs, support responsible innovation, and create fair competition. She pointed to the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint as early examples of coordination, suggesting that greater harmonization could lead to increased efficiency, clarity, and expanded investor access to digital assets. Addressing concerns about the CFTC’s effectiveness, Pham reported that from January 20 to September 3, the agency has carried out 18 non-enforcement actions and 13 enforcement actions, with some involving digital asset lawsuits. Since September 4, the Commission has initiated 14 more legal proceedings in just a few weeks. The acting chair said these figures show that the CFTC is active and effective, adding that “there needs to be no more FUD about what’s happening on the other side of town.” The roundtable also featured panels on market structure and innovation, with discussions on topics such as extended trading hours, perpetual contracts, prediction markets, and crypto assets. The participants included executives from major crypto firms such as Kraken, Robinhood, and Crypto.com. On the sidelines of the recent event, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said that crypto is the agency’s “top priority right now.” He also identified asset tokenization as a key area of regulatory focus, cautioning that it may take a year or two to establish proper guardrails, and described its potential as “pretty much endless.” Earlier in the year, the financial watchdog had held discussions on tokenization and crypto regulation, with the aim of harmonizing rules amid increasing crypto adoption. Tensions Rise Over Classification of Tokenized Securities Elsewhere, the crypto X community has reignited debate over how tokenized securities should be classified. The conversation follows tensions at the recent joint panel, where traditional finance representatives resisted innovation exemptions and advocated for strict fungibility requirements under Reg NMS. Crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro argued that tokenized securities should indeed be fungible. In response, former regulatory adviser Justin Slaughter questioned the belief that these instruments are inherently derivatives, suggesting they could represent either the underlying asset itself or an idealized version. Shapiro countered that such ambiguity may reflect poor tokenization practices through SPVs and similar structures, compared with more native approaches like Superstate or MetaLeX.

52680220,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-ada-and-magacoin-finance-emerge-as-a-power-combo-for-smart-investors/,1759622340,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52680220.jpeg,Cardano (ADA) and MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerge as a Power Combo for Smart Investors,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-ada-and-magacoin-finance-emerge-as-a-power-combo-for-smart-investors/,"With the new crypto bull run making waves in the market, two names are attracting the attention of forward-looking investors: Cardano (ADA) and MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining status among investors as one of the promising digital assets for 2025. Together with ADA, they are stable and explosive assets that anyone looking to build a strong portfolio should consider adding. Cardano Builds Long-Term Trust Cardano is trading at near $0.89 and has regained momentum. The project has always focused on research, scientific rigour, and a slow-but-steady approach to blockchain development. Supporters of Cardano make a strong argument in favor of the crypto asset. Unlike competing crypto assets such as Ethereum and Solana that have seemingly caught on faster, Cardano has a decently sized user base to reflect upon the future success of the crypto coin. The ecosystem is growing, and applications for DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and governance are coming along. Future upgrades that will boost scalability and interoperability are in the works, leading commentators to believe ADA could soon be seen by institutions. ADA has had a strong recovery from its lows and now has stabilised just under the important $1 level. According to technical analysts, ADA has the potential to retest levels of $1.20-$1.30 if it manages to secure a firm break above resistance at $1, provided the market continues to remain bullish. Smart Money Eyes ADA Many large holders, often referred to as whales, have been buying more ADA. This shows that they believe Cardano has a future in blockchain. The increasing accumulation trend, along with rising unique wallet addresses, hints that another breakout could be in the cards for ADA. Institutional interest is also a key factor. Cardano is poised to integrate with traditional financial firms thanks to its strong commitment to compliance and sustainability. As global regulations tighten, Cardano’s nature as a supposed slow and steady project might be more of a blessing. MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outpace Solana’s Early Days While ADA provides the foundation of stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating the type of hype reminiscent of Solana’s early explosive growth. Analysts are already noting that MAGACOIN’s momentum is surprising even the most optimistic forecasts, with early-stage investors anticipating massive upside potential. If current growth continues, MAGACOIN FINANCE could eclipse the early returns that Solana delivered when it rose from under $1 to triple-digit prices in just a few years. The project has gained traction by tapping into retail enthusiasm and institutional curiosity at the same time. Its limited supply, strong presale performance, and ambitious roadmap have set it apart in a crowded market. By positioning itself as both accessible to smaller investors and appealing to larger funds, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out a unique position in the 2025 bull market. As capital flows increasingly rotate into early-stage projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most attractive bets for those who don’t want to miss the next generational altcoin success story. ADA’s Role in Investor Portfolios Many investors are now looking at ADA as a necessary token for long-term blockchain exposure. ADA’s proven track record, growing developer community, and strong institutional prospects make it a great way to balance riskier assets in a portfolio. The ability of the token to survive through previous bear markets has certainly contributed to its reputation as one of the safer long-term plays on crypto. ADA has a great case to eventually be considered as a core digital asset along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, due to its sustainability narrative plus iterations. Conclusion The ongoing bull run is creating opportunities for established tokens and new tokens to shine. Cardano (ADA) offers reliability, as a well-known crypto with strong fundamentals, while MAGACOIN FINANCE has breakout potential to do a Solana, or better. This is an opportunity that you don’t want to miss. Together, they form a powerful combination for investors: ADA as the solid foundation, and MAGACOIN FINANCE as the high-upside play. In 2025, the smartest portfolios may very well be those that include both.

52679628,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85380,1759622453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Predicts Timeline for $100 XRP,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-timeline-for-100-xrp/,"Crypto market analyst 24hrscrypto1 has shared a bullish outlook for XRP, stating that the digital asset could reach the $100 milestone sooner than 2030. Although he initially projected a five-year window for the target, he now believes the price surge may happen even earlier, citing growing confidence in XRP’s long-term fundamentals and utility within the financial sector. At the time of his remarks, XRP was trading around $3.02, but it has declined to $2.94, meaning it would need to appreciate by more than 3,301% to reach $100. Despite the steep climb, 24hrscrypto1’s position reflects an increasing sentiment among XRP supporters who believe that broader adoption and sustained market recovery could drive such exponential growth. Increasing Optimism Among Analysts Several analysts have suggested that XRP could eventually reach $100, indicating that this target is not just a singular prediction. Several figures in the crypto community have shared similar expectations over the past year, reinforcing growing confidence in the asset’s long-term trajectory. My firm belief is that XRP will reach $100 by 2030… But honestly, I think I’m wrong. It’s going to happen sooner than that. — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) October 3, 2025 Earlier in 2025, Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer at CryptoCharged, described an XRP valuation between $100 and $1,000 as highly attainable within the next decade. He attributed this prediction to XRP’s expanding role in cross-border payments and global remittance solutions, areas where the token has established a strong presence through Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions. Similarly, Linda Jones, a well-known crypto wealth strategist, reiterated her belief that XRP could eventually trade at $100. While she did not specify a timeline, Jones emphasized the importance of holding the asset long-term, noting the dramatic difference between XRP’s early prices and today’s valuation. She illustrated this by comparing her early $100 purchase, which once bought 400 XRP, to the same amount now buying fewer than 35 XRP, emphasizing the coin’s gradual increase in value over time. Her view was supported by community figures like Rob Cunningham, host of KUWL.show, who advised investors to stay patient, and Mr. Hillard, another early adopter, who shared that his early accumulation of XRP has yielded consistent satisfaction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Contrasting Forecasts for XRP by 2030 Although optimism is high, projections for XRP’s price in 2030 vary widely across analysts. Among the most ambitious assessments is a Valhil Capital study , which applied its “Athey & Mitchnick Model” to estimate XRP’s potential fair value at $4,813 by 2030. The model considers factors such as global adoption, liquidity, and transactional velocity. In contrast, more conservative estimates from Changelly and Telegaon place XRP between $21 and $48 by 2030, while Bitwise suggests a possible upper limit of $30. Despite differing figures, most projections share a common theme: strong expectations of significant long-term appreciation compared to XRP’s current market price. Assessing the Market Cap Challenge For XRP to hit $100, its market cap would need to exceed $5.9 trillion, representing a 32x increase from its current valuation of around $181 billion. This level of growth would position XRP among the largest global financial assets, raising questions about the practicality of such projections. Nonetheless, some analysts maintain that this level of expansion could be achievable if institutional adoption, bank integrations, and tokenization of financial assets continue to grow at their current pace. The expanding use of Ripple’s technology across global payment systems could also strengthen XRP’s utility, potentially driving demand and long-term valuation. While opinions vary on XRP’s $100 target, the recurring forecasts among analysts reflect increasing optimism about its future significance in the digital financial landscape. Whether or not this price level materializes before 2030, the ongoing discussion underscores the sustained optimism surrounding XRP’s role in the crypto economy.

52680086,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85359,1759623319,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"7 Altcoins Leading the Next Bull Run Including XRP, SOL, ETH and Top New Cryptos to Join Now",https://timestabloid.com/7-altcoins-leading-the-next-bull-run-including-xrp-sol-eth/,"Top new cryptos to join now are shaping the final stretch of Q4 2025 as market sentiment heats up. Bitcoin is holding strong at support, Ethereum’s ascending triangle points toward the $3,000 mark, and Solana is regaining its stride through dApps and NFT activity. Analysts are split on whether the rally will peak before year-end, but one project is already capturing attention: MoonBull ($MOBU). With its blend of meme culture and structured tokenomics, it isn’t just background noise—it’s positioning as a core contender for those seeking entry before the cycle turns. MoonBull ($MOBU) demonstrates why it belongs in every conversation about the top new cryptos to join now. Built on Ethereum, it leverages liquidity locks, token reflections, and supply burns to strengthen scarcity while rewarding holders. Its presale format with multiple stages, combined with staking rewards and governance features, gives it more utility than typical meme plays. Ripple continues to expand into finance, Cardano keeps delivering upgrades, yet MoonBull has emerged as the freshest breakout pick. As momentum builds through October, it’s proving to be more than hype—staking its claim as one of the projects to watch closely going into 2026. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Meme Energy Meets Real Mechanics MoonBull ($MOBU) is structured around auto-liquidity, reflections, and supply burns, ensuring every trade pushes its ecosystem forward. Community members are rewarded passively while liquidity deepens and token supply shrinks, creating sustainable scarcity. Unlike short-lived meme projects, MoonBull is audited, liquidity-locked, and fully transparent. This makes it a meme-driven token with functional mechanics that encourage stability. Its staking program promises an impressive 95% APY, while referral rewards bring viral potential. Community governance ensures each holder has direct influence. By combining memes with mechanics, MoonBull positions itself as a project that transforms trading conviction into actual returns and collective ecosystem growth. MoonBull’s presale rollout spans 23 stages, steadily tightening supply and rewarding early participants with better entry points. Fifty percent of its total 73.2 billion tokens are committed to this phase, supported by allocations for staking, liquidity, and referral growth. Stage 10 unlocks staking, while Stage 12 delivers governance rights. A unique launch safeguard prevents dumping, ensuring entry prices hold firm. Deployed on Ethereum, MoonBull is backed by security, liquidity, and scale. This combination of structure and strength has placed MoonBull presale into spotlight discussions as the best crypto to buy now and one of the top new cryptos to join now. Top New Cryptos to Join Now: Moonbull’s 27.40% Surge Is Next Moonbull is leading the list of top new cryptos to join now. In Stage 4 at $0.00005168, the token has already attracted over $200K in tally and 700+ holders. With its listing price set at $0.00616, ROI projections sit at 11,800%. A $5,000 entry secures 96.7 million tokens, which rise to $595,975 by launch. With a 27.40% price surge expected next, Moonbull presale is proving why early movers are locking in their allocations before the next stage begins. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): Still the Market’s Anchor in Q4 2025 Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor heading into Q4 2025. It is consolidating near crucial levels, with analysts eyeing $80,000 as the next upside target. ETF inflows continue to support liquidity, while trading volumes hold steady across global exchanges. Institutions are still active, cementing Bitcoin’s role as the backbone of digital finance. Despite volatility, its position as digital gold has only grown stronger. Bitcoin continues to attract both newcomers and veterans. For many, no portfolio feels complete without BTC exposure. Its dominance frames the narrative for every altcoin, influencing which projects are spotlighted as top new cryptos to join now. Market setups indicate a decisive Q4 ahead for Bitcoin. Technical patterns show consolidation zones forming strength before a breakout. Traders are watching whether BTC will initiate the rally or simply provide stability for altcoins to thrive. Whichever path plays out, Bitcoin remains essential to crypto market direction. Its presence creates liquidity, confidence, and gravitational pull that other projects rely upon. Without Bitcoin’s foundation, few tokens can sustain broader adoption. That’s why it remains not only the original but also the most important benchmark asset in the sector. Altcoins may grab headlines, but Bitcoin writes the market’s story. 3. BullZilla (BZIL): A Meme Powerhouse With Bold Potential BullZilla has built its identity as a viral contender in the meme economy, positioning itself as the top meme coin to buy now. Its branding has immediate recognition, designed to spread across TikTok, Discord, and Twitter feeds. Beyond aesthetics, BullZilla has structured its tokenomics to strengthen community growth. Scarcity mechanics mirror viral meme tokens of the past but with added engagement strategies for stronger longevity. Early chatter highlights grassroots adoption, with community-driven promotions fueling liquidity and consistency. Unlike projects that fade after initial excitement, BullZilla has created a repeatable cycle of engagement, making its presence difficult to ignore. The coin’s biggest strength lies in its culture. Participants are not only holding tokens but actively building memes, stories, and integrations that expand the brand. This viral feedback loop makes BullZilla unique among new meme projects. If Dogecoin and Shiba Inu showed what cultural power can achieve, BullZilla is shaping its own trajectory by locking its focus on branding and engagement. Whether it cements itself as a permanent player depends on execution, but few meme projects are structured with this level of attention. In the race to become crypto’s cultural icon, BullZilla has the raw potential. 4. La Culex: Why It’s Being Ranked as a Top Meme Coin La Culex is quickly capturing the attention of the meme coin community with its playful style and strong engagement. Built around creativity and collective energy, it offers more than just short-lived trends. The project’s ability to spark conversations and attract participants highlights why it is being discussed as a top meme coin to follow in the coming cycles of 2025. What makes La Culex stand out is the energy of its supporters who continue to amplify its presence across platforms. Meme tokens live and die on community strength, and La Culex is proving it has the momentum needed to thrive. With rising chatter and growing traction, it is steadily cementing its reputation as a top meme coin, one that blends fun with genuine staying power in the wider crypto conversation. 5. Ethereum (ETH): Gearing Up for Another Breakout Ethereum remains at the center of crypto adoption as Q4 2025 begins. Its price action is coiling within an ascending triangle, with analysts eyeing $3,000 as the key level to reclaim. If it breaks through, projections point toward higher highs by year-end. Beyond technicals, Ethereum dominates decentralized finance, NFT markets, and smart contract ecosystems. Its rollup upgrades continue to reduce fees and strengthen scalability. Ethereum’s unmatched developer base and vast network effect ensure its relevance. For many community members, ETH is a must-hold asset, especially when compiling any serious list of the top new cryptos to join now. Ethereum’s adaptability has secured its leadership across multiple Web3 sectors. From powering complex decentralized apps to enabling yield strategies in DeFi, ETH maintains utility across diverse functions. Its ecosystem is larger than any competitor, making it the prime launchpad for innovations. Institutional adoption through staking further reinforces its position as a strong long-term play. Market signals point toward Ethereum being ready for another defining run in Q4 2025, which could cement its influence once again. Whether held as an infrastructure asset or speculative driver, Ethereum remains one of the most important projects in global crypto discussions. 6. Solana (SOL): The Speedster Regaining Confidence Solana has re-entered the spotlight as one of 2025’s best comeback stories. Known for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, Solana is re-establishing its place as the preferred chain for developers and NFT creators. Q4 adoption metrics show surging activity in decentralized applications and token launches. Reliability concerns that haunted Solana in the past have largely been resolved, giving participants renewed confidence in the network. By late 2025, Solana is climbing charts again, both in ecosystem usage and price performance. It has regained momentum as one of the top new cryptos to join now for utility-driven opportunities. Developers and traders are flocking back to Solana for its speed and efficiency. New partnerships and ecosystem expansions continue to push innovation, with applications spanning from gaming to decentralized finance. Solana’s consistent focus on performance at scale makes it a top contender for long-term relevance. Its recovery underscores resilience and its ability to overcome setbacks. For those who once doubted its staying power, Solana is proving why it can reclaim its former glory.

52681501,597775,1759624255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52681501.jpeg,Bored Ape NFTs Win Big: Court Says They’re Not Securities,https://bitcoinist.com/bored-ape-nfts-win-big-court-says-theyre-not-securities/,"A US federal judge has tossed a high-profile investor suit that accused Yuga Labs of selling unregistered securities through Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs and ApeCoin. The decision , handed down by Judge Fernando M. Olguin, found that the plaintiffs did not meet the legal test for an investment contract. According to reports, the suit dated back to 2022 and was aimed at forcing a legal finding that the tokens were securities; the court disagreed and dismissed the case. Judge Found Howey Test Unmet Judge Olguin ruled the plaintiffs failed to show all three prongs of the Howey Test were satisfied. Based on reports, the court said buyers were not shown to have a shared enterprise tied to Yuga’s efforts, nor were they promised returns that would come primarily from Yuga’s work. The judge emphasized that many BAYC sales were framed as collectibles and membership benefits rather than investment contracts. Plaintiffs Had Argued For Profit Expectations The investors argued that market talk about trading and rare traits created profit expectations. The court, however, saw those claims as too thin to convert a collectible into a security. Purchasers’ fortunes, the ruling noted, were not made to depend directly on Yuga’s future business actions in the way required by securities law. This narrower view left the complaint without the necessary legal footing. Regulators Still Watchful Reports say the SEC has taken enforcement steps in other NFT cases, meaning the space remains under close regulatory scrutiny. Historical actions noted by regulators included instances associated with projects that provided revenue sharing or paid promotional aspects. Courts have not always offered a consistent interpretation of their findings. That uncertainty means that creators and platforms may be facing legal exposure even after the ruling. Not A Complete Shield For NFTs Legal experts cautioned that the ruling does not imply that all NFTs are free from securities claims. Yuga Labs itself has faced other legal fights; in July 2025 an appeals court overturned an $8.8 million judgment that Yuga had won in a trademark dispute and sent that matter back for trial. The mixed outcomes in related suits show courts are treating each case on its own facts. The decision is expected to offer some reassurance to NFT holders and marketplaces, since one major challenge was dismissed. Still, projects that promise revenue sharing, profit splits, or that are marketed mainly as investments could attract a different outcome if challenged. The ruling is useful, but it is not a universal safe harbor.

52681942,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=827754,1759625568,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52681942.jpeg,99.3% of Bitcoin supply in profit could trigger short-term dip,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/99-3-of-bitcoin-supply-in-profit/,"Bitcoin’s supply is almost entirely in profit, and analysts warn this could trigger a short-term correction. Historically, such high profitability has often been followed by brief market pullbacks. According to analyst Ted Pillows, 99.3% of the entire Bitcoin supply is profitable at its present market price of about $121,900. When the BTC supply in profits was above 99% three times, the price corrected by between 3% and 10%. This development comes when traders have been securing profits following prolonged rallies . Pillows claims that the same pattern is forming today. Hence, BTC may experience a temporary decline before resuming its overall upward trend. CryptoQuant data highlights that the price and the percentage of coins in profit move in tandem with Bitcoin. Nearly all holders are back in the black, signaling stronger investor confidence, although the rapid surge raises the risk of market overheating. Bitcoin sentiment strengthens as optimism builds The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has climbed to 63, reflecting growing market optimism . Analyst Darkfost noted that Bitcoin is approaching a new all-time high, though sentiment has not yet reached euphoric levels. He described the market mood as “optimistic but measured,” supporting BTC’s potential uptrend. Standard Chartered projects BTC could reach $200,000 on sustained ETF momentum. Historically, extreme greed levels above 80 have preceded major tops, but with the index now at 63, there may still be room for further gains before sentiment overheats. “At every previous top, we consistently moved into extreme greed territory,” Darkfost said, implying that the market has not yet overheated. Such a combination of robust on-chain statistics and an increase in investor sentiment is a complex picture. Typically, when the level of profitability is high, it leads to significant profit-taking and price corrections. On the other hand, the lack of extreme greed may indicate that Bitcoin still has a chance to recover. To support this view, Bitcoin ETFs experienced record weekly inflows of $3.2 billion in 2025. This reflects strong institutional interest and renewed market confidence. As long as sentiment rises steadily but never reaches the state of euphoria, BTC may have a leg higher to another all-time high. BTC price is consolidating around $121,900. A correction would not be completely bearish, but it would likely be a healthy reset following months of gain. Citi Sees Bitcoin hitting $133K in 2025 on ETF inflows Citigroup projects that BTC will end 2025 near $133,000, another all-time high. That would be a relatively modest 8.75% gain from its current price of around $122,350. BTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView The bank’s base case is for steady growth led by strong inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and rising digital asset allocations from treasuries. As of Saturday, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs held more than $163.5 billion in BTC. Citi is forecasting new inflows of approximately $7.5 billion by year-end, which would provide further support for demand. BTC remains undervalued compared to the price of gold when adjusting for volatility, a team of JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said. The Bitcoin-over-gold volatility ratio has fallen below 2.0, with Bitcoin now absorbing about 1.85 times the risk capital as gold, they wrote in a report on Wednesday.

Ethereum is already languishing at close to $4,300, and a break through key resistance could have it retest its $5,000 all-time high at pace. Historically, ETH’s tendency to lag Bitcoin at the start of a rally has been among the most bullish signs for the market, often being followed by a time frame wherein Ethereum takes the lead and triggers altseason. But whereas ETH remains a blue-chip selection for long-term investors, the focus is shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi altcoin centered on utility that is as low as $0.035, but is already well over 55% sold out during Stage 6 of its presale. Mutuum Finance has the potential to rocket to $5 in 2026 thanks to its real-yield mechanism, dual lending system, and rapidly expanding base of investors. Ethereum Heading to Shoot to $7,000 if Bitcoin Rockets Past $130K Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of new strength as it trudges steadily higher above the $4,300 level, positioning for a potential breakout. Analysts believe a strong break above its key resistance zone would trigger a swift retest of the $5,000 all-time high, with further gains on the horizon if Bitcoin can rally up to $130,000. In the past, Ethereum has lagged behind Bitcoin at the beginning of a bull run, and the majority of analysts assert that this dynamic, labeled as, the most bullish setup of all time, is usually followed by ETH spearheading the altseason once resistance turns into support. As speed picks up and institutional capital delves further into DeFi, some investors are already scouting for opportunities beyond Ethereum, with particular interest in fresh Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that could generate outsized returns in the next wave of market growth. MUTM Presale Momentum Gains Speed MUTM tokens currently cost $0.035 in Round 6 Presale, up 16.17% from the previous round. Very robust investor demand persists with over 16,770 investors trading a cumulative $16.8 million so far. As yet another step towards constructing the security of the platform, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat hackers and developers are encouraged to report bugs. Four levels of bug severities, i.e., low, minor, major, and critical, are offered so that bugs could be recognized on time and rectified. Mutuum Finance Readies Launch of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance is preparing to release its lending and borrowing protocol , an essential step toward increasing its grip in the DeFi space. The V1 will be released on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with required features such as liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and so on. Supporting ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral from its inception, the protocol is designed to offer a robust and user-focused decentralized finance experience. It is based on robust collateral management to protect the network and users. Unrestricted deposit limits, borrowing limits, and collateral ratios are some of the aspects that ensure it is secure. Real-time closing and remediation charges and penalties on undercollateral position stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Make the Most of the Next Big DeFi Breakout Before It’s Too Late As Ethereum is poised to climb towards $7,000 on the strength of Bitcoin’s surge to $130,000, investors are preparing to make the most of the next explosive cycle in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be a strong contender in this round, having amassed over $16.8 million from over 16,770 investors, with Phase 6 of its presale already over 55% sold out and tokens for as little as $0.035. Its twin lending mechanism, real-yield dynamics, and future lending protocol release place MUTM among the next-gen DeFi platforms that have the potential to reach $5 by 2026. Supported by a $50,000 bug bounty and strong security infrastructure, MUTM combines innovation and investor protection. Early entry into the presale could offer a rare chance to seize 100× potential before the next bull run drives it into high gear.

At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention as one of the top best crypto to buy now, offering traders a chance to diversify before capital rotation accelerates. Bitcoin Crosses $120K With ETF Demand Bitcoin rose 0.88% in the past 24 hours to $120,524, adding to a 10% weekly rise. The driver is the surging demand for ETFs. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs brought in $1.3 billion in two days , tightening supply. Data also shows futures open interest jumped 14.6% to $88.5 billion, with institutions buying at a premium on Coinbase. Citibank has recently updated its outlook, setting a base target of $181,000 in 12 months and a bullish case at $231,000 . With limited supply and consistent ETF inflows, traders are watching daily flow data to see if inflows above $500 million continue. If so, Bitcoin could push even higher in the coming weeks. Solana Pulls $291M Inflows as Adoption Grows Solana is drawing attention with $291 million in weekly inflows , taking its yearly inflows to $1.86 billion. This rush of liquidity is linked to expectations around upcoming U.S. ETF approvals. Corporations are also starting to add Solana to their treasuries, with Japanese firm Mobcast Holdings announcing a $10 million SOL buy . This shows how Solana is being used not only for network activity but also as a treasury and corporate reserve asset. With inflows stacking and new institutional adoption coming in, Solana is keeping its place as one of the top best crypto to buy now . MAGACOIN FINANCE Set for Exchange Listings MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched closely as one of the best altcoins to buy now. It is cheap compared to larger assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a smaller market cap that makes it easier for traders to build large holdings. The project has confirmed exchange listings are coming soon , adding urgency for early buyers. Smart money often rotates from Bitcoin into newer altcoins after big moves, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the names likely to catch early flows. With whales looking to diversify and grow positions in smaller caps, this is where attention is shifting. Visit MAGACOIN FINANCE here . XRP Mega Breakout Gains Speed XRP is back in focus after breaking out of a wedge formation that kept it range-bound for months. It has now cleared the $3 level and is trading at $3.05. Analysts describe this as a “mega breakout” and expect further gains if XRP pushes through $3.40 and $3.66. Analysts like Matt Hughes and EGRAG see XRP climbing anywhere between $8 and $27 in the next wave. Some even suggest $50 if ETF approvals arrive. With upcoming SEC decisions on XRP ETFs and Ripple’s pursuit of a U.S. bank charter, the conditions for more upside are aligning. This makes XRP a key pick on the list of the top best crypto to buy now . Ethereum Outlook Turns Bullish Ethereum is holding above $4,500, gaining 2.5% in the past day. Citibank set a base target of $5,400 and a bullish case at $7,300 in its latest outlook, with some traders even eyeing $15,000 down the line. Institutional adoption is still centered on Bitcoin, but Ethereum’s evolving ecosystem, along with ETH ETFs, is driving steady inflows. With altcoins like Solana and XRP gaining traction, Ethereum remains the blue-chip crypto that many consider essential for a balanced portfolio. This keeps ETH among the top best crypto to buy now . How Traders Should Position Bitcoin is setting the pace, but smart traders spread out their bets. Diversifying into Solana, XRP, Ethereum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE makes sense as liquidity rotates across assets. MAGACOIN in particular stands out because it is still cheap and preparing for exchange listings.

Chainlink ($LINK) received 1,963 new addresses on Oct 1, the highest in a month, signaling strong adoption. Chainlink roared back to life on October 1, adding a record 1,963 new addresses as LINK surged over 10% this week. With fresh tech integrations and growing adoption, bullish momentum is building fast despite a slight daily dip. What caused Chainlink’s new-address surge on Oct 1, 2025? Chainlink adoption spiked after on-chain metrics recorded 1,963 new addresses on Oct 1, 2025, the largest daily rise in weeks. This increase aligns with CCIP rollouts, Data Streams integrations, and institutional pilot announcements, which together boosted network activity and investor interest. How many new Chainlink addresses were added and why it matters? On-chain data provider Glassnode reported 1,963 new addresses for Chainlink on Oct 1, a clear uptick from the September daily range of 1,100–1,700. New-address growth is a leading indicator of user adoption and can precede extended price rallies when coupled with demand drivers. Source: Ali Charts Via X How is LINK’s price reacting to the address growth? LINK’s price rebounded to $22.59 following the address surge, riding a short-term recovery trend. The correlation between rising new addresses and price suggests increased demand and participation, which technical setups may confirm if resistance levels are cleared. TradingView shows LINK holding the $20.24 support (0.786 Fibonacci). Bulls are eyeing a breakout in the $23–$24 zone. Confirmed breaches could target $28.98, $35–$39, and a full extension to $46.31. Current price actions show a 3-day gain of 4.09% and price testing the mid-line of an ascending parallel channel. Source: Ali Charts Via X Why do CCIP and real-world integrations matter for adoption? Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and Data Streams integrations expand utility by enabling secure cross-chain transfers and real-time data feeds. The Worldcoin Data Streams integration and Cross-Chain Token standard lower developer friction and increase potential end-user reach. Chainlink Labs and Tools for Humanity characterized the upgrades as pivotal for scaling DeFi and cross-chain payments. These fundamentals complement on-chain metrics, making the adoption signal stronger than isolated price moves. When did institutional pilots add confidence to LINK’s outlook? Institutional pilots with Swift and UBS Asset Management showcased tokenized fund use cases at Sibos, highlighting enterprise interest in Chainlink’s oracle and cross-chain services. These pilots provide institutional validation that supports medium-term adoption narratives. Frequently Asked Questions How does new-address growth affect LINK’s price? New-address growth increases on-chain demand signals, often preceding price rallies when paired with positive fundamentals. For LINK, rising addresses have coincided with higher trading volumes and renewed bullish technical setups. Is the CCIP integration already live? CCIP integrations have begun rolling out, with Data Streams and the CCT standard enabling cross-chain token flows. Adoption timelines vary by project, but early integrations with Worldcoin demonstrate practical use cases. Key Takeaways On-chain signal : 1,963 new addresses on Oct 1 — strongest daily spike in weeks. Technical levels : Key support at $20.24, breakout zone $23–$24, targets to $46.31. Fundamental drivers : CCIP, Data Streams, CCT standard and institutional pilots strengthen adoption thesis. Conclusion Chainlink adoption appears to be accelerating: 1,963 new addresses, CCIP integrations, and institutional pilots together present a cohesive growth story for LINK . Traders should monitor the $23–$24 breakout and on-chain flows for confirmation, while developers watch CCIP rollouts for long-term utility gains. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/chainlink-adoption-oct-1-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""Chainlink adoption spikes as 1,963 new addresses appear on Oct 1, 2025"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-39-1024x576.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Chainlink adoption surged as 1,963 new addresses appeared on Oct 1, 2025, supporting LINK price recovery amid CCIP and institutional pilots.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many new Chainlink addresses were added on Oct 1, 2025?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""On Oct 1, 2025, Chainlink recorded 1,963 new addresses, the highest daily increase in over a month according to on-chain metrics."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does CCIP integration improve Chainlink adoption?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Meta description: Bitcoin price surge driven by low exchange inflows and whale accumulation; discover near-term targets, risks, and trade signals. Read now. What is driving Bitcoin’s recent price surge? Bitcoin price surge is being driven primarily by a sharp decline in exchange inflows and concentrated whale accumulation, which reduce immediate sell-side supply. These on-chain shifts, supported by positive taker-side flows, have pushed BTC toward its all-time high while increasing short-term volatility risk. How low exchange inflows affect Bitcoin’s liquidity? Exchange inflows (30DMA) have dropped to multi-year lows, roughly half the 2020 average. Lower inflows mean fewer coins available for quick selling on centralized exchanges, reducing downward pressure and amplifying upward moves when demand increases. Bitcoin inflow on Binance hits historical lows CryptoQuant data shows Binance and aggregate exchange inflows fell to historic lows, with 30‑day averages slipping below typical multi-year levels. This pattern contrasts past rebounds when inflows spiked as traders realized profits. Source: CryptoQuant Historically, average exchange inflows have been near 11,000 BTC; current readings are roughly half that. The shift indicates more holders choosing self-custody and long-term storage instead of exchange deposits. Exchange Netflow has recorded sustained negative values, with a monthly low near -26k BTC on October 3, indicating net withdrawals from exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant Buyers dominate the market Spot market taker CVD readings turned positive for consecutive days, indicating buyers are aggressively taking liquidity. When takers buy on exchanges, they often withdraw assets to private wallets—supporting the decline in exchange balances. Source: CryptoQuant Who is buying? On-chain exchange balance metrics show large-scale withdrawals by whales. Checkonchain data indicates MegaWhales Exchange Balance Change registered a sharp drop, consistent with tens of thousands of BTC moving off exchanges and into custody wallets. Source: Checkonchain Whale-driven withdrawals imply accumulation rather than distribution. Historically, prolonged whale accumulation has preceded extended bullish runs for BTC. Is a new ATH within reach for BTC? Reduced exchange selling and concentrated accumulation have pushed BTC close to its all-time high. Momentum indicators—Stochastic RSI and DMI—show strong trend strength but also overbought readings that increase the chance of short-term corrections. Source: TradingView If inflows remain low and whales continue accumulation, BTC is likely to test $123,700 and its ATH near $124,517, with upside possible beyond that level. Conversely, overbought conditions could cause buyer exhaustion and a corrective move toward $116,821. Frequently Asked Questions How do exchange inflows signal market direction? Exchange inflows measure coins deposited to exchanges; sustained declines reduce immediate selling supply and often precede price appreciation if demand remains steady. What does whale accumulation mean for retail traders? Whale accumulation typically reduces available supply and can create powerful upward pressure; retail traders should monitor on-chain balance shifts and risk-manage around momentum indicators. Are momentum indicators reliable at extremes? Momentum indicators like Stochastic RSI can confirm trend strength but often signal short-term exhaustion when extreme; use them with liquidity and flow data for context. Key Takeaways Supply squeeze : Exchange inflows are at multi-year lows, tightening sell-side liquidity. Concentrated demand : Whales are withdrawing and accumulating BTC off exchanges, supporting price. Manage risk : Extreme momentum readings increase short-term volatility risk; maintain stop management. Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent rally is rooted in reduced exchange inflows and significant whale accumulation, creating a supply-constrained environment that supports higher prices. Momentum indicators suggest both continuation potential and elevated volatility risk; traders should combine on-chain flow metrics with technical signals for informed decisions.

52682163,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85366,1759626955,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,8 Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025: One Presale is Gaining Momentum,https://timestabloid.com/8-top-cryptos-to-join-in-october-2025-one-presale-is-gaining/,"The crypto market in 2025 has become a stage where meme coins and legacy networks alike battle for dominance. From explosive presales to chains powering global finance, the rise of community-led projects and groundbreaking ecosystems has ignited new debates. For those searching the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025 or even eyeing the best new coins launching October 2025, the hunt is more than speculative, it’s survival of the loudest. Now enters BullZilla ($BZIL), a project wrapped in lore, fire, and unapologetic ambition. Other Best cryptos Uptober rally 2025, like Polkadot (DOT), MoonBull, LaCulex, Avalanche (AVAX), Hedera (HBAR) will each carve their role in this cycle, but none shout louder than BullZilla presale 48h update. 1. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Meme King That is Breaking Records BullZilla isn’t just another ERC-20 meme coin; it’s a cinematic movement in Presale coins with ROI 2025. BullZilla continues to dominate the narrative of best meme coin presales in October 2025 and Top cryptos trending this week, attracting both retail and whale investors. Currently in its Stage 5B presale, it raised over $770,000 with 30 billion tokens sold. Its deflationary mechanics, including the “Roar Burn” system and mutation-driven growth phases, give it an edge over other upcoming crypto presale projects this month. With more than 2,400 token holders, BullZilla is proving itself as one of the top presale crypto coins 2025. Community engagement further enhances BullZilla’s reputation. Weekly AMA sessions, regular burn updates broadcasted live on-chain, and 24/7 market hype keep investors motivated. Its presale model rewards early entry with cheaper tokens, making it one of the 1000x potential presale altcoins of this year. How to Buy BullZilla Coins To join the roar, buyers can follow a straightforward process: First, install a Web3 wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Fund it by purchasing ETH through a trusted exchange, such as Coinbase or Binance, and then transfer it to your wallet. Next, connect directly to the official BullZilla presale portal. From there, select the ETH allocation, confirm the swap, and the $BZIL purchase is locked in. Allocations become claimable once the presale completes. BullZilla doesn’t sell hope, it sells inevitability. Each progressive stage heightens scarcity and amplifies rewards for holders. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s an ETH presale narrative with claws, designed to slice through noise. Among the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025, few carry the same firepower or market theatrics. 2. Polkadot (DOT): Cross-Chain Innovation With Staying Power Polkadot remains one of the most technically sophisticated ecosystems in the blockchain universe. Founded by Ethereum co-creator Gavin Wood, it focuses on interoperability through parachains, allowing multiple blockchains to operate seamlessly under one relay chain. In the race for the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025, DOT continues to earn its spot as a foundational layer of Web3. Market analysts project that Polkadot’s growing ecosystem of parachain projects could rival Ethereum in terms of developer activity by late 2025. This isn’t meme-driven hype; it’s infrastructure-level value that stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Ethereum and Avalanche. When compared against a lore-driven coin like BullZilla, DOT demonstrates the other side of crypto’s spectrum: pure, technical utility. Together, they showcase why both DOT and BullZilla are critical among the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. 3. MoonBull Coin: Next Big Meme Coin MoonBull Coin is quickly capturing attention as one of the freshest meme-driven presale projects on the market. Inspired by the unstoppable drive of bulls charging toward the moon, MoonBull combines scarcity mechanics with community-first growth. Its presale is structured to reward early adopters through staged price increases, similar to BullZilla’s progressive Mutation Engine model, but with an added focus on liquidity pools and staking rewards that aim to stabilize long-term growth. The narrative surrounding MoonBull taps into the same energy that propelled Dogecoin and Shiba Inu but aligns it with structured tokenomics. With a capped supply, referral bonuses, and deflationary burns embedded into its roadmap, MoonBull isn’t just positioning itself as a hype coin , it’s building a foundation for exponential growth. Investors looking beyond the obvious giants now view MoonBull as an exciting addition to the meme coin battlefield. While still early in its presale journey, the project has already started building a loyal online community across Telegram and X (Twitter), laying the groundwork for explosive traction once listings begin. For those scouting the best crypto presale to buy, MoonBull offers both narrative strength and mechanical innovation. 4. LaCulex: From Buzz to Swarm La Culex is the meme coin that proves even the tiniest buzz can turn into a global roar. Inspired by the humble mosquito, this project has taken one of the most annoying sounds in the world and transformed it into a movement that crypto traders can’t stop talking about. With La Culex price still low enough to tempt early investors, $CULEX is being hailed as one of the Top meme coins to join this month. It’s not just about the humor, it’s about the swarm effect, where community, tokenomics, and timing come together to create a project that feels both playful and powerful. What makes La Culex stand out is how it balances fun with fundamentals. While the mosquito theme drives the memes, its structured presale, community growth, and deflationary design give it long-term potential. Early adopters are already buzzing about returns, and with $CULEX shaping up to be the Best Crypto to Buy Now, it’s capturing attention at the perfect time, the holiday season, when traders are hunting for the next breakout coin. In short, La Culex has turned an insect into an investment, and this swarm is only getting bigger. 5. Stellar (XLM): The Bridge Between Fiat and Blockchain If Polkadot is the architect of Web3, Stellar (XLM) is the diplomat. Stellar focuses on remittances, cross-border payments, and connecting traditional financial systems with blockchain. Founded in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, XLM has steadily evolved into a go-to protocol for settlement and liquidity. Its use cases strike directly at the heart of global finance, where trillions move daily. The XLM token is integral, used for transaction fees and maintaining network integrity. Compared with meme projects like BullZilla, Stellar feels clinical. Yet the irony is that both rely on narratives, Stellar’s is rooted in solving systemic inefficiencies, BullZilla’s in commanding cultural chaos. Both models win attention, but Stellar offers a less volatile bet. As the best new coins launching September 2025 gain traction, Stellar’s reliability keeps it in focus and cements it within the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. 6. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): The Legacy of Scalability Bitcoin Cash emerged in 2017 as a fork of Bitcoin, aiming to fix scalability issues through larger block sizes. While Bitcoin remained rigid, BCH embraced bigger blocks to process more transactions at lower fees. For years, it was overshadowed by the original, but in 2025, renewed attention has revived BCH as a practical payments network. BullZilla may offer cinematic gains, but BCH provides pragmatic adoption. The crypto battlefield needs both: spectacle to drive retail attention, and practical rails to support usage. This duality is why both BCH and BullZilla deserve their place in the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. 7. Avalanche (AVAX): The Speed Demon of Layer-1s Avalanche has built its reputation as one of the fastest blockchains, achieving sub-second finality and throughput rivaling Visa. Founded by Emin Gün Sirer, AVAX uses a novel consensus mechanism that blends classical protocols with Nakamoto security. In 2025, Avalanche’s expanding ecosystem of DeFi, gaming, and tokenized assets ensures it remains among the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. Narratively, AVAX sits at the intersection of speed and institutional legitimacy. Unlike BullZilla’s lore-driven chaos, Avalanche delivers technical certainty. Both are essential to the 2025 cycle, where the best new coins launching September 2025 include everything from meme-fueled rockets to enterprise-ready platforms. For traders, Avalanche’s ecosystem growth could rival Ethereum’s DeFi summer, making it a serious competitor within the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. 8. Hedera (HBAR): Governing the Next Internet Hedera Hashgraph offers something rare in crypto: enterprise-grade governance combined with unique consensus mechanics. Unlike traditional blockchains, Hedera uses hashgraph technology, promising high throughput, low fees, and fairness in transaction ordering. With a governing council that includes Google, IBM, and Boeing, Hedera brings heavyweight credibility. Compared to meme phenomena like BullZilla, Hedera embodies the sober side of crypto. But that doesn’t mean it lacks upside. If enterprises adopt Hedera en masse, HBAR could experience exponential demand. In the wider narrative, Hedera and BullZilla showcase how crypto thrives both in boardrooms and in internet memes, a duality fueling the best new coins launching September 2025 and keeping Hedera firmly within the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. Conclusion: Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025 Based on the latest research, the BullZilla, Polkadot, MoonBull, LaCulex, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, Avalanche and Hedera narratives converge into a single truth: the crypto market in 2025 is louder, faster, and more diverse than ever before. From mutation-driven presales to enterprise blockchains, the opportunities are as vast as they are volatile. BullZilla presale leads the charge with its aggressive pricing model and lore-driven mechanics, offering 1000x potential for early believers. Meanwhile, projects like DOT, XLM, BCH. This is why they remain central to any serious discussion about the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. This isn’t a quiet evolution, it’s a mutation. The market just got louder. Join the BullZilla presale now, or risk watching from the sidelines as the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025 change the game forever.

According to technical analysis, Dogecoin may be on its way to hitting new all-time highs, with $0.8 marked as the next bullish target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rockets Past $119K, Analysts Now Eye $130K Target Analyst Doubles Down On Bold Dogecoin Forecast A new analysis by Mikybull Crypto, a prominent market expert on X social media, reveals that Dogecoin has completed the critical phases of a Bump and Run reversal chart pattern—a setup that historically precedes explosive breakouts. With price action already reclaiming its trendline, the analyst has doubled down on earlier forecasts, predicting that the DOGE price could experience an explosive surge toward the $0.8 level. Sharing a price chart, Mikybull clearly highlights the textbook Bump and Run reversal, which consists of a lead-in phase, a bump phase, and a final breakout followed by a throwback to the trendline below $0.23. DOGE’s weekly price action has mirrored this chart structure, with the recent move back to retest the broken resistance now serving as a potential springboard for the next phase. In technical terms, this “throwback” often marks the last opportunity for accumulation before the real rally begins. Mikybull, who has been closely tracking Dogecoin’s macro setup, emphasized in his X post that “the main bullish rally is about to kick off.” In an earlier update, the analyst described the upcoming bull phase as a “face-melting rally,” noting that the Bump and Run pattern is rare but extremely reliable when confirmed. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading slightly above $0.25, and a rally to the projected $0.8 target would represent a massive gain of approximately 220%. Such a move would propel DOGE’s price beyond its 2021 record high of $0.73, setting a fresh ATH with an additional 9.6% upside. DOGE Breakout Structure Reinforces Rally Setup A second technical analysis by crypto market expert Unipcs on X delivers a similar bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price. His chart highlights a tightening wedge structure, where DOGE has been consolidating below long-term resistance while forming a series of higher lows. Recently, the price broke out from this compression zone, reinforcing the meme coin’s bullish narrative. Unipcs reiterated that “DOGE to $1 is a meme until it isn’t,” suggesting that this cycle could deliver the long-anticipated push toward the $1 price level. He further noted that Dogecoin looks primed for an aggressive move that could generate strong spillover effects for other major meme coins in the market. Related Reading: Space Meets Crypto—Spacecoin Executes 1st Blockchain Transaction Beyond Earth In an earlier post, he pointed out that Dogecoin’s structure still looked bullish on the Higher Time Frame (HTF), coinciding with the FED interest rate cut and the DTCC listing of a new Dogecoin ETF in September. With Digital Asset Trusts (DATs) and institutional players already accumulating, the analyst maintains a strong bullish stance on the meme coin’s price outlook.

Examples of the support areas Renault intends to reduce by 15% include human resources, finance, and marketing. This is part of the company’s cost-saving project known as “Arrow.” The reduction is anticipated to result in approximately 3,000 job losses at the firm’s headquarters in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, and at other locations worldwide. This development follows the introduction of a commercial version of the French automaker’s new Renault 4 E-Tech crossover. Still, you would be hard-pressed to identify it as a work vehicle at first glance. Called the Societe, this new line of electric cars for professionals skips the traditional van look in favor of something much more subtle. In 2021, Renault unveiled a concept inspired by the classic Renault 4 Fourgonnette, sparking hopes for a retro revival. But with the new 4 E-Tech Societe, the automaker opted for a more budget-friendly approach. Renault plans to reduce its workforce by 3,000 jobs amid cost-cutting measures Regarding the workforce reduction , the French newsletter cited a source with knowledge on the topic of discussion, which is close to the company, revealing that a final decision could be made by the end of this year. When reports requested that Renault comment on the situation, the car manufacturer confirmed that it is exploring cost-cutting measures. However, the company stated that no specific number has been decided on since they have not yet finalized this decision. According to a spokesperson for Renault, the firm has embraced this approach due to increasing uncertainties in the automotive market and the intense competitive nature of the industry. “Therefore, we are looking into ways to streamline our operations, improve execution speed, and lower our fixed costs,” the spokesperson added. The total number of Renault’s workforce in 2024 was 98,636 employees globally. In July, the car manufacturer announced a net loss of € 11.2 billion, roughly equivalent to $13 billion for the year’s first half. This included a €9.3 billion write-down related to its partner, Nissan. Notably, without this write-down, the net income would have decreased to € 461 million, which is lower than one-third of the previous year’s. This drop resulted from a weaker van market, increased costs related to electric vehicles, and pressure from swift industry competition. Renault faces significant challenges in its operation Analysts have raised concerns about how Renault’s CEO, François Provost, manages the company’s profit margins. According to them, Provost, who replaced Luca de Meo in July when the owner of Gucci Kering poached him, needs to address profit margins as soon as possible. They also highlighted that he needs to work to bring Renault’s credit rating back up to an investment grade, while figuring out how the relatively small car company can survive US tariffs and stiff competition from Chinese rivals. This issue was raised after reports from sources revealed that although Renault has been largely protected from US tariffs, as it does not have a footprint there, it has been indirectly hit by greater commercial pressure as European rivals seeking new markets outside the United States step up efforts to sell in its home region of France. In the meantime, the company reported zero growth in second-quarter sales volume and cautioned that sales performance was weak in June. It also faces increasing competition from Chinese newcomers in the electric car and hybrid markets. Barclays analysts suggest that Renault may have experienced slower price-mix momentum during the first half of the year. The company is due to announce full first-half results soon.

Summary: Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan of Bitwise told Solana Labs that institutional investors favor blockchains with rapid finality and high throughput. Hougan said Solana’s settlement speed improvements and low-latency confirmations make it particularly suited for stablecoin issuance and real-world-asset tokenization. Speaking on Oct. 2 with Solana Labs’ Akshay Rajan, Hougan emphasized that Wall Street audiences find Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios “hard to get their heads around,” while stablecoins and tokenized assets present clear, actionable opportunities. Source: Matt Hougan What is the institutional case for Solana? The institutional case for Solana centers on ultra-low latency, predictable finality and throughput that support high-frequency settlement needs. Financial firms prioritize networks where settlement times and unstaking windows align with fund liquidity and ETF redemption mechanics. How does Solana’s settlement speed compare? Solana’s settlement latency has improved from around 400 microseconds to about 150 microseconds according to industry reporting. Those microsecond-level gains reduce execution uncertainty and are attractive to asset managers designing tokenized securities or stablecoin rails. Why are stablecoins and tokenization important to institutions? Stablecoins enable near-instant transfers and programmable money rails, while tokenization converts stocks, bonds and real estate into tradable digital assets. Institutions see both as tools to streamline settlement, increase market access and reduce processing friction. How big is Solana’s stablecoin market? Solana’s on-chain stablecoin supply is reported at $13.9 billion, representing roughly 4.7% market share in stablecoin tokenization. By contrast, Ethereum holds approximately $172.5 billion on-chain in stablecoins, roughly 59% market share; layer-2 networks raise Ethereum’s share further when included. What do industry leaders say? Industry figures note that total value locked (TVL) is only one metric. Some strategists recommend the EVM ecosystem for issuing new stablecoins due to tooling and interoperability, while others stress Solana’s performance and evolving custody solutions as differentiators for institutional use cases. What is Bitwise’s current exposure to Solana? Bitwise offers the Bitwise Physical Solana ETP, a fully backed product that provides institutional-grade custody for SOL exposure. The ETP has attracted modest assets relative to BTC and ETH products, with roughly $30 million in assets under management at the most recent reporting. When will regulators decide on a spot Solana ETF? The SEC’s decision on Bitwise’s spot Solana ETF is scheduled for Oct. 16, 2025. Approval would create a new regulated vehicle for institutional and retail investors to access SOL under a familiar fund wrapper. Frequently Asked Questions Can Solana replace Ethereum for stablecoins? Solana offers performance advantages that appeal to certain institutional workflows, but Ethereum currently leads in on-chain stablecoin volume and developer tooling. Adoption will depend on liquidity, regulatory clarity and custody infrastructure. Is Solana suitable for tokenizing real-world assets? Yes — tokenization use cases require speed, throughput and secure custody. Solana’s performance profile aligns with these needs, while issuers must also consider legal frameworks and interoperability. Key Takeaways Performance matters : Solana’s low-latency finality aligns with institutional trading requirements. Market share gap : Ethereum currently dominates stablecoin on-chain value, though Solana’s share is rising. ETF watch : Bitwise’s spot Solana ETF decision (Oct. 16, 2025) could materially affect institutional access to SOL. Conclusion Solana’s technical strengths—speed, throughput and rapid finality—are driving renewed institutional interest in stablecoins and tokenized assets. Bitwise’s public endorsements and product launches underscore that trend, while Ethereum remains the dominant settlement layer today. Market participants will watch custody infrastructure, liquidity and the pending SEC decision to gauge whether Solana can capture meaningful institutional share.",Bitcoin|Ethereum|News|BTC|ETH|SOL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-05 02:08:54

The hunt for the top crypto to buy in 2025 has already begun, and the names on the shortlist are starting to crystallize. This isn’t about yesterday’s headlines; it’s about spotting momentum before the rest of the market catches on. Investors are circling like hawks, watching which projects have the strength to push through 2025’s volatility and which ones are destined to fade into obscurity. TRON and Chainlink are making noise with strategic updates, but one presale is already creating the kind of upward pressure that turns casual buyers into long-term holders. That project is MoonBull , and its mechanics are why it’s being called the top crypto to buy in 2025. MoonBull’s Mechanics Put It Ahead as the Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 MoonBull is built around a system that flips traditional token selling on its head. Known as the Bull’s Engine, this mechanism transforms every sell into growth for the ecosystem. Two percent of each trade is poured back into liquidity, deepening the pool and making trading smoother. Another slice goes directly to holders, rewarding them instantly without extra effort. Finally, one percent is permanently burned, reducing the total supply and steadily increasing rarity. Instead of fearing sell pressure, MoonBull thrives on it,making it one of the smartest contenders for the top crypto to buy in 2025. The project also hands power directly to its community. Beginning at Stage 12, governance comes alive with one token equaling one vote. Holders aren’t spectators,they’re decision-makers. Proposals on burns, campaigns, or ecosystem incentives are shaped by the people who actually hold the token. This level of transparency is rare, and it builds trust where other projects often stumble. Combined, these mechanics explain why MoonBull is viewed as the top crypto to buy in 2025 by those looking for both utility and upside. Presale Numbers That Could Define the Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 MoonBull’s presale isn’t moving, it’s sprinting. Currently in Stage 4 at $0.00005168, over $200k has been raised, with more than 700 holders already onboard. The math speaks volumes: from Stage 4 to the listing price of $0.00616, the potential ROI exceeds 11,800%. Early participants who joined in earlier stages have already secured gains of over 106%. The next stage comes with a 27.40% price jump, which means every delay costs real upside. To put that into perspective, a $2,500 buy today secures nearly 48 million tokens. At listing, that same position could be worth close to $295,000. It’s the kind of setup analysts describe as “catching lightning in a bottle.” Or better yet, like finding Ethereum when most people were still joking about smart contracts. These numbers make a clear case: MoonBull isn’t just another presale; it’s positioning itself as the top crypto to buy in 2025. TRON ($TRX): Building Steady Momentum TRON has carved its niche as a blockchain designed for speed and accessibility. With a market cap above $31 billion, TRON is a serious player in the global crypto economy. Recent data shows TRX trading near $0.33, supported by strong on-chain activity and daily transaction volumes exceeding $590 million. Its emphasis on scaling digital payments and supporting decentralized applications continues to attract both developers and investors. While TRON may not deliver the explosive growth of a presale like MoonBull, its consistency and strong usage base make it a valuable addition for those evaluating the top crypto to buy in 2025 across different categories. It’s not the moonshot,it’s the foundation. Chainlink ($LINK): Oracles Powering the Future Chainlink remains one of the most trusted names in blockchain infrastructure. Its decentralized oracle network connects smart contracts to real-world data, powering everything from DeFi lending platforms to insurance solutions. LINK has been holding steady near critical support levels, with developers continuing to expand its reach across multiple chains. The most recent updates focus on enhancing security and interoperability, making Chainlink even more essential to Web3’s backbone. Investors looking at the top crypto to buy in 2025 should not overlook LINK’s role in anchoring reliability. It may not generate meme-coin style buzz, but it drives the rails many other tokens depend on. Conclusion: Why MoonBull Takes the Spotlight TRON builds scale. Chainlink delivers trust. But MoonBull brings scarcity, rewards, and community governance together in a way that creates compounding momentum. With its 23-stage presale model, deflationary mechanics, and direct voting power, MoonBull is making a compelling case as the top crypto to buy in 2025. Its presale is live, numbers are climbing, and stages are closing fast. Opportunities like this don’t pause. For those determined to secure a spot in what could be the top crypto to buy in 2025, the window is open now,but not for long.

XRP consolidates for 300+ days under its prior ATH near $3.70, signaling accumulation. 0.618 Fibonacci and descending triangle set key resistance and support levels. SEC ETF decisions and early XRPR fund volume ($38M day one) could drive institutional flows. XRP breakout: Monitor $3.01–$3.05 trigger, $3.40–$3.66 resistance, and ETF rulings; read analysis and trade levels now. XRP’s 300-day consolidation near its all-time high signals a potential breakout. Analysts eye $3.40 and $3.66 resistance levels. XRP consolidates for 300+ days below its previous ATH around $3.70. 0.618 Fibonacci levels near $3 act as key resistance zones. Approval of XRP ETFs by the SEC could trigger institutional inflows and liquidity. Primary keywords: XRP breakout, XRP ETF approval. LSI keywords: XRP consolidation, all-time high, Fibonacci retracement, descending triangle, resistance levels, support zones, institutional inflows. What is driving the XRP breakout potential? XRP breakout potential is driven by a prolonged 300-day consolidation just below the $3.70 all-time high combined with technical pressure in a descending triangle. A break above $3.01–$3.05 could accelerate momentum toward $3.40 and $3.66, while SEC ETF rulings may add institutional demand. How could XRP ETFs affect price action? Approval of spot XRP ETFs would likely increase institutional inflows and liquidity, raising demand. Early market evidence shows XRPR fund volume reached $38 million on day one, indicating investor appetite. Rejection could spark volatility and short-term downside, but current market positioning prices in a potential positive catalyst. XRP is holding strong up 1.39% in the last 24 hours and nearly 10% over the past week. With momentum building, traders are eyeing a potential breakout toward $3.70. Why does the 0.618 Fibonacci level matter? The 0.618 Fibonacci retracement often marks significant resistance in corrective structures. For XRP, the 0.618 zone aligns near $3, creating a confluence with the descending triangle’s upper trendline. Confluence increases the probability of a clear rejection or, if overcome, a rapid bullish extension. What technical levels should traders watch? Key levels to monitor: Trigger: $3.01–$3.05 — daily close above could validate a breakout. Immediate resistance: $3.13 and $3.25. Primary targets: $3.40 and $3.66; extended target $4.20 if momentum is strong. Support: $2.75–$2.80 and downside targets $2.86 or $2.67 if invalidated. Source: galaxyBTC Via X Trading near $3.02 now, XRP is pushing against a major resistance level at $3, highlighted by the important 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. Recent weeks show the price squeezed inside a descending triangle, signaling growing pressure for a big move soon. How to trade a potential XRP breakout? Step-based approach: Wait for a confirmed daily close above $3.05 before entering long positions. Use layered targets at $3.13, $3.25, $3.40 and $3.66; scale out into resistance zones. Place protective stops under $2.80–$2.86 to limit downside risk. Source: Ali Charts Via X If XRP breaks out, watch for resistance at $3.13, $3.25, and $3.40, with a target near $3.66. Strong buying could even push it toward $4.20. But if it can’t clear these levels, XRP might fall back to support around $2.86 or $2.67, staying within the descending triangle’s lower edge. Frequently Asked Questions Will an XRP ETF approval cause a price surge? Yes. ETF approval typically increases institutional access and liquidity, which could lift prices. Historical ETF flows in crypto have often produced short-term spikes due to concentrated capital inflows and improved market legitimacy. When are the SEC rulings expected? The SEC is expected to rule on several spot XRP ETF applications in mid-to-late October, with a notable decision on Grayscale’s request scheduled by October 18. Market participants are pricing in outcomes ahead of these dates. Key Takeaways Consolidation: XRP has traded near its ATH for 300+ days, signaling accumulation. Technical trigger: Daily close above $3.01–$3.05 would validate a breakout setup. Regulatory catalyst: SEC ETF rulings could provide institutional inflows and heightened volatility. Conclusion In summary, XRP breakout potential rests on a clear technical trigger above $3.01–$3.05 and a favorable regulatory outcome for spot ETFs. Traders should watch resistance zones at $3.40 and $3.66 and manage risk under $2.80. COINOTAG will monitor price action and regulatory updates for possible tradeable catalysts.

The meme coin has managed to maintain bullish momentum in the past 24 hours after ending September consolidating. This recent move has kept Dogecoin’s uptrend intact on the daily chart, and according to technical analysis shared on the social media platform X by analyst Javon Marks, this structure could be setting the stage for a powerful upward move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rockets Past $119K, Analysts Now Eye $130K Target Breakout Structure And Higher Lows According to Marks, Dogecoin’s current price formation could be the early stages of a massive rally that carries the meme coin to $0.65 in a quick move. This prediction is based off a clear sequence of higher lows (HL) and higher highs that has been forming on the Dogecoin price chart. This formation is on the 5-day candlestick timeframe chart, and it goes as far back as the 2022 bear market. The first higher low started from the capitulation low in 2022 and continued through 2023 into 2024. Each higher low shows growing buyer interest after every correction, which is a sign of bullish continuation on higher timeframes. The most recent example came during September’s downturn, when Dogecoin found a strong support at $0.22. Rather than breaking down further, the price rebounded from this level to create yet another higher low in the series. This response was important because it confirmed that Dogecoin’s uptrend was still intact. Marks points out that this upward structure of higher lows means that another wave up is likely to be in the works. Therefore, the current phase between $0.22 and $0.25 now is more of a build-up before the next explosive move higher. Dogecoin 5-day price chart: Javon Marks on X The Case For A 153% Rally To $0.6533 Marks’ projection goes beyond a simple breakout. The analyst projected Dogecoin to go on to create another higher high in the coming weeks and months. This wave up could be an over 153% run from Dogecoin’s current price level. His chart identifies $0.6533 as the immediate target for this wave. Achieving this level would require Dogecoin to more than double from its current price, but this is not unprecedented given its price history. If Dogecoin were to reach the $0.6533 breakout target, it would be its strongest bullish rally since early 2021. However, this is still below its 2021 all-time high of $0.7316, meaning there’s still room for further upside if bullish conditions persist. Interestingly, the analysis also noted that Dogecoin might extend the rally above the $1 threshold. Particularly, the second price target is at $1.25711, although this may seem far-fetched in the short term.

The design of this new framework is a response to long-standing concerns within regulated finance about the reliability and compliance of tokenization systems. Instead of relying on custom smart contracts, the XRPL now integrates compliance and control features directly into its protocol, expanding its appeal in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) . Dr. Martin Hiesboeck, head of research at Uphold, explained that this standard addresses operational risks that have hindered other platforms. By embedding essential tools into the base layer of the ledger, the amendment reduces the complexity and cost of developing compliant financial products.

It includes mechanisms for freezing assets, fund clawbacks , and identity-linked transfer restrictions. Hiesboeck noted that these functions enable issuers to align quickly with sanctions or recover assets in cases of fraud or error. Another key feature is the use of decentralized identifiers and credentials, which ensure only verified participants can hold or transfer certain assets. This strengthens trust in the system while meeting regulatory demands. Additionally, every token returned to its issuer is automatically removed from circulation, creating a transparent and auditable supply record. Technical Strengths for Financial Institutions The standard is structured to serve high-volume settlement environments. It benefits from the XRPL’s speed, offering transactions completed in 3 to 5 seconds with very low fees. Each transaction fee is paid in XRP, which is then permanently destroyed , linking network usage to the reduction of XRP supply.

This enables tokens to carry machine-readable contractual data, such as maturity dates or settlement terms. The integration reduces the need for external reconciliation systems, making the XRPL a more attractive infrastructure for regulated finance. Direct Impact on XRP’s Utility The adoption of MPT ties XRP more closely to real-world financial activity. Every issuance and transfer consumes a small amount of XRP, while reserves are locked to create and maintain token objects. These functions reduce circulating supply and link XRP’s value to measurable financial operations rather than speculation alone. Hiesboeck emphasized that this shift strengthens XRP’s role as a utility asset . He stated that MPT was created to meet the compliance expectations of institutions and designed to operate on a global scale. With tokenized real-world assets projected to represent trillions of dollars in value, the XRPL is positioning itself as a secure and compliant platform for institutional adoption.

The rally followed a massive demand for U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). which collectively registering a net inflow of $3.24 billion last week. This marks the second-largest weekly inflow on record, according to data provider SoSoValue. Other tokens such as XRP, ETH, SOL, DOGE followed BTC's lead, gaining 1% to 3% during the Asian hours. Haven demand BTC's rally arrives against the backdrop of a continued U.S. government shutdown, which analysts say has heightened safe-haven demand for the top cryptocurrency. Jeff Dorman, Chief Investment Officer of Arca, noted just before the shutdown began, ""The only time I buy BTC is when society loses faith in governments and local banks. $BTC likely a good buy here ahead of yet another U.S. government shutdown."" Beyond political uncertainty, experts point to significant macroeconomic factors driving the rally. Noelle Acheson, author of Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, explained, ""beyond the escalating risk of new conflicts, US inflation is more likely to increase than decrease, increased borrowing around the world will intensify currency concerns, and what’s good for gold is also good for BTC, especially since it is still woefully under-allocated."" ""Plus, the incoming rush of market support – lower rates, yield curve control and lots and lots of “money printing” – will boost global liquidity, which will seep into the riskier corners of institutional portfolios,"" she added. In short, BTC looks set to chalk up impressive gains during the seasonally bullish month of October.

That makes this the most expensive stock market the U.S. has ever seen. It also means valuations are now more than double the size of the actual economy. This ratio has long been Warren’s go-to signal for spotting market bubbles. It’s simple: when market cap flies too far above GDP, the stock market is basically running on fumes. And right now, it’s looking like the market is floating on hope, hype, and a lot of talks about AI. Tech stocks rally as shutdown fears fade Even as the government drowns in budget drama, Wall Street saw solid gains this week. The S&P 500 rose 1.4%, Dow Jones tacked on 1.5%, and the Nasdaq matched the S&P’s 1.4% jump. AI-driven optimism is still juicing investor appetite, even while analysts throw warning flags. A deeper look at the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a chunk of stocks now sitting in the “overbought” zone. That includes names like Robinhood, Micron, Western Digital, and Fair Isaac. An RSI above 70 suggests that a stock may be overheated. CNBC Pro filtered for stocks with an RSI above 70 and at least a 5% gain this week. Turns out, some of these names are flying a little too close to the sun. Let’s start with Robinhood, which hit an RSI of nearly 76 after a 20% rally this week. The push followed its addition to the S&P 500 in late September, which pulled in a wave of investors. Bank of America raised its price target to $157, up from $139, suggesting about 7.7% upside from Friday’s close. Analyst Craig Siegenthaler wrote : “We believe HOOD is positioned to perform well long-term as the broker continues to scale its business, launch additional products and capabilities, deepen current client relationships, and expand its TAM both domestically and internationally.” Micron and Western Digital trigger overbought warnings Micron Technology, one of the big AI winners this year, has now seen its stock more than double. This week alone, it surged again after smashing expectations on both earnings and revenue Tuesday. The company also gave a strong forecast for the next quarter. Revenue rose 46% year-over-year. That rally pushed its RSI to 81.7, a strong overbought reading. Despite the run-up, analysts polled by LSEG say the stock could fall 4%, based on an average price target of $179.07. Meanwhile, Western Digital is even more overstretched. Its RSI sits at a crazy 87.7, making it the most overbought stock of the week. Like Micron, it’s been riding the AI hardware wave, especially storage demand. It logged double-digit gains this week, and it was already one of the top-performing stocks in Q3. But LSEG analysts are warning that the stock could crash 22% from here. Other AI-linked hardware names also made the list: Intel, Super Micro Computer, and Lam Research. All saw big weekly gains and RSIs above 70, pointing to a potentially crowded trade. Another surprise entry on the overbought list is Fair Isaac, the firm behind the FICO score. The stock popped 20% after the company revealed a new model that lets mortgage lenders skip the credit bureaus entirely. Its RSI is now above 79. That Thursday jump was its biggest one-day gain since November 22. Still, the stock remains down for the year, despite this week’s rally. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Sharing a chart that depicts a strong bullish structure, he stated that “XRP literally has the opportunity to go for the most face-melting pump of all time.” At the time of his analysis, XRP traded near $3.04. The market structure shows the asset’s sharp rise in late 2024 and early 2025, followed by a multi-month consolidation phase . After a brief surge in July, the digital asset dipped again. However, the chart shows a major breakout with an aggressive move on the horizon. XRP literally has the opportunity to go for the most face-melting pump of all time pic.twitter.com/9NXg9DTScT — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) October 3, 2025 Growing Institutional Interest in XRP While Cobb did not cite specific catalysts for the projected increase, several ongoing developments could provide the conditions for a rally. One factor is the discussion surrounding the potential approval of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for XRP, which would open up exposure to a broader base of investors. Similar products in other digital assets have driven significant inflows when launched. 3iQ’s spot XRP ETF, which launched in Canada in June, has outperformed expectations , and market participants in the U.S. anticipate massive growth, with projections of $5 billion in inflows within the first month . Institutional participation continues to expand as large-scale investors search for assets with liquidity and established global utility. XRP has frequently been positioned as a solution for efficient cross-border payments, giving it a practical use case that may appeal to traditional finance players. Growing adoption across different regions further supports this perspective. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additional Bullish Factors Another important backdrop is monetary policy. The Federal Reserve’s recent decision to cut interest rates , with the possibility of further easing in the coming months, has shifted market expectations. In a lower-rate environment, capital often seeks higher-yielding or alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. XRP could benefit if more investors incorporate digital assets into their portfolio strategies. This alignment of favorable conditions, including potential ETF approval, institutional inflows, network adoption, and macroeconomic policy, creates a landscape where strong price acceleration remains possible. Technical traders are already monitoring XRP’s chart structure, while fundamental factors provide additional reasons for optimism. The projection shared by Cobb reflects confidence in XRP’s ability to extend its rally from current levels. While the timing and scale of such a move remain uncertain, the market structure and external drivers present a compelling setup.

The move came after nearly two weeks of testing the same level. The rally unfolded amid what is now the longest U.S. government shut down in history under the 45th and 47th president, Donald Trump. Lawmakers failed to agree on funding, and by Wednesday the shutdown officially began. The timing pushed investors toward decentralized assets. Bitcoin jumped 14% in just a week. Traders wanted a hedge as Washington failed to govern. The shutdown added more stress to a market already on edge. Bitcoin rises as shutdown and politics collide Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered said, “The shutdown matters this time around.” He noted that during Trump’s last shutdown from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, Bitcoin barely moved because it was “in a different place than now.” This time, the crypto is reacting directly to political risks. Geoff added, “However, this year bitcoin has traded with ‘US government risks’ as best shown by its relationship to US treasury term premium.” Standard Chartered had predicted less than two days ago that Bitcoin was about to set a new high. They also said the coin could reach $135,000 soon after. But traders are also moving into other assets. Spot gold surged 0.5% to $3,876.55 per ounce on Friday, capping a weekly gain of more than 2%. The demand for havens reflects the same pressures driving crypto higher. Trump, speaking during the standoff, warned that benefit programs could face cuts if no deal is reached. He threatened reductions for what he called “large numbers of people.” The remarks only fueled more concern about instability. At the same time, Bitcoin has climbed about 30% in 2025. More Wall Street firms are adding it to portfolios, treating it as a credible allocation. Global investors are also shifting, seeing it less as a trading toy and more as part of a larger strategy. On-chain data shows what big holders, or whales, are doing. The 30-day metric that tracks balances shows a sharp decline through September 2025. Whales sold a significant amount during the past month, creating downward pressure. Charts showed a red zone of heavy selling. But signs of exhaustion are clear. As prices climbed, whale selling slowed down. In early October, the pace eased. Data shows the purple zone narrowing, a signal that the selling pressure is fading. Whales have been net sellers for weeks, but now there’s a hint they might be shifting into a new re-accumulation phase. If that continues, it could backstop the short-term rally. For now, the market has shown that even during political gridlock, Bitcoin can set records while traditional systems stall.

Despite the exploit that disrupted operations and the decline in activity that followed, she maintains that Shibarium is equipped for recovery and long-term growth. Her comments highlighted resilience, the role of its community, and the expansion of new utilities that could strengthen the blockchain as it moves into its next phase. Why Shibarium Will Survive and Come Back Stronger Shibarium is bruised, not broken. The recent exploit and the drop in activity shook confidence, but they also lit the fire for a stronger rebuild. Survival in crypto is not about avoiding setbacks. It is about how you rise after… pic.twitter.com/DykjWelgAc — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) October 1, 2025 Addressing Security Concerns The hack that affected Shibarium revealed vulnerabilities within the system, but Lucie highlighted that steps are already underway to address them. The Shibarium network was exploited on September 12, 2025, when attackers drained an estimated $2.3 to $4.1 million by manipulating validators through a flash loan. The incident caused a decline in the value of ecosystem tokens, forced a halt in bridge operations, and redirected attention toward improving network protections. In response, the development team is tightening validator control, implementing enhanced security measures, and conducting additional audits. Rather than being a permanent setback, Lucie framed these issues as opportunities for the network to reinforce its defenses and become more robust over time. Strong Infrastructure and User Base Another point Lucie underlined is the scale of Shibarium’s existing operations. The blockchain has already processed over one billion transactions and has seen hundreds of millions of wallets onboarded. While activity slowed in the aftermath of the exploit, this level of infrastructure does not simply disappear. Lucie noted that it forms a strong base upon which renewed activity and growth can be built. The Role of the Shib Army Community engagement remains one of Shibarium’s strongest assets. Lucie described the Shib Army as loyal and persistent, highlighting that this movement goes beyond technology and taps into collective commitment. In her view, SHIB holders are not easily discouraged by setbacks, and their continued involvement provides the network with stability and energy that many other projects lack. Expanding Beyond Its Meme Origins Lucie also drew attention to Shibarium’s efforts to grow past its beginnings as a meme-driven blockchain. She pointed to ongoing developments in areas such as stablecoins, decentralized finance, NFTs, gaming, and even discussions of a Layer 3 network. This push toward expanding utility, she argued, is essential for Shibarium’s evolution from a speculative asset into a blockchain with lasting relevance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community-Led Token Burns Token burns remain another mechanism for strengthening the ecosystem, and Lucie stressed that they are not just a technical process but a community-driven initiative. The more Shibarium is used and developed, the greater the impact of these burns. She described this as a reinforcing cycle that ties the network’s success to the active participation of its holders. Lucie concluded by framing Shibarium’s challenges as part of a larger recovery story. In the broader cryptocurrency space, comebacks are often celebrated, and if Shibarium manages to rebound, it could strengthen its reputation significantly. With its scale, community backing, and ongoing development efforts, she insisted that the network is far from finished. Instead, she sees Shibarium as evolving, with its next chapter set to be defined by stronger infrastructure and renewed focus.

Exchange reserves hit six-year lows More than 114,000 BTC (~$14 billion) left centralized exchanges in the past fortnight. Glassnode reports 2.83M BTC on exchanges; CryptoQuant shows ~2.45M BTC, a seven-year low. Bitcoin exchange balances tumble to six-year lows; learn why 114,000 BTC left CEXs and what it means for supply and price — read expert analysis now. Bitcoin exchange balances plunged to six-year lows as over $14 billion left CEX platforms in a fortnight, as the asset powered to a new peak price. Bitcoin exchange balances have fallen sharply as the asset climbed to new highs, signaling reduced available supply on centralized trading platforms. This move is driven by transfers to self-custody, institutional treasuries, and OTC flows, which historically supports upward price pressure. What are Bitcoin exchange balances and why do they matter? Bitcoin exchange balances measure how many BTC are held on centralized exchanges and represent the effective “available supply” for trading. A decline in exchange balances usually indicates coins moving to long-term custody or institutional holdings, reducing immediate sell pressure and potentially supporting higher prices. How fast did exchange reserves fall and which data sources report this? Blockchain analytics provider Glassnode reported total BTC on centralized exchanges at about 2.83 million BTC , a six-year low. CryptoQuant reports a slightly lower figure near 2.45 million BTC , which would equate to a seven-year low. Glassnode also estimates that over 114,000 BTC (~$14 billion) left exchanges in the past fortnight. BTC balance on exchanges dropped to 2019 levels. Source: Glassnode How are market participants reacting to dwindling exchange liquidity? Market participants and industry experts are noting tighter liquidity on exchange books. VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, said traders are already discussing potential short-term shortages. Market chatter from OTC desks — quoted by traders — suggests some liquidity providers expect sell-side inventories to deplete quickly as futures sessions open. What does this mean for price action and short-term outlook? With fewer BTC available on exchanges, price formation can become more sensitive to buy-side demand. Bitcoin recently reached a new all-time high near $125,700 (Tradingview), reclaiming territory above prior peaks. Reduced exchange reserves combined with renewed buying interest helps explain the rapid move higher. BTC prices reach a new peak. Source: Tradingview Why are holders withdrawing BTC from exchanges? Holders move BTC off exchanges for several reasons: self-custody for long-term storage, institutional allocations to treasuries, and OTC transfers to buyers not using public order books. When coins leave exchanges, they typically become less likely to be sold quickly, reducing available liquidity. Are the on-chain signals consistent across analytics platforms? Yes. While Glassnode and CryptoQuant use different classification methods, both show pronounced outflows and low exchange reserves. Discrepancies in absolute numbers reflect methodology differences; the directional signal — sharp decline in exchange-held BTC — is clear across providers. Frequently Asked Questions How much Bitcoin left exchanges recently? Glassnode reports over 114,000 BTC moved off centralized exchanges in the last two weeks, valuing roughly $14 billion at recent prices. Does low exchange balance guarantee higher prices? Lower exchange balances reduce available sell liquidity, which can amplify price moves when buy demand increases, but price outcomes also depend on macro events and trader behavior. Key Takeaways Exchange reserves are low : Centralized exchange BTC balances are at multi-year lows, tightening available supply. Significant outflows : More than 114,000 BTC (~$14B) left exchanges in a fortnight per Glassnode. Price implications : Reduced exchange liquidity can support stronger price rallies if demand persists. Conclusion Centralized Bitcoin exchange balances have dropped to six- to seven-year lows, driven by transfers to self-custody, institutional holdings, and OTC flows. These outflows coincide with a new price high and suggest tighter available supply. Monitor exchange reserves and on-chain metrics for signals of sustained market strength. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin exchange balances fall to multi-year lows as 114,000 BTC leave exchanges"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin exchange balances fell to six-year lows as over 114,000 BTC (~$14B) left centralized exchanges in a fortnight, tightening available supply amid new price highs."", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199b2ae-be57-70f3-a379-9ebbfbd02288.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-05T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-05T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much Bitcoin left exchanges recently?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Glassnode reports over 114,000 BTC left centralized exchanges in the past two weeks, amounting to roughly $14 billion at recent prices."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why do falling exchange balances matter for price?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Falling exchange balances reduce available sell-side liquidity, which can magnify price moves when buy demand increases, though other market factors also influence price."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin exchange outflows"", ""description"": ""A short guide to understanding what large BTC transfers off centralized exchanges indicate for supply and price."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check exchange reserve metrics"", ""text"": ""Compare exchange reserve data from multiple analytics providers to confirm directional trends."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess destination addresses"", ""text"": ""Determine whether flows go to self-custody, institutional wallets, or OTC counterparties to infer holder intent."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor price reaction"", ""text"": ""Watch how reduced exchange liquidity affects order book depth and price volatility during buying pressure."" } ], ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199b2ae-be57-70f3-a379-9ebbfbd02288.png""} Published: 2025-10-05 · Updated: 2025-10-05 · Author: COINOTAG",Analysis|Bitcoin|News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-05 04:59:13

Solana nears $260 resistance; weekly close above could trigger a rally toward $520. On-chain metrics show rising TVL and growing DEX volumes, supporting network liquidity. Technical indicators — MACD, 50-day and 200-day SMAs — confirm bullish momentum with weekly gains above 7%. Solana resistance near $260: weekly close above $260 could spark a $520 rally — read on for on-chain data, technical setup, and trading considerations. What is the current Solana resistance level and why does it matter? Solana resistance sits near $260; a weekly close above $260 is widely viewed as the trigger for a sustained bullish phase. A confirmed breakout would align price action with on-chain growth, creating a path toward higher resistance zones up to $520 within a multi-month horizon. How strong is the on-chain evidence supporting a Solana bull case? On-chain data shows tangible increases in Total Value Locked and DEX activity. Solana’s TVL reached roughly $12.647 billion with a daily rise of 3.97%, and decentralized exchange volumes show expanding DeFi usage. These metrics indicate growing liquidity and utility, which historically support price appreciation when paired with technical breakouts. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/solana-260-resistance-analysis"" }, ""headline"": ""Solana Nears $260 Resistance; Weekly Close Could Ignite Rally Toward $520"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-46.png"", ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-45.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Solana resistance near $260: a weekly close above $260 could spark a rally to $520, supported by rising TVL and bullish technicals.""} Why would a weekly close above $260 matter for SOL price action? Weekly closes confirm institutional and longer-term trader conviction. Closing above $260 would indicate that sellers at prior highs have been absorbed and that bullish order flow dominates. Historically, such weekly confirmations precede extended rallies, especially when backed by improving on-chain metrics and moving average alignment. Solana Approaches Key Resistance Zone Solana is trading near $229 and is approaching a decisive range around $240–$260. Price history shows a peak near $260 in late 2021, a multi-month drawdown in 2022, and a recovery phase that formed higher lows into 2025. Analysts note that a weekly close above $260 would open upside targets at $280, $360, $440 and $520. A weekly close above $260 could ignite a Solana $SOL bull rally to $520. pic.twitter.com/ZfkD2gcaHV — Ali (@ali_charts) October 3, 2025 The weekly chart shows resistance bands at $240, $280, $360, $440 and $520, with support identified at $160 and $80. Analyst Ali stated: “a weekly close above $260 could ignite a Solana bull rally to $520,” outlining a multi-step path with consolidation and resistance tests along the way. Source: TedPillows (X) Market momentum remains constructive. SOL traded with weekly gains of roughly 7.15% and sits above key moving averages. Analyst Ted highlighted a cluster of long liquidation orders between $200–$220, which may serve as a liquidity sweep zone before continuation. Support near $200 is considered robust by multiple on-chain observers. What do on-chain metrics and technical indicators reveal? Solana’s on-chain fundamentals support the bullish outlook: TVL near $12.647 billion and stablecoin market cap around $15.115 billion indicate sizable liquidity on network. DEX volume of approximately $4.126 billion reflects expanding DeFi activity, increasing transaction throughput and fee capture potential. Source: DeFiLlama Technicals are aligned: MACD histogram displays rising positive momentum and SOL trades above the 50-day SMA ($212.82) and the 200-day SMA ($169.20). Pattern analysis from ZYN notes three corrective phases near -24% historically, each followed by strong recoveries; the current structure matches prior recovery behavior pointing toward $280–$300 in the near term. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret a Solana breakout above $260"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step guide to assess Solana price action and on-chain confirmation for a breakout above $260."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Check weekly close"", ""text"": ""Confirm a clean weekly close above $260 to validate breakout strength."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Verify on-chain metrics"", ""text"": ""Confirm rising TVL, increasing DEX volumes, and stablecoin liquidity as evidence of fundamental support."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Monitor technical indicators"", ""text"": ""Watch MACD momentum and SMA alignment; a MACD crossover and price above 50/200 SMAs strengthen the bull case."" } ], ""totalTime"": ""P1M""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What happens if Solana closes above $260 on the weekly chart?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A weekly close above $260 would likely confirm a bullish breakout and could lead to a multi-month rally toward higher resistance levels such as $280, $360, and potentially $520, supported by rising TVL and bullish technical indicators."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which on-chain metrics support Solana's price strength?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key supporting metrics include a TVL near $12.647 billion, a stablecoin market cap around $15.115 billion, and DEX volumes of roughly $4.126 billion, all indicating increasing liquidity and DeFi activity on Solana."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How should traders manage risk around $200–$220 liquidity zones?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Traders should watch for liquidity sweeps and use layered stop-losses; the $200–$220 zone may host long liquidations but also acts as a strong support area if absorption occurs."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How likely is a Solana rally to $520 after a breakout? Historical price structure and current on-chain growth make a rally to $520 plausible after a confirmed weekly breakout, but the move depends on sustained liquidity, macro conditions, and follow-through from institutional buyers. When will a breakout be confirmed on the weekly timeframe? A breakout is confirmed when price closes the weekly candle above $260 with above-average volume and supportive on-chain inflows, reducing the chance of a false breakout. Key Takeaways Resistance level : $260 is the critical weekly resistance that could determine the next trend phase. On-chain support : TVL (~$12.647B) and DEX volumes (~$4.126B) indicate improving network liquidity. Technical confirmation : MACD positivity and price above 50/200 SMAs support a bullish bias; manage risk around $200–$220 liquidity pools. Conclusion Solana’s approach to the $260 resistance combines technical momentum and improving on-chain fundamentals. A weekly close above $260 would strengthen the case for a multi-stage rally toward higher targets like $520.

52689765,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85403,1759640571,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Pundit to XRP Family: Is October Going to be a Crazy Good Month for XRP?,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-family-is-october-going-to-be-a-crazy-good-month-for-xrp/,"Crypto commentator Austin Hilton recently shared his perspective on how October may unfold for XRP, pointing to broader market behavior and historical data. In a new video, Hilton broke down the impact of Bitcoin’s market dominance, seasonal performance trends, and external economic factors such as the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. His remarks centered on how XRP, despite lacking its own historical October track record due to years of stagnation under the SEC lawsuit , could still benefit from Bitcoin-led market momentum. XRP Family! Is October going to be a crazy good month for XRP? Lets talk about this! What do you think? pic.twitter.com/8JEwubk4Jj — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) October 2, 2025 The Role of Bitcoin Dominance Hilton explained that Bitcoin currently accounts for approximately 58% of the entire cryptocurrency market, with a dominance value of around $2.38 trillion out of a total market capitalization of $4.1 trillion. He noted that XRP’s own market capitalization stands at about $178 billion, with modest gains of 1% in the past 24 hours and 4% over the past week. His view is that Bitcoin’s market influence ensures that when it trends upward, the rest of the market, including XRP, is likely to follow. Government Shutdown and Market Reaction One of the unusual elements shaping October is the U.S. government shutdown. Hilton reminded his audience that the last such shutdown took place in 2018 and lasted 35 days, a period when cryptocurrency was not yet widely impacted by such macroeconomic developments. This time, however, he observed that crypto markets have responded positively rather than negatively, with hundreds of billions of dollars flowing in. He suggested that this may have accelerated gains earlier in the month than expected, disrupting the assumption that October’s first weeks would remain flat. Historical October Trends in Bitcoin While XRP lacks a meaningful October track record due to its limited activity during the years of its SEC battle, Hilton highlighted Bitcoin’s historical strength in the month. According to his data, Bitcoin has posted gains in 10 of the past 12 Octobers, with increases ranging from single digits to over 60% in certain years. He presented charts showing these results and argued that such consistency makes October an especially favorable month for crypto performance. Implications for XRP Drawing a connection between Bitcoin’s October track record and XRP’s potential , Hilton argued that XRP is positioned to benefit from overall market momentum. He emphasized that when Bitcoin rises, capital and liquidity tend to flow into other assets as well. With retail investors expected to return when Bitcoin shows strong upward moves, Hilton believes XRP could experience meaningful gains throughout October and into the fourth quarter. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Beyond October Hilton went further by outlining broader market expectations for the end of 2025. He referenced projections of Bitcoin potentially reaching between $150,000 and $200,000 by the close of that year, with some even speculating as high as $250,000. In his view, XRP will naturally rise alongside such movements due to the influx of liquidity and renewed investor participation that typically accompany bull market conditions. He pointed out that October, November, and December have historically been strong quarters for crypto as a whole, with early 2026 expected to continue the trend. Austin Hilton’s analysis of XRP’s potential in October ties closely to Bitcoin’s historical performance and current dominance. While XRP itself does not have a consistent October history to draw from, Hilton believes the overall environment, including the government shutdown’s unexpected market impact and Bitcoin’s proven seasonal strength, indicates that XRP is well-placed for gains. He assesses that October could serve as the start of a broader bullish phase for both Bitcoin and XRP, extending into the final quarter of the year and beyond.

BNB net inflows: ~$26B into market cap, suggesting concentrated capital rotation into Binance Coin BNB shows a near-2x ROI vs. Ethereum and a 22% jump in BSC active addresses in September BNB OI ~$3B vs. XRP OI ~$8B; a $30B incremental flow could push BNB past XRP for third-largest crypto Meta description: Binance Coin (BNB) is outperforming altcoins with major inflows, 22% BSC growth, and strong ROI—read the analysis and steps for BNB to overtake XRP. What is driving Binance Coin (BNB) to outperform other altcoins? Binance Coin is rising because focused capital rotations, higher ROI versus ETH, and on-chain metrics point to strong demand. Active addresses on Binance Smart Chain jumped 22% in September while implied inflows of about $26 billion have pushed BNB to a new implied cost basis near $1,194. How significant are on-chain flows and ROI for BNB’s rally? On-chain flows and comparative ROI are central. Over the last week, TOTAL2 (ex-BTC market cap) climbed 6.68% to $1.73T, with ~17% of that move rotating into BNB—roughly $26B. BNB’s ROI is nearly twice Ethereum’s, indicating stronger relative performance that attracts strategic capital. Technically, BNB’s market cap sits near $166B, or ~4% of the $4.2T total crypto market. Active addresses on BSC accelerated, signaling increased network usage and liquidity demands. Open Interest (OI) on BNB derivatives is ~ $3B, lower than XRP’s ~$8B, which reduces liquidation risk and supports organic price appreciation. Source: TradingView (BNB/USDT) How could Binance Coin claim the third-largest crypto spot? BNB can ascend to third if capital rotation continues and inflows exceed outflows. The gap to XRP is roughly 12.5% in market cap terms today; approximately $30B more into BNB could bridge that gap and place Binance Coin above XRP. What indicators matter for a successful overtake? Key indicators include continued strong net inflows, persistent growth in BSC active addresses, stable or rising OI without increased liquidation risk, and the XRP/BNB ratio remaining weak. Artemis Terminal and TradingView data show the XRP/BNB ratio has dropped ~60% since July—an important technical signal favoring BNB. Source: TradingView (XRP/BNB) Frequently Asked Questions Can BNB realistically overtake XRP in market cap this quarter? Yes, if inflows persist. A sustained rotation similar to recent moves—plus an incremental ~$30B—would likely push BNB past XRP; on-chain inflows, ROI advantage, and diminished XRP bid strength support this path. Is BNB’s rally driven more by fundamentals or speculation? Current data point to fundamentals: increased BSC activity, higher address growth, and measurable capital inflows underpin the rally. That said, momentum and positioning can amplify price moves short term. What risks could derail BNB’s ascent? Risks include marketwide corrections, regulatory or exchange-specific events, a sudden reversal in flows, or renewed confidence/capital returning to XRP. Watch liquidity and derivatives OI closely. Key Takeaways Capital rotation into BNB : Roughly $26B implied inflows have driven the rally. On-chain strength : BSC active addresses rose ~22%, signaling real network demand. Path to third spot : A $30B incremental flow and continued ratio weakness vs. XRP could secure third place for BNB. Conclusion Binance Coin’s outperformance is built on measurable on-chain flows, superior short-term ROI versus ETH, and weakening bid support for XRP.

Wall Street has taken notice. Major financial institutions that once dismissed Bitcoin as a speculative bubble have quietly been accumulating positions, while exchange-traded funds tracking the cryptocurrency have seen record inflows in recent months.

The MVRV rising above its yearly moving average and 99.3% of supply in profit point to elevated short‑term distribution risk near the $100K–$110K band. MVRV jumped from 1.9 to 2.4 in October, crossing its yearly average and signalling renewed holder confidence. Analyst data shows 99.3% of Bitcoin supply is currently in profit, historically preceding short-term pullbacks of 3–10%. Converging momentum and profitability metrics place the $100K–$110K resistance band as the next major testing range. Bitcoin MVRV breakout shows rising profit supply and pressure near $100K–$110K — read our analysis and next steps for traders. Stay informed with COINOTAG coverage. Bitcoin’s MVRV breakout and profit supply spike indicate increasing upside pressure and a higher probability of short‑term distribution as the market approaches the $100K resistance range. MVRV ratio climbed from 1.9 to 2.4 in October, a momentum crossover above the one‑year moving average. Analyst data shows 99.3% of Bitcoin supply is in profit, a historic level linked to short‑term pullbacks. $100K–$110K is the primary resistance range as on‑chain momentum and unrealized gains converge. Bitcoin is demonstrating renewed strength across multiple on‑chain indicators, positioning price action near a significant pressure zone. Expert commentary from market analysts highlights a decisive trend change, with momentum turning bullish after months of consolidation. MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) is a common on‑chain gauge for identifying expansion and distribution phases. The ratio measures market capitalization relative to the aggregate cost basis of holders, offering a snapshot of unrealized profit or loss across the network. Recent movements now point to accumulation resuming after an extended neutral period. What is the Bitcoin MVRV breakout? The Bitcoin MVRV breakout refers to the MVRV ratio rising above its one‑year moving average, indicating renewed net unrealized gains and increased holder confidence. This breakout often precedes acceleration but also raises short‑term distribution risk when profitability reaches historic highs. How does the MVRV crossover affect short‑term price action? The crossover from 1.9 to 2.4 in October shows a momentum shift from neutral to positive. Historically, MVRV crossovers have coincided with phases of renewed buying, but when paired with extremely high profit supply, they can precede temporary pullbacks. Short, disciplined risk management is prudent in these windows. How significant is the 99.3% profit supply reading? Analyst Ted’s flagged statistic that 99.3% of Bitcoin supply is in profit is unusually elevated and has only appeared a few times historically. Those instances were followed by short‑term declines between 3% and 10%, suggesting elevated distribution risk despite the current bullish momentum. Source: Ali on X Price action between November 2024 and October 2025 saw Bitcoin trade in a broad range from roughly $60,000 to $110,000, with MVRV oscillating between 1.6 and 2.8. A notable dip to ~1.6 in March 2025 aligned with capitulation events, while the April–May rebound returned the market to neutral territory. Why does the $100K–$110K band matter now? The $100K–$110K range has repeatedly acted as a ceiling across 2024–2025. With unrealized gains expanding and profitability metrics stretching, the band represents the next major test for buyers. If distribution intensifies near that band, expect short‑term cooldowns before any sustained breakout. What should traders and investors watch next? Key metrics to monitor include the MVRV trajectory relative to its moving average, changes in realized profit distribution, and liquidity at $100K–$110K. Use stop placement and position sizing to manage the elevated risk that comes with near‑historic profit levels. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What does a Bitcoin MVRV breakout indicate?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A Bitcoin MVRV breakout indicates rising unrealized gains among holders and a shift toward bullish momentum; however, it can also precede short‑term distribution when profitability nears historic highs."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How does 99.3% of supply in profit affect price risk?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""When 99.3% of supply is in profit, historical precedents show increased probability of short‑term pullbacks (typically 3–10%), as holders lock in gains and distribution increases."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is $100K the next major resistance for Bitcoin?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes. Converging on‑chain momentum and stretched profitability metrics make $100K–$110K the primary near‑term resistance band to watch."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How reliable is MVRV as a timing tool? MVRV is reliable as a cycle and sentiment indicator but not a precise timing tool. It highlights phases of unrealized profit and loss; combine it with volume, liquidity, and price structure for better timing decisions (40–50 words). What should a long‑term investor do when profit supply spikes? Long‑term investors should reassess risk allocation, consider partial profit‑taking at clear resistance, and rebalance rather than fully exit positions. Maintain a multi‑year view while protecting capital near historic profit extremes. Key Takeaways MVRV breakout : The ratio moving above its yearly average signals renewed on‑chain momentum. Profit supply elevated : 99.3% of supply in profit historically precedes short‑term pullbacks. Resistance focus : $100K–$110K is the next key band; manage risk and watch distribution metrics closely. Conclusion Bitcoin’s current MVRV breakout and elevated profit supply suggest a meaningful near‑term test at the $100K–$110K resistance band. Traders should balance participation with disciplined risk controls, while long‑term holders monitor distribution metrics for re‑entry opportunities.

The move higher came after a mid-session flushout drove price to $0.248 on heavy volume, clearing weak longs before buyers stepped in. DOGE is now consolidating just above $0.26 with traders eyeing the $0.30–$0.33 zone as the next resistance cluster. News Background • DOGE has been trading within a broad $0.24–$0.27 band through September as ETF filings and institutional mining investments build longer-term narratives. • Reports show 2 billion DOGE accumulated by large holders over the past 72 hours, consistent with historical pre-breakout patterns. • Broader crypto markets are stabilizing after last week’s $1.7 billion in liquidations, with DOGE drawing inflows as traders rotate back into high-beta tokens. Price Action Summary • DOGE dropped from $0.254 to $0.248 during Saturday’s mid-session selloff, establishing strong support at $0.247–$0.249. • Volume surged to 485.6M during the capitulation, confirming institutional participation. • The token rebounded into an ascending channel formation, closing near $0.252. • By early Sunday, DOGE had reclaimed $0.26, with consolidation now evident above the level. • Traders flag $0.30 as the next resistance test, with $0.33–$0.40 as breakout targets.

BTC jumped to a high of $125,650 as it rose for the fifth consecutive day following the crash to $108,652. This article explains some of the top reasons why BTC is soaring. Bitcoin price is soaring as safe-haven demand rises One of the main reasons why the Bitcoin price has jumped is that it has emerged as a safe-haven asset. This mirrors the performance of gold, which has jumped to a record high in the past few days. Investors see Bitcoin as a digital equivalent to gold. As such, while old-school investors are buying gold, the new generation leans toward Bitcoin, which has some solid fundamentals. For example, unlike gold, Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million coins and most of them have been mined already. Many have been lost and millions of others are held by treasury companies that are not interested in selling. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty continues rising as the halving effect reduces the block rewards every four years. At the same time, Bitcoin demand continues rising, mostly from corporations. All this has led to a low Bitcoin supply, with the number of coins in exchanges falling to the lowest level in years. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts The other main catalyst for the Bitcoin price has been the Federal Reserve, which has started cutting interest rates this year. It slashed rates by 0.25% in September, and analysts point to more cuts in the coming months. The odds that the bank will deliver more cuts in the coming meetings jumped after ADP published the latest job numbers. Its report showed that the economy shed over 36,000 jobs in September this year. The ADP report was the only one that came out last week as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is part of the government shutdown. Therefore, Polymarket and the CME Fed Tool predict that the bank will cut interest rates by 0.25% in the coming meeting, which will boost Bitcoin prices. BTC ETF inflows are rising Meanwhile, there are signs that institutional investors continue to load up on Bitcoin using ETFs. Data shows that Bitcoin had inflows in the last five consecutive days. These funds added over $3.25 billion in assets last week, bringing the total inflows to over $60 billion for the first time ever. This growth has helped to transform BlackRock’s IBIT into one of the biggest and most profitable funds globally. It now has over $90 billion in assets and a 25 basis points expense ratio. BTC price has strong technicals BTC price chart | Source: TradingView The other bullish catalyst for the Bitcoin price is its strong technicals. It recently formed a giant bullish flag pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a descending channel pattern. The coin has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Also, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has jumped to nearly 30. Therefore, the coin will likely continue soaring as bulls target the next key resistance at $130,000.

The cryptocurrency rocketed to just under $126K on Binance during the early trading hours of Sunday. Recall that bitcoin went on a roll during the summer when it topped $124K in August. What followed was a somewhat expected correction and consolidation. September was volatile with a peak of $118K after the US Fed reduced the interest rates. However, that was short-lived and BTC dumped below $109K a week later. Its recovery began at the start of the business week and especially since October ( referred to as ‘Uptober’ in the crypto community) kicked off. Bitcoin added more than $10K to its value from Monday until Friday but the actual breakout was yet to transpire. Following a calm Saturday with sideways trading between $121K-$122K, the major cryptocurrency flew past the precious record and set a new one at $125.9K on Binance. Its market capitalization has shot up to $2.5 trillion, which places it above Amazon and close to silver. The total value of liquidations on CoinGlass is up to $350 million, with shorts responsible for the lion’s share.

Analysts project $135,000 near term and $200,000+ before year‑end; monitor liquidity and on‑chain signals. Bitcoin price rockets past $125,000 in 2025; read why BTC could reach $135,000–$200,000 and what traders should watch. Stay informed with COINOTAG coverage. What is driving Bitcoin’s 2025 rally? Bitcoin price has climbed as institutional allocations, macroeconomic uncertainty and concentrated short squeezes have converged to push demand higher. Large trading flows and renewed interest from asset managers are front-loading capital into BTC, strengthening the narrative of Bitcoin as a digital store of value. How high can Bitcoin go in 2025? Market data shows Bitcoin reached a new record above $125,000 during Asia trading, with approximately $50 billion in 24‑hour volume and roughly $100 million in short liquidations in a single hour; more than $200 million in BTC shorts were liquidated over the prior 24 hours (data reported by market data aggregators and analytics providers). Analyst expectations vary. Some asset managers forecast a near‑term price floor above $135,000 and upside to $200,000 before year‑end, citing institutional adoption, constrained supply dynamics and macro tailwinds. These projections are scenario‑based and assume continued inflows and liquidity. Why did short liquidations accelerate the move? Forced buybacks from liquidated short positions amplified momentum, creating feedback loops that lifted price rapidly. Higher leverage in derivatives markets increases potential for swift moves; when concentrated short exposure is closed, market liquidity thins and volatility spikes. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-125k-2025-outlook"" }, ""headline"": ""How high can Bitcoin go?

Institutional allocations increase buy-side demand and can reduce available float in liquid venues, supporting higher prices. Large institutional buys also attract secondary flows from retail and algorithmic traders, amplifying momentum. What on‑chain metrics indicate exhaustion or continuation? Key signals include exchange net flows, long‑term holder distribution, network activity, and realized volatility. Rising exchange outflows and longer hodl durations typically support continuation; heavy inflows to exchanges may signal near‑term selling pressure. Key Takeaways Record breakout : Bitcoin exceeded $125,000 in 2025 amid heavy volume and short squeezes. Analyst targets : Near‑term targets cited include $135,000 with upside scenarios to $200,000; outcomes depend on flows and liquidity. Risk management : Use size limits, stops and monitor derivatives and on‑chain metrics before increasing exposure. Conclusion The Bitcoin price rally through $125,000 reflects a confluence of institutional demand, macro uncertainty and forced liquidations. While some models point to $135,000–$200,000 targets, volatility remains elevated. Follow verified market data, apply disciplined risk controls, and consult professional advice before trading.

ETF inflows: $3.24B this week, largest since January 2025 Exchange reserves fell to ~2.83M BTC, the lowest since 2019 (Glassnode). Market technicals show bullish momentum: 7‑day SMA $117,800; 200‑day EMA $105,511; RSI ~69. Bitcoin all-time high: Bitcoin rises above $125,200 on ETF inflows and low exchange supply — read key drivers and next targets. Stay informed with COINOTAG. What caused Bitcoin to hit a new all-time high? Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high was driven by accelerated institutional demand via spot ETFs and a marked reduction in exchange liquid supply. ETFs recorded $3.24 billion in weekly inflows while centralized exchange balances fell to multi-year lows, creating a strong demand-to-supply imbalance and upward price pressure. How did ETF inflows fuel the breakout? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $3.24 billion in inflows this week, led by large single-day purchases (for example, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust absorbed ~$524 million in one day). ETFs are acquiring roughly 8,200 BTC per day while miner issuance remains near 450 BTC daily, creating an estimated 20:1 demand-to-supply gap. That sustained accumulation mirrors conditions seen in late 2020 when institutional capital first entered the market at scale, and it increases the probability of extended bullish momentum if inflows persist. Why is exchange supply important and what does data show? Exchange supply is a proxy for available liquid Bitcoin. Glassnode-style on-chain metrics show centralized exchange balances down to approximately 2.83 million BTC—the lowest since 2019. Over the past two weeks, withdrawals equivalent to more than $14 billion were observed, indicating growing scarcity on venues that facilitate quick selling. Institutional custodians and long-term holders withdrawing coins reduces available float and can amplify price moves when inflows continue to outpace new supply. What do technical indicators say about the trend? Chart indicators confirm bullish strength while not yet signalling extreme overbought conditions. Bitcoin reclaimed major averages: 7‑day SMA near $117,800 and 200‑day EMA at $105,511 acting as support. MACD histogram at +1,127 and RSI around 69.2 indicate momentum remains healthy with short-term resistance near $128,000 and a Fibonacci extension target around $139,000 if momentum continues. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High as ETF Inflows and Supply Shortage Drive Momentum"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-05T08:44:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-05T08:44:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Person"", ""name"": ""Kosta Gushterov"", ""affiliation"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin surged above $125,200 as spot-ETF inflows and falling exchange reserves created a steep demand-to-supply imbalance, lifting market cap to roughly $2.49 trillion."", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-etf-inflows-125k"" }} Frequently Asked Questions How much did ETFs buy this week? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $3.24 billion in inflows this week, led by sizable single-day purchases that accelerated institutional accumulation (data referenced from public ETF flow reports). Is the supply shortage real and measurable? Yes. Centralized exchange balances have declined to roughly 2.83 million BTC, the lowest level since 2019, according to on-chain exchange balance metrics. This reduced liquid supply increases scarcity risk if demand remains elevated. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much did ETFs buy this week?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $3.24 billion in inflows this week, driven by large institutional purchases."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is the supply shortage measurable?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes, centralized exchange balances have declined to about 2.83 million BTC, the lowest since 2019, indicating reduced liquid supply."" } } ]} How to interpret ETF-driven rallies? Follow these steps to assess the sustainability of ETF-driven rallies: Monitor weekly ETF net flows to gauge institutional demand. Track centralized exchange balances for shifts in liquid supply. Confirm technical support levels (7‑day SMA, 200‑day EMA) and momentum indicators (MACD, RSI). Compare miner issuance to ETF acquisition rates to assess demand-to-supply imbalance. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret ETF-driven Bitcoin rallies"", ""description"": ""Simple steps to evaluate whether ETF inflows are likely to sustain a Bitcoin rally."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Monitor ETF flows"", ""text"": ""Check weekly spot ETF inflows to measure institutional buying pressure."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Track exchange balances"", ""text"": ""Watch centralized exchange BTC balances for reductions in liquid supply."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Confirm technicals"", ""text"": ""Use moving averages and momentum indicators to validate trend strength."" } ]} Key Takeaways ETF demand : Institutional spot-ETF inflows (≈$3.24B this week) are a primary driver of the rally. Supply shortage : Centralized exchange reserves dropped to ~2.83M BTC, increasing scarcity and potential volatility. Technical outlook : Support at $105k–$118k with short-term resistance near $128k; extension targets toward $139k if momentum continues. Conclusion Bitcoin’s new all-time high above $125,200 reflects a convergence of strong institutional ETF inflows and a measurable decrease in exchange liquid supply. Data from market flow reports and on-chain metrics suggest the rally is backed by real demand rather than pure speculation. Monitor ETF flows, exchange balances, and technical support to gauge the next leg of price action. COINOTAG will continue to report updates and data-driven analysis.

While Bitcoin continues to reign and make headlines, major altcoins are also gaining significant attention due to their consistent accumulation. XRP and Solana (SOL) are leading the pack and are being heavily purchased by whales. Meanwhile, retail investors, who have turned their attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE, are anticipating returns as high as 55x, according to analysts. Whale Activity Surrounding XRP XRP continues trading steadily around the price of $3.05, one of the most bought altcoins. The token has consistently remained popular among institutions due to Ripple’s quest to become a global payment standard. For the past couple of weeks, whale wallets with large XRP holdings have been making big moves by accumulating the asset significantly. Recent on-chain data reveals that addresses owning more than 10 million XRP started to move their coins. Experts think this accumulation period is setting the stage for a future breakout that may take the token nearer to $3.50 to $3.75 in the next few months. While Ripple continues to forge partnerships across banking and cross-border settlement, the confidence of investors in the long-term role of XRP remains solid. Solana Maintains Strong Momentum Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is trading at around $230, sustaining its strong rally as one of the major altcoins of the year. Solana is known for its ridiculously fast transactions and low fees. It’s quickly become a hot spot for DeFi activity and NFTs. Many organizations now have an increasing interest towards Solana. Rising expectations of Solana-linked ETFs and steady whale buying activity are driving up momentum. SOL is performing exceptionally well in 2025. According to a technical chart, price upward momentum will continue if Solana manages to stay above the $225 level. As a result, it will target the $250-$260 level. This makes it one of the outperforming assets of the 2025 market cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE Expected to Offer 55x ROI Whales are grabbing positions in XRP and SOL, while smaller investors are betting on MAGACOIN FINANCE to make generational gains. If MAGACOIN grows as expected in the next bull market, analysts believe early investors could see returns as high as 55x. Different from many presale tokens, which are speculated. The MAGACOIN FINANCE project is building a robust ecosystem with its own use cases and a strong community base. Due to its limited supply and speedy fundraising milestones, it has already emerged as one of the hottest projects in the early stages of 2025. Investors speak of rapid sellouts in its presales. According to experts, presales that exhibit this momentum usually deliver extraordinary returns post listing on exchanges. Many retail investors are looking at MAGACOIN FINANCE as their next big shot at exponential gains after having missed the early runs from SHIBA INU or Solana itself. If projections hold true, even a small sum of money today could deliver life-changing returns over the next 12-18 months. Altcoin Market Outlook The larger altcoin market is showing bullish indicators too. The Altcoin Season Index remains elevated at 68/100 implying that traders are rotating from Bitcoin dominance into alternative tokens with high upside. On-chain metrics show liquidity is circulating across networks. Activity is increasing in both the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems. There is renewed interest in XRP. Trading in the derivatives market has also picked up pace as the open interest and turnover has registered a significant rise indicating heavy speculation as investors position themselves for further upside. If Bitcoin can hold above $120,000, most analysts believe the altcoins will likely continue outperforming through Q1 2026. Conclusion The bullish market is conducive for both old and new cryptocurrencies to flourish. XRP and Solana are capturing the attention of whales and institutions, solidifying their place as core assets in this cycle. At the same time, retail investors seeking larger profits are taking notice of MAGACOIN FINANCE and it is quickly growing as a popular choice. With estimates indicating ROI of up to 55x, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings the kind of euro upside few tokens offer. The diverse strategies that XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are utilizing have given investors multiple opportunities in 2025’s historic bull run.

Read between the lines, they won’t tell you.” He argued that SWIFT’s Chief Innovation Officer, Tom Zschach, is restricted from openly discussing XRP’s role due to confidentiality obligations. “It’s clear that he’s under NDA. He knows exactly what XRP is and its magnitude, but he’s not allowed to talk about it,” UnknowDLT stated. The post also captioned a screenshot showing a potential settlement flow involving Corda, SWIFT gpi, and XRP as an example of cryptocurrencies. For many in the XRP community, this serves as further support that XRP could become an integral part of SWIFT’s future settlement processes , or potentially take over the market. This is Swift's CIO's response to my tweet. It's clear that he's under NDA. He knows exactly what XRP is and its magnitude, but he's not allowed to talk about it. Swift will integrate XRP. Read between the lines, they won't tell you. https://t.co/NjsAw13TpD pic.twitter.com/RiWVE5brBK — {x} (@unknowDLT) October 3, 2025 Context of the Exchange The remarks came after a direct interaction between UnknowDLT and SWIFT’s CIO on X. In response to SWIFT’s latest collaboration with ConsenSys on Linea , UnknowDLT argued that such partnerships “do not move liquidity, only data.” He added that XRP is the asset capable of solving the liquidity problem and insisted, “Swift will integrate XRP, I have no doubt about that.” Zschach expressed confusion in his reply , and UnknowDLT’s follow-up post argued that SWIFT’s executives recognize XRP’s importance but are unable to speak about it directly. The Argument on Liquidity The foundation of the XRP community’s perspective is that global cross-border payments require a liquidity solution , not just improvements in messaging or interoperability. While SWIFT has engaged in blockchain initiatives through partnerships with firms like ConsenSys, these efforts, in the view of XRP supporters, do not resolve the liquidity challenge that slows and complicates international transfers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 UnknowDLT’s statement that Linea and similar projects “do not move liquidity, only data” reflects this core belief. XRP is presented as the asset uniquely designed to bridge currencies and deliver real-time settlement with on-demand liquidity, something its advocates maintain is essential for SWIFT’s long-term modernization. SWIFT’s Current Direction SWIFT itself has emphasized innovation in areas such as tokenization, interoperability across ledgers, and enhancing its gpi service. SWIFT has made no official announcement regarding the integration of XRP. Nonetheless, the conviction within the XRP community remains firm. UnknowDLT’s comments reflect the continued belief that XRP will ultimately be indispensable to the transformation of global settlements , regardless of the partnerships SWIFT pursues in the present.

As bitcoin (BTC) trades in uncharted territory near record highs, traders may be searching for cues on what comes next, especially key levels that could act as magnets or resistance points. Here are three important levels worth watching closely. $126,100 This level represents the upper boundary of the broadening or expanding range pattern that has been developing since mid-July. The potential resistance is defined by the trendline connecting the July 15 and Aug. 14 highs. A reversal from this level could trigger a corrective pullback down toward the lower boundary of the range, represented by the trendline drawn from the Aug. 3 and Sept. 1 lows. $135,000 A breakout from the expanding range would shift focus to $135,000, where market makers currently hold a net long gamma position, according to activity in Deribit-listed options tracked by Amberdata. When market makers are net long gamma, they tend to trade against the market direction – buying on dips and selling on rallies – to maintain their overall market-neutral exposure. Other things being equal, this hedging activity tends to dampen price volatility. In other words, the $135,000 level could act as a resistance on the way higher. $140,000 Lastly, $140,000 stands out as key level, as data from Deribit shows the $140,000 strike call is the second-most popular on the exchange, holding a notional open interest of over $2 billion. Notional open interest refers to the dollar value of the number of active or open options contracts at a given time. Levels with large concentrations of open interest often act as magnets, drawing the price of the underlying asset toward them. A high open interest in call options suggests that many traders expect the spot price to approach or top that level. At the same time, those who have sold these calls, often large institutions, have an incentive to keep the price below that strike. Their hedging and trading activity around that level can create resistance, making it harder for the price to break through.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Options|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-05 06:09:07

(October 5),https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/05/crypto-market-rally-why-are-altcoins-going-up-today-october-5/,"A crypto market rally is intensifying today, Oct. 5, as Bitcoin price jumped to a record high and the valuation of all coins hit $4.26 trillion. The Bitcoin price rally has led to more upside among other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, and Stellar. Crypto market rally boosted by Bitcoin surge The first main reason why the crypto market rally is happening is that the Bitcoin price is in a strong surge and is sitting at its all-time high. BTC price soared to a record high of over $125,000 for several reasons, including the robust ETF inflows and its safe-haven appeal rises among investors. Bitcoin has also been boosted by the ongoing supply and demand dynamics. BTC has a supply limit of about 21 million coins and is seeing robust demand from American institutional investors. It is common for altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP to jump whenever Bitcoin is in a strong rally. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts The other catalyst for the BTC and the crypto market is that the Federal Reserve has embraced a more dovish sentiment in the past few months. Jerome Powell and his committee decided to cut interest rates in the last meeting in September. It brought the benchmark rate to between 4.00% and 4.25%. Also, the bank hinted that it will cut interest rates in the coming meeting. Odds that the bank will cut rates jumped last week after the government shutdown happened. The odds then increased after ADP published weak jobs numbers last week. This report showed that the economy lost over 36,000 jobs in September. Another report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that there are now more jobless people than there are vacancies. Soaring Crypto Fear and Greed Index and Uptober rally The crypto market is going up as investors embrace a risk-on sentiment. One of the signs for this is that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has jumped to 58 and will likely hit the greed zone of 60 soon. It is common for cryptocurrencies to jump when investors are greedy. The greed sentiment is rising as investors predict that a Uptober rally will happen. Uptober refers to a situation where the crypto market experiences positive returns in September. Increasing ETF inflows and potential approvals Meanwhile, the crypto market is thriving as investors focus on the ongoing ETF inflows. Data shows that Bitcoin ETFs added over $3.2 billion last week. Spot Ethereum ETFs added over $1 billion in assets and are now nearing their $15 billion milestone. At the same time, investors anticipate that the SEC will approve several spot ETFs like Solana and XRP in the coming weeks. The post Crypto market rally: Why are altcoins going up today?

CAKE tests key support at $3.45 and $3.25 after rejection at $3.70 On-chain volume spikes and net buyback/burns support liquidity and long-term strength Break above the descending trendline would signal renewed buyer control and a move toward $4.00 PancakeSwap (CAKE) price outlook: watch $3.45 and $3.25 demand zones; monitor trendline break for upside. Read on for trade levels and on-chain context. (Act now to reassess positions.) PancakeSwap (CAKE) faces short-term weakness near $3.55 after rejection at $3.70, with buyers monitoring support at $3.45 and $3.25. PancakeSwap (CAKE) pulled back from $3.70 and is testing strong demand zones near $3.45 and $3.25 amid sustained market interest. The technical structure remains bullish, as traders anticipate a breakout above the descending trendline could trigger another move toward the $4.00 region. Record trading volumes and ongoing token burns reinforce CAKE’s liquidity strength and dominance within the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. PancakeSwap (CAKE) price is moderately weak after attempting a push towards the $3.70 zone. The token is now consolidating near key short-term support zones, with traders assessing potential continuation signals. What is the PancakeSwap (CAKE) price outlook after the $3.70 rejection? PancakeSwap (CAKE) price has pulled back from $3.70 and is testing demand near $3.45 and $3.25. If one of these levels holds, the market structure remains bullish and a break above the local downtrend could send CAKE toward $3.85–$4.00. How are traders using the $3.45 and $3.25 demand zones? Traders view the retracement as a healthy consolidation. The $3.45 and $3.25 zones acted as breakout points during the prior rally. A sustained bounce from either zone would preserve higher lows and increase the probability of a trendline breakout. Market observer ZYN noted that keeping price above these regions retains the bullish structure. Short-term momentum indicators on the 1-hour chart show a descending pattern of lower highs, so a break of the downtrend is required for conviction. $CAKE showing some weakness after the push to $3.70. Price is now pulling back, testing lower support zones around $3.45 and $3.25. As long as it holds one of these levels, structure stays bullish and continuation remains on the table. Break above the local downtrend line… — ZYN (@Zynweb3) October 4, 2025 ZYN highlighted that a bounce at $3.45 could spark renewed buying that pushes price back above the downtrend line. That setup would open a path for a retest of $3.70 and a move into the $3.85–$4.00 range should volume pick up. What on-chain data supports CAKE’s outlook? On-chain metrics point to elevated participation. Analyst JW observed the largest trading volumes in CAKE’s history, surpassing peaks from 2021, alongside buyback and burn activity that now outpaces emissions. JW also emphasized CAKE’s role within the BNB Smart Chain as a liquidity leader. The combination of strong volumes, reduced net supply pressure, and ecosystem positioning supports the bullish narrative even during short-term pullbacks. I see $CAKE as the most liquid 5x the market has to offer right now: > Largest volumes in history, exceeding volumes set in 2021 when price pushed above $40, currently $3.60 > Total supply in circulation, with buyback/burn exceeding emissions > BSC ecosystem leader Value buy — JW (@JW100x) October 4, 2025 Frequently Asked Questions Is CAKE still bullish after the $3.70 rejection? Yes. CAKE remains in a bullish structure provided it holds one of the demand zones at $3.45 or $3.25. A confirmed break above the short-term downtrend line would increase the likelihood of a move toward $3.85–$4.00. Monitor volume and support reaction. When should traders consider buying CAKE? Traders often look for a clear bounce from $3.45 or $3.25 with increasing volume, or a breakout above the descending trendline. Use tight risk management and confirm moves with on-chain volume and order flow. Key Takeaways Short-term setup : CAKE rejected at $3.70 and is testing $3.45 and $3.25 supports. On-chain support : Record volumes and net buyback/burns bolster liquidity and long-term appeal. Actionable trigger : Break above the local downtrend line or a solid bounce from $3.45/$3.25 are bullish triggers. Conclusion PancakeSwap (CAKE) shows a mixed short-term picture: price weakness after a $3.70 rejection but structural strength if key demand zones hold. Traders should watch volume, support reactions, and a trendline breakout for confirmation.

Dogecoin just saw 40 million DOGE dumped by whales, dragging its price back toward $0.22. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to bleed, slipping 8% in the past week and struggling to hold support at $0.0000115. As these legacy meme coins lose momentum, many holders rotate into a new contender: Little Pepe (LILPEPE). With analysts forecasting potential gains of up to 16,736% by 2026, the project has quickly become one of the most talked-about presales of the year. Why Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Are Losing Steam Dogecoin’s dependence on market momentum has once again shown its downside. A coordinated sell-off of 40 million tokens sent the price tumbling, with support at $0.22 looking fragile. If the psychological $0.20 level is broken, analysts warn that DOGE could fall much further, potentially dragging retail traders into heavy losses. Dogecoin Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Shiba Inu is facing its own troubles. Despite a minor bounce, SHIB remains down over 8% this week and has recently hit its lowest level since early August, around $0.000011. Trading volume has declined by nearly 37%, indicating waning interest from buyers. With RSI in oversold territory but no strong reversal, sentiment remains fragile. For many investors, these signals confirm that SHIB and DOGE may struggle to deliver the life-changing returns they once did. That’s why attention is shifting fast to the new kid on the block. Little Pepe: The Meme Chain Revolution Little Pepe is more than just another meme coin. It is the world’s first Layer 2 blockchain designed entirely for memes, built to solve the problems plaguing earlier projects. Its unique features include: ultra-low fees, near-instant settlement, and anti-bot technology that prevents sniper bots from exploiting launches. It also introduces a zero-tax model and a dedicated Pump Pad Launchpad for meme tokens. Little Pepe has built an ecosystem dubbed the next big crypto revolution, alongside DeFi and GameFi. The presale numbers are proof of demand. The project has raised over $26.34 million, selling more than 16.1 billion tokens within a few months of its launch. Stage 13 is live at $0.0022, more than double the Stage 1 price of $0.001. With two top exchange listings confirmed at launch, early buyers are positioning for significant gains before LILPEPE even hits the open market. Could $LILPEPE Deliver a 16,736% Rally by 2026? Analysts believe the ingredients for explosive growth are all in place. With a completed CertiK audit, a strict vesting schedule , and a roadmap built around scalability and fairness, Little Pepe has the credibility and infrastructure that many meme coins lack. The community is also being rewarded in unprecedented ways. Alongside the ongoing $777K Giveaway, the new Mega Giveaway offers more than 15 ETH prizes to participants from Stages 12 through 17. This combination of trust, incentives, and innovation is fueling one of the fastest-growing presales of the year. The appeal is obvious for Shiba Inu and Dogecoin holders who are frustrated by stagnation. While legacy meme coins battle selling pressure, Little Pepe is offering the kind of early entry opportunity that could turn modest investments into life-changing returns.

With an anticipated rally and a robust presale phase, this new meme coin has captured the attention and wallets of many erstwhile Shiba and Doge enthusiasts. The Current State of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Shiba Inu, once a vibrant part of the meme token frenzy, is now grappling with an 8% decrease in its value over the previous week, touching new lows not seen since early August. Simultaneously, Dogecoin faces its challenges, with a significant dump of 40 million DOGE by large holders, sharply pushing the price down towards $0.22, a precarious position close to critical support levels. Dogecoin Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The Rise of Little Pepe As the older generation of meme coins like SHIB and DOGE wane in both price and community interest, a fresh meme coin named Little Pepe, stylized as LILPEPE, is stepping up, heralded by some as the next big movement in the meme coin ecosystem. The token's developers promise revolutionary features such as ultra-low transaction fees, near-instant settlements, and robust anti-bot measures to ensure a fair trading environment. These improvements address many of the issues that have historically plagued the usability and scalability of blockchain projects centered around memes. Market Reactions and Predictions With a dizzying gain of over 16,736% projected by 2026, Little Pepe is not only drawing the curiosity of typical crypto investors but also of those who have previously engaged with other meme tokens. The transition of investors from Shiba Inu and Dogecoin to Little Pepe is partly due to the latter's dynamic market entry and promising presale numbers, which show a robust uptake among the community.

But as Cardano pushes for bigger use with a possible fund approval, a fun new coin is jumping into the mix, ready to stir up the meme coin scene: Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Here’s a closer look at Cardano’s path in 2025 and why LILPEPE might steal the show with even bigger growth this year. Cardano’s Price Prediction for 2025 and Beyond Heading into 2025, Cardano (ADA) maintains a solid position in the blockchain world, thanks to technological upgrades and interest from major investors. Currently, it’s experiencing some notable growth, with a total value of approximately $29.76 billion. The new Hydra setup boosts speed, and Voltaire enables ADA holders to participate in decision-making, positioning Cardano to handle a larger user base and remain a top player in the blockchain space. A significant development expected for Cardano in 2025 is the potential approval of a fund (ETF) by regulators. If Grayscale’s ADA fund receives the green light, it could attract significant investments from large groups, potentially driving the price of ADA higher. Some estimates suggest that Cardano could climb to between $0.735 and $1.88 by year’s end, depending on market sentiment and the rollout of features like Hydra and the Midnight-Cardano privacy link. Cardano has strong technical roots, but its growth might take longer than fresher, quicker projects. It relies heavily on big investors and tech fixes, which can slow things down in a rapidly changing market.

Cardano has been a long-time player known for its technological rigor and methodical development, whereas Little Pepe is a nascent meme coin with a rapidly growing community and exciting market prospects. The Evolution of Cardano in the Crypto Market Cardano, with its robust technological foundation, continues to innovate with updates such as the Hydra scaling solution and the integration of governance features through the Voltaire upgrade. Heading into 2025, Cardano's market cap is nearly $30 billion, illustrating its significant impact. The potential approval of a Grayscale ADA fund could further catapult its financial standing, with price projections reaching between $0.735 and $1.88. Despite its solid technological base, Cardano's progress is dependent on these technological advancements and institutional investments, which might not appeal to the fast-paced retail market that craves quick gains. Emergence of Little Pepe as a Contender in Meme Coins LILPEPE is gaining traction with its clever market positioning and community-focused strategies. Since its introduction, it has garnered about $26.3 million through presales, paving the way for its potential explosion in the meme coin segment. Little Pepe's no-trade-fee approach and strategic reserve funds signify a well-thought-out entrance into the market. Little Pepe's commitment to community engagement and safety is evident in its promotional strategies and security measures. A notable highlight includes the well-documented whitepaper and the high security score by Certik, reassuring investors of its credibility. Community and Safety: Key to Little Pepe’s Success The meme coin's strategy involves hefty community engagement with initiatives like their $777,000 giveaway, which attracted a massive audience. This kind of marketing not only boosts the coin's visibility but also establishes a loyal user base, essential for the longevity of any meme coin. Moreover, Little Pepe’s safety features and transparency are factors that provide it an edge in a market segment that's frequently scrutinized for security concerns. Comparative Analysis: Cardano and Little Pepe in 2025 While Cardano continues to build on its sophisticated platform, catering to a more tech-savvy and patient investor base, Little Pepe capitalizes on the dynamic meme coin market with its aggressive community engagement and marketing stunts. The question for investors in 2025 would be whether to opt for the steady and promising growth of Cardano or to ride the volatile but potentially more lucrative waves of Little Pepe. Conclusion: Navigating Future Investments in Crypto For those considering investments in cryptocurrency in 2025, the choice between a foundational coin like Cardano and an emerging meme coin like Little Pepe depends on their risk tolerance and investment strategy. Cardano offers stability and a progressive outlook with substantial tech advancements, whereas Little Pepe presents an opportunity for rapid growth powered by its vibrant community and marketing strategies.

Major catalyst: U.S. government shutdown prompted a flight to safe-haven assets, boosting Bitcoin demand. Strong institutional ETF inflows supplied sustained buying pressure and increased market liquidity. October momentum: BTC rose over 30% in October, hitting ~ $125,689 on Oct 5, 2025 (all-time high). Bitcoin price hits $125,000 on Oct 5, 2025 — read concise analysis, causes, and market takeaways. Learn what investors should watch next. What caused Bitcoin’s price to surge past the $125,000 mark today? Bitcoin’s price surged past $125,000 due to a combination of macroeconomic uncertainty from the U.S. government shutdown, accelerated inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, and seasonal October strength. Institutional purchases and retail FOMO compounded into concentrated buying, pushing BTC to a new high near $125,689. How did ETF inflows and macro events combine to lift BTC? ETF inflows created steady, model-driven demand that absorbed available sell-side liquidity. At the same time, the U.S. government shutdown amplified risk-off sentiment across global markets, prompting a partial reallocation from fiat currencies and short-duration assets into perceived stores of value like BTC. Trading volumes and on-chain metrics show elevated deposit and withdrawal activity consistent with sustained buying. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-price-125k-oct-5-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Price Surges Past $125,000 Amid U.S. Government Shutdown and ETF Inflows"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin price hits $125,689 on October 5, 2025 as ETF inflows and macro uncertainty drive a flight to safety.

Predicting exact levels is speculative. Short-term targets will depend on continued ETF demand and macro developments. Traders typically watch psychological levels and liquidity bands; analysts reference previous resistance near $140k–$160k as possible future targets if inflows persist. Is this rally driven by retail or institutional buyers? Both. Institutional demand via spot ETFs provided structural buying, while retail participation increased during the breakout, amplifying short-term momentum. On-chain data and custody inflows indicate strong institutional allocation alongside elevated retail activity. What risks could reverse the rally? Key reversal risks include a rapid resolution of the U.S. shutdown reducing safe-haven flows, sudden ETF outflows, regulatory actions, or liquidity shocks in major exchanges. Market-makers may also tighten spreads, increasing volatility on fast retracements. Key Takeaways Macroeconomic trigger : A U.S. government shutdown prompted a flight to safety, accelerating demand for Bitcoin as a perceived store of value. Structural demand : Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows supplied sustained buying pressure, helping BTC clear prior resistance levels. Actionable insight : Monitor ETF flow reports, macro headlines, and exchange liquidity; consider staged profit-taking and risk controls in the current high-volatility environment. Conclusion Bitcoin’s surge past $125,000 on October 5, 2025 reflects a convergence of macro-driven safe-haven demand and structural ETF inflows. Market participants should remain attentive to ongoing fiscal developments, ETF flow data, and liquidity metrics.

52694751,https://invezz.com/?p=2908548,1759647600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Reddit buzz: best altcoins under $1 for 2025; analysts highlight ADA, VET and a rising star",https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/05/reddit-buzz-best-altcoins-under-1-for-2025-analysts-highlight-ada-vet-and-a-rising-star/,"Crypto fans on Reddit are debating the best altcoins to buy under $1 for 2025, and analysts have spotlighted three names. Cardano (ADA) and VeChain (VET) lead the conversation, but many eyes are shifting to a rising star — MAGACOIN FINANCE — which some are calling the hidden gem analyst pick. Cardano ADA: Can it climb back toward $1.33? Cardano (ADA) is one of the most-discussed projects on Reddit when it comes to the best altcoin to buy lists. Trading near $0.76, ADA is seen as undervalued by several analysts who believe it could climb back above the $1 mark in 2025. Analyst Arman Shaban pointed out that Cardano is hovering in a critical trading zone between $0.68 and $0.78. If it holds this level, ADA could begin a recovery with milestones at $0.85, $0.95, and $1.00. Longer-term t argets go as high as $1.33, provided market conditions stabilize. Other analysts, including Ali Martinez, have highlighted that ADA often follows historical patterns, with the possibility of reaching $3 or even higher later in the cycle. Still, the short-term picture depends on whether buyers can keep it above key levels. Despite recent struggles, ADA’s community remains active, and its long-term roadmap continues to attract attention. For Reddit users building a diversified list of best altcoins to buy , Cardano often makes the cut because of its history, liquidity, and established ecosystem. VeChain VET: The supply chain altcoin eyeing $1 VeChain (VET) is another analyst pick in the Reddit conversation about the best altcoin to buy under $1. Currently priced around two and a half cents, the idea of VET reaching $1 might sound far-fetched, but its focus on enterprise adoption gives it a unique path. VeChain solves real-world problems, particularly around supply chain management and sustainability. Walmart China uses it to track food, while auditors like PwC and DNV rely on its blockchain to verify corporate claims. Its two-token system separates daily costs (VTHO) from the value token (VET), making it easier for businesses to use without worrying about wild price swings. Recent upgrades, such as the Galactica and PoA 2.0 improvements, have strengthened the network. With new regulations in Europe pushing companies to back up their green commitments with real data, VeChain’s tools are gaining fresh relevance. For Reddit users exploring best altcoins to buy , VET’s mix of partnerships and long-term adoption stories keeps it on the list, even if reaching $1 requires massive growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Reddit’s rising star analyst pick Among Reddit’s debates on the best altcoins to buy , a new name is breaking through — MAGACOIN FINANCE . Unlike ADA and VET, which are already in the billion-dollar zone, MAGACOIN sits under $0.005, giving it room for rapid multiples if adoption increases. Analysts describe it as a hidden gem because it has real DeFi features. Its smaller cap makes it attractive for those looking beyond the old guard like ADA and VET, offering a new opportunity to diversify into a coin still early in its journey. Final thoughts: Diversify with old and new picks For those watching Reddit threads and analyst opinions on the best altcoins to buy , ADA and VET bring stability and history. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE adds fresh upside at a far lower entry point. Traders who want to balance old giants with new opportunities may want to explore further.

Pepe trades at $0.00000994, showing consolidation and potential for rapid gains. Shiba Inu is at $0.00001250, with short-term rallies tempered by whale activity and resistance levels. Amid this volatility, investors are looking for crypto with real utility and growth. Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a leading PayFi altcoin, offering verified security, a live wallet beta, and cross-border payment solutions, making it the best crypto to buy now. Pepe: Consolidation and Potential Breakout The cryptocurrency market is heating up in 2025, with meme coins like Pepe and Shiba Inu showing renewed activity. Pepe is currently priced at $0.00000994, and analysts are watching closely for a potential rally of over 100% as the price consolidates. Whale activity has caused some short-term selling, but the strong community and token burns, around 1.5 billion PEPE tokens burned last quarter, are helping support the price. Overall, PEPE recently outperformed some rivals during a meme coin rotation. Shiba Inu: Resistance Challenges and Market Recovery Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00001250 and has faced mixed signals. The short-term price movements are positive, with SHIB rising slightly over 24 hours. On the other hand, the long-term trends remain uncertain. The Shibarium platform has been restored after a $4 million bridge exploit, with security improvements like rotating validator keys and moving contracts to secure wallets. Token burns continue, with a recent 338% increase removing 410 million SHIB tokens. Despite these measures, whale activity and resistance around $0.0000128–$0.000013 remain key factors for price movement. Remittix: The Best Crypto To Buy Now While meme coins generate excitement, Remittix stands out as a trending altcoin with long-term growth potential. Remittix has raised over $27 million, sold over 674 million tokens, and is currently priced at $0.1130.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/expert-to-investors-buy-5000-xrp-asap-heres-why/,"Levi Rietveld, creator of Crypto Crusaders, recently delivered a strong message to the XRP army. In a video shared on X, he emphasized the need for individual investors to take immediate action, giving them multiple reasons to acquire at least 5,000 XRP before the end of the month. BUY 5000 #XRP ASAP pic.twitter.com/XCmVTVf8qq — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 3, 2025 Banks Face a Competitive Shift Rietveld linked his comments to a growing awareness within global banking institutions. He stated that world banks are beginning to realize they need XRP for cross-border payments and tokenization of real-world assets. He argued that this adoption will not only accelerate but also create major cost advantages. According to him, the banking sector could achieve savings estimated between $636 billion and $740 billion each year by adopting the XRP Ledger (XRPL) instead of relying on traditional systems like SWIFT. The reasoning is straightforward. A bank that embraces the efficiency and lower costs of XRP gains a structural advantage over competitors who remain with legacy networks. As Rietveld put it, if one bank adopts these systems while others do not, the early mover gains “one of the largest competitive advantages you can possibly ever hope for.” His view is that this incentive will push widespread institutional adoption . The Role of Major Partnerships A development that Rietveld connected to his argument is the recent collaboration between Securitize, BlackRock, and VanEck on XRPL. Securitize is already a key player in the tokenization of traditional financial instruments. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund and VanEck’s VBILL fund, both tokenized offerings, have begun integration with Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD. Through Securitize, investors in these funds can now redeem shares for RLUSD on-chain, a move that strengthens the infrastructure for tokenized assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This partnership represents a practical step toward embedding institutional-grade financial products directly into blockchain systems tied to the XRPL. Why Immediate Action Is Necessary Rietveld’s central message remains focused on timing. He told his audience that they will “need at least 5,000 XRP before the end of this month.” XRP is known for fast and aggressive moves , and Rietveld is advising investors to join the market or increase their holdings as soon as possible. He reinforced the argument that XRP is moving from potential to practical application with major partnerships and growing Institutional involvement. The urgency of his call reflects both confidence in XRPL’s role in the financial sector and recognition that opportunities can shift quickly once adoption accelerates.

Ethereum’s ADX broke a seven-year trendline while the green DI crossed above red, confirming a shift in long-term bullish strength. The RSI breakout from a multi-year downtrend mirrors pre-2020 rally patterns, signaling renewed market confidence and building momentum. Holding above the 21-month SMA and long-term trendline suggests Ethereum’s structure supports continued growth aligned with broader market optimism. Ethereum is showing a combination of bullish technical signals not seen in years. On the monthly chart, momentum indicators, trend structure, and long-term moving averages all point to a market transition that could redefine its broader trend direction. What is the Ethereum momentum breakout and why does it matter? The Ethereum momentum breakout refers to the simultaneous monthly ADX breakout, green DI crossing above red, and RSI clearing a long-term resistance while price remains above the 21-month SMA. These conditions increase the probability of a sustained bullish phase and attract renewed capital flows into ETH. How did ADX and directional indicators confirm the shift? On the monthly timeframe, the Average Directional Index (ADX) finally pierced a downward trendline that had limited trend strength since 2017. The green directional indicator crossing above the red confirms buying pressure superiority, a setup historically linked to multi-month advances. Plain text source mentions: Crypto Crew University highlighted the ADX trendline breach as a key signal. This alignment of ADX and DI on a monthly chart is rare and typically precedes extended trend expansion. How does the RSI breakout compare to past cycles? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) cleared a multi-year descending resistance, a behavior that mirrored pre-2020 accumulation phases. In prior cycles, similar RSI breakouts aligned with the start of extended bullish runs lasting several months to over a year. RSI momentum suggests investor conviction is improving, often translating into larger inflows when macro liquidity conditions are supportive. What role do support levels and moving averages play? Ethereum holding above the 21-month Simple Moving Average (SMA) and a long-term rising trendline preserves the structural integrity of the upswing. These levels act as key technical support; a sustained hold increases the likelihood of further gains. Market analyst Mikybull Crypto noted that Ethereum’s behavior is tracking the Russell 2000 Index, which recently reached a multi-year high. Historically, such cross-market correlation hints at broader liquidity expansion benefiting altcoins. How should traders interpret this setup? Traders should view the setup as a conditional bullish edge: confirmation comes from continued ADX strength, RSI momentum, and price staying above the 21-month SMA. Risk management remains essential—use clear stop levels below major support zones to guard against trend failures. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is this a confirmed long-term breakout for Ethereum?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The monthly ADX and RSI breakouts plus holding above the 21-month SMA provide strong evidence of a structural shift, but confirmation requires sustained price action above key supports and continued momentum indicators."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What technical levels should traders watch for ETH?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Traders should monitor the 21-month SMA, the long-term rising trendline, and momentum readings on monthly ADX and RSI.

Monthly ADX breaking its long-term downtrend, green DI crossing above red, RSI clearing a multi-year resistance, and price holding above the 21-month SMA together suggest Ethereum has likely completed a corrective phase and may be entering a new bullish cycle. How long could the bullish phase last if confirmed? Past instances of similar monthly breakouts have led to bullish phases lasting several months to over a year, but duration depends on macro liquidity, market participation, and on-chain metrics supporting sustained inflows. Key Takeaways ADX confirmation : ADX and DI alignment signal renewed long-term strength. RSI breakout : RSI clearing multi-year resistance mirrors prior pre-rally patterns. Structural support : Holding above the 21-month SMA and trendline is critical for continuation; manage risk below these levels. Conclusion Ethereum’s monthly chart presents a compelling technical case for renewed upside: an Ethereum momentum breakout driven by ADX, RSI, and key moving averages. While historical precedents favor continued gains, traders should combine this technical evidence with disciplined risk management and monitor macro liquidity signals for confirmation. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret an Ethereum monthly breakout"", ""description"": ""Simple steps to evaluate a monthly breakout in Ethereum using ADX, RSI, and moving averages."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm ADX and DI alignment"", ""text"": ""Check monthly ADX has broken its downtrend and the green DI is above the red DI to confirm rising trend strength."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Verify RSI breakout"", ""text"": ""Ensure RSI clears its multi-year descending resistance to signal momentum expansion."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess price vs moving averages"", ""text"": ""Confirm price holds above the 21-month SMA and key rising trendlines; place protective stops below these levels."" } ]}",Analysis|Ethereum|News|ETH,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-05 07:06:02

This lead is driven by $2B in new stablecoin inflows, major upgrades (Alpenglow, Firedancer) and sharply higher trading throughput and lower fees. Market share: Solana holds ~95.6% of tokenized stock trading volume. Drivers: $2B stablecoin inflows, Alpenglow and Firedancer upgrades, and record trading volumes. Competitors: Gnosis ~1.98%, Ethereum ~1.8% (Source: Solana Floor, Vaneck, Token Terminal). Solana tokenized stock trading dominance leads markets; learn why SOL surged and what comes next — read on for data-backed analysis and action items. How dominant is Solana in tokenized stock trading? Solana dominance in tokenized stock trading is pronounced: Solana accounted for approximately 95.6% of tokenized-stock trading volume over the last 30 days, with daily market share rarely dipping below 89% aside from a brief 26 September drop. That share outpaces Gnosis and Ethereum by a wide margin. What drove Solana’s lead in tokenized assets? Multiple measurable factors propelled Solana ahead. The network saw roughly $2 billion in new stablecoin inflows in September, lifting stablecoin balances to about $14.3 billion and capturing a 60% share of tokenized stock trades, according to Vaneck and on-chain tallies. Technical upgrades — notably Alpenglow and Firedancer — increased throughput and stability, improving settlement times and reducing fees. These operational gains attracted institutional liquidity and high-frequency trading activity, reflected in multi-month highs for SOL trading volume (Source: Token Terminal). Solana Floor data shows SOL’s tokenized-stock share stayed above 89% on most days, underscoring persistent trader preference for speed and low-cost execution over alternative chains in this specific market niche. Source: Solana Floor A standout September for Solana September’s inflows and network upgrades were central. Vaneck’s September analysis and on-chain reports both highlighted Solana’s outsized gains in tokenized equities issuance and trading activity. Stablecoin inflows of ~$2 billion in a single month increased liquidity available for tokenized stock trades and helped push Solana’s total tokenized-stablecoin pool to about $14.3 billion. That liquidity concentration supports deeper order books and tighter spreads for tokenized assets. Upgrades like Alpenglow (throughput optimizations) and Firedancer (performance improvements) targeted reliability and latency — two attributes large traders prioritize for high-volume derivatives and tokenized-equity operations. Trading volumes climb to multi-month high On-chain metrics and exchange-level reporting show SOL trading volumes reached multi-month highs during this period. Lower transaction fees and faster settlement times contributed to renewed investor confidence. Developers and market participants cited improved infrastructure and reduced friction as reasons for increased listing and trading activity in tokenized securities markets. Market watchers emphasize that execution quality and cost remain decisive variables for liquidity migration between chains. Source: Token Terminal What’s next for SOL? Solana’s near-term outlook in tokenized equities is tied to continued liquidity flows, issuer adoption and maintenance of low-cost, high-throughput execution. If stablecoin liquidity and trading activity persist, demand for SOL could remain elevated for network fees and staking-related utility. Rivals such as Ethereum and Gnosis retain development roadmaps aimed at scaling and cost reduction. Planned Ethereum scaling upgrades and cross-chain liquidity solutions could reduce Solana’s advantage over time, so continued technical iteration will be critical for SOL’s market position. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much of tokenized stock trading does Solana control?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Solana controls approximately 95.6% of tokenized stock trading volume over the past 30 days, according to Solana Floor data."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What factors drove Solana's market share in September?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key factors include about $2 billion in new stablecoin inflows, Alpenglow and Firedancer upgrades improving throughput, and record trading volumes that favored low fees and fast settlement."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Could other blockchains catch up to Solana in tokenized stocks?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Solana’s ~95.6% share eclipses Gnosis (~1.98%) and Ethereum (~1.8%) in tokenized stock trading volume for the past 30 days, per Solana Floor and supplementary market reports. Why did stablecoin inflows matter for tokenized stocks? Stablecoin inflows provide the settlement medium and liquidity for tokenized-stock trading. The influx of ~$2B in September increased available capital and improved depth, reducing slippage for large trades. Key Takeaways Dominant market share : Solana reached ~95.6% of tokenized-stock trading volume over 30 days. Liquidity and upgrades : ~$2B stablecoin inflows and upgrades (Alpenglow, Firedancer) strengthened network appeal. Outlook : Sustained liquidity and ongoing technical iteration are required for Solana to maintain this lead as competitors scale. Conclusion Solana’s dominant position in tokenized stock trading is supported by measurable liquidity gains and targeted performance upgrades. While current data points to SOL’s strength in this niche, continued monitoring of stablecoin flows, upgrade rollouts and competitor scaling efforts is essential.

Selig, who currently serves as general counsel on the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Crypto Task Force, is expected to be formally nominated soon. A source familiar with the matter said in a statement that “Selig's candidacy could be announced at any time.” Many in the cryptocurrency industry support Selig's appointment. Alluvial COO and former corporate lawyer Evan Weiss shared on his X account, “Selig, who currently leads the SEC's Crypto Task Force, has delivered the most effective work of any major regulator. If we want the US to be the crypto capital, Mike is the right person to lead the CFTC.” Expressions of support for Selig also came from several crypto lawyers and lobbyists after Politico reported on his candidacy on Thursday. Related News: Claims Spread That XRP Spot ETF Was Automatically Approved: How True Is It? Before Selig's name surfaced, former Trump administration nominee Brian Quintenz had been a frontrunner to lead the CFTC. However, Quintenz, who serves as policy director at Andreessen Horowitz's (a16z) cryptocurrency unit, was blocked by Gemini exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The Winklevoss brothers privately conveyed their concerns about the seven-year CFTC investigation into Gemini, which concluded this year, to Quintenz. Quintenz, in turn, shared these messages publicly, stating that “they are clear about what they want and refuse to make any promises.” Following this development, Quintenz's candidacy was shelved. Selig, previously an associate attorney at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, is a longtime advocate for the crypto industry. Prior to Trump's November 2024 victory, he was a frequent critic of former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's “regulation by enforcement” approach. Related News: Claims Spread That XRP Spot ETF Was Automatically Approved: How True Is It? “The election is a week away, Bitcoin has surpassed $71,000, and Gensler will soon be vacating his office. It's time for the SEC to embrace crypto again,” he wrote in an October 2024 post. Selig, who was appointed general counsel to the SEC's 14-person Crypto Task Force in March, also serves as a senior advisor to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins. Atkins' “Project Crypto” initiative, announced in July, aims to transition capital markets to a blockchain-based structure. Interestingly, Cameron Winklevoss, one of the Winklevoss brothers, recently described the project as “one of the most groundbreaking initiatives I’ve read about in a long time.” *This is not investment advice.

Avalanche Treasury targets a $1B AVAX reserve and has secured roughly $460M ahead of a $675M SPAC listing. AVAX DEX volume spikes to $791M, exchange outflows drop, Avalanche Treasury readies SPAC move — read the latest analysis and what traders should watch next. What is driving the recent AVAX DEX volume spike? AVAX DEX volume climbed to roughly $791.45 million in a 24-hour window, driven by increased trading on automated market makers and a rise in smart contract activity. This surge reflects strong on-chain liquidity and elevated user interaction across Avalanche-based decentralized exchanges. How did exchange flows change and what does negative netflow mean? Exchange netflows shifted from positive inflows mid-September to negative readings after 22 September, with outflows approaching -$10 million. Negative netflow typically signals reduced selling pressure on centralized venues and may support price stabilization when withdrawals outweigh deposits. Analyst-tracked inflow spikes between 10–13 September—around +$11M and +$12M—preceded distribution phases, then reversed as holdings moved off exchanges. Early October data continued to show slightly negative netflows, indicating constrained exchange-based sell pressure. How has AVAX price reacted to flows and liquidity changes? AVAX price traded between $24.88 and $37.11 during the observed period. After initial inflows, AVAX dipped under $30 before recovering toward $37 on 19 September, then settled around $30–$31 by early October. Reduced exchange balances aligned with narrower trading ranges and more subdued volatility. Why does the Avalanche Treasury SPAC plan matter for AVAX? Avalanche Treasury Co. announced plans for a $675M SPAC listing with Mountain Lake Acquisition and aims to build a $1 billion AVAX reserve, with approximately $460M reported secured. Such capitalization can attract institutional interest and create a persistent buy-side catalyst for AVAX liquidity. Source: Coinglass What do smart contract deployments reveal about network health? Smart contract deployments on Avalanche reportedly tripled year-over-year, indicating sustained developer activity and growing on-chain utility. Increasing contract counts support higher DEX throughput and are consistent with rising AVAX DEX volume and protocol-level usage. How should traders interpret DEX volume versus centralized exchange flows? High DEX volume reflects active liquidity and on-chain trading, while negative centralized exchange netflows indicate tokens moving off exchanges—often reducing immediate sell pressure. Together, these signals suggest a market with robust decentralized trading but restrained centralized supply for now. Frequently Asked Questions How large was AVAX’s 24-hour DEX volume peak? AVAX DEX settlements reached approximately $791.45 million in a single 24-hour period, positioning Avalanche among networks with top-tier decentralized liquidity during that window. Did exchange outflows cause the price stabilization? Partially. Exchange outflows near -$10M reduced available exchange liquidity, which tends to compress volatility and can help stabilize prices when demand remains steady. What is the Avalanche Treasury SPAC proposal? Avalanche Treasury Co. plans a $675M SPAC listing and aims to build a $1B AVAX reserve, with around $460M reportedly secured, signaling potential institutional interest and treasury-backed token exposure. Key Takeaways DEX Liquidity Surge : AVAX recorded $791.45M in 24h DEX volume, reflecting strong AMM activity. Exchange Netflow Shift : Netflows turned negative after 22 September, with outflows near $10M, indicating less centralized sell pressure. Treasury Moves : Avalanche Treasury’s SPAC plan and $1B reserve target may attract institutional capital and support long-term liquidity.

52695745,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85409,1759651359,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,When Ripple CTO Indirectly Told XRP Holders Not to Sell Early,https://timestabloid.com/when-ripple-cto-indirectly-told-xrp-holders-not-to-sell-early/,"Crypto commentator Jack The Rippler recently drew attention to a post from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, which serves as a cautionary reminder for investors. In his message, Jack emphasized the importance of patience in the digital asset market, using Schwartz’s personal experience with Ethereum to underline the risks of selling too early. Schwartz disclosed that he once sold 40,000 ETH at roughly one dollar per coin to finance the installation of solar panels on a property he no longer owns. While the decision may have seemed rational at the time, the value of that Ethereum surged significantly not long after. The amount he sold would have exceeded $100 million during the market’s rise. This personal anecdote has now been reframed by Jack The Rippler as a warning to XRP holders who may be tempted to take profits prematurely. Remember, David Schwartz indirectly tells you not to sell your #XRP too early. HODL! pic.twitter.com/tOsqCeJhwa — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 2, 2025 Jack The Rippler’s Perspective on XRP Jack linked Schwartz’s past decision to the present outlook for XRP, suggesting that holders should carefully consider the long-term potential of the asset before selling. His post carried a straightforward message: holding XRP may prove to be far more rewarding than short-term gains. According to him, Schwartz’s story illustrates the difficulty of timing markets and the importance of conviction when investing in digital assets with long-term utility. Supporters in the XRP community responded positively to Jack’s message, viewing it as a timely reminder to stay committed despite short-term volatility. For many, Schwartz’s ETH sale represents a vivid example of how quickly value can change in this market. While Ethereum eventually became one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world, Schwartz’s decision demonstrates how even experienced figures in the industry can miss out on extraordinary gains. Community Reactions The post triggered several comments from XRP supporters who resonated with Jack’s point. One user, identified as Capetonian, remarked that in the future, people might look back and recall selling 1,000 XRP at $100 to purchase a car, only to later see XRP valued at $10,000. This perspective aligned with Jack’s message about the dangers of exiting the market too soon. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another community member, XRP Eagle, added that the advice was a valuable reminder to “hold the line,” reinforcing the collective sentiment within the XRP community to remain patient. A Lesson for Investors Jack The Rippler’s use of Schwartz’s story is less about regret and more about reinforcing discipline in the market. The rapid growth of digital assets has repeatedly shown that early exits often come at the cost of massive unrealized gains. XRP, with its ongoing developments and increasing relevance in financial discussions, is seen by many as a digital asset with significant long-term potential. By spotlighting David Schwartz’s experience, Jack The Rippler underlined that even those deeply involved in the industry have faced challenges in managing their holdings. His message to XRP holders is clear: patience could be the deciding factor in realizing the true value of their investment.

With resistance levels approaching and market momentum building, traders are watching closely for the next breakout. Just as technical signals guide XRP’s path, effective communications play a critical role in shaping project visibility. That’s where Outset PR , with its data-driven and cost-optimized strategies, helps crypto businesses capture attention at the right time. XRP Poised for Growth as Price Edges Higher Source: tradingview XRP is trading between $2.71 and $3.01, showing a steady climb. In the past week, its value jumped by roughly 11%, while over the past six months, it's up by nearly 42%. Currently, XRP eyes the $3.16 mark as its immediate challenge, with potential to rise to $3.46 if momentum holds. The 10-day average staying above the 100-day suggests positive sentiment. With market tools like RSI close to a balanced state and MACD showing slight positive vibes, XRP has room to grow. If bullish trends continue, breaching the nearest resistance could yield another double-digit percentage boost on its current price. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Conclusion As XRP eyes new highs and ETF inflows remain in the spotlight, the theme is clear: momentum needs both market confidence and the right narrative. For crypto projects navigating similar turning points, Outset PR delivers that edge—through proprietary tools like Syndication Map, smart syndication strategies, and trusted media relationships. The result is visibility that scales beyond expectations, much like XRP’s potential rally. In both trading and PR, precision and timing make all the difference.

Its strong momentum and volatile trading range suggest that a breakout could be on the horizon. Just as traders rely on key resistance and support levels to gauge the next move, crypto projects rely on precise communication strategies to stand out. That’s where Outset PR comes in, bringing data-driven clarity and performance-based campaigns to ensure messages land at exactly the right moment. Solana Eyes New Heights as Investors Watch Key Levels Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is currently trading between mid to high $100s and low $200s. With a recent weekly gain near 20% and a monthly climb over 10%, Solana shows solid upward momentum. The nearest resistance is just under $260, and breaking through this could mean significant gains. If momentum continues, it might surge toward $305, marking a roughly 30% increase from the current range. However, if the price dips below $167, it could head down to the $120 level. The coin's volatility offers both challenges and opportunities, as recent trends show its potential for nearly doubling in value over six months.

Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets.
