In other words, XRP’s liquidity reality may be far smaller than its theoretical supply, meaning smaller inflows of capital could trigger disproportionately large price reactions. Understanding the Market Cap Multiplier In a recent video, Jake Claver, managing partner at Digital Wealth Partners, tackled the growing debate head-on: “People look at total supply of XRP when, in reality, the supply-demand dynamics are going to be on the available supply of XRP,” he explained. This distinction — between XRP’s total supply of 100 billion and the much smaller circulating amount that actually trades — is at the heart of the multiplier effect. Let's look at what the XRP market cap multiplier effect means pic.twitter.com/5tiUdpHt6i — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 3, 2025 Claver illustrated this with a practical example: “There might be 2 billion XRP left on exchanges — probably less than that if you include retail and what they’re going to exit or sell.” He added that even if XRP’s price skyrockets to $10, $20, or even $50, some retail investors would inevitably sell portions of their holdings, adding perhaps another billion XRP to the liquid market. But that still represents a small share of total supply. The Math Behind the Multiplier Claver broke down the logic simply: “If you only had, let’s say, 2 billion [XRP] out of 100 billion, you’d be that 50x that Zach Rector talks about. It’s total supply versus available supply — and that’s why you get a shift in how much liquidity moving in is going to cause the market cap to rise in a multiplier effect.” When buyers enter the market, their demand impacts a smaller pool of available tokens, rather than the total supply. This limited float magnifies price movements, which in turn amplifies market capitalization faster than would occur in a fully distributed asset. Institutional Holdings and Market Liquidity Claver also revealed that his firm, Digital Wealth Partners, currently manages around 200 million XRP, accounting for roughly 8% of retail-owned XRP, based on his estimates. This institutional custody further concentrates holdings, reducing the amount of XRP readily available on exchanges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 “Retail doesn’t hold more than maybe 1.2 to 2 billion total XRP in my opinion,” he said, emphasizing that these liquidity dynamics are critical for understanding XRP’s future price behavior. Broader Context and Implications While the multiplier concept doesn’t change XRP’s total supply — which remains capped at 100 billion — it reframes how market participants should interpret liquidity and price discovery. Ripple’s monthly escrow releases , typically capped at 1 billion XRP, also control how much new supply enters circulation, keeping active liquidity relatively tight. The takeaway is clear: XRP’s potential price response is not purely a function of total supply, but of how much XRP is actually tradable. As Claver summarized, “It’s total supply versus available supply. That’s the reason there is a multiplier effect.” The XRP market cap multiplier effect shows how small changes in liquidity can lead to significant price movements. It’s not speculation — it’s a structural feature of how XRP trades in real-world conditions, where limited availability magnifies every dollar of demand that flows into the asset.

But what you've heard or seen so far doesn't necessarily align with what's actually coming out.” The company announced that the new program will be called MetaMask Rewards and will not be a farming-focused system. It was announced that more than $30 million in LINEA token rewards will be distributed in the first season (Season 1).

Timing is crucial: the best stories sync with industry cycles like regulation, restaking, or stablecoins. Syndication multiplies reach: one article can turn into dozens of pickups across CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, Yahoo Finance, and more. Long-term PR builds reputation and trust — moving projects from short-term hype to lasting influence. For many founders, PR begins and ends with a press release. You raise a round, launch a feature, or announce a partnership — so you send a statement to the media and hope it lands somewhere. But in crypto, where attention cycles move at breakneck speed and skepticism is the default, a press release alone rarely does the job. The projects that break through are the ones that treat PR not as a one-off announcement, but as a way to shape narratives, influence conversations, and build credibility over time. Crypto PR Turns Features Into Stories That Matter The crypto industry is littered with updates that sound alike: staking pools, wallet upgrades, bridge integrations. On their own, they blur together. What cuts through is when a feature becomes part of a bigger story. Take gas fees: no journalist is writing about a dashboard redesign. But if a protocol slashes fees at a time when high costs are throttling DeFi activity, that update suddenly taps into one of the space’s biggest debates. Agencies like Outset PR build entire campaigns on this principle. They argue that newsworthiness comes not from the feature itself, but from the tension it addresses in the wider market. It’s a simple filter: if it matters beyond the company’s walls, it matters to the press. Why Timing Is Critical in Web3 Narratives In crypto, timing can be as important as substance. The industry shifts focus every few weeks: one moment it’s restaking, the next it’s stablecoins, then regulation. The strongest stories can fall flat if they land just a few days too late. This is why timing is often cited as the biggest mistake projects make in their outreach — assuming that because something is big for them, it will automatically matter for everyone else. PR done well is less about hype and more about syncing with the rhythm of the industry. Get it right, and your project feels relevant. Miss the window, and even a solid story disappears. Tailoring for Media and Community Crypto PR also has to work on two fronts: journalists and communities. Both care about the same story, but they consume it differently. Media want clarity and independence. They need verifiable data, not just claims. Communities want belonging. They want to feel like progress is happening because of them and with them. Smart PR reframes the same narrative for both. For the press: “Our protocol reduced gas fees by 70%, backed by hard numbers.” For the community: “We heard your feedback, and together we solved one of the biggest pain points.” It’s the same story, just told through different lenses — and that balance is what builds trust. Syndication in Crypto PR: From One Press Release to Dozens of Mentions One of the most overlooked aspects of crypto PR is what happens after an article runs. A single placement can spark dozens of secondary mentions across aggregators, media hubs, and community feeds. This ripple effect is often invisible to teams who only track traffic from the first article. Yet it’s what determines whether a project’s story feels like a blip — or like it’s everywhere. For example, Outset PR tracked how a tier-1 feature for StealthEX turned into 92 republications across platforms like CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance. The outreach from those pickups reached billions, far beyond what the original article could have achieved alone. Outset PR even developed a syndication map , a tool that identifies which outlets trigger the most secondary coverage. It’s a rare data-driven approach in a space that usually treats PR results as intangible. From Attention to Reputation Ultimately, PR isn’t about a single headline. It’s about compounding. Each story, AMA, and narrative that ties back to a project’s mission builds over time. Journalists begin to view the team as credible commentators. Communities start to see the project not just as another token, but as part of the industry’s direction. That shift — from chasing attention to earning reputation — is what separates projects that flash and fade from those that last. Why Crypto PR Is More Than Announcements A press release says you exist. PR, at its best, explains why you matter. It frames features as part of larger narratives. It aligns with industry cycles instead of fighting them. It adapts to different audiences without losing authenticity. And it ensures stories don’t just land once, but echo across the ecosystem. As cases from Outset PR show, crypto PR is not about vanity mentions. It’s about giving every story both meaning and momentum. For founders trying to figure out if PR is worth the effort, some common questions always come up. Let’s tackle them. FAQ: Crypto PR and Web3 Storytelling Q: Is a press release enough to promote a crypto project?A: Not really. A press release can announce your update, but it won’t shape the narrative or guarantee visibility. Effective crypto PR connects your update to industry-wide conversations and ensures amplification across media, aggregators, and communities. Q: What’s the difference between PR and marketing in crypto?A: Marketing drives direct results — clicks, traffic, signups. PR builds reputation and credibility by shaping how your project is perceived in the media and among investors. In crypto, where trust is often the barrier, PR makes marketing more effective. Q: How does PR help with investor trust?A: Third-party validation. When investors see your project covered by credible outlets, it reduces skepticism. PR places you in those outlets and frames you as part of the broader conversation. Q: What is syndication in crypto PR?A: Syndication is when one article gets echoed across dozens of platforms like CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, or Yahoo Finance. It multiplies your visibility far beyond the original hit — sometimes 10x over. Q: How do I choose the right crypto PR agency?A: Look for agencies with a track record in Web3, that understand narrative cycles, and that can show data on outcomes — not just placements, but the ripple effects of coverage.",More News,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BNB|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-04 20:51:38

Tether To Launch Digital Asset Treasury Firm With XAUT: Report On Friday, October 3rd, Bloomberg reported that Tether and financial services firm Antalpha Platform Holding are leading an effort to raise at least $200 million to set up a digital asset treasury company. Citing unnamed sources close to the matter, this public vehicle would use the capital to purchase XAUT, Tether’s gold token. Bloomberg revealed that Antalpha Platform Holding has close ties to Bitmain Technologies, the world’s largest Bitcoin hardware supplier based in China. According to a report from the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, the Bitcoin hardware manufacturer supplies about 82% of the world’s crypto mining machines. Bloomberg posited that this capital-raising effort would further strengthen the relationship between two of the largest companies in the global crypto industry. Meanwhile, this venture would represent a continuation in digital asset treasury companies’ craze happening this year, with more than 80 firms set up so far in 2025. Furthermore, the report revealed that asset manager Cohen & Company is the lead advisor on the deal, with further talks kept private. While most parties declined to comment, Tether reportedly pointed out a post on the social media platform X about its recent announcement with Antalpha. As per the post on X , Antalpha revealed that it would be integrating Tether Gold into its Real-World Assets (RWA) Hub, offering tokenized gold-backed lending and infrastructure solutions. The financial services firm also announced that it would set up physical vaults in major financial centers around the world to allow holders to exchange the tokens for gold bars. This move to offer XAUT-backed lending came after Tether had purchased an 8.1% stake in Antalpha during its initial public offering (IPO) earlier in May 2025. Tether Gold, launched in 2020, offers investors an exposure to gold without physically owning the metal. With a market capitalization of about $1.5 billion, Tether claims that the almost 250,000 XAUT tokens in circulation are backed by an equivalent of more than 7.66 tons of gold . USDT Market Cap At $175 Billion At the same time, Tether owns the largest dollar-backed stablecoin and the fourth-largest digital asset in the cryptocurrency market, with a market cap of more than $175 billion.",Tether (USDT)|Antalpha|Bitmain|Bloomberg|crypto|gold|Tether|USDT|xaut,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDT|FIAT|XAUT|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 21:00:06

With recent price gains and steady market momentum, many are wondering if ADA can finally break through the barrier and push beyond the dollar mark. This article looks at the key indicators shaping ADA’s next move—and also highlights how Outset PR applies data-driven clarity to help crypto projects, much like ADA itself, position for lasting growth in a competitive environment. Cardano on the Rise: Potential Growth Amidst Recent Gains Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is on an upward swing, trading between about 75 to 88 cents. In the past week alone, its price has jumped over 12%. Heading towards the 95-cent resistance mark, Cardano shows promise. If it breaks this barrier, it could target a rise beyond one dollar, which implies a sharp climb. Over the last six months, Cardano has seen a growth of over 31%. Key support at around 69 cents could act as a cushion if prices dip. With a relative strength index near 50, Cardano seems balanced between overbought and oversold, suggesting room for potential further upward movement.

Analyst Identifies 2 Conditions For Uptrend,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-to-160000-by-early-2026-analyst/,"The price of Bitcoin made a dreamy start to the last quarter of the year, beginning the historically bullish month of October with a reclaim of the $120,000 level. After over a month of choppy price action, the world’s largest cryptocurrency seems to be resuming its bullish uptrend. With the price closing in on its all-time high price above $124,000, investors will be looking to see how far and long the premier cryptocurrency can go in the latest leg up. According to an on-chain analyst on social media platform X, the price of BTC could rise as high as $160,000 in the current run. Why A Break Above $128k Is Critical To BTC’s Bull Run In an October 3 post on X, crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. put forward a $160,000 target for the Bitcoin price at the start of next year. According to the online pundit, the sustained progression of BTC’s price action to this unprecedented high hinges on two primary conditions, or two price levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forecast: Expert Predicts Final Impulse Wave Targeting $18,000 This bullish analysis revolves around the historical price performance of Bitcoin following the halving event. Typically, the halving event is viewed as a catalytic event that triggers long-term price rallies for BTC, as it involves slashing by half the volume of the premier cryptocurrency created at a time. As observed in the chart above, the scenario-based model shows through a trend-based forecast that each halving cycle produces an exponentially higher peak for the Bitcoin price. According to this model, the price of BTC printed a post-halving peak around $57,000 following the 2020 event, beating the previous high of $4,250. Adler Jr. revealed that the Bitcoin price could head for $160,000 after the 2024 halving event, which saw miner rewards fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. However, for this rally to be confirmed, the first condition is that the flagship cryptocurrency will need to break above the $128,000 and hold above this “base” level on multiple weekly closes. In the second condition, the on-chain analyst shared that Bitcoin’s upward movement toward the $160,000 mark could be at risk of invalidation should the price fall below the $102,000 level. According to Adler Jr., a breakdown beneath this level could lead to a quick scenario reset, potentially changing the target or overall trend for the Bitcoin price. Ultimately, the price action of BTC in the short term is one to look out for, as the market leader looks to reclaim its current all-time high. Moreover, a break above the record-high price could clear the path for Bitcoin to reach the ‘base” level of $128,000. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $122,710, reflecting a 2% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the top cryptocurrency is up by more than 12% in the last seven days.

TON price faces a critical test at $2: buyers must reassert control with clear volume support and declining exchange inflows to prevent a slide to $1.60–$1.20. Current taker CVD and netflow signals favor sellers, so momentum confirmation is essential for a sustainable defense. How does taker CVD reflect current market bias? Toncoin’s spot taker CVD chart shows dominant red zones, indicating aggressive taker sells. Short, repeated red spikes suggest sellers are executing market orders more frequently than buyers. Without a sustained shift to green CVD, the bias remains bearish and hinders meaningful recoveries. TON’s extended consolidation near key support — what does it mean? TON has traded inside a prolonged channel between $2.50 and $3.68, retesting mid-range levels without conviction. Price indecision points to a balance between weak bulls and persistent bears. If $2.50 collapses, downside momentum may accelerate; holding near $2 supports the case for a gradual rebound. Buy-side weakness around $2 diminishes the probability of an immediate recovery. Traders should treat the $2 zone as a make-or-break area: a sustained hold can open recovery targets at $3.20–$3.50, while failure increases the chance of reaching $1.60 or $1.20. Source: TradingView Do inflows and cooling volumes confirm a bearish market outlook for TON? Yes. Weekly Netflow data shows steady inflows—most recently around $4.12M—consistent with tokens moving to exchanges for potential liquidation. At the same time, the Spot Volume Bubble map shows shrinking bubbles, signaling declining trading conviction. These combined metrics support a bearish outlook until they diverge. How should traders interpret cooling spot volumes? Cooling spot volumes indicate reduced participation. Historically, declining volumes often precede major moves—either accumulation or distribution. For TON, diminished volumes alongside selling inflows suggest distribution, increasing the likelihood of lower prices unless buyer capital returns. Source: CryptoQuant How do exchange inflows affect downside risk for TON? Exchange inflows raise downside risk because they increase sell-side supply. The latest weekly netflow reading (~$4.12M) aligns with weak CVD and fading volumes, reinforcing the seller-controlled narrative. Without a notable shift to outflows, accumulation signals remain absent and rallies are likely to struggle. Source: CoinGlass Frequently Asked Questions What price targets should traders watch if $2 fails? If $2 fails, the next meaningful targets are $1.60 and then $1.20, driven by increased selling pressure and exchange inflows. Watch for accelerating taker sells and expanding outflow volumes for confirmation of those moves. How quickly can TON recover if buyers return? Recovery speed depends on volume intensity: a sustained shift to green taker CVD and measurable outflows from exchanges could push TON toward $3.20–$3.50 over several sessions. Absent strong volume, recoveries are likely to be shallow and short-lived. Which indicators provide the clearest signals for TON right now? Primary indicators to watch: taker CVD (aggression), Spot Volume Bubble map (conviction), and weekly exchange netflows (supply/demand balance). Together they reveal whether buyers or sellers control the next directional move. Key Takeaways $2 is TON’s pivotal level : A sustained defense requires renewed buyer volume and reduced exchange inflows. Seller dominance on CVD : Persistent red zones and shrinking spot volumes point to distribution, not accumulation. Actionable watchlist : Monitor taker CVD, spot volume bubbles, and weekly netflows for early signs of reversal or continued breakdown. Conclusion Toncoin (TON) remains in a fragile state around the $2 support; current metrics favor sellers and emphasize the risk of a slide to $1.60–$1.20. Traders should prioritize volume-confirmed signals and exchange flow shifts.

This isn’t about hype or speculation—it’s a data-driven analysis of what could be a defining moment for XRP’s price movement. According to a prominent analyst, this setup might be the very opportunity XRP holders have been waiting for. A Defining Moment for XRP Holders In a video shared on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO sounded the alarm: “XRP holders, this could literally be the moment we have been waiting for here on the channel.” He explained that XRP had been consolidating within a bull flag pattern since mid-July and is now beginning to show “very bullish signs.” Steph emphasized that this pattern could lead to a major breakout in the coming days or weeks if confirmed, saying, “I want you guys to be prepared for this. I want to show you exactly what my game plan is, what my expectations are. Is the momentum bullish? Is there a potential bull trap? What’s the best thing right now?” IF YOU HOLD #XRP I GOT NEWS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!! (urgent) pic.twitter.com/AkTJkXiv6i — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 3, 2025 The Key Confirmation Level: $3 Daily Close The analyst stressed that confirmation is essential before calling a full breakout: “For me to absolutely call and to confirm this breakout, I would need to see the daily candle of today close above three dollars.” According to Steph, a confirmed daily close above this level would strongly suggest that XRP is “most likely heading a lot higher in the next days and the next weeks.” He maintained a technical target of around $5 , derived from the height of the bull flag’s pole, but cautioned traders to remain realistic. “There are no guarantees on the way up,” he said. “Maybe XRP is not going to go to five dollars—maybe we’re going to stop at four dollars or $4.50. It’s important that you have an exit strategy and that you secure profits on the way up.” Bullish Momentum Confirmed by EMA Ribbons Steph also highlighted a significant technical signal—the EMA ribbons on the daily chart. He noted that XRP is “right now actually breaking above daily ribbons, which is a strong sign and shows a lot of bullish momentum, a lot of buying pressure going on.” Historically, when XRP breaks above these ribbons, it often indicates the start of a larger upward move, especially if accompanied by increasing volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He added that the broader market context supports this potential surge. “Historically, October and November tend to be very bullish for crypto and for XRP,” he explained. “I think Q4—the next few days and the next few weeks—could be very bullish for XRP . But once again, for absolute confirmation, wait for the daily candle of today to close above three dollars.” Market Context and Outlook As of now, XRP trades just below the critical $3 threshold, consolidating after several attempts to break higher. Analysts widely agree that this level represents a major resistance zone. A confirmed breakout above it could open the door to a sustained rally toward $4–$5, while rejection might lead to renewed consolidation or a temporary pullback. For long-term investors, Steph’s message serves as both encouragement and caution. The current technical setup appears promising, but as he reminded his audience, “There are no guarantees on the way up.” Ultimately, the coming days will determine whether XRP confirms its long-awaited breakout. Traders and holders alike are watching the charts closely—because in crypto, decisive moments often arrive without warning, and being prepared can make all the difference.

The report noted that Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT) holdings have reached approximately $135 billion, with institutional investors, in particular, continuing to accumulate and stake ETH. VanEck noted that this creates a dilution risk for investors outside of staking. The report also touched on Ethereum's upcoming Fusaka upgrade in December. This update is expected to reduce Layer-2 rollup costs by increasing blob capacity and improve network efficiency by allowing nodes to perform block validation using probabilistic sampling. According to VanEck's report, 23 of the 35 major tokens closed the month lower. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 5%, while Ethereum (ETH) fell 5%. The overall decline in market volatility has dampened both price action and blockchain revenue, causing stagnation in the sector. According to the report, blockchain revenues fell by 16% month-over-month: Ethereum revenues: -6% Solana revenues: -11% Tron revenues: -37% VanEck stated that the primary reason for this decline was the decrease in market volatility. In September, volatility fell by -40% for ETH, -26% for BTC, and -16% for SOL. While decentralized spot exchange (DEX) volumes remained at August levels of approximately $365 billion, futures volumes increased by 30%. Much of this increase was driven by the token launch of the Aster platform within the Binance ecosystem and incentivized trading pairs.

Network revenue fell 16% MoM in September Ethereum fees down 6%, Solana down 11%, Tron fees dropped 37% after a governance fee cut. Volatility fell sharply: ETH -40%, SOL -16%, BTC -26% — reducing arbitrage-driven fee demand. Blockchain network revenue fell 16% in September due to lower crypto volatility; read the full analysis, data, and investor takeaways. Learn how fees and fundamentals changed. Asset manager VanEck attributed the broad decline in blockchain network revenue in September to lower volatility in the crypto markets. What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September? Blockchain network revenue declined 16% month-over-month in September primarily because lower crypto volatility reduced traders’ need to pay priority fees, decreasing total fees across major networks. VanEck’s analysis cites reduced arbitrage and fewer high-priority transactions as the main drivers. VanEck reported that overall network revenues across the blockchain ecosystem dropped by 16% month-over-month in September, linked to diminished volatility and lower transaction fee demand. Ethereum network revenue fell by 6% and Solana’s by 11%. The Tron network recorded a 37% reduction in fees, which VanEck attributes to a governance proposal that halved gas fees in August. Most cryptocurrencies experienced reduced volatility in September. Source: VanEck How did volatility changes affect crypto network fees? Reduced volatility curtailed arbitrage and time-sensitive trading that typically pushes users to pay higher fees for faster settlement. Ether (ETH) volatility dropped about 40% in September, SOL volatility fell 16%, and BTC volatility declined 26%, according to VanEck’s figures. Lower volatility means fewer rapid price moves and thus fewer priority transactions, translating directly into lower network revenue and smaller fee pools for validators and miners. Why did Tron lead revenue metrics despite lower fees? Tron remains the top revenue-generating crypto ecosystem, producing roughly $3.6 billion over the last year, according to Token Terminal data cited in market reporting. This leadership stems largely from stablecoin activity — 51% of circulating Tether USDt supply is issued on the Tron network. A comparison of crypto network fees over the last year. Source: Token Terminal By comparison, Ethereum generated about $1 billion in annual revenue despite ETH reaching all-time highs in August and a market capitalization near $539 billion — roughly 16x TRX’s market cap of about $32 billion. Stablecoins continue to expand: the stablecoin market cap crossed $292 billion in October 2025, per RWA.XYZ data, reinforcing Tron’s role in settlement and recurring fee generation. How should investors interpret network revenue and fees? Network revenues and fees are a core metric for assessing blockchain economic activity and protocol health. Monitor fees as a short-term gauge of transaction demand and revenue as a longer-term indicator of platform monetization and product fit. Analysts track fundamentals such as active addresses, transaction value, and fee revenue to evaluate project trajectories and ecosystem resilience. Frequently Asked Questions How large was the month-over-month revenue decline in September? The blockchain ecosystem saw a 16% month-over-month decline in network revenue in September, driven largely by reduced volatility and lower priority-fee transactions. Did any networks buck the trend in September? Tron continued to lead annual revenue generation despite a 37% monthly fee drop, thanks to heavy stablecoin settlement activity and prior fee-structure changes. What role did governance changes play in fee reductions? On Tron, a governance proposal reduced gas fees by over 50% in August, contributing to a 37% drop in network fees in September as reflected in revenue data. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Reduced crypto volatility lowered arbitrage and priority-fee demand, leading to a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why did Tron still lead revenue metrics?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Tron generated the most annual revenue due to heavy stablecoin settlement activity, with 51% of circulating USDT issued on Tron, supporting recurring fee volume."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Blockchain network revenue drops in September as volatility falls"", ""description"": ""VanEck reports a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September driven by reduced crypto volatility and lower transaction fees."", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199b0f3-c6e7-7260-b34f-183b28f6d0b8""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret a drop in blockchain network revenue"", ""description"": ""A brief step-by-step guide for investors to assess causes and implications of falling network fees and revenue."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check volatility metrics"", ""text"": ""Compare ETH, SOL, and BTC volatility changes to see if lower price swings explain fee reductions."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review protocol governance changes"", ""text"": ""Identify recent fee-structure proposals, such as Tron’s gas fee cut, which can materially reduce revenue."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Analyze stablecoin flows"", ""text"": ""Assess stablecoin issuance and settlement trends, as stablecoin volume can sustain fee revenue even in low-volatility markets."" } ]} Key Takeaways Revenue decline: A 16% MoM drop in September shows fees are sensitive to volatility and governance changes.

Conclusion September’s 16% fall in blockchain network revenue reflects lower crypto volatility and targeted protocol changes that cut fees.

What are Defiance Investments’ proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Defiance Investments’ prospectus requests 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs , offering triple daily exposure to crypto firms, token-linked ETFs and select tech names. The filing lists single-stock, ETF and crypto ETP targets and repeatedly warns these funds are suited only for aggressive, short-term traders. How do the proposed 3X leveraged crypto ETFs differ from existing 2X products? Three-times leveraged ETFs aim to deliver approximately 3X the daily return of an underlying asset, versus 2X funds that seek double daily moves. Because leverage compounds daily, 3X funds amplify volatility and path dependency, increasing the chance of significant losses over multi-day holding periods.

Defiance targeted crypto firms and token-linked ETFs to meet rising investor demand for direct and derivative exposure to digital assets. The surge in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows — with Bitcoin-related funds commanding sizable assets according to CoinGlass — encouraged issuers to explore leveraged versions despite higher risk. What specific companies and token ETFs are named in the filing? The prospectus lists funds tied to Coinbase, MicroStrategy (Bitcoin treasury exposure), Robinhood, BitMine Immersion (Ethereum treasury exposure), Circle (USDC issuer), Grayscale mini-trust ETFs tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a Solana ETF from Volatility Shares. The filing proposes both 3X long and 3X inverse share classes for many of these exposures.

Recent filings — including Defiance’s — indicate the SEC is receiving applications for higher-leverage products. Market analysts, such as ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy, note the regulator may permit more volatile products, but approvals will depend on disclosures, structure and investor-protection considerations. How should investors evaluate proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Evaluate leverage objectives, daily rebalancing mechanics, expense ratios, underlying liquidity, and prospectus risk disclosures. Compare historical one-day return replication and understand compounding effects for multi-day holdings. These funds are primarily for experienced, short-term traders. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to evaluate a 3X leveraged ETF"", ""description"": ""Steps to assess whether a 3X leveraged ETF aligns with a trader's objectives and risk tolerance."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Read the prospectus"", ""text"": ""Review leverage goal, daily reset rules, and risk warnings contained in the fund's prospectus."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Analyze volatility and liquidity"", ""text"": ""Check historical intraday and daily volatility of the underlying asset and the ETF's trading volume."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Simulate multi-day scenarios"", ""text"": ""Model multi-day returns to understand compounding effects and potential drawdowns for holding periods beyond one day."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Compare costs"", ""text"": ""Compare expense ratios and transaction costs relative to alternative exposure methods."" } ]} Key Takeaways Defiance filed for 49 3X ETFs : Proposals include crypto firms, token ETFs and tech stocks, with both long and inverse classes. Higher leverage increases risk : 3X daily leverage amplifies volatility and can produce large multi-day divergences from expected returns. Investor due diligence required : Read prospectuses, assess liquidity and model compounding before trading these products. Conclusion The Defiance prospectus signals a push to expand 3X leveraged ETFs across crypto and tech exposures, reflecting issuer interest in meeting aggressive trader demand. 3X leveraged ETFs may arrive if approved, but their complexity and high risk make careful evaluation essential. Monitor regulatory decisions and read fund disclosures before trading. NEW: @Defiance_ETFs has just filed for just shy of 50 3X levered ETFs. Some on single stocks, some on other ETFs, some on crypto ETPs.

Investors are curious whether these quirky coins can trigger a new wave of excitement in the market. Could these underdogs lead to a fresh rally? Explore the potential growth drivers and market sentiment in the full article. Dogecoin on the Rise: Is a Surge Around the Corner? Source: tradingview Dogecoin is currently trading between twenty-two and twenty-six cents. Its recent upward trend has seen a price surge of over 15% this week and nearly 20% for the month. The coin's momentum hints at breaking through the nearest resistance level of about twenty-eight cents. If it continues this path, it might soon challenge the second resistance level of roughly thirty-two cents. This could signal a potential growth of over 25%. With its popularity and community backing, Dogecoin remains a digital currency to watch, as its price movements suggest more potential climbs in the future. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Pepe (PEPE) Price Watch: What to Expect from this Crypto Adventure Source: tradingview Pepe (PEPE) is showing mixed signals. Its current price range swings between a few thousandths of a cent, landing at around $0.000009. Despite it passing a week with almost a 9% rise, the momentum is cautious. It's below the 10-day moving average but slightly above the 100-day average, which points to stable but slow progress. If Pepe breaks the nearest resistance level, it could see a growth of about 15% from its current spot. However, dropping below support could mean a slide of 20%. With its RSI below 50, Pepe’s current potential leans more towards recovery than rapid growth. Conclusion DOGE and PEPE have both shown potential for growth. DOGE remains popular with a strong community backing. PEPE has recently gained attention due to its memes and social media trends. If interest in meme coins continues, both could see price increases. However, market dynamics always play a big role. Keeping an eye on market trends and investor interest is crucial for predicting future movements of these coins. Just as crucial as crafting a narrative that fits the market, the key ability of Outset PR.

The SEC is reviewing 21 such ETF filings amid government shutdown delays. SEC review of 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs underway Funds propose staking exposure to altcoins including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SUI and others. Up to 40% of assets may be allocated to non-U.S. crypto ETPs from issuers like 21Shares and CoinShares. Meta description: staking crypto ETFs under SEC review — 21 REX-Osprey filings offer yield plus price exposure to ADA, AVAX, NEAR; follow regulatory updates on en.coinotag.com. SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs offering yield and price exposure to altcoins like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR amid shutdown delays. SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs as shutdown delays approval and review timelines. New ETFs include staked tokens like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR, offering both yield and price exposure. Up to 40% of ETF assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto ETPs from 21Shares, CoinShares, and Valour. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing multiple staking-based crypto ETF filings while operating with reduced staff during a government shutdown. REX Shares and Osprey Funds have proposed 21 spot ETFs that combine staking rewards with token price exposure, broadening regulated access to altcoins for institutional and retail investors. What are the REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs under SEC review? REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs are proposed funds that would hold and stake selected proof-of-stake tokens, paying staking rewards to the ETF while tracking token price movements. The filings name tokens such as ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI and SUI and outline use of Cayman subsidiaries to meet regulatory and tax requirements. How do these ETFs combine yield and price exposure? The funds are structured to both participate in on-chain staking (generating rewards) and provide market exposure to token price changes. Staking rewards would be retained or distributed according to each fund’s prospectus. Issuers emphasize the ability to deliver staking yield without investors directly managing private keys. Why is the SEC review delayed and what are the regulatory implications? The SEC’s standard review period for ETF filings is approximately 75 days, but reduced staffing from the government shutdown has slowed processing. Past shutdowns, such as in 2018, caused notable approval delays; analysts expect a similar impact now. Any approvals will still need to satisfy custody, custody-provider oversight, and compliance requirements for staking activities. Which tokens and issuers are named in filings? Filings list staked tokens including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI, SUI, TAO and HYPE. The documents reference allocation flexibility allowing up to 40% of fund assets to be invested in non-U.S. exchange-traded products from issuers named in plain text: 21Shares, CoinShares and Valour. Issuers plan Cayman Islands feeder structures to preserve regulated investment company status under U.S. tax rules. How might investor exposure differ compared to existing spot ETFs? Staking crypto ETFs differ from spot ETFs by adding a yield component from protocol-level staking. Investors gain passive yield (subject to slashing and validator performance) in addition to price appreciation or depreciation. The funds aim to reduce operational friction for institutional investors while preserving tradability on U.S. exchanges. Summary comparison of proposed ETFs (example allocation) ETF Primary Token Staking Enabled Potential Non‑U.S. Allocation Target Investor REX-Osprey ADA Staked ETF ADA Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey AVAX Staked ETF AVAX Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey NEAR Staked ETF NEAR Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional When could decisions resume and what should investors watch? Approvals are likely to resume once full SEC operations return; October 2025 is noted as a key month for several pending crypto ETF deadlines. Investors should monitor SEC notices, prospectus amendments, and custody disclosures for staking mechanics, fee schedules, and counterparty arrangements. Frequently Asked Questions Will staking ETFs increase investor access to altcoins? Yes. Staking ETFs aim to broaden access by allowing investors to gain price and yield exposure through regulated vehicles, avoiding direct custody and staking complexities. Product terms will determine yield distribution and fee impact. Can fund assets be invested in non-U.S. ETPs? Yes. Filings state up to 40% of a fund’s assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto exchange-traded products from issuers referenced in the filings. This may diversify access to European and Canadian markets within a U.S.-listed wrapper. Are staking rewards guaranteed? No. Staking rewards depend on network conditions, validator performance and protocol rules. Rewards can fluctuate and may be subject to penalties such as slashing for misbehavior or downtime. Key Takeaways Regulatory review active : The SEC is reviewing 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETF filings; approval timelines are delayed by a government shutdown. Yield + market exposure : Proposed ETFs combine staking rewards with token price exposure for altcoins like ADA, AVAX and NEAR. Cross-border allocation : Up to 40% non-U.S. ETP allocation may link funds to international issuers while using Cayman subsidiaries for tax and regulatory alignment. Conclusion The SEC’s review of staking crypto ETFs from REX and Osprey could expand regulated yield-bearing access to major altcoins, but approval timing remains uncertain due to the government shutdown.

Keep Eye On These 3 Coins,https://bitzo.com/2025/10/fear-greed-increase-is-crypto-preparing-for-the-next-explosive-rally-keep-eye-on-these-3-coins,"The mood in the crypto market is shifting as excitement and caution begin to blend. Amid this atmosphere, three cryptocurrencies appear ready for significant movement. Experts are analyzing patterns and signals that hint at a possible surge. This article delves into which coins show promise and why they might be on the brink of explosive growth. TRON (TRX) Eyes Growth Amid Steady Price Range Source: tradingview TRON is trading between thirty-three to thirty-four cents. It's facing resistance at thirty-five cents, while support stands at thirty-two cents. With a six-month increase of almost fifty percent, the coin shows strong growth potential. If TRX breaks through the thirty-five cents resistance, it could target thirty-six cents, suggesting a rise of about three percent. The Relative Strength Index indicates the coin is far from overbought, and its momentum is growing. This stability around the thirty-four cents moving averages suggests TRON might continue its gradual climb. Keep an eye on market shifts, as the coin's current positioning hints at further upward movement. Hedera (HBAR) Shows Promise Even Amid Market Fluctuations Source: tradingview Hedera , a rising player in the crypto market, currently trades between twenty and twenty-three cents. It hovers just below the twenty-five-cent resistance, suggesting room for upward movement. If the price breaks this, it could target over twenty-eight cents, almost a twenty percent rise from its upper range. Over the past six months, Hedera has climbed nearly fifty-eight percent, showing strong growth potential. Despite slight dips recently, it continues to maintain a steady course with key support holding at just under nineteen cents. With positive signs, including a six-month surge, Hedera's future looks promising for those watching closely. Arbitrum (ARB) Eyes Potential Bounce After Recent Lows Source: tradingview Arbitrum's current price stays within x cents to a few cents below half a dollar. Though it saw a big drop over the month, it still holds a considerable rise over six months. The coin is near its support, which might hint at a bounce. Its nearest challenge lies above the half-dollar mark, needing a climb of around a fifth more to get there. If enthusiasm grows, it could shoot to a price that is a bit more than five dimes. While past patterns show mixed signals, the coin's price holds room for recovery. If it gains ground, investors might see significant jumps in the coin's value. Conclusion TRX, HBAR, and ARB show strong potential in the current market. TRX focuses on fast transactions and low fees, which attracts many users. HBAR offers high efficiency and unique technology, making it appealing to developers. ARB is gaining interest due to its innovative features in governance. These coins may see significant growth if the market remains favorable. Keeping an eye on them could be worthwhile for those interested in the crypto space.

Technical structure shows higher highs and higher lows after two channel breakouts, supported by increased trading volumes that confirm active buying. How did analysts interpret the technical setup? Chart analysts, including Captain Faibik, identify a descending channel breakout from late 2022–April 2023 and a confirming breakout in October 2023 that formed a bullish flag continuation pattern. The pattern’s measured move places a near-term target near $140,000, assuming volume supports the advance. $BTC #Bitcoin Bulls are in Complete Control.. pic.twitter.com/QEWWLwItN8 — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) October 4, 2025 The pattern demonstrates strong technical strength, showing that selling pressure was absorbed within the consolidation phase. Historical data confirms that after each breakout, Bitcoin maintained upward momentum, indicating sustained buying strength. Trading volumes during breakout phases provide factual confirmation of active market participation from both institutional and retail investors. Source: MichaelvandePoppe (X) Market expert Michael van de Poppe noted that “Bitcoin has held the 20-week moving average as support, broken the downtrend at $112,000, and is on track for the highest weekly close in history.” He added that recent price action included “a 7% weekly candle,” confirming renewed bullish control. Why does institutional demand and seasonality matter for Bitcoin’s outlook? Institutional inflows and historical seasonality amplify bullish momentum and help sustain higher price levels. Citigroup’s published forecast and other institutional commentary point to substantial upside scenarios, while seasonality data shows October historically favors Bitcoin performance. According to Citigroup’s forecast (plain text citation), Bitcoin’s base case target sits near $181,000 with a bullish scenario up to $231,000 over a 12-month horizon. Institutional adoption, growing trading desks, and derivatives activity are cited as primary drivers in institutional research notes (plain text reference). Data compiled by The Bull Theory on X shows Bitcoin closed October in the green in 10 of the last 12 years, with an average October return of 20.62%. Those historical tendencies, paired with improving macro conditions, support a scenario where Bitcoin could extend toward $150,000 in the coming quarter if institutional flows continue. How are domestic retail premiums and macro policy influencing flows? Analysts note domestic demand disparities—U.S. investors have paid premiums on certain exchanges—indicating stubborn retail participation. As the Federal Reserve signals a more cautious stance, macro liquidity conditions could remain supportive for risk assets, allowing institutional allocations to increase. Frequently Asked Questions What is the immediate technical target for Bitcoin after the bullish flag breakout? BTC’s technical setup points to an initial upside target near $140,000 based on the measured move of the bullish flag, supported by rising volume and sustained buying pressure. How likely is a sustained rally to $150K or higher? With institutional demand rising, favorable October seasonality, and easing macro conditions, a rally to $150,000 is plausible within a quarter. Broader analyst scenarios range higher but depend on continued inflows and macro stability. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the immediate technical target for Bitcoin after the bullish flag breakout?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""BTC’s technical setup points to an initial upside target near $140,000 based on the measured move of the bullish flag, supported by rising volume and sustained buying pressure."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How likely is a sustained rally to $150,000 or higher?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""With institutional demand, positive October seasonality, and easing macro risks, a rally to $150,000 is plausible within a quarter, while longer-term analyst scenarios range higher and depend on continued inflows."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Breakout Confirms Bullish Flag, Targets $140K"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin bullish flag breakout signals upside to $140K; rising volume and institutional demand boost momentum."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/article-image-44.png"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T00:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T00:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo.png"" }, ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-bullish-flag-140k"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin's bullish flag breakout"", ""description"": ""A short, actionable guide to reading Bitcoin's bullish flag and assessing price targets."", ""totalTime"": ""PT10M"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Identify the breakout"", ""text"": ""Confirm a clear price break above the flag's upper trendline with increasing volume."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Measure the target"", ""text"": ""Measure the flagpole height from prior swing low to the start of consolidation and add it to the breakout point to derive a target near $140K."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm with volume and moving averages"", ""text"": ""Ensure rising trading volume supports the breakout and that key moving averages, such as the 20-week, act as support."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor macro and institutional flows"", ""text"": ""Track institutional desk activity and macro policy shifts that could either reinforce or undermine the breakout."" } ], ""supply"": [], ""tool"": []} Key Takeaways Bullish Flag Breakout : Bitcoin’s technical breakout targets near $140,000 based on pattern measured move.

The rise of these meme coins is stirring excitement and speculation in the market. As traders scramble to catch the next big thing, the question remains: which meme coin will dominate in 2025? Dogecoin Drifts Amid Market Uncertainty, Potential for a 25% Rise in View Source: tradingview Dogecoin's recent price movements show it trading between 21 and 26 cents. With a rise of over 66% in the past six months, DOGE holds potential for future gains. Eyes are on the resistance levels at 28 and 32 cents. If DOGE breaks these barriers, it could see a rise of around 25% from its current price. The support levels stand at 19 and 15 cents, serving as safety nets. Despite a weaker short-term momentum reflected by the RSI and other metrics, the semi-optimistic price change over recent months hints that DOGE could regain strength if market conditions improve. Pepe (PEPE) Shows Steady Growth with Potential for Breakout Source: tradingview Pepe's price now sits snugly between nine and ten-thousandths of a cent. The coin's journey over the past six months shows a remarkable growth of more than 50%. Recently, it rose by a little over 5% in just a week, hinting at bullish momentum. If trading gathers steam, it might rise to just above one cent, a jump of about 25% from where it stands now. The current movement suggests it can test the first hurdle set slightly higher, around the twelve-thousandths mark. Support sits a bit lower, below eight-thousandths of a cent. With its strength yet mild, attention focuses on when it might decisively break upward. Bonk Sees Steady Gains, Eyes Higher Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Bonk (BONK) is experiencing a steady price movement, trading between $0.00001789 and $0.00002185. The coin has the potential to rise toward its first resistance level at $0.00002413. If it gains momentum, it could aim for the second resistance level at $0.00002809. Bonk's price has increased by over 3% in the last week, showing potential for further growth. Over six months, it has seen an impressive increase of over 100%. With stable support levels and promising resistance targets, Bonk may continue to demonstrate growth, capturing the attention of investors looking for emerging cryptocurrencies with upward momentum. Conclusion DOGE has been underperforming recently, while PEPE and BONK have shown impressive gains. The question remains which coin will come out on top by 2025. DOGE has a strong community and established presence. PEPE and BONK, with their recent performance, could attract more interest. The deciding factor will likely be the ability to maintain momentum and continue to engage users. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The stablecoin, called A7A5, is pegged to the ruble and has been used heavily by Russian users since its launch in January. Despite being part of a sanctioned network, A7A5 was visible at the TOKEN2049 event with a booth, staff wearing its logo, and a speaking slot for one of its executives. TOKEN2049 is a top-tier global crypto event held annually and registered in Hong Kong. This year, it drew more than 25,000 attendees, over 500 exhibitors, and a lineup of high-profile speakers, including Donald Trump Jr., chairman of U.S. brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald Brandon Lutnick, and senior executives from major crypto companies. The appearance of A7A5 at such a high-profile event came even after it was sanctioned by both Washington and London in August. A7A5 sponsors TOKEN2049 despite U.S. and U.K. sanctions The U.S. and Britain said in August that they had sanctioned several companies linked to A7A5, which they described as part of a network designed to help Russians evade Western sanctions. The stablecoin was created in Kyrgyzstan by a Russian defense lender and a payments firm. On the official TOKEN2049 website, A7A5 had been listed as one of more than 20 platinum sponsors. Event staff were seen wearing A7A5-branded shirts, and its director for regulatory and overseas affairs, Oleg Ogienko, appeared on stage to speak about the project. By 1300 GMT on Thursday, references to A7A5 had been removed from the conference’s website and Ogienko was no longer listed as a speaker after Reuters contacted the event for comment. TOKEN2049’s organizers did not respond to multiple requests for comment about why A7A5 had been included. When approached at the conference, Ogienko confirmed that the operation in Singapore was part of the sanctioned group. “We were sanctioned several times,” he told Reuters on Thursday from the sidelines of the event. He added that A7A5 had no ties to money laundering and complied with Kyrgyz regulations. “We just regularly applied for our participation, and the organisers confirmed the participation (at TOKEN2049),” he said. Trading volumes surge as sanctions struggle to stop flows A7A5’s presence at TOKEN2049 underscores how difficult it has been for Western governments to restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in sanctions evasion. Neither Singapore nor Hong Kong has imposed sanctions on the companies connected to A7A5. Three lawyers who specialize in sanctions told Reuters that the U.S. has no jurisdiction in cases where no U.S. persons are involved. Western sanctions following Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, especially the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT global payment system, have forced Moscow to search for alternative payment channels. A7A5 has quickly become one of them. According to blockchain research firm Elliptic, more than $70.8 billion of A7A5 has been transferred since its January launch, up from $40 billion recorded in July. Elliptic also said the daily number of A7A5 transactions had doubled over the past month. Reuters was unable to independently verify the source of the funds or the purpose of the transfers. Ogienko, who is based in Russia, told Reuters that A7A5 is mainly used for cross-border payments by Russian companies and their trading partners. He said its target markets are Asia, Africa, and Latin America. “There are many countries who trade with Russia, and some of them, many of them, use our stablecoin… and these are billions of dollars,” he said. The Singapore event’s scale made the visibility of A7A5 even more striking. TOKEN2049 remains one of the largest industry gatherings, featuring not just high-profile U.S. figures like Donald Trump Jr. but also senior leaders from top crypto companies worldwide.

The enthusiasm for AI was reignited this week following global partnerships involving Nvidia Corp., pushing the MSCI All-Country World Index to an all-time high. Twelve companies, including Accelleron Industries AG, Arcadis NV, Legrand SA, National Grid Plc, Nokia Oyj, Orange SA, OVH Groupe SA, Prysmian SpA, Siemens Energy AG, and Veolia Environnement SA, have surpassed traditional tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple in percentage gains this year. AI infrastructure trades boom in Europe A custom basket of ten European data center operators , grid providers, and infrastructure companies has surged 23% this year, outpacing both the 12% gain in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index and the Nasdaq 100. The Stoxx 600 Technology Index has gained only 6.7% this year. However, the 23% surge is still significantly lower than the 69% jump in U.S. power stocks. The basket includes major players such as Accelleron Industries AG, Arcadis NV, Legrand SA, National Grid Plc, Nokia Oyj, Orange SA, OVH Groupe SA, Prysmian SpA, Siemens Energy AG, and Veolia Environnement SA. “It’s not as sexy to talk about infrastructure as it is to talk about some of the big U.S. tech names,” Helen Jewell, the Chief Investment Officer for EMEA fundamental equities at BlackRock, said . “But we are literally just at the beginning of it. Power infrastructure, grid stability, energy efficiency—that is the AI story in Europe, less on the software side.” Investors light up stocks powering AI As artificial intelligence models grow more complex, they demand vast energy resources , which is advantageous for power and infrastructure companies. Siemens Energy AG, for instance, has seen its shares soar 111% this year, making it a top pick in Ninety One’s European equity fund, which manages $192B in assets. “It is absolutely mission critical in getting power from the grid to data centers,” Ben Lambert, the fund manager at Ninety One, said. Despite the gains, Siemens Energy still trades at a 60% discount to its U.S. peer GE Vernova Inc., based on price-to-earnings ratios. The energy firm’s prospects were boosted in January when President Donald Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank Group, OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. to fund billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Siemens, GE Vernova, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries together account for over 70% of global gas turbine production capacity. The Italian cable manufacturer Prysmian SpA has also benefited from AI-driven infrastructure demand. Its stock has surged 41% in 2025, trading at 20 times forward earnings, which is a significant discount to chip-equipment leader ASML Holding NV, which trades at 35 times. Prysmian’s cables are key for transmitting electricity and data across growing AI networks. Legrand SA, a French producer of electrical and digital infrastructure, has seen its shares climb 52% this year after raising full-year sales guidance in July. About 20% of its revenues now come from data centers. “We’re seeing European industrials really benefit from the surge in data center growth driven by AI,” Alexandra Sentuc, the European equity portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, said. Telecom firms like Orange SA, France’s largest telecom operator, manages over 70 data centers, and plans to expand its AI-ready capacity. Similarly, Nokia Oyj is a critical part of Europe’s AI infrastructure due to its network switch technology used in data centers. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that Nokia’s 2026 revenue could rise by €300M if hyperscaler-linked sales continue to grow. “It’s still a tangible play from the geopolitical standpoint,” Xiadong Bao, the co-manager of the Edmond de Rothschild Fund Big Data, said. He noted that European governments prefer local suppliers over U.S. or Chinese switch makers. Despite the optimism, challenges like thin liquidity and limited passive investment exposure to infrastructure-focused AI themes raise concerns for investors. There’s also regulatory scrutiny around AI and energy use that could also temper growth. However, both public and private investments are accelerating. Nvidia is expanding its European footprint with new technology centers in the U.K., France, Spain, and Sweden. “The AI world is a bit like the Cold War, where everybody wants to get to the moon,” Bao said. “But for us, especially European investors, it’s better to look at the AI race as a marathon—monetization will increase progressively.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Business|Nasdaq,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-04 21:55:51

Despite market cycles, their capacity to surprise investors with sudden rallies has ensured that they maintain positions in the investors’ portfolios. Among them, Dogecoin remains a subject of interest for its suggested climb near the symbolic $1 milestone. However, Dogecoin is not the only coin that is being watched over by analysts. Predictions of explosive growth surround a newly established presale project, MAGACOIN FINANCE. Some analysts argue it might repeat Dogecoin’s early stages and provide a 75x breakout in 2025 . This tie between the two tokens has led to increasing interest from retail and institutional investors alike. Dogecoin Builds Toward $1 Target Dogecoin is currently trading within an ascending megaphone pattern. Historically, this feature has produced big breakouts in the price. Analysts note the growing formation has a target of $1. The rising megaphone has higher lows gradually increasing and higher highs spreading, indicating increasing momentum. In the case of Dogecoin, the pattern has been developing since mid-2023 and is still holding in 2025. This pattern sets up a structure for potential rallies as long as the buyers maintain control. Historical Rallies Confirm Uptrend This outlook is also supported by historical evidence. Since 2023, Dogecoin has been following a consistent pattern of accumulation, breakout, and consolidation. For instance, the meme coin consolidated around $0.06 in late 2023, then rose to above $0.15 in early 2024. After each upward move, DOGE retreated into consolidation zones before repeating the cycle. Analysts believe this action gives weight to the overall bullish framework that might ultimately drive DOGE to $1. Tight Consolidations Before Steep Rallies One analyst, Trader Tardigrade, points out other shorter-term cycles that put Dogecoin’s strength in perspective. His chart displayed repetitive tight consolidations followed by strong rallies. The same compression and expansion cycle was seen in July and September 2025. Source: X Most recently, Dogecoin consolidated between $0.22 and $0.23, then broke higher to $0.25. If the same pattern is to continue, there is another spike above $0.34. This is similar to the megaphone structure, which gives both short and mid-term confirmation. Higher Highs and Higher Lows Strengthen Trend Furthermore, Dogecoin’s historical price performance establishes the upward trend. The coin had hit a low of $0.055 in October 2023 before jumping back above $0.42 in March 2024. Another high exceeded $0.38 in April 2025. Even amid corrections, DOGE held near major support at $0.16 in September 2024 and August 2025 near $0.19. The higher lows and highs confirm the long-term bullish channel. The Relative Strength Index is close to 55, which corresponds to a balanced momentum. Analysts point out that as long as demand remains, there is room for the indicator to continue upward pressure. MAGACOIN FINANCE Analysts Call It the Next 75x Breakout Play While Dogecoin continues to capture headlines with its push toward $1, analysts are also turning their attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE. A number of market watchers describe it as the next breakout token, forecasting a potential 75x return within a year . According to analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trajectory mirrors the early days of Dogecoin. When DOGE first entered the market, it was dismissed as a meme before proving its staying power through repeated rallies. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now showing similar signs, with strong community backing driving momentum. One recurring point among analysts is the striking resemblance between MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early growth curve and Dogecoin’s initial breakout cycles. Both projects began with grassroots community energy and active participation in social channels. That combination has historically fueled explosive rallies, and MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be repeating the formula. Analysts argue this timing could amplify returns, setting up MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most closely watched breakout plays in 2025 . Conclusion Dogecoin’s climb toward $1 underscores its resilience as a leading meme coin. With clear bullish patterns, strong support levels, and repeated breakout cycles, the coin continues to attract both retail traders and institutional interest. Analysts believe that if current momentum holds, DOGE could eventually achieve the symbolic $1 milestone. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be the breakout play of 2025 as analysts see echoes of Dogecoin’s early rallies. For investors seeking a balance between established momentum and high-growth potential, Dogecoin and MAGACOIN FINANCE represent two of the most compelling opportunities in the current market.

But what is surprising most analysts is that these same whales are not putting all of their capital into Bitcoin, they are investing in high-upside altcoins, and one of the best picks is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . At just $0.035 and already over 55% sold out in Stage 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance is attracting whale-sized attention due to its two-layer lending infrastructure built to generate sustainable returns. With more than 16,750 investors and $16.8 million+ raised, many institutional investors now are diversifying into Mutuum Finance as a high-conviction hedge alongside Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s Strategic Position Enlarges as U.S. Legislators Call for a National Reserve Bitcoin’s role in the global financial system could surge to the level of billions with U.S. legislators calling for its inclusion in the country’s strategic reserves. Rep. Nick Begich and Sen. Cynthia Lummis have introduced the BITCOIN Act, a landmark bill that would purchase one million BTC in five years via budget-neutral mechanisms. The bill follows the lead of an executive order signed by former President Donald Trump, blocking the government from selling off seized crypto assets and instead keeping them as a permanent “digital stockpile.” Begich argues that diversifying the gold-dominant national balance sheet with Bitcoin would make America economically safer and more competitive in the digital economy. With institutional belief in Bitcoin becoming more firm, the large traders are diversifying too, and it is here that young altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are increasingly finding themselves on their radar screens as second-tier high-upside wagers. MUTM Presale Momentum Picks Up Pace MUTM tokens are currently going for $0.035 in Presale Round 6, an increase of 16.17% over the previous round. Demand from investors remains very high with over 16,750 investors already pouring in over $16.8 million to date. While attempting to make the platform safer, Mutuum Finance has launched recently a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat developers and hackers are invited to report bugs. Four severity levels of bugs, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, have been used so that bugs could be detected and corrected early on. The protocol is supported by strong collateral management that makes the network and participants secure. Unlimited collateral ratio, lending ability, and deposit ability are among the security attributes that make it safe. Remedy of real-time undercollateral positions and fees and penalties stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Efficiency is at the core of the Mutuum Finance model. By maximizing Loan-to-Value (LTV) rates and taking overcollateralized positions, the protocol interacts with all available capital with aggressive guards. Reserve requirements provide to serve as a cushion against market volatility with overlying reserves to borrow against in riskier assets to hedge against volatility. Mutuum Finance Announces Upcoming Lending & Borrowing Protocol Launch Mutuum Finance has unveiled the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , reiterating its commitment to providing wider decentralized finance solutions. The release V1 will be available in the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will feature vital elements such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be the initial assets for borrowing, lending, and collateral and the backbone of a dynamic and strong DeFi platform. Mutuum Finance is reshaping decentralized finance on three fundamental axes: long-term viability, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable borrowing and lending platform is introducing DeFi to institutions and retail investors. Whereas lawmakers are calling for a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, whales are diversifying their bets away from BTC, and the top pick among them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). As $0.035 and over 55% sold with $16.8M raised, MUTM’s twin lending architecture, solid security, and imminent DeFi protocol launch make it a high-leverage hedge and one of the strongest altcoins in 2025.

52677237,https://nulltx.com/?p=152262,1759615980,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"BNB Chain Tops Active Addresses in September, Surpassing Solana and NEAR",https://nulltx.com/bnb-chain-tops-active-addresses-in-september-surpassing-solana-and-near/,"BNB Chain has emerged as the leading blockchain by active addresses in September. Data shows the chain recorded 52.5 million monthly active addresses, surpassing both NEAR Protocol’s 51.8M and Solana’s 45.8M. It marks the first time since August 2024 that Solana has been dethroned in this metric. The shift signals a major momentum swing in the battle for user activity across top Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. BNB Chain is the top chain by active addresses in September With 52.5M, @BNBCHAIN surpassed @NEARProtocol (51.8M) and @solana (45.8M). It’s the 1st time since Aug 2024 that Solana was dethroned by this metric. BNB Chain's spike in activity is fueled by the hype around Aster. pic.twitter.com/LZ7bv99Ofg — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) October 3, 2025 Aster Hype Fuels BNB Chain’s Surge The sudden spike in BNB Chain activity ties closely to the buzz surrounding Aster, a new project driving engagement across the ecosystem. On-chain data points to users flocking toward Aster-related activity, pushing BNB Chain into the spotlight. BNB Chain’s core Layer 1 logged a 22% month-on-month increase in active addresses. But that’s only part of the story. The chain’s Layer 2 solution, opBNB, built on Optimism’s tech stack, exploded with a 66.4% surge in active addresses. That dual growth has set BNB Chain apart from competitors. The surge isn’t just a one-off blip,it shows increasing demand from users who are actively transacting, not just holding tokens. I knew there was some activity on the Binance Chain, but I wasn’t expecting this level of traction. This map shows the evolution of active addresses over one month, essentially for September, and the numbers speak for themselves. The BNB Chain Layer 1 recorded a 22%… pic.twitter.com/FCcB3BIlEy — Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) October 3, 2025 Solana Slips After Holding the Crown For over a year, Solana maintained dominance as the chain with the highest active addresses, consistently outpacing rivals. Its low-cost transactions and thriving memecoin culture gave it strong grassroots traction. But the September data shows a clear shift. At 45.8M active addresses, Solana now trails behind both BNB Chain and NEAR. While still one of the most active ecosystems, its lead has narrowed. This dethroning in September is a reminder that even the most dominant networks can lose momentum when rivals capitalize on new trends. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL trades at $228.45, down 1.2% on the day but still up 10.4% in the past month, reflecting solid investor confidence despite activity shifts. NEAR Holds Strong at Second Right behind BNB Chain, NEAR Protocol posted 51.8M active addresses in September. That keeps it competitive, with only a narrow gap separating it from the top. NEAR’s ecosystem continues to benefit from its push into Web3 gaming and user-friendly dApps. Unlike Solana, NEAR hasn’t had to rely on memecoins to maintain its user activity. Instead, it’s building steady growth through core ecosystem plays. On CoinMarketCap, NEAR is priced at $2.94, up 8.6% over the past week, suggesting both retail and institutional traders are paying close attention to its progress. Ethereum and Base Trail Behind While BNB Chain, NEAR, and Solana battle for the top three spots, other ecosystems lag behind in activity. Ethereum, despite being the leading Layer 1 by total value locked and DeFi dominance, continues to lose ground in active address metrics due to higher gas fees. Similarly, Base, Coinbase’s Layer 2 network, is gaining traction but hasn’t yet matched the scale of BNB Chain or NEAR. The latest numbers put it well behind the leaders, even though it benefits from one of the largest centralized exchange ecosystems in the world. ETH currently trades at $4500, slightly up 0.8% in 24 hours, while BASE’s native activity token metrics remain outside the top traded assets on CoinMarketCap. The Significance of opBNB’s Growth What stands out most in September is the growth of opBNB. Built on Optimism’s OP Stack, the Layer 2 solution was designed to make transactions on BNB Chain cheaper and faster. With a 66.4% increase in active addresses, it’s clear users are adopting it at a rapid pace. This move mirrors the broader trend across the industry,where Layer 2 solutions are increasingly becoming the real battleground for user engagement. Just as Arbitrum and Optimism compete for Ethereum’s Layer 2 crown, opBNB is helping Binance’s ecosystem strengthen its footprint. BNB, the native token, trades at $1147.20, up 17.8% this week. The token’s price movement reflects renewed interest from traders betting that higher user activity will translate to long-term value capture. What This Means for the Market The fact that BNB Chain overtook Solana and NEAR in active addresses suggests a dynamic shift in user interest. Instead of one chain holding a dominant lead, we’re seeing a back-and-forth battle where hype cycles, new dApps, and Layer 2 innovation play major roles. For now, BNB Chain’s rise is powered by Aster and the rapid adoption of opBNB. But history shows that activity can shift just as fast,whether to Solana with memecoins, NEAR with gaming, or Ethereum with DeFi. What’s clear is that the market no longer belongs to one single chain. Users are moving between ecosystems depending on cost, speed, and opportunity. That keeps competition fierce and innovation constant. BNB Chain’s climb to the top in September is more than a vanity metric. With 52.5M active addresses, it proves users are actively engaging, not just passively holding tokens. The Layer 1’s 22% growth combined with opBNB’s 66.4% surge show Binance’s ecosystem is attracting real traction. Whether this momentum sustains or fades will depend on how long projects like Aster can capture attention and how effectively the ecosystem continues to expand. For now, BNB Chain leads the pack. But as Solana, NEAR, Ethereum, and Base fight back, the race for active users is far from over. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This week, the non-profit sold 1,000 ETH through decentralized exchange CoWSwap, using a TWAP (time-weighted average price) strategy. The swap brought in $4.5 million USDC, marking the Foundation’s largest on-chain move in recent months. The sale is not random. Funds are officially allocated to research, grants, and donations,the backbone of Ethereum’s long-term ecosystem growth. But every time the Foundation moves ETH, traders take notice. This latest sale comes at a critical point for the market. Why Traders Care About Foundation Moves Ethereum’s price sits around $4,500 today, according to CoinMarketCap, up nearly 10% this past week. On-chain activity is also surging, fueled by new DeFi flows, NFT transactions, and institutional inflows. Against this backdrop, the Foundation’s $4.5M conversion to stablecoins raised eyebrows. Historically, when the Foundation sells ETH, the market interprets it as a signal of caution or profit-taking. Past sales have coincided with short-term dips. Traders know that when one of Ethereum’s biggest holders moves tokens, the ripple effects are real. This is why blockchain watchers and analysts scan Foundation wallets closely. Every move sets off speculation: Are they predicting volatility? Or simply managing their treasury responsibly? The Strategy: Using TWAP via CoWSwap The Foundation didn’t just dump tokens into the market. Instead, they used TWAP, a strategy that spreads out sales over time to reduce slippage and avoid spiking volatility. Executed on CoWSwap, the method ensured that the sale looked more like a risk management play than a market shock. This also signals sophistication. Rather than destabilizing ETH price, the Foundation chose a method that preserves liquidity. For traders, it’s a subtle reminder that Ethereum’s core stewards balance development needs with market sensitivity. Why Now? The Timing Behind the Swap The timing of the move is key. Ethereum has been climbing steadily, riding the wave of institutional interest and broader crypto optimism. Spot Ethereum ETFs are under review in multiple regions. Meanwhile, Layer-2 activity is soaring, with networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base driving traffic and fees. At the same time, volatility is intensifying. Bitcoin dominance is softening, altcoin rotations are in play, and ETH sits at a critical resistance level. In such moments, large treasury moves can be interpreted as profit-taking at the top of a rally. By moving to USDC, the Foundation shows it’s not betting recklessly on price action. Instead, it’s ensuring stable resources for ongoing projects. For developers and researchers, that’s reassurance. For traders, it’s a reason to pause and reassess bullish bets. What the Funds Will Support The Ethereum Foundation clarified that proceeds are earmarked for: Research: advancing Ethereum protocol development, scaling upgrades, and next-gen cryptography. Grants: supporting builders, open-source projects, and infrastructure teams. Donations: contributing to ecosystem-aligned initiatives that extend Ethereum’s reach. This allocation reinforces the Foundation’s role as more than just a holder of ETH. By cycling value back into the ecosystem, it ensures Ethereum stays competitive as rivals like Solana and Avalanche attract attention. Market Signals: Stablecoins as a Treasury Tool The Foundation’s choice of USDC over other assets is also telling. Stablecoins remain the most reliable hedge for organizations managing large treasuries. By parking $4.5M into USDC, the Foundation highlights the role stablecoins play in reducing exposure while preserving liquidity. This isn’t just about managing risk. It’s about signaling discipline to the market. Stablecoins have become the crypto-native equivalent of cash reserves. For traders, seeing Ethereum’s core organization lean on them validates their role in treasury management. How Traders Interpret the Move Blockchain sleuths often joke that when the Ethereum Foundation sells ETH, a dip follows. While correlation doesn’t always mean causation, history shows that these events coincide with increased sell pressure. 1/ Today, The Ethereum Foundation will convert 1000 ETH to stablecoins via @CoWSwap 's TWAP feature, as part of our ongoing work to fund R&D, grants and donations, and to highlight the power of DeFi. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 3, 2025 Already, analysts on X (formerly Twitter) are flagging the move. Ethereum Foundation’s official announcement confirms the sale. Market watchers, including CryptoPost Official, are tracking sentiment shifts. For retail traders, the lesson is simple: Foundation sales often signal caution. For institutions, it’s a sign that even Ethereum’s core players diversify when volatility looms. Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem. With ETH trading near $4,500 and demand for block space rising, the long-term outlook is strong. But Foundation moves like this remind everyone that markets are not one-directional. By selling 1,000 ETH for USDC, the Ethereum Foundation demonstrated strategic treasury management. It ensures that development, grants, and donations continue,regardless of short-term price swings. For traders, the signal is mixed. On one hand, the ecosystem gains funding security. On the other, the move injects caution into bullish momentum. In crypto, perception often drives price. And when Ethereum’s most influential entity makes a treasury adjustment, the market listens. The Ethereum Foundation’s $4.5M ETH-to-USDC swap isn’t just a trade,it’s a message. It’s about sustainability, funding, and risk management. For the community, it reassures that growth is supported. For traders, it sparks speculation about what comes next. As Ethereum pushes through a volatile market, one thing is clear: every Foundation transaction is more than just a number on the blockchain. It’s a signal. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

Bitcoin has broken above the $120,000 price level. XRP, on the other hand, hasn’t found it as easy to establish a firm breakout, although it has pushed as high as $3.10 in the past 24 hours. Technical analysis points to possible short-term price gains if resistance levels holds, but it also outlines a scenario where both Bitcoin and XRP could face another round of declines in the coming week. Related Reading: Space Meets Crypto—Spacecoin Executes 1st Blockchain Transaction Beyond Earth XRP’s Struggle Against The Downtrend Technical analysis of XRP’s daily candlestick timeframe chart, which was posted on the social media platform X by a crypto analyst called Guy on the Earth, shows that XRP’s price action in the past 48 hours is pushing above a downtrend resistance, with the top of its consolidation rectangle at $3.12 now in focus. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency narrowly missed this target during its latest surge, stalling at $3.10 before slipping back to $3. However, XRP has so far managed to retest and find support on the downtrend line, which suggests there is still a chance for continuation higher. However, the analyst noted that the rally could fade quickly, unless XRP can closes the week and hold above the $3.12. A drop back below $3.00 would invalidate the breakout attempt and reopen the possibility of a breakdown to the $2.72 support. The pink circle drawn on the chart below shows the risk of XRP falling back to retest the ascending trendline around $2.40 to $2.50 if $2.72 is broken. XRP Daily Price Chart: @guyontheearth Bitcoin, on the other hand, has been displaying stronger momentum. The breakout above $120,000 has been decisive, and this can be seen as a healthier technical structure compared to XRP. The Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) is also pointing higher, meaning Bitcoin could continue leading the market regardless of whether the next move is up or down. A Big Weekend Ahead For Both Bitcoin And XRP The next few days will be important for both XRP and Bitcoin. The three-day candle closes within hours, and the weekly candle will confirm the broader direction soon after. For XRP, holding above the $3.00 downtrend retest is important to maintain bullish momentum. On the other hand, Bitcoin maintaining strength above $120,000 could confirm its breakout and establish new grounds for further rallies. Failure for Bitcoin to hold above $120,000, would likely usher in another bloody phase next week, with XRP at risk of dropping back toward $2.72 or even lower. The week’s close will determine whether this rally has legs or whether the correction scenario plays out instead.

The move is an evolution in how public blockchain companies raise capital, blending traditional debt instruments with decentralized infrastructure models. Why This Move Redefines Capital Formation For Ethereum DATs In an X post , BitDigital_BTBT revealed that the company has made history as the first publicly traded Ethereum Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) to deploy unsecured leverage through a convertible notes offering, marking a new milestone in blockchain-based corporate finance. The latest move by the financial behemoth will be beneficial to the company shareholders. However, this initiative will enhance capital efficiency for shareholders, without immediate dilution notes due in October 2030. The proceeds will be used to acquire ETH, expand BitDigital’s treasury, and increase institutional staking capacity. This strategic financing deepens BitDigital’s exposure to ETH, while positioning the asset as a programmable treasury instrument capable of generating institution-grade staking yield. By leveraging traditional debt structures within a decentralized framework, BitDigital reinforces its leadership in ETH-native treasury management and staking strategies. The move also signals ETH’s advanced role in institutional finance, bridging the gap between Web3 infrastructure and legacy capital markets. Amid the growing exposure to Ethereum, multiple potential projects are being consistently launched on the leading chain. Kriptoloji, an ambassador at Irys_xyz, points out that their restaking design project’s focus isn’t on flashy incentive yields, but on building genuine utility and layering right on top of ETH’s ecosystem. Kriptoloji noted that most projects in DeFi tend to chase the same hype cycles and loops, but Ekoxofficial is building something different with this move. Instead of creating another yield, it aims to make network participation more seamless, efficient, and sustainable. Meanwhile, the early indicators suggest that a well-received testnet, growing momentum from the Arichain collaboration, and a pipeline of upcoming integrations are starting to establish the foundation for credibility as a long-term infrastructure play rather than a fleeting experiment. “This is not financial advice, but the way they are structuring it’s definitely something worth paying attention to.” Kriptoloji mentioned. Institutional Adoption Strengthens ETH Long-Term Outlook Ethereum is still very much recognized at the institutional level. Goldman Sachs’ latest report reveals a powerful trend unfolding as institutional investors are deepening their involvement with ETH, with over $3.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM) now linked to the ecosystem. This level of exposure highlights the ETH transformation from a speculative blockchain into a critical layer of institutional-grade infrastructure. According to Crypto Patel, Elite KOL CoinMarketCap and Binance, this institutional pivot is one of the strongest bullish signals for ETH’s future.",Ethereum|Assets Under Management|AUM|binance|BitDigital|Coinmarketcap|Crypto Patel|DAT|digital asset treasury|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|goldman sachs|Kriptoloji,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 22:30:47

Source: Annbessa (X) On-chain observers note XRP remains above the one-week 50 EMA at $2.77 after a prolonged consolidation that preceded the 2024 breakout. With Bitcoin trading above $123,000, altcoin rotation has favored XRP’s short-term momentum. Frequently Asked Questions What are the immediate support and resistance levels for XRP? Immediate resistance sits at $3.10; support levels to watch are $3.00 (pivot), $2.90, and $2.80. Maintaining $3.00 is critical for a push toward $3.30–$3.50. How much institutional interest is there in XRP ETFs? Early ETF adoption is measurable: the XRPR ETF holds $77.6 million in assets, suggesting growing institutional allocation to XRP via spot ETF exposure. Key Takeaways Pivot level : $3.00 is decisive for next directional move. ETF tailwinds : XRPR ETF assets ($77.6M) show institutional demand forming.

His latest analysis comes as the asset continues to face resistance below $3.10 despite Bitcoin’s strong rebound. At the time of writing, XRP trades around $2.95 , up roughly 45% since the start of the year but still significantly below its historical peak. In contrast, Bitcoin recently reclaimed $122,000, reinforcing its dominance during the current market recovery. The Historical Role of the Chasm Line According to EGRAG’s multi-year price analysis, the Chasm Line has historically served as a marker for XRP’s cyclical tops. His chart review, based on three-week intervals, shows that XRP has approached or interacted with this trendline in previous market cycles, with each retest signaling a major turning point. #XRP – The Chasm ($10.30) : As of today, the price of touching The Chasm is $10.30 . As time goes on, the price of the Chasm continues to rise. ONLY FEW AND PATIENCE TRULY GETS IT #XRPFamily STAY STEADY and STRONG , Together We Rise and Soon We Shall Fly… pic.twitter.com/rTA4YAkvta — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 3, 2025 For instance, XRP peaked at $1.96 in April 2021 during the 2020-2021 bull run. This price coincided with the Chasm Line, which subsequently acted as resistance. The token struggled to break above that level and later entered a period of correction as overall market momentum slowed. XRP demonstrated similar behavior in the 2017–2018 cycle. In May 2017, the token surged to $0.3988, aligning with the Chasm Line at the time. Although it experienced a short-term pullback, XRP later exceeded the trendline, rising to a record high of $3.31 by January 2018. EGRAG classified this breakout as an exception rather than the norm but noted that it underscored the importance of this technical level as a long-term reference point. What the Chasm Line Means for Today’s Market In the current cycle, the Chasm Line appears much higher, now positioned near $10.3. EGRAG’s analysis suggests that XRP would need to rally to at least this level to retest the trendline. Achieving that target would represent a more than threefold increase from current prices and could mark the lower boundary of a potential cycle top if the pattern continues to hold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While such a move may appear ambitious, EGRAG pointed out that historical cycles indicate that XRP has the potential to extend beyond this line under favourable conditions. In the 2017 cycle, XRP advanced more than 600% above the Chasm Line before its eventual peak. Applying a similar trajectory in the current context could imply prices exceeding $70, although he acknowledged that such levels may not be realistic within this market phase. Market Outlook and Analyst Commentary EGRAG emphasized that investors who maintain long-term positions may be best positioned to benefit from the next significant rally, reiterating the importance of patience. This perspective aligns with comments from financial educator Coach JV, who has consistently advised that meaningful movements in XRP tend to occur rapidly once market catalysts align, leaving little time for late entrants to participate. Other analysts have also weighed in on potential price targets. Market observer Mikybull recently suggested that XRP could be approaching the final upward phase of its current cycle, projecting a conservative target between $6 and $10 , with an extended target of $21 under ideal conditions. The Chasm Line remains a focal point in EGRAG’s technical framework, serving as both a benchmark for XRP’s cyclical performance and a reference for assessing its future potential. If XRP were to approach or surpass this line again, it could signal a new phase of market expansion. However, reaching such levels would depend heavily on sustained momentum across the broader cryptocurrency market and renewed investor demand for XRP.

The discussion highlighted that the two agencies intend to cooperate on crypto regulation, despite having little history of collaboration. Alignment on Crypto Rules Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham acknowledged at Monday’s roundtable that while the SEC and CFTC have had many opportunities to work together for market participants and global capital markets, unclear regulatory boundaries have sometimes caused friction and difficulties for the public. Pham said she was pleased that both regulators are now aligning rules to reduce unnecessary costs, support responsible innovation, and create fair competition. She pointed to the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint as early examples of coordination, suggesting that greater harmonization could lead to increased efficiency, clarity, and expanded investor access to digital assets. Addressing concerns about the CFTC’s effectiveness, Pham reported that from January 20 to September 3, the agency has carried out 18 non-enforcement actions and 13 enforcement actions, with some involving digital asset lawsuits. Since September 4, the Commission has initiated 14 more legal proceedings in just a few weeks. The acting chair said these figures show that the CFTC is active and effective, adding that “there needs to be no more FUD about what’s happening on the other side of town.” The roundtable also featured panels on market structure and innovation, with discussions on topics such as extended trading hours, perpetual contracts, prediction markets, and crypto assets. The participants included executives from major crypto firms such as Kraken, Robinhood, and Crypto.com. On the sidelines of the recent event, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said that crypto is the agency’s “top priority right now.” He also identified asset tokenization as a key area of regulatory focus, cautioning that it may take a year or two to establish proper guardrails, and described its potential as “pretty much endless.” Earlier in the year, the financial watchdog had held discussions on tokenization and crypto regulation, with the aim of harmonizing rules amid increasing crypto adoption. Tensions Rise Over Classification of Tokenized Securities Elsewhere, the crypto X community has reignited debate over how tokenized securities should be classified. The conversation follows tensions at the recent joint panel, where traditional finance representatives resisted innovation exemptions and advocated for strict fungibility requirements under Reg NMS. Crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro argued that tokenized securities should indeed be fungible. In response, former regulatory adviser Justin Slaughter questioned the belief that these instruments are inherently derivatives, suggesting they could represent either the underlying asset itself or an idealized version. Shapiro countered that such ambiguity may reflect poor tokenization practices through SPVs and similar structures, compared with more native approaches like Superstate or MetaLeX.

52680220,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-ada-and-magacoin-finance-emerge-as-a-power-combo-for-smart-investors/,1759622340,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52680220.jpeg,Cardano (ADA) and MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerge as a Power Combo for Smart Investors,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-ada-and-magacoin-finance-emerge-as-a-power-combo-for-smart-investors/,"With the new crypto bull run making waves in the market, two names are attracting the attention of forward-looking investors: Cardano (ADA) and MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining status among investors as one of the promising digital assets for 2025. Together with ADA, they are stable and explosive assets that anyone looking to build a strong portfolio should consider adding. Cardano Builds Long-Term Trust Cardano is trading at near $0.89 and has regained momentum. The project has always focused on research, scientific rigour, and a slow-but-steady approach to blockchain development. Supporters of Cardano make a strong argument in favor of the crypto asset. Unlike competing crypto assets such as Ethereum and Solana that have seemingly caught on faster, Cardano has a decently sized user base to reflect upon the future success of the crypto coin. The ecosystem is growing, and applications for DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and governance are coming along. Future upgrades that will boost scalability and interoperability are in the works, leading commentators to believe ADA could soon be seen by institutions. ADA has had a strong recovery from its lows and now has stabilised just under the important $1 level. According to technical analysts, ADA has the potential to retest levels of $1.20-$1.30 if it manages to secure a firm break above resistance at $1, provided the market continues to remain bullish. Smart Money Eyes ADA Many large holders, often referred to as whales, have been buying more ADA. This shows that they believe Cardano has a future in blockchain. The increasing accumulation trend, along with rising unique wallet addresses, hints that another breakout could be in the cards for ADA. Institutional interest is also a key factor. Cardano is poised to integrate with traditional financial firms thanks to its strong commitment to compliance and sustainability. As global regulations tighten, Cardano’s nature as a supposed slow and steady project might be more of a blessing. MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outpace Solana’s Early Days While ADA provides the foundation of stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating the type of hype reminiscent of Solana’s early explosive growth. Analysts are already noting that MAGACOIN’s momentum is surprising even the most optimistic forecasts, with early-stage investors anticipating massive upside potential. If current growth continues, MAGACOIN FINANCE could eclipse the early returns that Solana delivered when it rose from under $1 to triple-digit prices in just a few years. The project has gained traction by tapping into retail enthusiasm and institutional curiosity at the same time. Its limited supply, strong presale performance, and ambitious roadmap have set it apart in a crowded market. By positioning itself as both accessible to smaller investors and appealing to larger funds, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out a unique position in the 2025 bull market. As capital flows increasingly rotate into early-stage projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most attractive bets for those who don’t want to miss the next generational altcoin success story. ADA’s Role in Investor Portfolios Many investors are now looking at ADA as a necessary token for long-term blockchain exposure. ADA’s proven track record, growing developer community, and strong institutional prospects make it a great way to balance riskier assets in a portfolio. The ability of the token to survive through previous bear markets has certainly contributed to its reputation as one of the safer long-term plays on crypto. ADA has a great case to eventually be considered as a core digital asset along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, due to its sustainability narrative plus iterations. Conclusion The ongoing bull run is creating opportunities for established tokens and new tokens to shine. Cardano (ADA) offers reliability, as a well-known crypto with strong fundamentals, while MAGACOIN FINANCE has breakout potential to do a Solana, or better. This is an opportunity that you don’t want to miss. Together, they form a powerful combination for investors: ADA as the solid foundation, and MAGACOIN FINANCE as the high-upside play. In 2025, the smartest portfolios may very well be those that include both.

52679628,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85380,1759622453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Predicts Timeline for $100 XRP,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-timeline-for-100-xrp/,"Crypto market analyst 24hrscrypto1 has shared a bullish outlook for XRP, stating that the digital asset could reach the $100 milestone sooner than 2030. Although he initially projected a five-year window for the target, he now believes the price surge may happen even earlier, citing growing confidence in XRP’s long-term fundamentals and utility within the financial sector. At the time of his remarks, XRP was trading around $3.02, but it has declined to $2.94, meaning it would need to appreciate by more than 3,301% to reach $100. Despite the steep climb, 24hrscrypto1’s position reflects an increasing sentiment among XRP supporters who believe that broader adoption and sustained market recovery could drive such exponential growth. Increasing Optimism Among Analysts Several analysts have suggested that XRP could eventually reach $100, indicating that this target is not just a singular prediction. Several figures in the crypto community have shared similar expectations over the past year, reinforcing growing confidence in the asset’s long-term trajectory. My firm belief is that XRP will reach $100 by 2030… But honestly, I think I’m wrong. It’s going to happen sooner than that. — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) October 3, 2025 Earlier in 2025, Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer at CryptoCharged, described an XRP valuation between $100 and $1,000 as highly attainable within the next decade. He attributed this prediction to XRP’s expanding role in cross-border payments and global remittance solutions, areas where the token has established a strong presence through Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions. Similarly, Linda Jones, a well-known crypto wealth strategist, reiterated her belief that XRP could eventually trade at $100. While she did not specify a timeline, Jones emphasized the importance of holding the asset long-term, noting the dramatic difference between XRP’s early prices and today’s valuation. She illustrated this by comparing her early $100 purchase, which once bought 400 XRP, to the same amount now buying fewer than 35 XRP, emphasizing the coin’s gradual increase in value over time. Her view was supported by community figures like Rob Cunningham, host of KUWL.show, who advised investors to stay patient, and Mr. Hillard, another early adopter, who shared that his early accumulation of XRP has yielded consistent satisfaction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Contrasting Forecasts for XRP by 2030 Although optimism is high, projections for XRP’s price in 2030 vary widely across analysts. Among the most ambitious assessments is a Valhil Capital study , which applied its “Athey & Mitchnick Model” to estimate XRP’s potential fair value at $4,813 by 2030. The model considers factors such as global adoption, liquidity, and transactional velocity. In contrast, more conservative estimates from Changelly and Telegaon place XRP between $21 and $48 by 2030, while Bitwise suggests a possible upper limit of $30. Despite differing figures, most projections share a common theme: strong expectations of significant long-term appreciation compared to XRP’s current market price. Assessing the Market Cap Challenge For XRP to hit $100, its market cap would need to exceed $5.9 trillion, representing a 32x increase from its current valuation of around $181 billion. This level of growth would position XRP among the largest global financial assets, raising questions about the practicality of such projections. Nonetheless, some analysts maintain that this level of expansion could be achievable if institutional adoption, bank integrations, and tokenization of financial assets continue to grow at their current pace. The expanding use of Ripple’s technology across global payment systems could also strengthen XRP’s utility, potentially driving demand and long-term valuation. While opinions vary on XRP’s $100 target, the recurring forecasts among analysts reflect increasing optimism about its future significance in the digital financial landscape. Whether or not this price level materializes before 2030, the ongoing discussion underscores the sustained optimism surrounding XRP’s role in the crypto economy.

52680086,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85359,1759623319,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"7 Altcoins Leading the Next Bull Run Including XRP, SOL, ETH and Top New Cryptos to Join Now",https://timestabloid.com/7-altcoins-leading-the-next-bull-run-including-xrp-sol-eth/,"Top new cryptos to join now are shaping the final stretch of Q4 2025 as market sentiment heats up. Bitcoin is holding strong at support, Ethereum’s ascending triangle points toward the $3,000 mark, and Solana is regaining its stride through dApps and NFT activity. Analysts are split on whether the rally will peak before year-end, but one project is already capturing attention: MoonBull ($MOBU). With its blend of meme culture and structured tokenomics, it isn’t just background noise—it’s positioning as a core contender for those seeking entry before the cycle turns. MoonBull ($MOBU) demonstrates why it belongs in every conversation about the top new cryptos to join now. Built on Ethereum, it leverages liquidity locks, token reflections, and supply burns to strengthen scarcity while rewarding holders. Its presale format with multiple stages, combined with staking rewards and governance features, gives it more utility than typical meme plays. Ripple continues to expand into finance, Cardano keeps delivering upgrades, yet MoonBull has emerged as the freshest breakout pick. As momentum builds through October, it’s proving to be more than hype—staking its claim as one of the projects to watch closely going into 2026. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Meme Energy Meets Real Mechanics MoonBull ($MOBU) is structured around auto-liquidity, reflections, and supply burns, ensuring every trade pushes its ecosystem forward. Community members are rewarded passively while liquidity deepens and token supply shrinks, creating sustainable scarcity. Unlike short-lived meme projects, MoonBull is audited, liquidity-locked, and fully transparent. This makes it a meme-driven token with functional mechanics that encourage stability. Its staking program promises an impressive 95% APY, while referral rewards bring viral potential. Community governance ensures each holder has direct influence. By combining memes with mechanics, MoonBull positions itself as a project that transforms trading conviction into actual returns and collective ecosystem growth. MoonBull’s presale rollout spans 23 stages, steadily tightening supply and rewarding early participants with better entry points. Fifty percent of its total 73.2 billion tokens are committed to this phase, supported by allocations for staking, liquidity, and referral growth. Stage 10 unlocks staking, while Stage 12 delivers governance rights. A unique launch safeguard prevents dumping, ensuring entry prices hold firm. Deployed on Ethereum, MoonBull is backed by security, liquidity, and scale. This combination of structure and strength has placed MoonBull presale into spotlight discussions as the best crypto to buy now and one of the top new cryptos to join now. Top New Cryptos to Join Now: Moonbull’s 27.40% Surge Is Next Moonbull is leading the list of top new cryptos to join now. In Stage 4 at $0.00005168, the token has already attracted over $200K in tally and 700+ holders. With its listing price set at $0.00616, ROI projections sit at 11,800%. A $5,000 entry secures 96.7 million tokens, which rise to $595,975 by launch. With a 27.40% price surge expected next, Moonbull presale is proving why early movers are locking in their allocations before the next stage begins. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): Still the Market’s Anchor in Q4 2025 Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor heading into Q4 2025. It is consolidating near crucial levels, with analysts eyeing $80,000 as the next upside target. ETF inflows continue to support liquidity, while trading volumes hold steady across global exchanges. Institutions are still active, cementing Bitcoin’s role as the backbone of digital finance. Despite volatility, its position as digital gold has only grown stronger. Bitcoin continues to attract both newcomers and veterans. For many, no portfolio feels complete without BTC exposure. Its dominance frames the narrative for every altcoin, influencing which projects are spotlighted as top new cryptos to join now. Market setups indicate a decisive Q4 ahead for Bitcoin. Technical patterns show consolidation zones forming strength before a breakout. Traders are watching whether BTC will initiate the rally or simply provide stability for altcoins to thrive. Whichever path plays out, Bitcoin remains essential to crypto market direction. Its presence creates liquidity, confidence, and gravitational pull that other projects rely upon. Without Bitcoin’s foundation, few tokens can sustain broader adoption. That’s why it remains not only the original but also the most important benchmark asset in the sector. Altcoins may grab headlines, but Bitcoin writes the market’s story. 3. BullZilla (BZIL): A Meme Powerhouse With Bold Potential BullZilla has built its identity as a viral contender in the meme economy, positioning itself as the top meme coin to buy now. Its branding has immediate recognition, designed to spread across TikTok, Discord, and Twitter feeds. Beyond aesthetics, BullZilla has structured its tokenomics to strengthen community growth. Scarcity mechanics mirror viral meme tokens of the past but with added engagement strategies for stronger longevity. Early chatter highlights grassroots adoption, with community-driven promotions fueling liquidity and consistency. Unlike projects that fade after initial excitement, BullZilla has created a repeatable cycle of engagement, making its presence difficult to ignore. The coin’s biggest strength lies in its culture. Participants are not only holding tokens but actively building memes, stories, and integrations that expand the brand. This viral feedback loop makes BullZilla unique among new meme projects. If Dogecoin and Shiba Inu showed what cultural power can achieve, BullZilla is shaping its own trajectory by locking its focus on branding and engagement. Whether it cements itself as a permanent player depends on execution, but few meme projects are structured with this level of attention. In the race to become crypto’s cultural icon, BullZilla has the raw potential. 4. La Culex: Why It’s Being Ranked as a Top Meme Coin La Culex is quickly capturing the attention of the meme coin community with its playful style and strong engagement. Built around creativity and collective energy, it offers more than just short-lived trends. The project’s ability to spark conversations and attract participants highlights why it is being discussed as a top meme coin to follow in the coming cycles of 2025. What makes La Culex stand out is the energy of its supporters who continue to amplify its presence across platforms. Meme tokens live and die on community strength, and La Culex is proving it has the momentum needed to thrive. With rising chatter and growing traction, it is steadily cementing its reputation as a top meme coin, one that blends fun with genuine staying power in the wider crypto conversation. 5. Ethereum (ETH): Gearing Up for Another Breakout Ethereum remains at the center of crypto adoption as Q4 2025 begins. Its price action is coiling within an ascending triangle, with analysts eyeing $3,000 as the key level to reclaim. If it breaks through, projections point toward higher highs by year-end. Beyond technicals, Ethereum dominates decentralized finance, NFT markets, and smart contract ecosystems. Its rollup upgrades continue to reduce fees and strengthen scalability. Ethereum’s unmatched developer base and vast network effect ensure its relevance. For many community members, ETH is a must-hold asset, especially when compiling any serious list of the top new cryptos to join now. Ethereum’s adaptability has secured its leadership across multiple Web3 sectors. From powering complex decentralized apps to enabling yield strategies in DeFi, ETH maintains utility across diverse functions. Its ecosystem is larger than any competitor, making it the prime launchpad for innovations. Institutional adoption through staking further reinforces its position as a strong long-term play. Market signals point toward Ethereum being ready for another defining run in Q4 2025, which could cement its influence once again. Whether held as an infrastructure asset or speculative driver, Ethereum remains one of the most important projects in global crypto discussions. 6. Solana (SOL): The Speedster Regaining Confidence Solana has re-entered the spotlight as one of 2025’s best comeback stories. Known for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, Solana is re-establishing its place as the preferred chain for developers and NFT creators. Q4 adoption metrics show surging activity in decentralized applications and token launches. Reliability concerns that haunted Solana in the past have largely been resolved, giving participants renewed confidence in the network. By late 2025, Solana is climbing charts again, both in ecosystem usage and price performance. It has regained momentum as one of the top new cryptos to join now for utility-driven opportunities. Developers and traders are flocking back to Solana for its speed and efficiency. New partnerships and ecosystem expansions continue to push innovation, with applications spanning from gaming to decentralized finance. Solana’s consistent focus on performance at scale makes it a top contender for long-term relevance. Its recovery underscores resilience and its ability to overcome setbacks. For those who once doubted its staying power, Solana is proving why it can reclaim its former glory.

52681501,597775,1759624255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52681501.jpeg,Bored Ape NFTs Win Big: Court Says They’re Not Securities,https://bitcoinist.com/bored-ape-nfts-win-big-court-says-theyre-not-securities/,"A US federal judge has tossed a high-profile investor suit that accused Yuga Labs of selling unregistered securities through Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs and ApeCoin. The decision , handed down by Judge Fernando M. Olguin, found that the plaintiffs did not meet the legal test for an investment contract. According to reports, the suit dated back to 2022 and was aimed at forcing a legal finding that the tokens were securities; the court disagreed and dismissed the case. Judge Found Howey Test Unmet Judge Olguin ruled the plaintiffs failed to show all three prongs of the Howey Test were satisfied. Based on reports, the court said buyers were not shown to have a shared enterprise tied to Yuga’s efforts, nor were they promised returns that would come primarily from Yuga’s work. The judge emphasized that many BAYC sales were framed as collectibles and membership benefits rather than investment contracts. Plaintiffs Had Argued For Profit Expectations The investors argued that market talk about trading and rare traits created profit expectations. The court, however, saw those claims as too thin to convert a collectible into a security. Purchasers’ fortunes, the ruling noted, were not made to depend directly on Yuga’s future business actions in the way required by securities law. This narrower view left the complaint without the necessary legal footing. Regulators Still Watchful Reports say the SEC has taken enforcement steps in other NFT cases, meaning the space remains under close regulatory scrutiny. Historical actions noted by regulators included instances associated with projects that provided revenue sharing or paid promotional aspects. Courts have not always offered a consistent interpretation of their findings. That uncertainty means that creators and platforms may be facing legal exposure even after the ruling. Not A Complete Shield For NFTs Legal experts cautioned that the ruling does not imply that all NFTs are free from securities claims. Yuga Labs itself has faced other legal fights; in July 2025 an appeals court overturned an $8.8 million judgment that Yuga had won in a trademark dispute and sent that matter back for trial. The mixed outcomes in related suits show courts are treating each case on its own facts. The decision is expected to offer some reassurance to NFT holders and marketplaces, since one major challenge was dismissed. Still, projects that promise revenue sharing, profit splits, or that are marketed mainly as investments could attract a different outcome if challenged. The ruling is useful, but it is not a universal safe harbor.

52681942,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=827754,1759625568,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52681942.jpeg,99.3% of Bitcoin supply in profit could trigger short-term dip,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/99-3-of-bitcoin-supply-in-profit/,"Bitcoin’s supply is almost entirely in profit, and analysts warn this could trigger a short-term correction. Historically, such high profitability has often been followed by brief market pullbacks. According to analyst Ted Pillows, 99.3% of the entire Bitcoin supply is profitable at its present market price of about $121,900. When the BTC supply in profits was above 99% three times, the price corrected by between 3% and 10%. This development comes when traders have been securing profits following prolonged rallies . Pillows claims that the same pattern is forming today. Hence, BTC may experience a temporary decline before resuming its overall upward trend. CryptoQuant data highlights that the price and the percentage of coins in profit move in tandem with Bitcoin. Nearly all holders are back in the black, signaling stronger investor confidence, although the rapid surge raises the risk of market overheating. Bitcoin sentiment strengthens as optimism builds The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has climbed to 63, reflecting growing market optimism . Analyst Darkfost noted that Bitcoin is approaching a new all-time high, though sentiment has not yet reached euphoric levels. He described the market mood as “optimistic but measured,” supporting BTC’s potential uptrend. Standard Chartered projects BTC could reach $200,000 on sustained ETF momentum. Historically, extreme greed levels above 80 have preceded major tops, but with the index now at 63, there may still be room for further gains before sentiment overheats. “At every previous top, we consistently moved into extreme greed territory,” Darkfost said, implying that the market has not yet overheated. Such a combination of robust on-chain statistics and an increase in investor sentiment is a complex picture. Typically, when the level of profitability is high, it leads to significant profit-taking and price corrections. On the other hand, the lack of extreme greed may indicate that Bitcoin still has a chance to recover. To support this view, Bitcoin ETFs experienced record weekly inflows of $3.2 billion in 2025. This reflects strong institutional interest and renewed market confidence. As long as sentiment rises steadily but never reaches the state of euphoria, BTC may have a leg higher to another all-time high. BTC price is consolidating around $121,900. A correction would not be completely bearish, but it would likely be a healthy reset following months of gain. Citi Sees Bitcoin hitting $133K in 2025 on ETF inflows Citigroup projects that BTC will end 2025 near $133,000, another all-time high. That would be a relatively modest 8.75% gain from its current price of around $122,350. BTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView The bank’s base case is for steady growth led by strong inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and rising digital asset allocations from treasuries. As of Saturday, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs held more than $163.5 billion in BTC. Citi is forecasting new inflows of approximately $7.5 billion by year-end, which would provide further support for demand. BTC remains undervalued compared to the price of gold when adjusting for volatility, a team of JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said. The Bitcoin-over-gold volatility ratio has fallen below 2.0, with Bitcoin now absorbing about 1.85 times the risk capital as gold, they wrote in a report on Wednesday.

Ethereum is already languishing at close to $4,300, and a break through key resistance could have it retest its $5,000 all-time high at pace. Historically, ETH’s tendency to lag Bitcoin at the start of a rally has been among the most bullish signs for the market, often being followed by a time frame wherein Ethereum takes the lead and triggers altseason. But whereas ETH remains a blue-chip selection for long-term investors, the focus is shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi altcoin centered on utility that is as low as $0.035, but is already well over 55% sold out during Stage 6 of its presale. Mutuum Finance has the potential to rocket to $5 in 2026 thanks to its real-yield mechanism, dual lending system, and rapidly expanding base of investors. Ethereum Heading to Shoot to $7,000 if Bitcoin Rockets Past $130K Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of new strength as it trudges steadily higher above the $4,300 level, positioning for a potential breakout. Analysts believe a strong break above its key resistance zone would trigger a swift retest of the $5,000 all-time high, with further gains on the horizon if Bitcoin can rally up to $130,000. In the past, Ethereum has lagged behind Bitcoin at the beginning of a bull run, and the majority of analysts assert that this dynamic, labeled as, the most bullish setup of all time, is usually followed by ETH spearheading the altseason once resistance turns into support. As speed picks up and institutional capital delves further into DeFi, some investors are already scouting for opportunities beyond Ethereum, with particular interest in fresh Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that could generate outsized returns in the next wave of market growth. MUTM Presale Momentum Gains Speed MUTM tokens currently cost $0.035 in Round 6 Presale, up 16.17% from the previous round. Very robust investor demand persists with over 16,770 investors trading a cumulative $16.8 million so far. As yet another step towards constructing the security of the platform, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat hackers and developers are encouraged to report bugs. Four levels of bug severities, i.e., low, minor, major, and critical, are offered so that bugs could be recognized on time and rectified. Mutuum Finance Readies Launch of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance is preparing to release its lending and borrowing protocol , an essential step toward increasing its grip in the DeFi space. The V1 will be released on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with required features such as liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and so on. Supporting ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral from its inception, the protocol is designed to offer a robust and user-focused decentralized finance experience. It is based on robust collateral management to protect the network and users. Unrestricted deposit limits, borrowing limits, and collateral ratios are some of the aspects that ensure it is secure. Real-time closing and remediation charges and penalties on undercollateral position stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Make the Most of the Next Big DeFi Breakout Before It’s Too Late As Ethereum is poised to climb towards $7,000 on the strength of Bitcoin’s surge to $130,000, investors are preparing to make the most of the next explosive cycle in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be a strong contender in this round, having amassed over $16.8 million from over 16,770 investors, with Phase 6 of its presale already over 55% sold out and tokens for as little as $0.035. Its twin lending mechanism, real-yield dynamics, and future lending protocol release place MUTM among the next-gen DeFi platforms that have the potential to reach $5 by 2026. Supported by a $50,000 bug bounty and strong security infrastructure, MUTM combines innovation and investor protection. Early entry into the presale could offer a rare chance to seize 100× potential before the next bull run drives it into high gear.

At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention as one of the top best crypto to buy now, offering traders a chance to diversify before capital rotation accelerates. Bitcoin Crosses $120K With ETF Demand Bitcoin rose 0.88% in the past 24 hours to $120,524, adding to a 10% weekly rise. The driver is the surging demand for ETFs. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs brought in $1.3 billion in two days , tightening supply. Data also shows futures open interest jumped 14.6% to $88.5 billion, with institutions buying at a premium on Coinbase. Citibank has recently updated its outlook, setting a base target of $181,000 in 12 months and a bullish case at $231,000 . With limited supply and consistent ETF inflows, traders are watching daily flow data to see if inflows above $500 million continue. If so, Bitcoin could push even higher in the coming weeks. Solana Pulls $291M Inflows as Adoption Grows Solana is drawing attention with $291 million in weekly inflows , taking its yearly inflows to $1.86 billion. This rush of liquidity is linked to expectations around upcoming U.S. ETF approvals. Corporations are also starting to add Solana to their treasuries, with Japanese firm Mobcast Holdings announcing a $10 million SOL buy . This shows how Solana is being used not only for network activity but also as a treasury and corporate reserve asset. With inflows stacking and new institutional adoption coming in, Solana is keeping its place as one of the top best crypto to buy now . MAGACOIN FINANCE Set for Exchange Listings MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched closely as one of the best altcoins to buy now. It is cheap compared to larger assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a smaller market cap that makes it easier for traders to build large holdings. The project has confirmed exchange listings are coming soon , adding urgency for early buyers. Smart money often rotates from Bitcoin into newer altcoins after big moves, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the names likely to catch early flows. With whales looking to diversify and grow positions in smaller caps, this is where attention is shifting. Visit MAGACOIN FINANCE here . XRP Mega Breakout Gains Speed XRP is back in focus after breaking out of a wedge formation that kept it range-bound for months. It has now cleared the $3 level and is trading at $3.05. Analysts describe this as a “mega breakout” and expect further gains if XRP pushes through $3.40 and $3.66. Analysts like Matt Hughes and EGRAG see XRP climbing anywhere between $8 and $27 in the next wave. Some even suggest $50 if ETF approvals arrive. With upcoming SEC decisions on XRP ETFs and Ripple’s pursuit of a U.S. bank charter, the conditions for more upside are aligning. This makes XRP a key pick on the list of the top best crypto to buy now . Ethereum Outlook Turns Bullish Ethereum is holding above $4,500, gaining 2.5% in the past day. Citibank set a base target of $5,400 and a bullish case at $7,300 in its latest outlook, with some traders even eyeing $15,000 down the line. Institutional adoption is still centered on Bitcoin, but Ethereum’s evolving ecosystem, along with ETH ETFs, is driving steady inflows. With altcoins like Solana and XRP gaining traction, Ethereum remains the blue-chip crypto that many consider essential for a balanced portfolio. This keeps ETH among the top best crypto to buy now . How Traders Should Position Bitcoin is setting the pace, but smart traders spread out their bets. Diversifying into Solana, XRP, Ethereum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE makes sense as liquidity rotates across assets. MAGACOIN in particular stands out because it is still cheap and preparing for exchange listings.

Chainlink ($LINK) received 1,963 new addresses on Oct 1, the highest in a month, signaling strong adoption. Chainlink roared back to life on October 1, adding a record 1,963 new addresses as LINK surged over 10% this week. With fresh tech integrations and growing adoption, bullish momentum is building fast despite a slight daily dip. What caused Chainlink’s new-address surge on Oct 1, 2025? Chainlink adoption spiked after on-chain metrics recorded 1,963 new addresses on Oct 1, 2025, the largest daily rise in weeks. This increase aligns with CCIP rollouts, Data Streams integrations, and institutional pilot announcements, which together boosted network activity and investor interest. How many new Chainlink addresses were added and why it matters? On-chain data provider Glassnode reported 1,963 new addresses for Chainlink on Oct 1, a clear uptick from the September daily range of 1,100–1,700. New-address growth is a leading indicator of user adoption and can precede extended price rallies when coupled with demand drivers. Source: Ali Charts Via X How is LINK’s price reacting to the address growth? LINK’s price rebounded to $22.59 following the address surge, riding a short-term recovery trend. The correlation between rising new addresses and price suggests increased demand and participation, which technical setups may confirm if resistance levels are cleared. TradingView shows LINK holding the $20.24 support (0.786 Fibonacci). Bulls are eyeing a breakout in the $23–$24 zone. Confirmed breaches could target $28.98, $35–$39, and a full extension to $46.31. Current price actions show a 3-day gain of 4.09% and price testing the mid-line of an ascending parallel channel. Source: Ali Charts Via X Why do CCIP and real-world integrations matter for adoption? Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and Data Streams integrations expand utility by enabling secure cross-chain transfers and real-time data feeds. The Worldcoin Data Streams integration and Cross-Chain Token standard lower developer friction and increase potential end-user reach. Chainlink Labs and Tools for Humanity characterized the upgrades as pivotal for scaling DeFi and cross-chain payments. These fundamentals complement on-chain metrics, making the adoption signal stronger than isolated price moves. When did institutional pilots add confidence to LINK’s outlook? Institutional pilots with Swift and UBS Asset Management showcased tokenized fund use cases at Sibos, highlighting enterprise interest in Chainlink’s oracle and cross-chain services. These pilots provide institutional validation that supports medium-term adoption narratives. Frequently Asked Questions How does new-address growth affect LINK’s price? New-address growth increases on-chain demand signals, often preceding price rallies when paired with positive fundamentals. For LINK, rising addresses have coincided with higher trading volumes and renewed bullish technical setups. Is the CCIP integration already live? CCIP integrations have begun rolling out, with Data Streams and the CCT standard enabling cross-chain token flows. Adoption timelines vary by project, but early integrations with Worldcoin demonstrate practical use cases. Key Takeaways On-chain signal : 1,963 new addresses on Oct 1 — strongest daily spike in weeks. Technical levels : Key support at $20.24, breakout zone $23–$24, targets to $46.31. Fundamental drivers : CCIP, Data Streams, CCT standard and institutional pilots strengthen adoption thesis. Conclusion Chainlink adoption appears to be accelerating: 1,963 new addresses, CCIP integrations, and institutional pilots together present a cohesive growth story for LINK . Traders should monitor the $23–$24 breakout and on-chain flows for confirmation, while developers watch CCIP rollouts for long-term utility gains. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/chainlink-adoption-oct-1-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""Chainlink adoption spikes as 1,963 new addresses appear on Oct 1, 2025"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-39-1024x576.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Chainlink adoption surged as 1,963 new addresses appeared on Oct 1, 2025, supporting LINK price recovery amid CCIP and institutional pilots.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many new Chainlink addresses were added on Oct 1, 2025?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""On Oct 1, 2025, Chainlink recorded 1,963 new addresses, the highest daily increase in over a month according to on-chain metrics."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does CCIP integration improve Chainlink adoption?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Meta description: Bitcoin price surge driven by low exchange inflows and whale accumulation; discover near-term targets, risks, and trade signals. Read now. What is driving Bitcoin’s recent price surge? Bitcoin price surge is being driven primarily by a sharp decline in exchange inflows and concentrated whale accumulation, which reduce immediate sell-side supply. These on-chain shifts, supported by positive taker-side flows, have pushed BTC toward its all-time high while increasing short-term volatility risk. How low exchange inflows affect Bitcoin’s liquidity? Exchange inflows (30DMA) have dropped to multi-year lows, roughly half the 2020 average. Lower inflows mean fewer coins available for quick selling on centralized exchanges, reducing downward pressure and amplifying upward moves when demand increases. Bitcoin inflow on Binance hits historical lows CryptoQuant data shows Binance and aggregate exchange inflows fell to historic lows, with 30‑day averages slipping below typical multi-year levels. This pattern contrasts past rebounds when inflows spiked as traders realized profits. Source: CryptoQuant Historically, average exchange inflows have been near 11,000 BTC; current readings are roughly half that. The shift indicates more holders choosing self-custody and long-term storage instead of exchange deposits. Exchange Netflow has recorded sustained negative values, with a monthly low near -26k BTC on October 3, indicating net withdrawals from exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant Buyers dominate the market Spot market taker CVD readings turned positive for consecutive days, indicating buyers are aggressively taking liquidity. When takers buy on exchanges, they often withdraw assets to private wallets—supporting the decline in exchange balances. Source: CryptoQuant Who is buying? On-chain exchange balance metrics show large-scale withdrawals by whales. Checkonchain data indicates MegaWhales Exchange Balance Change registered a sharp drop, consistent with tens of thousands of BTC moving off exchanges and into custody wallets. Source: Checkonchain Whale-driven withdrawals imply accumulation rather than distribution. Historically, prolonged whale accumulation has preceded extended bullish runs for BTC. Is a new ATH within reach for BTC? Reduced exchange selling and concentrated accumulation have pushed BTC close to its all-time high. Momentum indicators—Stochastic RSI and DMI—show strong trend strength but also overbought readings that increase the chance of short-term corrections. Source: TradingView If inflows remain low and whales continue accumulation, BTC is likely to test $123,700 and its ATH near $124,517, with upside possible beyond that level. Conversely, overbought conditions could cause buyer exhaustion and a corrective move toward $116,821. Frequently Asked Questions How do exchange inflows signal market direction? Exchange inflows measure coins deposited to exchanges; sustained declines reduce immediate selling supply and often precede price appreciation if demand remains steady. What does whale accumulation mean for retail traders? Whale accumulation typically reduces available supply and can create powerful upward pressure; retail traders should monitor on-chain balance shifts and risk-manage around momentum indicators. Are momentum indicators reliable at extremes? Momentum indicators like Stochastic RSI can confirm trend strength but often signal short-term exhaustion when extreme; use them with liquidity and flow data for context. Key Takeaways Supply squeeze : Exchange inflows are at multi-year lows, tightening sell-side liquidity. Concentrated demand : Whales are withdrawing and accumulating BTC off exchanges, supporting price. Manage risk : Extreme momentum readings increase short-term volatility risk; maintain stop management. Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent rally is rooted in reduced exchange inflows and significant whale accumulation, creating a supply-constrained environment that supports higher prices. Momentum indicators suggest both continuation potential and elevated volatility risk; traders should combine on-chain flow metrics with technical signals for informed decisions.

52682163,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85366,1759626955,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,8 Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025: One Presale is Gaining Momentum,https://timestabloid.com/8-top-cryptos-to-join-in-october-2025-one-presale-is-gaining/,"The crypto market in 2025 has become a stage where meme coins and legacy networks alike battle for dominance. From explosive presales to chains powering global finance, the rise of community-led projects and groundbreaking ecosystems has ignited new debates. For those searching the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025 or even eyeing the best new coins launching October 2025, the hunt is more than speculative, it’s survival of the loudest. Now enters BullZilla ($BZIL), a project wrapped in lore, fire, and unapologetic ambition. Other Best cryptos Uptober rally 2025, like Polkadot (DOT), MoonBull, LaCulex, Avalanche (AVAX), Hedera (HBAR) will each carve their role in this cycle, but none shout louder than BullZilla presale 48h update. 1. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Meme King That is Breaking Records BullZilla isn’t just another ERC-20 meme coin; it’s a cinematic movement in Presale coins with ROI 2025. BullZilla continues to dominate the narrative of best meme coin presales in October 2025 and Top cryptos trending this week, attracting both retail and whale investors. Currently in its Stage 5B presale, it raised over $770,000 with 30 billion tokens sold. Its deflationary mechanics, including the “Roar Burn” system and mutation-driven growth phases, give it an edge over other upcoming crypto presale projects this month. With more than 2,400 token holders, BullZilla is proving itself as one of the top presale crypto coins 2025. Community engagement further enhances BullZilla’s reputation. Weekly AMA sessions, regular burn updates broadcasted live on-chain, and 24/7 market hype keep investors motivated. Its presale model rewards early entry with cheaper tokens, making it one of the 1000x potential presale altcoins of this year. How to Buy BullZilla Coins To join the roar, buyers can follow a straightforward process: First, install a Web3 wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Fund it by purchasing ETH through a trusted exchange, such as Coinbase or Binance, and then transfer it to your wallet. Next, connect directly to the official BullZilla presale portal. From there, select the ETH allocation, confirm the swap, and the $BZIL purchase is locked in. Allocations become claimable once the presale completes. BullZilla doesn’t sell hope, it sells inevitability. Each progressive stage heightens scarcity and amplifies rewards for holders. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s an ETH presale narrative with claws, designed to slice through noise. Among the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025, few carry the same firepower or market theatrics. 2. Polkadot (DOT): Cross-Chain Innovation With Staying Power Polkadot remains one of the most technically sophisticated ecosystems in the blockchain universe. Founded by Ethereum co-creator Gavin Wood, it focuses on interoperability through parachains, allowing multiple blockchains to operate seamlessly under one relay chain. In the race for the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025, DOT continues to earn its spot as a foundational layer of Web3. Market analysts project that Polkadot’s growing ecosystem of parachain projects could rival Ethereum in terms of developer activity by late 2025. This isn’t meme-driven hype; it’s infrastructure-level value that stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Ethereum and Avalanche. When compared against a lore-driven coin like BullZilla, DOT demonstrates the other side of crypto’s spectrum: pure, technical utility. Together, they showcase why both DOT and BullZilla are critical among the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. 3. MoonBull Coin: Next Big Meme Coin MoonBull Coin is quickly capturing attention as one of the freshest meme-driven presale projects on the market. Inspired by the unstoppable drive of bulls charging toward the moon, MoonBull combines scarcity mechanics with community-first growth. Its presale is structured to reward early adopters through staged price increases, similar to BullZilla’s progressive Mutation Engine model, but with an added focus on liquidity pools and staking rewards that aim to stabilize long-term growth. The narrative surrounding MoonBull taps into the same energy that propelled Dogecoin and Shiba Inu but aligns it with structured tokenomics. With a capped supply, referral bonuses, and deflationary burns embedded into its roadmap, MoonBull isn’t just positioning itself as a hype coin , it’s building a foundation for exponential growth. Investors looking beyond the obvious giants now view MoonBull as an exciting addition to the meme coin battlefield. While still early in its presale journey, the project has already started building a loyal online community across Telegram and X (Twitter), laying the groundwork for explosive traction once listings begin. For those scouting the best crypto presale to buy, MoonBull offers both narrative strength and mechanical innovation. 4. LaCulex: From Buzz to Swarm La Culex is the meme coin that proves even the tiniest buzz can turn into a global roar. Inspired by the humble mosquito, this project has taken one of the most annoying sounds in the world and transformed it into a movement that crypto traders can’t stop talking about. With La Culex price still low enough to tempt early investors, $CULEX is being hailed as one of the Top meme coins to join this month. It’s not just about the humor, it’s about the swarm effect, where community, tokenomics, and timing come together to create a project that feels both playful and powerful. What makes La Culex stand out is how it balances fun with fundamentals. While the mosquito theme drives the memes, its structured presale, community growth, and deflationary design give it long-term potential. Early adopters are already buzzing about returns, and with $CULEX shaping up to be the Best Crypto to Buy Now, it’s capturing attention at the perfect time, the holiday season, when traders are hunting for the next breakout coin. In short, La Culex has turned an insect into an investment, and this swarm is only getting bigger. 5. Stellar (XLM): The Bridge Between Fiat and Blockchain If Polkadot is the architect of Web3, Stellar (XLM) is the diplomat. Stellar focuses on remittances, cross-border payments, and connecting traditional financial systems with blockchain. Founded in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, XLM has steadily evolved into a go-to protocol for settlement and liquidity. Its use cases strike directly at the heart of global finance, where trillions move daily. The XLM token is integral, used for transaction fees and maintaining network integrity. Compared with meme projects like BullZilla, Stellar feels clinical. Yet the irony is that both rely on narratives, Stellar’s is rooted in solving systemic inefficiencies, BullZilla’s in commanding cultural chaos. Both models win attention, but Stellar offers a less volatile bet. As the best new coins launching September 2025 gain traction, Stellar’s reliability keeps it in focus and cements it within the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. 6. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): The Legacy of Scalability Bitcoin Cash emerged in 2017 as a fork of Bitcoin, aiming to fix scalability issues through larger block sizes. While Bitcoin remained rigid, BCH embraced bigger blocks to process more transactions at lower fees. For years, it was overshadowed by the original, but in 2025, renewed attention has revived BCH as a practical payments network. BullZilla may offer cinematic gains, but BCH provides pragmatic adoption. The crypto battlefield needs both: spectacle to drive retail attention, and practical rails to support usage. This duality is why both BCH and BullZilla deserve their place in the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. 7. Avalanche (AVAX): The Speed Demon of Layer-1s Avalanche has built its reputation as one of the fastest blockchains, achieving sub-second finality and throughput rivaling Visa. Founded by Emin Gün Sirer, AVAX uses a novel consensus mechanism that blends classical protocols with Nakamoto security. In 2025, Avalanche’s expanding ecosystem of DeFi, gaming, and tokenized assets ensures it remains among the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. Narratively, AVAX sits at the intersection of speed and institutional legitimacy. Unlike BullZilla’s lore-driven chaos, Avalanche delivers technical certainty. Both are essential to the 2025 cycle, where the best new coins launching September 2025 include everything from meme-fueled rockets to enterprise-ready platforms. For traders, Avalanche’s ecosystem growth could rival Ethereum’s DeFi summer, making it a serious competitor within the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. 8. Hedera (HBAR): Governing the Next Internet Hedera Hashgraph offers something rare in crypto: enterprise-grade governance combined with unique consensus mechanics. Unlike traditional blockchains, Hedera uses hashgraph technology, promising high throughput, low fees, and fairness in transaction ordering. With a governing council that includes Google, IBM, and Boeing, Hedera brings heavyweight credibility. Compared to meme phenomena like BullZilla, Hedera embodies the sober side of crypto. But that doesn’t mean it lacks upside. If enterprises adopt Hedera en masse, HBAR could experience exponential demand. In the wider narrative, Hedera and BullZilla showcase how crypto thrives both in boardrooms and in internet memes, a duality fueling the best new coins launching September 2025 and keeping Hedera firmly within the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. Conclusion: Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025 Based on the latest research, the BullZilla, Polkadot, MoonBull, LaCulex, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, Avalanche and Hedera narratives converge into a single truth: the crypto market in 2025 is louder, faster, and more diverse than ever before. From mutation-driven presales to enterprise blockchains, the opportunities are as vast as they are volatile. BullZilla presale leads the charge with its aggressive pricing model and lore-driven mechanics, offering 1000x potential for early believers. Meanwhile, projects like DOT, XLM, BCH. This is why they remain central to any serious discussion about the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025. This isn’t a quiet evolution, it’s a mutation. The market just got louder. Join the BullZilla presale now, or risk watching from the sidelines as the Top Cryptos to Join in October 2025 change the game forever.

According to technical analysis, Dogecoin may be on its way to hitting new all-time highs, with $0.8 marked as the next bullish target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rockets Past $119K, Analysts Now Eye $130K Target Analyst Doubles Down On Bold Dogecoin Forecast A new analysis by Mikybull Crypto, a prominent market expert on X social media, reveals that Dogecoin has completed the critical phases of a Bump and Run reversal chart pattern—a setup that historically precedes explosive breakouts. With price action already reclaiming its trendline, the analyst has doubled down on earlier forecasts, predicting that the DOGE price could experience an explosive surge toward the $0.8 level. Sharing a price chart, Mikybull clearly highlights the textbook Bump and Run reversal, which consists of a lead-in phase, a bump phase, and a final breakout followed by a throwback to the trendline below $0.23. DOGE’s weekly price action has mirrored this chart structure, with the recent move back to retest the broken resistance now serving as a potential springboard for the next phase. In technical terms, this “throwback” often marks the last opportunity for accumulation before the real rally begins. Mikybull, who has been closely tracking Dogecoin’s macro setup, emphasized in his X post that “the main bullish rally is about to kick off.” In an earlier update, the analyst described the upcoming bull phase as a “face-melting rally,” noting that the Bump and Run pattern is rare but extremely reliable when confirmed. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading slightly above $0.25, and a rally to the projected $0.8 target would represent a massive gain of approximately 220%. Such a move would propel DOGE’s price beyond its 2021 record high of $0.73, setting a fresh ATH with an additional 9.6% upside. DOGE Breakout Structure Reinforces Rally Setup A second technical analysis by crypto market expert Unipcs on X delivers a similar bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price. His chart highlights a tightening wedge structure, where DOGE has been consolidating below long-term resistance while forming a series of higher lows. Recently, the price broke out from this compression zone, reinforcing the meme coin’s bullish narrative. Unipcs reiterated that “DOGE to $1 is a meme until it isn’t,” suggesting that this cycle could deliver the long-anticipated push toward the $1 price level. He further noted that Dogecoin looks primed for an aggressive move that could generate strong spillover effects for other major meme coins in the market. Related Reading: Space Meets Crypto—Spacecoin Executes 1st Blockchain Transaction Beyond Earth In an earlier post, he pointed out that Dogecoin’s structure still looked bullish on the Higher Time Frame (HTF), coinciding with the FED interest rate cut and the DTCC listing of a new Dogecoin ETF in September. With Digital Asset Trusts (DATs) and institutional players already accumulating, the analyst maintains a strong bullish stance on the meme coin’s price outlook.

Examples of the support areas Renault intends to reduce by 15% include human resources, finance, and marketing. This is part of the company’s cost-saving project known as “Arrow.” The reduction is anticipated to result in approximately 3,000 job losses at the firm’s headquarters in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, and at other locations worldwide. This development follows the introduction of a commercial version of the French automaker’s new Renault 4 E-Tech crossover. Still, you would be hard-pressed to identify it as a work vehicle at first glance. Called the Societe, this new line of electric cars for professionals skips the traditional van look in favor of something much more subtle. In 2021, Renault unveiled a concept inspired by the classic Renault 4 Fourgonnette, sparking hopes for a retro revival. But with the new 4 E-Tech Societe, the automaker opted for a more budget-friendly approach. Renault plans to reduce its workforce by 3,000 jobs amid cost-cutting measures Regarding the workforce reduction , the French newsletter cited a source with knowledge on the topic of discussion, which is close to the company, revealing that a final decision could be made by the end of this year. When reports requested that Renault comment on the situation, the car manufacturer confirmed that it is exploring cost-cutting measures. However, the company stated that no specific number has been decided on since they have not yet finalized this decision. According to a spokesperson for Renault, the firm has embraced this approach due to increasing uncertainties in the automotive market and the intense competitive nature of the industry. “Therefore, we are looking into ways to streamline our operations, improve execution speed, and lower our fixed costs,” the spokesperson added. The total number of Renault’s workforce in 2024 was 98,636 employees globally. In July, the car manufacturer announced a net loss of € 11.2 billion, roughly equivalent to $13 billion for the year’s first half. This included a €9.3 billion write-down related to its partner, Nissan. Notably, without this write-down, the net income would have decreased to € 461 million, which is lower than one-third of the previous year’s. This drop resulted from a weaker van market, increased costs related to electric vehicles, and pressure from swift industry competition. Renault faces significant challenges in its operation Analysts have raised concerns about how Renault’s CEO, François Provost, manages the company’s profit margins. According to them, Provost, who replaced Luca de Meo in July when the owner of Gucci Kering poached him, needs to address profit margins as soon as possible. They also highlighted that he needs to work to bring Renault’s credit rating back up to an investment grade, while figuring out how the relatively small car company can survive US tariffs and stiff competition from Chinese rivals. This issue was raised after reports from sources revealed that although Renault has been largely protected from US tariffs, as it does not have a footprint there, it has been indirectly hit by greater commercial pressure as European rivals seeking new markets outside the United States step up efforts to sell in its home region of France. In the meantime, the company reported zero growth in second-quarter sales volume and cautioned that sales performance was weak in June. It also faces increasing competition from Chinese newcomers in the electric car and hybrid markets. Barclays analysts suggest that Renault may have experienced slower price-mix momentum during the first half of the year. The company is due to announce full first-half results soon.

Summary: Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan of Bitwise told Solana Labs that institutional investors favor blockchains with rapid finality and high throughput. Hougan said Solana’s settlement speed improvements and low-latency confirmations make it particularly suited for stablecoin issuance and real-world-asset tokenization. Speaking on Oct. 2 with Solana Labs’ Akshay Rajan, Hougan emphasized that Wall Street audiences find Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios “hard to get their heads around,” while stablecoins and tokenized assets present clear, actionable opportunities. Source: Matt Hougan What is the institutional case for Solana? The institutional case for Solana centers on ultra-low latency, predictable finality and throughput that support high-frequency settlement needs. Financial firms prioritize networks where settlement times and unstaking windows align with fund liquidity and ETF redemption mechanics. How does Solana’s settlement speed compare? Solana’s settlement latency has improved from around 400 microseconds to about 150 microseconds according to industry reporting. Those microsecond-level gains reduce execution uncertainty and are attractive to asset managers designing tokenized securities or stablecoin rails. Why are stablecoins and tokenization important to institutions? Stablecoins enable near-instant transfers and programmable money rails, while tokenization converts stocks, bonds and real estate into tradable digital assets. Institutions see both as tools to streamline settlement, increase market access and reduce processing friction. How big is Solana’s stablecoin market? Solana’s on-chain stablecoin supply is reported at $13.9 billion, representing roughly 4.7% market share in stablecoin tokenization. By contrast, Ethereum holds approximately $172.5 billion on-chain in stablecoins, roughly 59% market share; layer-2 networks raise Ethereum’s share further when included. What do industry leaders say? Industry figures note that total value locked (TVL) is only one metric. Some strategists recommend the EVM ecosystem for issuing new stablecoins due to tooling and interoperability, while others stress Solana’s performance and evolving custody solutions as differentiators for institutional use cases. What is Bitwise’s current exposure to Solana? Bitwise offers the Bitwise Physical Solana ETP, a fully backed product that provides institutional-grade custody for SOL exposure. The ETP has attracted modest assets relative to BTC and ETH products, with roughly $30 million in assets under management at the most recent reporting. When will regulators decide on a spot Solana ETF? The SEC’s decision on Bitwise’s spot Solana ETF is scheduled for Oct. 16, 2025. Approval would create a new regulated vehicle for institutional and retail investors to access SOL under a familiar fund wrapper. Frequently Asked Questions Can Solana replace Ethereum for stablecoins? Solana offers performance advantages that appeal to certain institutional workflows, but Ethereum currently leads in on-chain stablecoin volume and developer tooling. Adoption will depend on liquidity, regulatory clarity and custody infrastructure. Is Solana suitable for tokenizing real-world assets? Yes — tokenization use cases require speed, throughput and secure custody. Solana’s performance profile aligns with these needs, while issuers must also consider legal frameworks and interoperability. Key Takeaways Performance matters : Solana’s low-latency finality aligns with institutional trading requirements. Market share gap : Ethereum currently dominates stablecoin on-chain value, though Solana’s share is rising. ETF watch : Bitwise’s spot Solana ETF decision (Oct. 16, 2025) could materially affect institutional access to SOL. Conclusion Solana’s technical strengths—speed, throughput and rapid finality—are driving renewed institutional interest in stablecoins and tokenized assets. Bitwise’s public endorsements and product launches underscore that trend, while Ethereum remains the dominant settlement layer today. Market participants will watch custody infrastructure, liquidity and the pending SEC decision to gauge whether Solana can capture meaningful institutional share.",Bitcoin|Ethereum|News|BTC|ETH|SOL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-05 02:08:54

The hunt for the top crypto to buy in 2025 has already begun, and the names on the shortlist are starting to crystallize. This isn’t about yesterday’s headlines; it’s about spotting momentum before the rest of the market catches on. Investors are circling like hawks, watching which projects have the strength to push through 2025’s volatility and which ones are destined to fade into obscurity. TRON and Chainlink are making noise with strategic updates, but one presale is already creating the kind of upward pressure that turns casual buyers into long-term holders. That project is MoonBull , and its mechanics are why it’s being called the top crypto to buy in 2025. MoonBull’s Mechanics Put It Ahead as the Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 MoonBull is built around a system that flips traditional token selling on its head. Known as the Bull’s Engine, this mechanism transforms every sell into growth for the ecosystem. Two percent of each trade is poured back into liquidity, deepening the pool and making trading smoother. Another slice goes directly to holders, rewarding them instantly without extra effort. Finally, one percent is permanently burned, reducing the total supply and steadily increasing rarity. Instead of fearing sell pressure, MoonBull thrives on it,making it one of the smartest contenders for the top crypto to buy in 2025. The project also hands power directly to its community. Beginning at Stage 12, governance comes alive with one token equaling one vote. Holders aren’t spectators,they’re decision-makers. Proposals on burns, campaigns, or ecosystem incentives are shaped by the people who actually hold the token. This level of transparency is rare, and it builds trust where other projects often stumble. Combined, these mechanics explain why MoonBull is viewed as the top crypto to buy in 2025 by those looking for both utility and upside. Presale Numbers That Could Define the Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 MoonBull’s presale isn’t moving, it’s sprinting. Currently in Stage 4 at $0.00005168, over $200k has been raised, with more than 700 holders already onboard. The math speaks volumes: from Stage 4 to the listing price of $0.00616, the potential ROI exceeds 11,800%. Early participants who joined in earlier stages have already secured gains of over 106%. The next stage comes with a 27.40% price jump, which means every delay costs real upside. To put that into perspective, a $2,500 buy today secures nearly 48 million tokens. At listing, that same position could be worth close to $295,000. It’s the kind of setup analysts describe as “catching lightning in a bottle.” Or better yet, like finding Ethereum when most people were still joking about smart contracts. These numbers make a clear case: MoonBull isn’t just another presale; it’s positioning itself as the top crypto to buy in 2025. TRON ($TRX): Building Steady Momentum TRON has carved its niche as a blockchain designed for speed and accessibility. With a market cap above $31 billion, TRON is a serious player in the global crypto economy. Recent data shows TRX trading near $0.33, supported by strong on-chain activity and daily transaction volumes exceeding $590 million. Its emphasis on scaling digital payments and supporting decentralized applications continues to attract both developers and investors. While TRON may not deliver the explosive growth of a presale like MoonBull, its consistency and strong usage base make it a valuable addition for those evaluating the top crypto to buy in 2025 across different categories. It’s not the moonshot,it’s the foundation. Chainlink ($LINK): Oracles Powering the Future Chainlink remains one of the most trusted names in blockchain infrastructure. Its decentralized oracle network connects smart contracts to real-world data, powering everything from DeFi lending platforms to insurance solutions. LINK has been holding steady near critical support levels, with developers continuing to expand its reach across multiple chains. The most recent updates focus on enhancing security and interoperability, making Chainlink even more essential to Web3’s backbone. Investors looking at the top crypto to buy in 2025 should not overlook LINK’s role in anchoring reliability. It may not generate meme-coin style buzz, but it drives the rails many other tokens depend on. Conclusion: Why MoonBull Takes the Spotlight TRON builds scale. Chainlink delivers trust. But MoonBull brings scarcity, rewards, and community governance together in a way that creates compounding momentum. With its 23-stage presale model, deflationary mechanics, and direct voting power, MoonBull is making a compelling case as the top crypto to buy in 2025. Its presale is live, numbers are climbing, and stages are closing fast. Opportunities like this don’t pause. For those determined to secure a spot in what could be the top crypto to buy in 2025, the window is open now,but not for long.

XRP consolidates for 300+ days under its prior ATH near $3.70, signaling accumulation. 0.618 Fibonacci and descending triangle set key resistance and support levels. SEC ETF decisions and early XRPR fund volume ($38M day one) could drive institutional flows. XRP breakout: Monitor $3.01–$3.05 trigger, $3.40–$3.66 resistance, and ETF rulings; read analysis and trade levels now. XRP’s 300-day consolidation near its all-time high signals a potential breakout. Analysts eye $3.40 and $3.66 resistance levels. XRP consolidates for 300+ days below its previous ATH around $3.70. 0.618 Fibonacci levels near $3 act as key resistance zones. Approval of XRP ETFs by the SEC could trigger institutional inflows and liquidity. Primary keywords: XRP breakout, XRP ETF approval. LSI keywords: XRP consolidation, all-time high, Fibonacci retracement, descending triangle, resistance levels, support zones, institutional inflows. What is driving the XRP breakout potential? XRP breakout potential is driven by a prolonged 300-day consolidation just below the $3.70 all-time high combined with technical pressure in a descending triangle. A break above $3.01–$3.05 could accelerate momentum toward $3.40 and $3.66, while SEC ETF rulings may add institutional demand. How could XRP ETFs affect price action? Approval of spot XRP ETFs would likely increase institutional inflows and liquidity, raising demand. Early market evidence shows XRPR fund volume reached $38 million on day one, indicating investor appetite. Rejection could spark volatility and short-term downside, but current market positioning prices in a potential positive catalyst. XRP is holding strong up 1.39% in the last 24 hours and nearly 10% over the past week. With momentum building, traders are eyeing a potential breakout toward $3.70. Why does the 0.618 Fibonacci level matter? The 0.618 Fibonacci retracement often marks significant resistance in corrective structures. For XRP, the 0.618 zone aligns near $3, creating a confluence with the descending triangle’s upper trendline. Confluence increases the probability of a clear rejection or, if overcome, a rapid bullish extension. What technical levels should traders watch? Key levels to monitor: Trigger: $3.01–$3.05 — daily close above could validate a breakout. Immediate resistance: $3.13 and $3.25. Primary targets: $3.40 and $3.66; extended target $4.20 if momentum is strong. Support: $2.75–$2.80 and downside targets $2.86 or $2.67 if invalidated. Source: galaxyBTC Via X Trading near $3.02 now, XRP is pushing against a major resistance level at $3, highlighted by the important 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. Recent weeks show the price squeezed inside a descending triangle, signaling growing pressure for a big move soon. How to trade a potential XRP breakout? Step-based approach: Wait for a confirmed daily close above $3.05 before entering long positions. Use layered targets at $3.13, $3.25, $3.40 and $3.66; scale out into resistance zones. Place protective stops under $2.80–$2.86 to limit downside risk. Source: Ali Charts Via X If XRP breaks out, watch for resistance at $3.13, $3.25, and $3.40, with a target near $3.66. Strong buying could even push it toward $4.20. But if it can’t clear these levels, XRP might fall back to support around $2.86 or $2.67, staying within the descending triangle’s lower edge. Frequently Asked Questions Will an XRP ETF approval cause a price surge? Yes. ETF approval typically increases institutional access and liquidity, which could lift prices. Historical ETF flows in crypto have often produced short-term spikes due to concentrated capital inflows and improved market legitimacy. When are the SEC rulings expected? The SEC is expected to rule on several spot XRP ETF applications in mid-to-late October, with a notable decision on Grayscale’s request scheduled by October 18. Market participants are pricing in outcomes ahead of these dates. Key Takeaways Consolidation: XRP has traded near its ATH for 300+ days, signaling accumulation. Technical trigger: Daily close above $3.01–$3.05 would validate a breakout setup. Regulatory catalyst: SEC ETF rulings could provide institutional inflows and heightened volatility. Conclusion In summary, XRP breakout potential rests on a clear technical trigger above $3.01–$3.05 and a favorable regulatory outcome for spot ETFs. Traders should watch resistance zones at $3.40 and $3.66 and manage risk under $2.80. COINOTAG will monitor price action and regulatory updates for possible tradeable catalysts.

The meme coin has managed to maintain bullish momentum in the past 24 hours after ending September consolidating. This recent move has kept Dogecoin’s uptrend intact on the daily chart, and according to technical analysis shared on the social media platform X by analyst Javon Marks, this structure could be setting the stage for a powerful upward move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rockets Past $119K, Analysts Now Eye $130K Target Breakout Structure And Higher Lows According to Marks, Dogecoin’s current price formation could be the early stages of a massive rally that carries the meme coin to $0.65 in a quick move. This prediction is based off a clear sequence of higher lows (HL) and higher highs that has been forming on the Dogecoin price chart. This formation is on the 5-day candlestick timeframe chart, and it goes as far back as the 2022 bear market. The first higher low started from the capitulation low in 2022 and continued through 2023 into 2024. Each higher low shows growing buyer interest after every correction, which is a sign of bullish continuation on higher timeframes. The most recent example came during September’s downturn, when Dogecoin found a strong support at $0.22. Rather than breaking down further, the price rebounded from this level to create yet another higher low in the series. This response was important because it confirmed that Dogecoin’s uptrend was still intact. Marks points out that this upward structure of higher lows means that another wave up is likely to be in the works. Therefore, the current phase between $0.22 and $0.25 now is more of a build-up before the next explosive move higher. Dogecoin 5-day price chart: Javon Marks on X The Case For A 153% Rally To $0.6533 Marks’ projection goes beyond a simple breakout. The analyst projected Dogecoin to go on to create another higher high in the coming weeks and months. This wave up could be an over 153% run from Dogecoin’s current price level. His chart identifies $0.6533 as the immediate target for this wave. Achieving this level would require Dogecoin to more than double from its current price, but this is not unprecedented given its price history. If Dogecoin were to reach the $0.6533 breakout target, it would be its strongest bullish rally since early 2021. However, this is still below its 2021 all-time high of $0.7316, meaning there’s still room for further upside if bullish conditions persist. Interestingly, the analysis also noted that Dogecoin might extend the rally above the $1 threshold. Particularly, the second price target is at $1.25711, although this may seem far-fetched in the short term.

The design of this new framework is a response to long-standing concerns within regulated finance about the reliability and compliance of tokenization systems. Instead of relying on custom smart contracts, the XRPL now integrates compliance and control features directly into its protocol, expanding its appeal in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) . Dr. Martin Hiesboeck, head of research at Uphold, explained that this standard addresses operational risks that have hindered other platforms. By embedding essential tools into the base layer of the ledger, the amendment reduces the complexity and cost of developing compliant financial products.

It includes mechanisms for freezing assets, fund clawbacks , and identity-linked transfer restrictions. Hiesboeck noted that these functions enable issuers to align quickly with sanctions or recover assets in cases of fraud or error. Another key feature is the use of decentralized identifiers and credentials, which ensure only verified participants can hold or transfer certain assets. This strengthens trust in the system while meeting regulatory demands. Additionally, every token returned to its issuer is automatically removed from circulation, creating a transparent and auditable supply record. Technical Strengths for Financial Institutions The standard is structured to serve high-volume settlement environments. It benefits from the XRPL’s speed, offering transactions completed in 3 to 5 seconds with very low fees. Each transaction fee is paid in XRP, which is then permanently destroyed , linking network usage to the reduction of XRP supply.

This enables tokens to carry machine-readable contractual data, such as maturity dates or settlement terms. The integration reduces the need for external reconciliation systems, making the XRPL a more attractive infrastructure for regulated finance. Direct Impact on XRP’s Utility The adoption of MPT ties XRP more closely to real-world financial activity. Every issuance and transfer consumes a small amount of XRP, while reserves are locked to create and maintain token objects. These functions reduce circulating supply and link XRP’s value to measurable financial operations rather than speculation alone. Hiesboeck emphasized that this shift strengthens XRP’s role as a utility asset . He stated that MPT was created to meet the compliance expectations of institutions and designed to operate on a global scale. With tokenized real-world assets projected to represent trillions of dollars in value, the XRPL is positioning itself as a secure and compliant platform for institutional adoption.

The rally followed a massive demand for U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). which collectively registering a net inflow of $3.24 billion last week. This marks the second-largest weekly inflow on record, according to data provider SoSoValue. Other tokens such as XRP, ETH, SOL, DOGE followed BTC's lead, gaining 1% to 3% during the Asian hours. Haven demand BTC's rally arrives against the backdrop of a continued U.S. government shutdown, which analysts say has heightened safe-haven demand for the top cryptocurrency. Jeff Dorman, Chief Investment Officer of Arca, noted just before the shutdown began, ""The only time I buy BTC is when society loses faith in governments and local banks. $BTC likely a good buy here ahead of yet another U.S. government shutdown."" Beyond political uncertainty, experts point to significant macroeconomic factors driving the rally. Noelle Acheson, author of Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, explained, ""beyond the escalating risk of new conflicts, US inflation is more likely to increase than decrease, increased borrowing around the world will intensify currency concerns, and what’s good for gold is also good for BTC, especially since it is still woefully under-allocated."" ""Plus, the incoming rush of market support – lower rates, yield curve control and lots and lots of “money printing” – will boost global liquidity, which will seep into the riskier corners of institutional portfolios,"" she added. In short, BTC looks set to chalk up impressive gains during the seasonally bullish month of October.

That makes this the most expensive stock market the U.S. has ever seen. It also means valuations are now more than double the size of the actual economy. This ratio has long been Warren’s go-to signal for spotting market bubbles. It’s simple: when market cap flies too far above GDP, the stock market is basically running on fumes. And right now, it’s looking like the market is floating on hope, hype, and a lot of talks about AI. Tech stocks rally as shutdown fears fade Even as the government drowns in budget drama, Wall Street saw solid gains this week. The S&P 500 rose 1.4%, Dow Jones tacked on 1.5%, and the Nasdaq matched the S&P’s 1.4% jump. AI-driven optimism is still juicing investor appetite, even while analysts throw warning flags. A deeper look at the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a chunk of stocks now sitting in the “overbought” zone. That includes names like Robinhood, Micron, Western Digital, and Fair Isaac. An RSI above 70 suggests that a stock may be overheated. CNBC Pro filtered for stocks with an RSI above 70 and at least a 5% gain this week. Turns out, some of these names are flying a little too close to the sun. Let’s start with Robinhood, which hit an RSI of nearly 76 after a 20% rally this week. The push followed its addition to the S&P 500 in late September, which pulled in a wave of investors. Bank of America raised its price target to $157, up from $139, suggesting about 7.7% upside from Friday’s close. Analyst Craig Siegenthaler wrote : “We believe HOOD is positioned to perform well long-term as the broker continues to scale its business, launch additional products and capabilities, deepen current client relationships, and expand its TAM both domestically and internationally.” Micron and Western Digital trigger overbought warnings Micron Technology, one of the big AI winners this year, has now seen its stock more than double. This week alone, it surged again after smashing expectations on both earnings and revenue Tuesday. The company also gave a strong forecast for the next quarter. Revenue rose 46% year-over-year. That rally pushed its RSI to 81.7, a strong overbought reading. Despite the run-up, analysts polled by LSEG say the stock could fall 4%, based on an average price target of $179.07. Meanwhile, Western Digital is even more overstretched. Its RSI sits at a crazy 87.7, making it the most overbought stock of the week. Like Micron, it’s been riding the AI hardware wave, especially storage demand. It logged double-digit gains this week, and it was already one of the top-performing stocks in Q3. But LSEG analysts are warning that the stock could crash 22% from here. Other AI-linked hardware names also made the list: Intel, Super Micro Computer, and Lam Research. All saw big weekly gains and RSIs above 70, pointing to a potentially crowded trade. Another surprise entry on the overbought list is Fair Isaac, the firm behind the FICO score. The stock popped 20% after the company revealed a new model that lets mortgage lenders skip the credit bureaus entirely. Its RSI is now above 79. That Thursday jump was its biggest one-day gain since November 22. Still, the stock remains down for the year, despite this week’s rally. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Sharing a chart that depicts a strong bullish structure, he stated that “XRP literally has the opportunity to go for the most face-melting pump of all time.” At the time of his analysis, XRP traded near $3.04. The market structure shows the asset’s sharp rise in late 2024 and early 2025, followed by a multi-month consolidation phase . After a brief surge in July, the digital asset dipped again. However, the chart shows a major breakout with an aggressive move on the horizon. XRP literally has the opportunity to go for the most face-melting pump of all time pic.twitter.com/9NXg9DTScT — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) October 3, 2025 Growing Institutional Interest in XRP While Cobb did not cite specific catalysts for the projected increase, several ongoing developments could provide the conditions for a rally. One factor is the discussion surrounding the potential approval of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for XRP, which would open up exposure to a broader base of investors. Similar products in other digital assets have driven significant inflows when launched. 3iQ’s spot XRP ETF, which launched in Canada in June, has outperformed expectations , and market participants in the U.S. anticipate massive growth, with projections of $5 billion in inflows within the first month . Institutional participation continues to expand as large-scale investors search for assets with liquidity and established global utility. XRP has frequently been positioned as a solution for efficient cross-border payments, giving it a practical use case that may appeal to traditional finance players. Growing adoption across different regions further supports this perspective. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additional Bullish Factors Another important backdrop is monetary policy. The Federal Reserve’s recent decision to cut interest rates , with the possibility of further easing in the coming months, has shifted market expectations. In a lower-rate environment, capital often seeks higher-yielding or alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. XRP could benefit if more investors incorporate digital assets into their portfolio strategies. This alignment of favorable conditions, including potential ETF approval, institutional inflows, network adoption, and macroeconomic policy, creates a landscape where strong price acceleration remains possible. Technical traders are already monitoring XRP’s chart structure, while fundamental factors provide additional reasons for optimism. The projection shared by Cobb reflects confidence in XRP’s ability to extend its rally from current levels. While the timing and scale of such a move remain uncertain, the market structure and external drivers present a compelling setup.

The move came after nearly two weeks of testing the same level. The rally unfolded amid what is now the longest U.S. government shut down in history under the 45th and 47th president, Donald Trump. Lawmakers failed to agree on funding, and by Wednesday the shutdown officially began. The timing pushed investors toward decentralized assets. Bitcoin jumped 14% in just a week. Traders wanted a hedge as Washington failed to govern. The shutdown added more stress to a market already on edge. Bitcoin rises as shutdown and politics collide Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered said, “The shutdown matters this time around.” He noted that during Trump’s last shutdown from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, Bitcoin barely moved because it was “in a different place than now.” This time, the crypto is reacting directly to political risks. Geoff added, “However, this year bitcoin has traded with ‘US government risks’ as best shown by its relationship to US treasury term premium.” Standard Chartered had predicted less than two days ago that Bitcoin was about to set a new high. They also said the coin could reach $135,000 soon after. But traders are also moving into other assets. Spot gold surged 0.5% to $3,876.55 per ounce on Friday, capping a weekly gain of more than 2%. The demand for havens reflects the same pressures driving crypto higher. Trump, speaking during the standoff, warned that benefit programs could face cuts if no deal is reached. He threatened reductions for what he called “large numbers of people.” The remarks only fueled more concern about instability. At the same time, Bitcoin has climbed about 30% in 2025. More Wall Street firms are adding it to portfolios, treating it as a credible allocation. Global investors are also shifting, seeing it less as a trading toy and more as part of a larger strategy. On-chain data shows what big holders, or whales, are doing. The 30-day metric that tracks balances shows a sharp decline through September 2025. Whales sold a significant amount during the past month, creating downward pressure. Charts showed a red zone of heavy selling. But signs of exhaustion are clear. As prices climbed, whale selling slowed down. In early October, the pace eased. Data shows the purple zone narrowing, a signal that the selling pressure is fading. Whales have been net sellers for weeks, but now there’s a hint they might be shifting into a new re-accumulation phase. If that continues, it could backstop the short-term rally. For now, the market has shown that even during political gridlock, Bitcoin can set records while traditional systems stall.

Despite the exploit that disrupted operations and the decline in activity that followed, she maintains that Shibarium is equipped for recovery and long-term growth. Her comments highlighted resilience, the role of its community, and the expansion of new utilities that could strengthen the blockchain as it moves into its next phase. Why Shibarium Will Survive and Come Back Stronger Shibarium is bruised, not broken. The recent exploit and the drop in activity shook confidence, but they also lit the fire for a stronger rebuild. Survival in crypto is not about avoiding setbacks. It is about how you rise after… pic.twitter.com/DykjWelgAc — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) October 1, 2025 Addressing Security Concerns The hack that affected Shibarium revealed vulnerabilities within the system, but Lucie highlighted that steps are already underway to address them. The Shibarium network was exploited on September 12, 2025, when attackers drained an estimated $2.3 to $4.1 million by manipulating validators through a flash loan. The incident caused a decline in the value of ecosystem tokens, forced a halt in bridge operations, and redirected attention toward improving network protections. In response, the development team is tightening validator control, implementing enhanced security measures, and conducting additional audits. Rather than being a permanent setback, Lucie framed these issues as opportunities for the network to reinforce its defenses and become more robust over time. Strong Infrastructure and User Base Another point Lucie underlined is the scale of Shibarium’s existing operations. The blockchain has already processed over one billion transactions and has seen hundreds of millions of wallets onboarded. While activity slowed in the aftermath of the exploit, this level of infrastructure does not simply disappear. Lucie noted that it forms a strong base upon which renewed activity and growth can be built. The Role of the Shib Army Community engagement remains one of Shibarium’s strongest assets. Lucie described the Shib Army as loyal and persistent, highlighting that this movement goes beyond technology and taps into collective commitment. In her view, SHIB holders are not easily discouraged by setbacks, and their continued involvement provides the network with stability and energy that many other projects lack. Expanding Beyond Its Meme Origins Lucie also drew attention to Shibarium’s efforts to grow past its beginnings as a meme-driven blockchain. She pointed to ongoing developments in areas such as stablecoins, decentralized finance, NFTs, gaming, and even discussions of a Layer 3 network. This push toward expanding utility, she argued, is essential for Shibarium’s evolution from a speculative asset into a blockchain with lasting relevance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community-Led Token Burns Token burns remain another mechanism for strengthening the ecosystem, and Lucie stressed that they are not just a technical process but a community-driven initiative. The more Shibarium is used and developed, the greater the impact of these burns. She described this as a reinforcing cycle that ties the network’s success to the active participation of its holders. Lucie concluded by framing Shibarium’s challenges as part of a larger recovery story. In the broader cryptocurrency space, comebacks are often celebrated, and if Shibarium manages to rebound, it could strengthen its reputation significantly. With its scale, community backing, and ongoing development efforts, she insisted that the network is far from finished. Instead, she sees Shibarium as evolving, with its next chapter set to be defined by stronger infrastructure and renewed focus.

Exchange reserves hit six-year lows More than 114,000 BTC (~$14 billion) left centralized exchanges in the past fortnight. Glassnode reports 2.83M BTC on exchanges; CryptoQuant shows ~2.45M BTC, a seven-year low. Bitcoin exchange balances tumble to six-year lows; learn why 114,000 BTC left CEXs and what it means for supply and price — read expert analysis now. Bitcoin exchange balances plunged to six-year lows as over $14 billion left CEX platforms in a fortnight, as the asset powered to a new peak price. Bitcoin exchange balances have fallen sharply as the asset climbed to new highs, signaling reduced available supply on centralized trading platforms. This move is driven by transfers to self-custody, institutional treasuries, and OTC flows, which historically supports upward price pressure. What are Bitcoin exchange balances and why do they matter? Bitcoin exchange balances measure how many BTC are held on centralized exchanges and represent the effective “available supply” for trading. A decline in exchange balances usually indicates coins moving to long-term custody or institutional holdings, reducing immediate sell pressure and potentially supporting higher prices. How fast did exchange reserves fall and which data sources report this? Blockchain analytics provider Glassnode reported total BTC on centralized exchanges at about 2.83 million BTC , a six-year low. CryptoQuant reports a slightly lower figure near 2.45 million BTC , which would equate to a seven-year low. Glassnode also estimates that over 114,000 BTC (~$14 billion) left exchanges in the past fortnight. BTC balance on exchanges dropped to 2019 levels. Source: Glassnode How are market participants reacting to dwindling exchange liquidity? Market participants and industry experts are noting tighter liquidity on exchange books. VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, said traders are already discussing potential short-term shortages. Market chatter from OTC desks — quoted by traders — suggests some liquidity providers expect sell-side inventories to deplete quickly as futures sessions open. What does this mean for price action and short-term outlook? With fewer BTC available on exchanges, price formation can become more sensitive to buy-side demand. Bitcoin recently reached a new all-time high near $125,700 (Tradingview), reclaiming territory above prior peaks. Reduced exchange reserves combined with renewed buying interest helps explain the rapid move higher. BTC prices reach a new peak. Source: Tradingview Why are holders withdrawing BTC from exchanges? Holders move BTC off exchanges for several reasons: self-custody for long-term storage, institutional allocations to treasuries, and OTC transfers to buyers not using public order books. When coins leave exchanges, they typically become less likely to be sold quickly, reducing available liquidity. Are the on-chain signals consistent across analytics platforms? Yes. While Glassnode and CryptoQuant use different classification methods, both show pronounced outflows and low exchange reserves. Discrepancies in absolute numbers reflect methodology differences; the directional signal — sharp decline in exchange-held BTC — is clear across providers. Frequently Asked Questions How much Bitcoin left exchanges recently? Glassnode reports over 114,000 BTC moved off centralized exchanges in the last two weeks, valuing roughly $14 billion at recent prices. Does low exchange balance guarantee higher prices? Lower exchange balances reduce available sell liquidity, which can amplify price moves when buy demand increases, but price outcomes also depend on macro events and trader behavior. Key Takeaways Exchange reserves are low : Centralized exchange BTC balances are at multi-year lows, tightening available supply. Significant outflows : More than 114,000 BTC (~$14B) left exchanges in a fortnight per Glassnode. Price implications : Reduced exchange liquidity can support stronger price rallies if demand persists. Conclusion Centralized Bitcoin exchange balances have dropped to six- to seven-year lows, driven by transfers to self-custody, institutional holdings, and OTC flows. These outflows coincide with a new price high and suggest tighter available supply. Monitor exchange reserves and on-chain metrics for signals of sustained market strength. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin exchange balances fall to multi-year lows as 114,000 BTC leave exchanges"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin exchange balances fell to six-year lows as over 114,000 BTC (~$14B) left centralized exchanges in a fortnight, tightening available supply amid new price highs."", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199b2ae-be57-70f3-a379-9ebbfbd02288.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-05T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-05T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much Bitcoin left exchanges recently?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Glassnode reports over 114,000 BTC left centralized exchanges in the past two weeks, amounting to roughly $14 billion at recent prices."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why do falling exchange balances matter for price?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Falling exchange balances reduce available sell-side liquidity, which can magnify price moves when buy demand increases, though other market factors also influence price."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin exchange outflows"", ""description"": ""A short guide to understanding what large BTC transfers off centralized exchanges indicate for supply and price."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check exchange reserve metrics"", ""text"": ""Compare exchange reserve data from multiple analytics providers to confirm directional trends."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess destination addresses"", ""text"": ""Determine whether flows go to self-custody, institutional wallets, or OTC counterparties to infer holder intent."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor price reaction"", ""text"": ""Watch how reduced exchange liquidity affects order book depth and price volatility during buying pressure."" } ], ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199b2ae-be57-70f3-a379-9ebbfbd02288.png""} Published: 2025-10-05 · Updated: 2025-10-05 · Author: COINOTAG",Analysis|Bitcoin|News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-05 04:59:13

Solana nears $260 resistance; weekly close above could trigger a rally toward $520. On-chain metrics show rising TVL and growing DEX volumes, supporting network liquidity. Technical indicators — MACD, 50-day and 200-day SMAs — confirm bullish momentum with weekly gains above 7%. Solana resistance near $260: weekly close above $260 could spark a $520 rally — read on for on-chain data, technical setup, and trading considerations. What is the current Solana resistance level and why does it matter? Solana resistance sits near $260; a weekly close above $260 is widely viewed as the trigger for a sustained bullish phase. A confirmed breakout would align price action with on-chain growth, creating a path toward higher resistance zones up to $520 within a multi-month horizon. How strong is the on-chain evidence supporting a Solana bull case? On-chain data shows tangible increases in Total Value Locked and DEX activity. Solana’s TVL reached roughly $12.647 billion with a daily rise of 3.97%, and decentralized exchange volumes show expanding DeFi usage. These metrics indicate growing liquidity and utility, which historically support price appreciation when paired with technical breakouts. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/solana-260-resistance-analysis"" }, ""headline"": ""Solana Nears $260 Resistance; Weekly Close Could Ignite Rally Toward $520"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-46.png"", ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-45.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Solana resistance near $260: a weekly close above $260 could spark a rally to $520, supported by rising TVL and bullish technicals.""} Why would a weekly close above $260 matter for SOL price action? Weekly closes confirm institutional and longer-term trader conviction. Closing above $260 would indicate that sellers at prior highs have been absorbed and that bullish order flow dominates. Historically, such weekly confirmations precede extended rallies, especially when backed by improving on-chain metrics and moving average alignment. Solana Approaches Key Resistance Zone Solana is trading near $229 and is approaching a decisive range around $240–$260. Price history shows a peak near $260 in late 2021, a multi-month drawdown in 2022, and a recovery phase that formed higher lows into 2025. Analysts note that a weekly close above $260 would open upside targets at $280, $360, $440 and $520. A weekly close above $260 could ignite a Solana $SOL bull rally to $520. pic.twitter.com/ZfkD2gcaHV — Ali (@ali_charts) October 3, 2025 The weekly chart shows resistance bands at $240, $280, $360, $440 and $520, with support identified at $160 and $80. Analyst Ali stated: “a weekly close above $260 could ignite a Solana bull rally to $520,” outlining a multi-step path with consolidation and resistance tests along the way. Source: TedPillows (X) Market momentum remains constructive. SOL traded with weekly gains of roughly 7.15% and sits above key moving averages. Analyst Ted highlighted a cluster of long liquidation orders between $200–$220, which may serve as a liquidity sweep zone before continuation. Support near $200 is considered robust by multiple on-chain observers. What do on-chain metrics and technical indicators reveal? Solana’s on-chain fundamentals support the bullish outlook: TVL near $12.647 billion and stablecoin market cap around $15.115 billion indicate sizable liquidity on network. DEX volume of approximately $4.126 billion reflects expanding DeFi activity, increasing transaction throughput and fee capture potential. Source: DeFiLlama Technicals are aligned: MACD histogram displays rising positive momentum and SOL trades above the 50-day SMA ($212.82) and the 200-day SMA ($169.20). Pattern analysis from ZYN notes three corrective phases near -24% historically, each followed by strong recoveries; the current structure matches prior recovery behavior pointing toward $280–$300 in the near term. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret a Solana breakout above $260"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step guide to assess Solana price action and on-chain confirmation for a breakout above $260."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Check weekly close"", ""text"": ""Confirm a clean weekly close above $260 to validate breakout strength."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Verify on-chain metrics"", ""text"": ""Confirm rising TVL, increasing DEX volumes, and stablecoin liquidity as evidence of fundamental support."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Monitor technical indicators"", ""text"": ""Watch MACD momentum and SMA alignment; a MACD crossover and price above 50/200 SMAs strengthen the bull case."" } ], ""totalTime"": ""P1M""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What happens if Solana closes above $260 on the weekly chart?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A weekly close above $260 would likely confirm a bullish breakout and could lead to a multi-month rally toward higher resistance levels such as $280, $360, and potentially $520, supported by rising TVL and bullish technical indicators."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which on-chain metrics support Solana's price strength?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key supporting metrics include a TVL near $12.647 billion, a stablecoin market cap around $15.115 billion, and DEX volumes of roughly $4.126 billion, all indicating increasing liquidity and DeFi activity on Solana."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How should traders manage risk around $200–$220 liquidity zones?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Traders should watch for liquidity sweeps and use layered stop-losses; the $200–$220 zone may host long liquidations but also acts as a strong support area if absorption occurs."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How likely is a Solana rally to $520 after a breakout? Historical price structure and current on-chain growth make a rally to $520 plausible after a confirmed weekly breakout, but the move depends on sustained liquidity, macro conditions, and follow-through from institutional buyers. When will a breakout be confirmed on the weekly timeframe? A breakout is confirmed when price closes the weekly candle above $260 with above-average volume and supportive on-chain inflows, reducing the chance of a false breakout. Key Takeaways Resistance level : $260 is the critical weekly resistance that could determine the next trend phase. On-chain support : TVL (~$12.647B) and DEX volumes (~$4.126B) indicate improving network liquidity. Technical confirmation : MACD positivity and price above 50/200 SMAs support a bullish bias; manage risk around $200–$220 liquidity pools. Conclusion Solana’s approach to the $260 resistance combines technical momentum and improving on-chain fundamentals. A weekly close above $260 would strengthen the case for a multi-stage rally toward higher targets like $520.

52689765,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85403,1759640571,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Pundit to XRP Family: Is October Going to be a Crazy Good Month for XRP?,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-family-is-october-going-to-be-a-crazy-good-month-for-xrp/,"Crypto commentator Austin Hilton recently shared his perspective on how October may unfold for XRP, pointing to broader market behavior and historical data. In a new video, Hilton broke down the impact of Bitcoin’s market dominance, seasonal performance trends, and external economic factors such as the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. His remarks centered on how XRP, despite lacking its own historical October track record due to years of stagnation under the SEC lawsuit , could still benefit from Bitcoin-led market momentum. XRP Family! Is October going to be a crazy good month for XRP? Lets talk about this! What do you think? pic.twitter.com/8JEwubk4Jj — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) October 2, 2025 The Role of Bitcoin Dominance Hilton explained that Bitcoin currently accounts for approximately 58% of the entire cryptocurrency market, with a dominance value of around $2.38 trillion out of a total market capitalization of $4.1 trillion. He noted that XRP’s own market capitalization stands at about $178 billion, with modest gains of 1% in the past 24 hours and 4% over the past week. His view is that Bitcoin’s market influence ensures that when it trends upward, the rest of the market, including XRP, is likely to follow. Government Shutdown and Market Reaction One of the unusual elements shaping October is the U.S. government shutdown. Hilton reminded his audience that the last such shutdown took place in 2018 and lasted 35 days, a period when cryptocurrency was not yet widely impacted by such macroeconomic developments. This time, however, he observed that crypto markets have responded positively rather than negatively, with hundreds of billions of dollars flowing in. He suggested that this may have accelerated gains earlier in the month than expected, disrupting the assumption that October’s first weeks would remain flat. Historical October Trends in Bitcoin While XRP lacks a meaningful October track record due to its limited activity during the years of its SEC battle, Hilton highlighted Bitcoin’s historical strength in the month. According to his data, Bitcoin has posted gains in 10 of the past 12 Octobers, with increases ranging from single digits to over 60% in certain years. He presented charts showing these results and argued that such consistency makes October an especially favorable month for crypto performance. Implications for XRP Drawing a connection between Bitcoin’s October track record and XRP’s potential , Hilton argued that XRP is positioned to benefit from overall market momentum. He emphasized that when Bitcoin rises, capital and liquidity tend to flow into other assets as well. With retail investors expected to return when Bitcoin shows strong upward moves, Hilton believes XRP could experience meaningful gains throughout October and into the fourth quarter. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Beyond October Hilton went further by outlining broader market expectations for the end of 2025. He referenced projections of Bitcoin potentially reaching between $150,000 and $200,000 by the close of that year, with some even speculating as high as $250,000. In his view, XRP will naturally rise alongside such movements due to the influx of liquidity and renewed investor participation that typically accompany bull market conditions. He pointed out that October, November, and December have historically been strong quarters for crypto as a whole, with early 2026 expected to continue the trend. Austin Hilton’s analysis of XRP’s potential in October ties closely to Bitcoin’s historical performance and current dominance. While XRP itself does not have a consistent October history to draw from, Hilton believes the overall environment, including the government shutdown’s unexpected market impact and Bitcoin’s proven seasonal strength, indicates that XRP is well-placed for gains. He assesses that October could serve as the start of a broader bullish phase for both Bitcoin and XRP, extending into the final quarter of the year and beyond.

BNB net inflows: ~$26B into market cap, suggesting concentrated capital rotation into Binance Coin BNB shows a near-2x ROI vs. Ethereum and a 22% jump in BSC active addresses in September BNB OI ~$3B vs. XRP OI ~$8B; a $30B incremental flow could push BNB past XRP for third-largest crypto Meta description: Binance Coin (BNB) is outperforming altcoins with major inflows, 22% BSC growth, and strong ROI—read the analysis and steps for BNB to overtake XRP. What is driving Binance Coin (BNB) to outperform other altcoins? Binance Coin is rising because focused capital rotations, higher ROI versus ETH, and on-chain metrics point to strong demand. Active addresses on Binance Smart Chain jumped 22% in September while implied inflows of about $26 billion have pushed BNB to a new implied cost basis near $1,194. How significant are on-chain flows and ROI for BNB’s rally? On-chain flows and comparative ROI are central. Over the last week, TOTAL2 (ex-BTC market cap) climbed 6.68% to $1.73T, with ~17% of that move rotating into BNB—roughly $26B. BNB’s ROI is nearly twice Ethereum’s, indicating stronger relative performance that attracts strategic capital. Technically, BNB’s market cap sits near $166B, or ~4% of the $4.2T total crypto market. Active addresses on BSC accelerated, signaling increased network usage and liquidity demands. Open Interest (OI) on BNB derivatives is ~ $3B, lower than XRP’s ~$8B, which reduces liquidation risk and supports organic price appreciation. Source: TradingView (BNB/USDT) How could Binance Coin claim the third-largest crypto spot? BNB can ascend to third if capital rotation continues and inflows exceed outflows. The gap to XRP is roughly 12.5% in market cap terms today; approximately $30B more into BNB could bridge that gap and place Binance Coin above XRP. What indicators matter for a successful overtake? Key indicators include continued strong net inflows, persistent growth in BSC active addresses, stable or rising OI without increased liquidation risk, and the XRP/BNB ratio remaining weak. Artemis Terminal and TradingView data show the XRP/BNB ratio has dropped ~60% since July—an important technical signal favoring BNB. Source: TradingView (XRP/BNB) Frequently Asked Questions Can BNB realistically overtake XRP in market cap this quarter? Yes, if inflows persist. A sustained rotation similar to recent moves—plus an incremental ~$30B—would likely push BNB past XRP; on-chain inflows, ROI advantage, and diminished XRP bid strength support this path. Is BNB’s rally driven more by fundamentals or speculation? Current data point to fundamentals: increased BSC activity, higher address growth, and measurable capital inflows underpin the rally. That said, momentum and positioning can amplify price moves short term. What risks could derail BNB’s ascent? Risks include marketwide corrections, regulatory or exchange-specific events, a sudden reversal in flows, or renewed confidence/capital returning to XRP. Watch liquidity and derivatives OI closely. Key Takeaways Capital rotation into BNB : Roughly $26B implied inflows have driven the rally. On-chain strength : BSC active addresses rose ~22%, signaling real network demand. Path to third spot : A $30B incremental flow and continued ratio weakness vs. XRP could secure third place for BNB. Conclusion Binance Coin’s outperformance is built on measurable on-chain flows, superior short-term ROI versus ETH, and weakening bid support for XRP.

Wall Street has taken notice. Major financial institutions that once dismissed Bitcoin as a speculative bubble have quietly been accumulating positions, while exchange-traded funds tracking the cryptocurrency have seen record inflows in recent months.

The MVRV rising above its yearly moving average and 99.3% of supply in profit point to elevated short‑term distribution risk near the $100K–$110K band. MVRV jumped from 1.9 to 2.4 in October, crossing its yearly average and signalling renewed holder confidence. Analyst data shows 99.3% of Bitcoin supply is currently in profit, historically preceding short-term pullbacks of 3–10%. Converging momentum and profitability metrics place the $100K–$110K resistance band as the next major testing range. Bitcoin MVRV breakout shows rising profit supply and pressure near $100K–$110K — read our analysis and next steps for traders. Stay informed with COINOTAG coverage. Bitcoin’s MVRV breakout and profit supply spike indicate increasing upside pressure and a higher probability of short‑term distribution as the market approaches the $100K resistance range. MVRV ratio climbed from 1.9 to 2.4 in October, a momentum crossover above the one‑year moving average. Analyst data shows 99.3% of Bitcoin supply is in profit, a historic level linked to short‑term pullbacks. $100K–$110K is the primary resistance range as on‑chain momentum and unrealized gains converge. Bitcoin is demonstrating renewed strength across multiple on‑chain indicators, positioning price action near a significant pressure zone. Expert commentary from market analysts highlights a decisive trend change, with momentum turning bullish after months of consolidation. MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) is a common on‑chain gauge for identifying expansion and distribution phases. The ratio measures market capitalization relative to the aggregate cost basis of holders, offering a snapshot of unrealized profit or loss across the network. Recent movements now point to accumulation resuming after an extended neutral period. What is the Bitcoin MVRV breakout? The Bitcoin MVRV breakout refers to the MVRV ratio rising above its one‑year moving average, indicating renewed net unrealized gains and increased holder confidence. This breakout often precedes acceleration but also raises short‑term distribution risk when profitability reaches historic highs. How does the MVRV crossover affect short‑term price action? The crossover from 1.9 to 2.4 in October shows a momentum shift from neutral to positive. Historically, MVRV crossovers have coincided with phases of renewed buying, but when paired with extremely high profit supply, they can precede temporary pullbacks. Short, disciplined risk management is prudent in these windows. How significant is the 99.3% profit supply reading? Analyst Ted’s flagged statistic that 99.3% of Bitcoin supply is in profit is unusually elevated and has only appeared a few times historically. Those instances were followed by short‑term declines between 3% and 10%, suggesting elevated distribution risk despite the current bullish momentum. Source: Ali on X Price action between November 2024 and October 2025 saw Bitcoin trade in a broad range from roughly $60,000 to $110,000, with MVRV oscillating between 1.6 and 2.8. A notable dip to ~1.6 in March 2025 aligned with capitulation events, while the April–May rebound returned the market to neutral territory. Why does the $100K–$110K band matter now? The $100K–$110K range has repeatedly acted as a ceiling across 2024–2025. With unrealized gains expanding and profitability metrics stretching, the band represents the next major test for buyers. If distribution intensifies near that band, expect short‑term cooldowns before any sustained breakout. What should traders and investors watch next? Key metrics to monitor include the MVRV trajectory relative to its moving average, changes in realized profit distribution, and liquidity at $100K–$110K. Use stop placement and position sizing to manage the elevated risk that comes with near‑historic profit levels. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What does a Bitcoin MVRV breakout indicate?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A Bitcoin MVRV breakout indicates rising unrealized gains among holders and a shift toward bullish momentum; however, it can also precede short‑term distribution when profitability nears historic highs."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How does 99.3% of supply in profit affect price risk?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""When 99.3% of supply is in profit, historical precedents show increased probability of short‑term pullbacks (typically 3–10%), as holders lock in gains and distribution increases."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is $100K the next major resistance for Bitcoin?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes. Converging on‑chain momentum and stretched profitability metrics make $100K–$110K the primary near‑term resistance band to watch."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How reliable is MVRV as a timing tool? MVRV is reliable as a cycle and sentiment indicator but not a precise timing tool. It highlights phases of unrealized profit and loss; combine it with volume, liquidity, and price structure for better timing decisions (40–50 words). What should a long‑term investor do when profit supply spikes? Long‑term investors should reassess risk allocation, consider partial profit‑taking at clear resistance, and rebalance rather than fully exit positions. Maintain a multi‑year view while protecting capital near historic profit extremes. Key Takeaways MVRV breakout : The ratio moving above its yearly average signals renewed on‑chain momentum. Profit supply elevated : 99.3% of supply in profit historically precedes short‑term pullbacks. Resistance focus : $100K–$110K is the next key band; manage risk and watch distribution metrics closely. Conclusion Bitcoin’s current MVRV breakout and elevated profit supply suggest a meaningful near‑term test at the $100K–$110K resistance band. Traders should balance participation with disciplined risk controls, while long‑term holders monitor distribution metrics for re‑entry opportunities.

The move higher came after a mid-session flushout drove price to $0.248 on heavy volume, clearing weak longs before buyers stepped in. DOGE is now consolidating just above $0.26 with traders eyeing the $0.30–$0.33 zone as the next resistance cluster. News Background • DOGE has been trading within a broad $0.24–$0.27 band through September as ETF filings and institutional mining investments build longer-term narratives. • Reports show 2 billion DOGE accumulated by large holders over the past 72 hours, consistent with historical pre-breakout patterns. • Broader crypto markets are stabilizing after last week’s $1.7 billion in liquidations, with DOGE drawing inflows as traders rotate back into high-beta tokens. Price Action Summary • DOGE dropped from $0.254 to $0.248 during Saturday’s mid-session selloff, establishing strong support at $0.247–$0.249. • Volume surged to 485.6M during the capitulation, confirming institutional participation. • The token rebounded into an ascending channel formation, closing near $0.252. • By early Sunday, DOGE had reclaimed $0.26, with consolidation now evident above the level. • Traders flag $0.30 as the next resistance test, with $0.33–$0.40 as breakout targets.

BTC jumped to a high of $125,650 as it rose for the fifth consecutive day following the crash to $108,652. This article explains some of the top reasons why BTC is soaring. Bitcoin price is soaring as safe-haven demand rises One of the main reasons why the Bitcoin price has jumped is that it has emerged as a safe-haven asset. This mirrors the performance of gold, which has jumped to a record high in the past few days. Investors see Bitcoin as a digital equivalent to gold. As such, while old-school investors are buying gold, the new generation leans toward Bitcoin, which has some solid fundamentals. For example, unlike gold, Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million coins and most of them have been mined already. Many have been lost and millions of others are held by treasury companies that are not interested in selling. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty continues rising as the halving effect reduces the block rewards every four years. At the same time, Bitcoin demand continues rising, mostly from corporations. All this has led to a low Bitcoin supply, with the number of coins in exchanges falling to the lowest level in years. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts The other main catalyst for the Bitcoin price has been the Federal Reserve, which has started cutting interest rates this year. It slashed rates by 0.25% in September, and analysts point to more cuts in the coming months. The odds that the bank will deliver more cuts in the coming meetings jumped after ADP published the latest job numbers. Its report showed that the economy shed over 36,000 jobs in September this year. The ADP report was the only one that came out last week as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is part of the government shutdown. Therefore, Polymarket and the CME Fed Tool predict that the bank will cut interest rates by 0.25% in the coming meeting, which will boost Bitcoin prices. BTC ETF inflows are rising Meanwhile, there are signs that institutional investors continue to load up on Bitcoin using ETFs. Data shows that Bitcoin had inflows in the last five consecutive days. These funds added over $3.25 billion in assets last week, bringing the total inflows to over $60 billion for the first time ever. This growth has helped to transform BlackRock’s IBIT into one of the biggest and most profitable funds globally. It now has over $90 billion in assets and a 25 basis points expense ratio. BTC price has strong technicals BTC price chart | Source: TradingView The other bullish catalyst for the Bitcoin price is its strong technicals. It recently formed a giant bullish flag pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a descending channel pattern. The coin has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Also, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has jumped to nearly 30. Therefore, the coin will likely continue soaring as bulls target the next key resistance at $130,000.

The cryptocurrency rocketed to just under $126K on Binance during the early trading hours of Sunday. Recall that bitcoin went on a roll during the summer when it topped $124K in August. What followed was a somewhat expected correction and consolidation. September was volatile with a peak of $118K after the US Fed reduced the interest rates. However, that was short-lived and BTC dumped below $109K a week later. Its recovery began at the start of the business week and especially since October ( referred to as ‘Uptober’ in the crypto community) kicked off. Bitcoin added more than $10K to its value from Monday until Friday but the actual breakout was yet to transpire. Following a calm Saturday with sideways trading between $121K-$122K, the major cryptocurrency flew past the precious record and set a new one at $125.9K on Binance. Its market capitalization has shot up to $2.5 trillion, which places it above Amazon and close to silver. The total value of liquidations on CoinGlass is up to $350 million, with shorts responsible for the lion’s share.

Analysts project $135,000 near term and $200,000+ before year‑end; monitor liquidity and on‑chain signals. Bitcoin price rockets past $125,000 in 2025; read why BTC could reach $135,000–$200,000 and what traders should watch. Stay informed with COINOTAG coverage. What is driving Bitcoin’s 2025 rally? Bitcoin price has climbed as institutional allocations, macroeconomic uncertainty and concentrated short squeezes have converged to push demand higher. Large trading flows and renewed interest from asset managers are front-loading capital into BTC, strengthening the narrative of Bitcoin as a digital store of value. How high can Bitcoin go in 2025? Market data shows Bitcoin reached a new record above $125,000 during Asia trading, with approximately $50 billion in 24‑hour volume and roughly $100 million in short liquidations in a single hour; more than $200 million in BTC shorts were liquidated over the prior 24 hours (data reported by market data aggregators and analytics providers). Analyst expectations vary. Some asset managers forecast a near‑term price floor above $135,000 and upside to $200,000 before year‑end, citing institutional adoption, constrained supply dynamics and macro tailwinds. These projections are scenario‑based and assume continued inflows and liquidity. Why did short liquidations accelerate the move? Forced buybacks from liquidated short positions amplified momentum, creating feedback loops that lifted price rapidly. Higher leverage in derivatives markets increases potential for swift moves; when concentrated short exposure is closed, market liquidity thins and volatility spikes. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-125k-2025-outlook"" }, ""headline"": ""How high can Bitcoin go?

Institutional allocations increase buy-side demand and can reduce available float in liquid venues, supporting higher prices. Large institutional buys also attract secondary flows from retail and algorithmic traders, amplifying momentum. What on‑chain metrics indicate exhaustion or continuation? Key signals include exchange net flows, long‑term holder distribution, network activity, and realized volatility. Rising exchange outflows and longer hodl durations typically support continuation; heavy inflows to exchanges may signal near‑term selling pressure. Key Takeaways Record breakout : Bitcoin exceeded $125,000 in 2025 amid heavy volume and short squeezes. Analyst targets : Near‑term targets cited include $135,000 with upside scenarios to $200,000; outcomes depend on flows and liquidity. Risk management : Use size limits, stops and monitor derivatives and on‑chain metrics before increasing exposure. Conclusion The Bitcoin price rally through $125,000 reflects a confluence of institutional demand, macro uncertainty and forced liquidations. While some models point to $135,000–$200,000 targets, volatility remains elevated. Follow verified market data, apply disciplined risk controls, and consult professional advice before trading.

ETF inflows: $3.24B this week, largest since January 2025 Exchange reserves fell to ~2.83M BTC, the lowest since 2019 (Glassnode). Market technicals show bullish momentum: 7‑day SMA $117,800; 200‑day EMA $105,511; RSI ~69. Bitcoin all-time high: Bitcoin rises above $125,200 on ETF inflows and low exchange supply — read key drivers and next targets. Stay informed with COINOTAG. What caused Bitcoin to hit a new all-time high? Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high was driven by accelerated institutional demand via spot ETFs and a marked reduction in exchange liquid supply. ETFs recorded $3.24 billion in weekly inflows while centralized exchange balances fell to multi-year lows, creating a strong demand-to-supply imbalance and upward price pressure. How did ETF inflows fuel the breakout? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $3.24 billion in inflows this week, led by large single-day purchases (for example, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust absorbed ~$524 million in one day). ETFs are acquiring roughly 8,200 BTC per day while miner issuance remains near 450 BTC daily, creating an estimated 20:1 demand-to-supply gap. That sustained accumulation mirrors conditions seen in late 2020 when institutional capital first entered the market at scale, and it increases the probability of extended bullish momentum if inflows persist. Why is exchange supply important and what does data show? Exchange supply is a proxy for available liquid Bitcoin. Glassnode-style on-chain metrics show centralized exchange balances down to approximately 2.83 million BTC—the lowest since 2019. Over the past two weeks, withdrawals equivalent to more than $14 billion were observed, indicating growing scarcity on venues that facilitate quick selling. Institutional custodians and long-term holders withdrawing coins reduces available float and can amplify price moves when inflows continue to outpace new supply. What do technical indicators say about the trend? Chart indicators confirm bullish strength while not yet signalling extreme overbought conditions. Bitcoin reclaimed major averages: 7‑day SMA near $117,800 and 200‑day EMA at $105,511 acting as support. MACD histogram at +1,127 and RSI around 69.2 indicate momentum remains healthy with short-term resistance near $128,000 and a Fibonacci extension target around $139,000 if momentum continues. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High as ETF Inflows and Supply Shortage Drive Momentum"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-05T08:44:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-05T08:44:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Person"", ""name"": ""Kosta Gushterov"", ""affiliation"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin surged above $125,200 as spot-ETF inflows and falling exchange reserves created a steep demand-to-supply imbalance, lifting market cap to roughly $2.49 trillion."", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-etf-inflows-125k"" }} Frequently Asked Questions How much did ETFs buy this week? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $3.24 billion in inflows this week, led by sizable single-day purchases that accelerated institutional accumulation (data referenced from public ETF flow reports). Is the supply shortage real and measurable? Yes. Centralized exchange balances have declined to roughly 2.83 million BTC, the lowest level since 2019, according to on-chain exchange balance metrics. This reduced liquid supply increases scarcity risk if demand remains elevated. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much did ETFs buy this week?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $3.24 billion in inflows this week, driven by large institutional purchases."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is the supply shortage measurable?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes, centralized exchange balances have declined to about 2.83 million BTC, the lowest since 2019, indicating reduced liquid supply."" } } ]} How to interpret ETF-driven rallies? Follow these steps to assess the sustainability of ETF-driven rallies: Monitor weekly ETF net flows to gauge institutional demand. Track centralized exchange balances for shifts in liquid supply. Confirm technical support levels (7‑day SMA, 200‑day EMA) and momentum indicators (MACD, RSI). Compare miner issuance to ETF acquisition rates to assess demand-to-supply imbalance. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret ETF-driven Bitcoin rallies"", ""description"": ""Simple steps to evaluate whether ETF inflows are likely to sustain a Bitcoin rally."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Monitor ETF flows"", ""text"": ""Check weekly spot ETF inflows to measure institutional buying pressure."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Track exchange balances"", ""text"": ""Watch centralized exchange BTC balances for reductions in liquid supply."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Confirm technicals"", ""text"": ""Use moving averages and momentum indicators to validate trend strength."" } ]} Key Takeaways ETF demand : Institutional spot-ETF inflows (≈$3.24B this week) are a primary driver of the rally. Supply shortage : Centralized exchange reserves dropped to ~2.83M BTC, increasing scarcity and potential volatility. Technical outlook : Support at $105k–$118k with short-term resistance near $128k; extension targets toward $139k if momentum continues. Conclusion Bitcoin’s new all-time high above $125,200 reflects a convergence of strong institutional ETF inflows and a measurable decrease in exchange liquid supply. Data from market flow reports and on-chain metrics suggest the rally is backed by real demand rather than pure speculation. Monitor ETF flows, exchange balances, and technical support to gauge the next leg of price action. COINOTAG will continue to report updates and data-driven analysis.

While Bitcoin continues to reign and make headlines, major altcoins are also gaining significant attention due to their consistent accumulation. XRP and Solana (SOL) are leading the pack and are being heavily purchased by whales. Meanwhile, retail investors, who have turned their attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE, are anticipating returns as high as 55x, according to analysts. Whale Activity Surrounding XRP XRP continues trading steadily around the price of $3.05, one of the most bought altcoins. The token has consistently remained popular among institutions due to Ripple’s quest to become a global payment standard. For the past couple of weeks, whale wallets with large XRP holdings have been making big moves by accumulating the asset significantly. Recent on-chain data reveals that addresses owning more than 10 million XRP started to move their coins. Experts think this accumulation period is setting the stage for a future breakout that may take the token nearer to $3.50 to $3.75 in the next few months. While Ripple continues to forge partnerships across banking and cross-border settlement, the confidence of investors in the long-term role of XRP remains solid. Solana Maintains Strong Momentum Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is trading at around $230, sustaining its strong rally as one of the major altcoins of the year. Solana is known for its ridiculously fast transactions and low fees. It’s quickly become a hot spot for DeFi activity and NFTs. Many organizations now have an increasing interest towards Solana. Rising expectations of Solana-linked ETFs and steady whale buying activity are driving up momentum. SOL is performing exceptionally well in 2025. According to a technical chart, price upward momentum will continue if Solana manages to stay above the $225 level. As a result, it will target the $250-$260 level. This makes it one of the outperforming assets of the 2025 market cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE Expected to Offer 55x ROI Whales are grabbing positions in XRP and SOL, while smaller investors are betting on MAGACOIN FINANCE to make generational gains. If MAGACOIN grows as expected in the next bull market, analysts believe early investors could see returns as high as 55x. Different from many presale tokens, which are speculated. The MAGACOIN FINANCE project is building a robust ecosystem with its own use cases and a strong community base. Due to its limited supply and speedy fundraising milestones, it has already emerged as one of the hottest projects in the early stages of 2025. Investors speak of rapid sellouts in its presales. According to experts, presales that exhibit this momentum usually deliver extraordinary returns post listing on exchanges. Many retail investors are looking at MAGACOIN FINANCE as their next big shot at exponential gains after having missed the early runs from SHIBA INU or Solana itself. If projections hold true, even a small sum of money today could deliver life-changing returns over the next 12-18 months. Altcoin Market Outlook The larger altcoin market is showing bullish indicators too. The Altcoin Season Index remains elevated at 68/100 implying that traders are rotating from Bitcoin dominance into alternative tokens with high upside. On-chain metrics show liquidity is circulating across networks. Activity is increasing in both the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems. There is renewed interest in XRP. Trading in the derivatives market has also picked up pace as the open interest and turnover has registered a significant rise indicating heavy speculation as investors position themselves for further upside. If Bitcoin can hold above $120,000, most analysts believe the altcoins will likely continue outperforming through Q1 2026. Conclusion The bullish market is conducive for both old and new cryptocurrencies to flourish. XRP and Solana are capturing the attention of whales and institutions, solidifying their place as core assets in this cycle. At the same time, retail investors seeking larger profits are taking notice of MAGACOIN FINANCE and it is quickly growing as a popular choice. With estimates indicating ROI of up to 55x, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings the kind of euro upside few tokens offer. The diverse strategies that XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are utilizing have given investors multiple opportunities in 2025’s historic bull run.

Read between the lines, they won’t tell you.” He argued that SWIFT’s Chief Innovation Officer, Tom Zschach, is restricted from openly discussing XRP’s role due to confidentiality obligations. “It’s clear that he’s under NDA. He knows exactly what XRP is and its magnitude, but he’s not allowed to talk about it,” UnknowDLT stated. The post also captioned a screenshot showing a potential settlement flow involving Corda, SWIFT gpi, and XRP as an example of cryptocurrencies. For many in the XRP community, this serves as further support that XRP could become an integral part of SWIFT’s future settlement processes , or potentially take over the market. This is Swift's CIO's response to my tweet. It's clear that he's under NDA. He knows exactly what XRP is and its magnitude, but he's not allowed to talk about it. Swift will integrate XRP. Read between the lines, they won't tell you. https://t.co/NjsAw13TpD pic.twitter.com/RiWVE5brBK — {x} (@unknowDLT) October 3, 2025 Context of the Exchange The remarks came after a direct interaction between UnknowDLT and SWIFT’s CIO on X. In response to SWIFT’s latest collaboration with ConsenSys on Linea , UnknowDLT argued that such partnerships “do not move liquidity, only data.” He added that XRP is the asset capable of solving the liquidity problem and insisted, “Swift will integrate XRP, I have no doubt about that.” Zschach expressed confusion in his reply , and UnknowDLT’s follow-up post argued that SWIFT’s executives recognize XRP’s importance but are unable to speak about it directly. The Argument on Liquidity The foundation of the XRP community’s perspective is that global cross-border payments require a liquidity solution , not just improvements in messaging or interoperability. While SWIFT has engaged in blockchain initiatives through partnerships with firms like ConsenSys, these efforts, in the view of XRP supporters, do not resolve the liquidity challenge that slows and complicates international transfers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 UnknowDLT’s statement that Linea and similar projects “do not move liquidity, only data” reflects this core belief. XRP is presented as the asset uniquely designed to bridge currencies and deliver real-time settlement with on-demand liquidity, something its advocates maintain is essential for SWIFT’s long-term modernization. SWIFT’s Current Direction SWIFT itself has emphasized innovation in areas such as tokenization, interoperability across ledgers, and enhancing its gpi service. SWIFT has made no official announcement regarding the integration of XRP. Nonetheless, the conviction within the XRP community remains firm. UnknowDLT’s comments reflect the continued belief that XRP will ultimately be indispensable to the transformation of global settlements , regardless of the partnerships SWIFT pursues in the present.

As bitcoin (BTC) trades in uncharted territory near record highs, traders may be searching for cues on what comes next, especially key levels that could act as magnets or resistance points. Here are three important levels worth watching closely. $126,100 This level represents the upper boundary of the broadening or expanding range pattern that has been developing since mid-July. The potential resistance is defined by the trendline connecting the July 15 and Aug. 14 highs. A reversal from this level could trigger a corrective pullback down toward the lower boundary of the range, represented by the trendline drawn from the Aug. 3 and Sept. 1 lows. $135,000 A breakout from the expanding range would shift focus to $135,000, where market makers currently hold a net long gamma position, according to activity in Deribit-listed options tracked by Amberdata. When market makers are net long gamma, they tend to trade against the market direction – buying on dips and selling on rallies – to maintain their overall market-neutral exposure. Other things being equal, this hedging activity tends to dampen price volatility. In other words, the $135,000 level could act as a resistance on the way higher. $140,000 Lastly, $140,000 stands out as key level, as data from Deribit shows the $140,000 strike call is the second-most popular on the exchange, holding a notional open interest of over $2 billion. Notional open interest refers to the dollar value of the number of active or open options contracts at a given time. Levels with large concentrations of open interest often act as magnets, drawing the price of the underlying asset toward them. A high open interest in call options suggests that many traders expect the spot price to approach or top that level. At the same time, those who have sold these calls, often large institutions, have an incentive to keep the price below that strike. Their hedging and trading activity around that level can create resistance, making it harder for the price to break through.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Options|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-05 06:09:07

(October 5),https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/05/crypto-market-rally-why-are-altcoins-going-up-today-october-5/,"A crypto market rally is intensifying today, Oct. 5, as Bitcoin price jumped to a record high and the valuation of all coins hit $4.26 trillion. The Bitcoin price rally has led to more upside among other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, and Stellar. Crypto market rally boosted by Bitcoin surge The first main reason why the crypto market rally is happening is that the Bitcoin price is in a strong surge and is sitting at its all-time high. BTC price soared to a record high of over $125,000 for several reasons, including the robust ETF inflows and its safe-haven appeal rises among investors. Bitcoin has also been boosted by the ongoing supply and demand dynamics. BTC has a supply limit of about 21 million coins and is seeing robust demand from American institutional investors. It is common for altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP to jump whenever Bitcoin is in a strong rally. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts The other catalyst for the BTC and the crypto market is that the Federal Reserve has embraced a more dovish sentiment in the past few months. Jerome Powell and his committee decided to cut interest rates in the last meeting in September. It brought the benchmark rate to between 4.00% and 4.25%. Also, the bank hinted that it will cut interest rates in the coming meeting. Odds that the bank will cut rates jumped last week after the government shutdown happened. The odds then increased after ADP published weak jobs numbers last week. This report showed that the economy lost over 36,000 jobs in September. Another report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that there are now more jobless people than there are vacancies. Soaring Crypto Fear and Greed Index and Uptober rally The crypto market is going up as investors embrace a risk-on sentiment. One of the signs for this is that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has jumped to 58 and will likely hit the greed zone of 60 soon. It is common for cryptocurrencies to jump when investors are greedy. The greed sentiment is rising as investors predict that a Uptober rally will happen. Uptober refers to a situation where the crypto market experiences positive returns in September. Increasing ETF inflows and potential approvals Meanwhile, the crypto market is thriving as investors focus on the ongoing ETF inflows. Data shows that Bitcoin ETFs added over $3.2 billion last week. Spot Ethereum ETFs added over $1 billion in assets and are now nearing their $15 billion milestone. At the same time, investors anticipate that the SEC will approve several spot ETFs like Solana and XRP in the coming weeks. The post Crypto market rally: Why are altcoins going up today?

CAKE tests key support at $3.45 and $3.25 after rejection at $3.70 On-chain volume spikes and net buyback/burns support liquidity and long-term strength Break above the descending trendline would signal renewed buyer control and a move toward $4.00 PancakeSwap (CAKE) price outlook: watch $3.45 and $3.25 demand zones; monitor trendline break for upside. Read on for trade levels and on-chain context. (Act now to reassess positions.) PancakeSwap (CAKE) faces short-term weakness near $3.55 after rejection at $3.70, with buyers monitoring support at $3.45 and $3.25. PancakeSwap (CAKE) pulled back from $3.70 and is testing strong demand zones near $3.45 and $3.25 amid sustained market interest. The technical structure remains bullish, as traders anticipate a breakout above the descending trendline could trigger another move toward the $4.00 region. Record trading volumes and ongoing token burns reinforce CAKE’s liquidity strength and dominance within the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. PancakeSwap (CAKE) price is moderately weak after attempting a push towards the $3.70 zone. The token is now consolidating near key short-term support zones, with traders assessing potential continuation signals. What is the PancakeSwap (CAKE) price outlook after the $3.70 rejection? PancakeSwap (CAKE) price has pulled back from $3.70 and is testing demand near $3.45 and $3.25. If one of these levels holds, the market structure remains bullish and a break above the local downtrend could send CAKE toward $3.85–$4.00. How are traders using the $3.45 and $3.25 demand zones? Traders view the retracement as a healthy consolidation. The $3.45 and $3.25 zones acted as breakout points during the prior rally. A sustained bounce from either zone would preserve higher lows and increase the probability of a trendline breakout. Market observer ZYN noted that keeping price above these regions retains the bullish structure. Short-term momentum indicators on the 1-hour chart show a descending pattern of lower highs, so a break of the downtrend is required for conviction. $CAKE showing some weakness after the push to $3.70. Price is now pulling back, testing lower support zones around $3.45 and $3.25. As long as it holds one of these levels, structure stays bullish and continuation remains on the table. Break above the local downtrend line… — ZYN (@Zynweb3) October 4, 2025 ZYN highlighted that a bounce at $3.45 could spark renewed buying that pushes price back above the downtrend line. That setup would open a path for a retest of $3.70 and a move into the $3.85–$4.00 range should volume pick up. What on-chain data supports CAKE’s outlook? On-chain metrics point to elevated participation. Analyst JW observed the largest trading volumes in CAKE’s history, surpassing peaks from 2021, alongside buyback and burn activity that now outpaces emissions. JW also emphasized CAKE’s role within the BNB Smart Chain as a liquidity leader. The combination of strong volumes, reduced net supply pressure, and ecosystem positioning supports the bullish narrative even during short-term pullbacks. I see $CAKE as the most liquid 5x the market has to offer right now: > Largest volumes in history, exceeding volumes set in 2021 when price pushed above $40, currently $3.60 > Total supply in circulation, with buyback/burn exceeding emissions > BSC ecosystem leader Value buy — JW (@JW100x) October 4, 2025 Frequently Asked Questions Is CAKE still bullish after the $3.70 rejection? Yes. CAKE remains in a bullish structure provided it holds one of the demand zones at $3.45 or $3.25. A confirmed break above the short-term downtrend line would increase the likelihood of a move toward $3.85–$4.00. Monitor volume and support reaction. When should traders consider buying CAKE? Traders often look for a clear bounce from $3.45 or $3.25 with increasing volume, or a breakout above the descending trendline. Use tight risk management and confirm moves with on-chain volume and order flow. Key Takeaways Short-term setup : CAKE rejected at $3.70 and is testing $3.45 and $3.25 supports. On-chain support : Record volumes and net buyback/burns bolster liquidity and long-term appeal. Actionable trigger : Break above the local downtrend line or a solid bounce from $3.45/$3.25 are bullish triggers. Conclusion PancakeSwap (CAKE) shows a mixed short-term picture: price weakness after a $3.70 rejection but structural strength if key demand zones hold. Traders should watch volume, support reactions, and a trendline breakout for confirmation.

Dogecoin just saw 40 million DOGE dumped by whales, dragging its price back toward $0.22. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to bleed, slipping 8% in the past week and struggling to hold support at $0.0000115. As these legacy meme coins lose momentum, many holders rotate into a new contender: Little Pepe (LILPEPE). With analysts forecasting potential gains of up to 16,736% by 2026, the project has quickly become one of the most talked-about presales of the year. Why Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Are Losing Steam Dogecoin’s dependence on market momentum has once again shown its downside. A coordinated sell-off of 40 million tokens sent the price tumbling, with support at $0.22 looking fragile. If the psychological $0.20 level is broken, analysts warn that DOGE could fall much further, potentially dragging retail traders into heavy losses. Dogecoin Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Shiba Inu is facing its own troubles. Despite a minor bounce, SHIB remains down over 8% this week and has recently hit its lowest level since early August, around $0.000011. Trading volume has declined by nearly 37%, indicating waning interest from buyers. With RSI in oversold territory but no strong reversal, sentiment remains fragile. For many investors, these signals confirm that SHIB and DOGE may struggle to deliver the life-changing returns they once did. That’s why attention is shifting fast to the new kid on the block. Little Pepe: The Meme Chain Revolution Little Pepe is more than just another meme coin. It is the world’s first Layer 2 blockchain designed entirely for memes, built to solve the problems plaguing earlier projects. Its unique features include: ultra-low fees, near-instant settlement, and anti-bot technology that prevents sniper bots from exploiting launches. It also introduces a zero-tax model and a dedicated Pump Pad Launchpad for meme tokens. Little Pepe has built an ecosystem dubbed the next big crypto revolution, alongside DeFi and GameFi. The presale numbers are proof of demand. The project has raised over $26.34 million, selling more than 16.1 billion tokens within a few months of its launch. Stage 13 is live at $0.0022, more than double the Stage 1 price of $0.001. With two top exchange listings confirmed at launch, early buyers are positioning for significant gains before LILPEPE even hits the open market. Could $LILPEPE Deliver a 16,736% Rally by 2026? Analysts believe the ingredients for explosive growth are all in place. With a completed CertiK audit, a strict vesting schedule , and a roadmap built around scalability and fairness, Little Pepe has the credibility and infrastructure that many meme coins lack. The community is also being rewarded in unprecedented ways. Alongside the ongoing $777K Giveaway, the new Mega Giveaway offers more than 15 ETH prizes to participants from Stages 12 through 17. This combination of trust, incentives, and innovation is fueling one of the fastest-growing presales of the year. The appeal is obvious for Shiba Inu and Dogecoin holders who are frustrated by stagnation. While legacy meme coins battle selling pressure, Little Pepe is offering the kind of early entry opportunity that could turn modest investments into life-changing returns.

With an anticipated rally and a robust presale phase, this new meme coin has captured the attention and wallets of many erstwhile Shiba and Doge enthusiasts. The Current State of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Shiba Inu, once a vibrant part of the meme token frenzy, is now grappling with an 8% decrease in its value over the previous week, touching new lows not seen since early August. Simultaneously, Dogecoin faces its challenges, with a significant dump of 40 million DOGE by large holders, sharply pushing the price down towards $0.22, a precarious position close to critical support levels. Dogecoin Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The Rise of Little Pepe As the older generation of meme coins like SHIB and DOGE wane in both price and community interest, a fresh meme coin named Little Pepe, stylized as LILPEPE, is stepping up, heralded by some as the next big movement in the meme coin ecosystem. The token's developers promise revolutionary features such as ultra-low transaction fees, near-instant settlements, and robust anti-bot measures to ensure a fair trading environment. These improvements address many of the issues that have historically plagued the usability and scalability of blockchain projects centered around memes. Market Reactions and Predictions With a dizzying gain of over 16,736% projected by 2026, Little Pepe is not only drawing the curiosity of typical crypto investors but also of those who have previously engaged with other meme tokens. The transition of investors from Shiba Inu and Dogecoin to Little Pepe is partly due to the latter's dynamic market entry and promising presale numbers, which show a robust uptake among the community.

But as Cardano pushes for bigger use with a possible fund approval, a fun new coin is jumping into the mix, ready to stir up the meme coin scene: Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Here’s a closer look at Cardano’s path in 2025 and why LILPEPE might steal the show with even bigger growth this year. Cardano’s Price Prediction for 2025 and Beyond Heading into 2025, Cardano (ADA) maintains a solid position in the blockchain world, thanks to technological upgrades and interest from major investors. Currently, it’s experiencing some notable growth, with a total value of approximately $29.76 billion. The new Hydra setup boosts speed, and Voltaire enables ADA holders to participate in decision-making, positioning Cardano to handle a larger user base and remain a top player in the blockchain space. A significant development expected for Cardano in 2025 is the potential approval of a fund (ETF) by regulators. If Grayscale’s ADA fund receives the green light, it could attract significant investments from large groups, potentially driving the price of ADA higher. Some estimates suggest that Cardano could climb to between $0.735 and $1.88 by year’s end, depending on market sentiment and the rollout of features like Hydra and the Midnight-Cardano privacy link. Cardano has strong technical roots, but its growth might take longer than fresher, quicker projects. It relies heavily on big investors and tech fixes, which can slow things down in a rapidly changing market.

Cardano has been a long-time player known for its technological rigor and methodical development, whereas Little Pepe is a nascent meme coin with a rapidly growing community and exciting market prospects. The Evolution of Cardano in the Crypto Market Cardano, with its robust technological foundation, continues to innovate with updates such as the Hydra scaling solution and the integration of governance features through the Voltaire upgrade. Heading into 2025, Cardano's market cap is nearly $30 billion, illustrating its significant impact. The potential approval of a Grayscale ADA fund could further catapult its financial standing, with price projections reaching between $0.735 and $1.88. Despite its solid technological base, Cardano's progress is dependent on these technological advancements and institutional investments, which might not appeal to the fast-paced retail market that craves quick gains. Emergence of Little Pepe as a Contender in Meme Coins LILPEPE is gaining traction with its clever market positioning and community-focused strategies. Since its introduction, it has garnered about $26.3 million through presales, paving the way for its potential explosion in the meme coin segment. Little Pepe's no-trade-fee approach and strategic reserve funds signify a well-thought-out entrance into the market. Little Pepe's commitment to community engagement and safety is evident in its promotional strategies and security measures. A notable highlight includes the well-documented whitepaper and the high security score by Certik, reassuring investors of its credibility. Community and Safety: Key to Little Pepe’s Success The meme coin's strategy involves hefty community engagement with initiatives like their $777,000 giveaway, which attracted a massive audience. This kind of marketing not only boosts the coin's visibility but also establishes a loyal user base, essential for the longevity of any meme coin. Moreover, Little Pepe’s safety features and transparency are factors that provide it an edge in a market segment that's frequently scrutinized for security concerns. Comparative Analysis: Cardano and Little Pepe in 2025 While Cardano continues to build on its sophisticated platform, catering to a more tech-savvy and patient investor base, Little Pepe capitalizes on the dynamic meme coin market with its aggressive community engagement and marketing stunts. The question for investors in 2025 would be whether to opt for the steady and promising growth of Cardano or to ride the volatile but potentially more lucrative waves of Little Pepe. Conclusion: Navigating Future Investments in Crypto For those considering investments in cryptocurrency in 2025, the choice between a foundational coin like Cardano and an emerging meme coin like Little Pepe depends on their risk tolerance and investment strategy. Cardano offers stability and a progressive outlook with substantial tech advancements, whereas Little Pepe presents an opportunity for rapid growth powered by its vibrant community and marketing strategies.

Major catalyst: U.S. government shutdown prompted a flight to safe-haven assets, boosting Bitcoin demand. Strong institutional ETF inflows supplied sustained buying pressure and increased market liquidity. October momentum: BTC rose over 30% in October, hitting ~ $125,689 on Oct 5, 2025 (all-time high). Bitcoin price hits $125,000 on Oct 5, 2025 — read concise analysis, causes, and market takeaways. Learn what investors should watch next. What caused Bitcoin’s price to surge past the $125,000 mark today? Bitcoin’s price surged past $125,000 due to a combination of macroeconomic uncertainty from the U.S. government shutdown, accelerated inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, and seasonal October strength. Institutional purchases and retail FOMO compounded into concentrated buying, pushing BTC to a new high near $125,689. How did ETF inflows and macro events combine to lift BTC? ETF inflows created steady, model-driven demand that absorbed available sell-side liquidity. At the same time, the U.S. government shutdown amplified risk-off sentiment across global markets, prompting a partial reallocation from fiat currencies and short-duration assets into perceived stores of value like BTC. Trading volumes and on-chain metrics show elevated deposit and withdrawal activity consistent with sustained buying. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-price-125k-oct-5-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Price Surges Past $125,000 Amid U.S. Government Shutdown and ETF Inflows"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin price hits $125,689 on October 5, 2025 as ETF inflows and macro uncertainty drive a flight to safety.

Predicting exact levels is speculative. Short-term targets will depend on continued ETF demand and macro developments. Traders typically watch psychological levels and liquidity bands; analysts reference previous resistance near $140k–$160k as possible future targets if inflows persist. Is this rally driven by retail or institutional buyers? Both. Institutional demand via spot ETFs provided structural buying, while retail participation increased during the breakout, amplifying short-term momentum. On-chain data and custody inflows indicate strong institutional allocation alongside elevated retail activity. What risks could reverse the rally? Key reversal risks include a rapid resolution of the U.S. shutdown reducing safe-haven flows, sudden ETF outflows, regulatory actions, or liquidity shocks in major exchanges. Market-makers may also tighten spreads, increasing volatility on fast retracements. Key Takeaways Macroeconomic trigger : A U.S. government shutdown prompted a flight to safety, accelerating demand for Bitcoin as a perceived store of value. Structural demand : Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows supplied sustained buying pressure, helping BTC clear prior resistance levels. Actionable insight : Monitor ETF flow reports, macro headlines, and exchange liquidity; consider staged profit-taking and risk controls in the current high-volatility environment. Conclusion Bitcoin’s surge past $125,000 on October 5, 2025 reflects a convergence of macro-driven safe-haven demand and structural ETF inflows. Market participants should remain attentive to ongoing fiscal developments, ETF flow data, and liquidity metrics.

52694751,https://invezz.com/?p=2908548,1759647600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Reddit buzz: best altcoins under $1 for 2025; analysts highlight ADA, VET and a rising star",https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/05/reddit-buzz-best-altcoins-under-1-for-2025-analysts-highlight-ada-vet-and-a-rising-star/,"Crypto fans on Reddit are debating the best altcoins to buy under $1 for 2025, and analysts have spotlighted three names. Cardano (ADA) and VeChain (VET) lead the conversation, but many eyes are shifting to a rising star — MAGACOIN FINANCE — which some are calling the hidden gem analyst pick. Cardano ADA: Can it climb back toward $1.33? Cardano (ADA) is one of the most-discussed projects on Reddit when it comes to the best altcoin to buy lists. Trading near $0.76, ADA is seen as undervalued by several analysts who believe it could climb back above the $1 mark in 2025. Analyst Arman Shaban pointed out that Cardano is hovering in a critical trading zone between $0.68 and $0.78. If it holds this level, ADA could begin a recovery with milestones at $0.85, $0.95, and $1.00. Longer-term t argets go as high as $1.33, provided market conditions stabilize. Other analysts, including Ali Martinez, have highlighted that ADA often follows historical patterns, with the possibility of reaching $3 or even higher later in the cycle. Still, the short-term picture depends on whether buyers can keep it above key levels. Despite recent struggles, ADA’s community remains active, and its long-term roadmap continues to attract attention. For Reddit users building a diversified list of best altcoins to buy , Cardano often makes the cut because of its history, liquidity, and established ecosystem. VeChain VET: The supply chain altcoin eyeing $1 VeChain (VET) is another analyst pick in the Reddit conversation about the best altcoin to buy under $1. Currently priced around two and a half cents, the idea of VET reaching $1 might sound far-fetched, but its focus on enterprise adoption gives it a unique path. VeChain solves real-world problems, particularly around supply chain management and sustainability. Walmart China uses it to track food, while auditors like PwC and DNV rely on its blockchain to verify corporate claims. Its two-token system separates daily costs (VTHO) from the value token (VET), making it easier for businesses to use without worrying about wild price swings. Recent upgrades, such as the Galactica and PoA 2.0 improvements, have strengthened the network. With new regulations in Europe pushing companies to back up their green commitments with real data, VeChain’s tools are gaining fresh relevance. For Reddit users exploring best altcoins to buy , VET’s mix of partnerships and long-term adoption stories keeps it on the list, even if reaching $1 requires massive growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Reddit’s rising star analyst pick Among Reddit’s debates on the best altcoins to buy , a new name is breaking through — MAGACOIN FINANCE . Unlike ADA and VET, which are already in the billion-dollar zone, MAGACOIN sits under $0.005, giving it room for rapid multiples if adoption increases. Analysts describe it as a hidden gem because it has real DeFi features. Its smaller cap makes it attractive for those looking beyond the old guard like ADA and VET, offering a new opportunity to diversify into a coin still early in its journey. Final thoughts: Diversify with old and new picks For those watching Reddit threads and analyst opinions on the best altcoins to buy , ADA and VET bring stability and history. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE adds fresh upside at a far lower entry point. Traders who want to balance old giants with new opportunities may want to explore further.

Pepe trades at $0.00000994, showing consolidation and potential for rapid gains. Shiba Inu is at $0.00001250, with short-term rallies tempered by whale activity and resistance levels. Amid this volatility, investors are looking for crypto with real utility and growth. Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a leading PayFi altcoin, offering verified security, a live wallet beta, and cross-border payment solutions, making it the best crypto to buy now. Pepe: Consolidation and Potential Breakout The cryptocurrency market is heating up in 2025, with meme coins like Pepe and Shiba Inu showing renewed activity. Pepe is currently priced at $0.00000994, and analysts are watching closely for a potential rally of over 100% as the price consolidates. Whale activity has caused some short-term selling, but the strong community and token burns, around 1.5 billion PEPE tokens burned last quarter, are helping support the price. Overall, PEPE recently outperformed some rivals during a meme coin rotation. Shiba Inu: Resistance Challenges and Market Recovery Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00001250 and has faced mixed signals. The short-term price movements are positive, with SHIB rising slightly over 24 hours. On the other hand, the long-term trends remain uncertain. The Shibarium platform has been restored after a $4 million bridge exploit, with security improvements like rotating validator keys and moving contracts to secure wallets. Token burns continue, with a recent 338% increase removing 410 million SHIB tokens. Despite these measures, whale activity and resistance around $0.0000128–$0.000013 remain key factors for price movement. Remittix: The Best Crypto To Buy Now While meme coins generate excitement, Remittix stands out as a trending altcoin with long-term growth potential. Remittix has raised over $27 million, sold over 674 million tokens, and is currently priced at $0.1130.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/expert-to-investors-buy-5000-xrp-asap-heres-why/,"Levi Rietveld, creator of Crypto Crusaders, recently delivered a strong message to the XRP army. In a video shared on X, he emphasized the need for individual investors to take immediate action, giving them multiple reasons to acquire at least 5,000 XRP before the end of the month. BUY 5000 #XRP ASAP pic.twitter.com/XCmVTVf8qq — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 3, 2025 Banks Face a Competitive Shift Rietveld linked his comments to a growing awareness within global banking institutions. He stated that world banks are beginning to realize they need XRP for cross-border payments and tokenization of real-world assets. He argued that this adoption will not only accelerate but also create major cost advantages. According to him, the banking sector could achieve savings estimated between $636 billion and $740 billion each year by adopting the XRP Ledger (XRPL) instead of relying on traditional systems like SWIFT. The reasoning is straightforward. A bank that embraces the efficiency and lower costs of XRP gains a structural advantage over competitors who remain with legacy networks. As Rietveld put it, if one bank adopts these systems while others do not, the early mover gains “one of the largest competitive advantages you can possibly ever hope for.” His view is that this incentive will push widespread institutional adoption . The Role of Major Partnerships A development that Rietveld connected to his argument is the recent collaboration between Securitize, BlackRock, and VanEck on XRPL. Securitize is already a key player in the tokenization of traditional financial instruments. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund and VanEck’s VBILL fund, both tokenized offerings, have begun integration with Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD. Through Securitize, investors in these funds can now redeem shares for RLUSD on-chain, a move that strengthens the infrastructure for tokenized assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This partnership represents a practical step toward embedding institutional-grade financial products directly into blockchain systems tied to the XRPL. Why Immediate Action Is Necessary Rietveld’s central message remains focused on timing. He told his audience that they will “need at least 5,000 XRP before the end of this month.” XRP is known for fast and aggressive moves , and Rietveld is advising investors to join the market or increase their holdings as soon as possible. He reinforced the argument that XRP is moving from potential to practical application with major partnerships and growing Institutional involvement. The urgency of his call reflects both confidence in XRPL’s role in the financial sector and recognition that opportunities can shift quickly once adoption accelerates.

Ethereum’s ADX broke a seven-year trendline while the green DI crossed above red, confirming a shift in long-term bullish strength. The RSI breakout from a multi-year downtrend mirrors pre-2020 rally patterns, signaling renewed market confidence and building momentum. Holding above the 21-month SMA and long-term trendline suggests Ethereum’s structure supports continued growth aligned with broader market optimism. Ethereum is showing a combination of bullish technical signals not seen in years. On the monthly chart, momentum indicators, trend structure, and long-term moving averages all point to a market transition that could redefine its broader trend direction. What is the Ethereum momentum breakout and why does it matter? The Ethereum momentum breakout refers to the simultaneous monthly ADX breakout, green DI crossing above red, and RSI clearing a long-term resistance while price remains above the 21-month SMA. These conditions increase the probability of a sustained bullish phase and attract renewed capital flows into ETH. How did ADX and directional indicators confirm the shift? On the monthly timeframe, the Average Directional Index (ADX) finally pierced a downward trendline that had limited trend strength since 2017. The green directional indicator crossing above the red confirms buying pressure superiority, a setup historically linked to multi-month advances. Plain text source mentions: Crypto Crew University highlighted the ADX trendline breach as a key signal. This alignment of ADX and DI on a monthly chart is rare and typically precedes extended trend expansion. How does the RSI breakout compare to past cycles? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) cleared a multi-year descending resistance, a behavior that mirrored pre-2020 accumulation phases. In prior cycles, similar RSI breakouts aligned with the start of extended bullish runs lasting several months to over a year. RSI momentum suggests investor conviction is improving, often translating into larger inflows when macro liquidity conditions are supportive. What role do support levels and moving averages play? Ethereum holding above the 21-month Simple Moving Average (SMA) and a long-term rising trendline preserves the structural integrity of the upswing. These levels act as key technical support; a sustained hold increases the likelihood of further gains. Market analyst Mikybull Crypto noted that Ethereum’s behavior is tracking the Russell 2000 Index, which recently reached a multi-year high. Historically, such cross-market correlation hints at broader liquidity expansion benefiting altcoins. How should traders interpret this setup? Traders should view the setup as a conditional bullish edge: confirmation comes from continued ADX strength, RSI momentum, and price staying above the 21-month SMA. Risk management remains essential—use clear stop levels below major support zones to guard against trend failures. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is this a confirmed long-term breakout for Ethereum?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The monthly ADX and RSI breakouts plus holding above the 21-month SMA provide strong evidence of a structural shift, but confirmation requires sustained price action above key supports and continued momentum indicators."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What technical levels should traders watch for ETH?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Traders should monitor the 21-month SMA, the long-term rising trendline, and momentum readings on monthly ADX and RSI.

Monthly ADX breaking its long-term downtrend, green DI crossing above red, RSI clearing a multi-year resistance, and price holding above the 21-month SMA together suggest Ethereum has likely completed a corrective phase and may be entering a new bullish cycle. How long could the bullish phase last if confirmed? Past instances of similar monthly breakouts have led to bullish phases lasting several months to over a year, but duration depends on macro liquidity, market participation, and on-chain metrics supporting sustained inflows. Key Takeaways ADX confirmation : ADX and DI alignment signal renewed long-term strength. RSI breakout : RSI clearing multi-year resistance mirrors prior pre-rally patterns. Structural support : Holding above the 21-month SMA and trendline is critical for continuation; manage risk below these levels. Conclusion Ethereum’s monthly chart presents a compelling technical case for renewed upside: an Ethereum momentum breakout driven by ADX, RSI, and key moving averages. While historical precedents favor continued gains, traders should combine this technical evidence with disciplined risk management and monitor macro liquidity signals for confirmation. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret an Ethereum monthly breakout"", ""description"": ""Simple steps to evaluate a monthly breakout in Ethereum using ADX, RSI, and moving averages."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm ADX and DI alignment"", ""text"": ""Check monthly ADX has broken its downtrend and the green DI is above the red DI to confirm rising trend strength."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Verify RSI breakout"", ""text"": ""Ensure RSI clears its multi-year descending resistance to signal momentum expansion."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess price vs moving averages"", ""text"": ""Confirm price holds above the 21-month SMA and key rising trendlines; place protective stops below these levels."" } ]}",Analysis|Ethereum|News|ETH,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-05 07:06:02

This lead is driven by $2B in new stablecoin inflows, major upgrades (Alpenglow, Firedancer) and sharply higher trading throughput and lower fees. Market share: Solana holds ~95.6% of tokenized stock trading volume. Drivers: $2B stablecoin inflows, Alpenglow and Firedancer upgrades, and record trading volumes. Competitors: Gnosis ~1.98%, Ethereum ~1.8% (Source: Solana Floor, Vaneck, Token Terminal). Solana tokenized stock trading dominance leads markets; learn why SOL surged and what comes next — read on for data-backed analysis and action items. How dominant is Solana in tokenized stock trading? Solana dominance in tokenized stock trading is pronounced: Solana accounted for approximately 95.6% of tokenized-stock trading volume over the last 30 days, with daily market share rarely dipping below 89% aside from a brief 26 September drop. That share outpaces Gnosis and Ethereum by a wide margin. What drove Solana’s lead in tokenized assets? Multiple measurable factors propelled Solana ahead. The network saw roughly $2 billion in new stablecoin inflows in September, lifting stablecoin balances to about $14.3 billion and capturing a 60% share of tokenized stock trades, according to Vaneck and on-chain tallies. Technical upgrades — notably Alpenglow and Firedancer — increased throughput and stability, improving settlement times and reducing fees. These operational gains attracted institutional liquidity and high-frequency trading activity, reflected in multi-month highs for SOL trading volume (Source: Token Terminal). Solana Floor data shows SOL’s tokenized-stock share stayed above 89% on most days, underscoring persistent trader preference for speed and low-cost execution over alternative chains in this specific market niche. Source: Solana Floor A standout September for Solana September’s inflows and network upgrades were central. Vaneck’s September analysis and on-chain reports both highlighted Solana’s outsized gains in tokenized equities issuance and trading activity. Stablecoin inflows of ~$2 billion in a single month increased liquidity available for tokenized stock trades and helped push Solana’s total tokenized-stablecoin pool to about $14.3 billion. That liquidity concentration supports deeper order books and tighter spreads for tokenized assets. Upgrades like Alpenglow (throughput optimizations) and Firedancer (performance improvements) targeted reliability and latency — two attributes large traders prioritize for high-volume derivatives and tokenized-equity operations. Trading volumes climb to multi-month high On-chain metrics and exchange-level reporting show SOL trading volumes reached multi-month highs during this period. Lower transaction fees and faster settlement times contributed to renewed investor confidence. Developers and market participants cited improved infrastructure and reduced friction as reasons for increased listing and trading activity in tokenized securities markets. Market watchers emphasize that execution quality and cost remain decisive variables for liquidity migration between chains. Source: Token Terminal What’s next for SOL? Solana’s near-term outlook in tokenized equities is tied to continued liquidity flows, issuer adoption and maintenance of low-cost, high-throughput execution. If stablecoin liquidity and trading activity persist, demand for SOL could remain elevated for network fees and staking-related utility. Rivals such as Ethereum and Gnosis retain development roadmaps aimed at scaling and cost reduction. Planned Ethereum scaling upgrades and cross-chain liquidity solutions could reduce Solana’s advantage over time, so continued technical iteration will be critical for SOL’s market position. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much of tokenized stock trading does Solana control?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Solana controls approximately 95.6% of tokenized stock trading volume over the past 30 days, according to Solana Floor data."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What factors drove Solana's market share in September?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key factors include about $2 billion in new stablecoin inflows, Alpenglow and Firedancer upgrades improving throughput, and record trading volumes that favored low fees and fast settlement."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Could other blockchains catch up to Solana in tokenized stocks?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Solana’s ~95.6% share eclipses Gnosis (~1.98%) and Ethereum (~1.8%) in tokenized stock trading volume for the past 30 days, per Solana Floor and supplementary market reports. Why did stablecoin inflows matter for tokenized stocks? Stablecoin inflows provide the settlement medium and liquidity for tokenized-stock trading. The influx of ~$2B in September increased available capital and improved depth, reducing slippage for large trades. Key Takeaways Dominant market share : Solana reached ~95.6% of tokenized-stock trading volume over 30 days. Liquidity and upgrades : ~$2B stablecoin inflows and upgrades (Alpenglow, Firedancer) strengthened network appeal. Outlook : Sustained liquidity and ongoing technical iteration are required for Solana to maintain this lead as competitors scale. Conclusion Solana’s dominant position in tokenized stock trading is supported by measurable liquidity gains and targeted performance upgrades. While current data points to SOL’s strength in this niche, continued monitoring of stablecoin flows, upgrade rollouts and competitor scaling efforts is essential.

Selig, who currently serves as general counsel on the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Crypto Task Force, is expected to be formally nominated soon. A source familiar with the matter said in a statement that “Selig's candidacy could be announced at any time.” Many in the cryptocurrency industry support Selig's appointment. Alluvial COO and former corporate lawyer Evan Weiss shared on his X account, “Selig, who currently leads the SEC's Crypto Task Force, has delivered the most effective work of any major regulator. If we want the US to be the crypto capital, Mike is the right person to lead the CFTC.” Expressions of support for Selig also came from several crypto lawyers and lobbyists after Politico reported on his candidacy on Thursday. Related News: Claims Spread That XRP Spot ETF Was Automatically Approved: How True Is It? Before Selig's name surfaced, former Trump administration nominee Brian Quintenz had been a frontrunner to lead the CFTC. However, Quintenz, who serves as policy director at Andreessen Horowitz's (a16z) cryptocurrency unit, was blocked by Gemini exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The Winklevoss brothers privately conveyed their concerns about the seven-year CFTC investigation into Gemini, which concluded this year, to Quintenz. Quintenz, in turn, shared these messages publicly, stating that “they are clear about what they want and refuse to make any promises.” Following this development, Quintenz's candidacy was shelved. Selig, previously an associate attorney at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, is a longtime advocate for the crypto industry. Prior to Trump's November 2024 victory, he was a frequent critic of former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's “regulation by enforcement” approach. Related News: Claims Spread That XRP Spot ETF Was Automatically Approved: How True Is It? “The election is a week away, Bitcoin has surpassed $71,000, and Gensler will soon be vacating his office. It's time for the SEC to embrace crypto again,” he wrote in an October 2024 post. Selig, who was appointed general counsel to the SEC's 14-person Crypto Task Force in March, also serves as a senior advisor to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins. Atkins' “Project Crypto” initiative, announced in July, aims to transition capital markets to a blockchain-based structure. Interestingly, Cameron Winklevoss, one of the Winklevoss brothers, recently described the project as “one of the most groundbreaking initiatives I’ve read about in a long time.” *This is not investment advice.

Avalanche Treasury targets a $1B AVAX reserve and has secured roughly $460M ahead of a $675M SPAC listing. AVAX DEX volume spikes to $791M, exchange outflows drop, Avalanche Treasury readies SPAC move — read the latest analysis and what traders should watch next. What is driving the recent AVAX DEX volume spike? AVAX DEX volume climbed to roughly $791.45 million in a 24-hour window, driven by increased trading on automated market makers and a rise in smart contract activity. This surge reflects strong on-chain liquidity and elevated user interaction across Avalanche-based decentralized exchanges. How did exchange flows change and what does negative netflow mean? Exchange netflows shifted from positive inflows mid-September to negative readings after 22 September, with outflows approaching -$10 million. Negative netflow typically signals reduced selling pressure on centralized venues and may support price stabilization when withdrawals outweigh deposits. Analyst-tracked inflow spikes between 10–13 September—around +$11M and +$12M—preceded distribution phases, then reversed as holdings moved off exchanges. Early October data continued to show slightly negative netflows, indicating constrained exchange-based sell pressure. How has AVAX price reacted to flows and liquidity changes? AVAX price traded between $24.88 and $37.11 during the observed period. After initial inflows, AVAX dipped under $30 before recovering toward $37 on 19 September, then settled around $30–$31 by early October. Reduced exchange balances aligned with narrower trading ranges and more subdued volatility. Why does the Avalanche Treasury SPAC plan matter for AVAX? Avalanche Treasury Co. announced plans for a $675M SPAC listing with Mountain Lake Acquisition and aims to build a $1 billion AVAX reserve, with approximately $460M reported secured. Such capitalization can attract institutional interest and create a persistent buy-side catalyst for AVAX liquidity. Source: Coinglass What do smart contract deployments reveal about network health? Smart contract deployments on Avalanche reportedly tripled year-over-year, indicating sustained developer activity and growing on-chain utility. Increasing contract counts support higher DEX throughput and are consistent with rising AVAX DEX volume and protocol-level usage. How should traders interpret DEX volume versus centralized exchange flows? High DEX volume reflects active liquidity and on-chain trading, while negative centralized exchange netflows indicate tokens moving off exchanges—often reducing immediate sell pressure. Together, these signals suggest a market with robust decentralized trading but restrained centralized supply for now. Frequently Asked Questions How large was AVAX’s 24-hour DEX volume peak? AVAX DEX settlements reached approximately $791.45 million in a single 24-hour period, positioning Avalanche among networks with top-tier decentralized liquidity during that window. Did exchange outflows cause the price stabilization? Partially. Exchange outflows near -$10M reduced available exchange liquidity, which tends to compress volatility and can help stabilize prices when demand remains steady. What is the Avalanche Treasury SPAC proposal? Avalanche Treasury Co. plans a $675M SPAC listing and aims to build a $1B AVAX reserve, with around $460M reportedly secured, signaling potential institutional interest and treasury-backed token exposure. Key Takeaways DEX Liquidity Surge : AVAX recorded $791.45M in 24h DEX volume, reflecting strong AMM activity. Exchange Netflow Shift : Netflows turned negative after 22 September, with outflows near $10M, indicating less centralized sell pressure. Treasury Moves : Avalanche Treasury’s SPAC plan and $1B reserve target may attract institutional capital and support long-term liquidity.

52695745,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85409,1759651359,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,When Ripple CTO Indirectly Told XRP Holders Not to Sell Early,https://timestabloid.com/when-ripple-cto-indirectly-told-xrp-holders-not-to-sell-early/,"Crypto commentator Jack The Rippler recently drew attention to a post from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, which serves as a cautionary reminder for investors. In his message, Jack emphasized the importance of patience in the digital asset market, using Schwartz’s personal experience with Ethereum to underline the risks of selling too early. Schwartz disclosed that he once sold 40,000 ETH at roughly one dollar per coin to finance the installation of solar panels on a property he no longer owns. While the decision may have seemed rational at the time, the value of that Ethereum surged significantly not long after. The amount he sold would have exceeded $100 million during the market’s rise. This personal anecdote has now been reframed by Jack The Rippler as a warning to XRP holders who may be tempted to take profits prematurely. Remember, David Schwartz indirectly tells you not to sell your #XRP too early. HODL! pic.twitter.com/tOsqCeJhwa — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 2, 2025 Jack The Rippler’s Perspective on XRP Jack linked Schwartz’s past decision to the present outlook for XRP, suggesting that holders should carefully consider the long-term potential of the asset before selling. His post carried a straightforward message: holding XRP may prove to be far more rewarding than short-term gains. According to him, Schwartz’s story illustrates the difficulty of timing markets and the importance of conviction when investing in digital assets with long-term utility. Supporters in the XRP community responded positively to Jack’s message, viewing it as a timely reminder to stay committed despite short-term volatility. For many, Schwartz’s ETH sale represents a vivid example of how quickly value can change in this market. While Ethereum eventually became one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world, Schwartz’s decision demonstrates how even experienced figures in the industry can miss out on extraordinary gains. Community Reactions The post triggered several comments from XRP supporters who resonated with Jack’s point. One user, identified as Capetonian, remarked that in the future, people might look back and recall selling 1,000 XRP at $100 to purchase a car, only to later see XRP valued at $10,000. This perspective aligned with Jack’s message about the dangers of exiting the market too soon. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another community member, XRP Eagle, added that the advice was a valuable reminder to “hold the line,” reinforcing the collective sentiment within the XRP community to remain patient. A Lesson for Investors Jack The Rippler’s use of Schwartz’s story is less about regret and more about reinforcing discipline in the market. The rapid growth of digital assets has repeatedly shown that early exits often come at the cost of massive unrealized gains. XRP, with its ongoing developments and increasing relevance in financial discussions, is seen by many as a digital asset with significant long-term potential. By spotlighting David Schwartz’s experience, Jack The Rippler underlined that even those deeply involved in the industry have faced challenges in managing their holdings. His message to XRP holders is clear: patience could be the deciding factor in realizing the true value of their investment.

With resistance levels approaching and market momentum building, traders are watching closely for the next breakout. Just as technical signals guide XRP’s path, effective communications play a critical role in shaping project visibility. That’s where Outset PR , with its data-driven and cost-optimized strategies, helps crypto businesses capture attention at the right time. XRP Poised for Growth as Price Edges Higher Source: tradingview XRP is trading between $2.71 and $3.01, showing a steady climb. In the past week, its value jumped by roughly 11%, while over the past six months, it's up by nearly 42%. Currently, XRP eyes the $3.16 mark as its immediate challenge, with potential to rise to $3.46 if momentum holds. The 10-day average staying above the 100-day suggests positive sentiment. With market tools like RSI close to a balanced state and MACD showing slight positive vibes, XRP has room to grow. If bullish trends continue, breaching the nearest resistance could yield another double-digit percentage boost on its current price. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Conclusion As XRP eyes new highs and ETF inflows remain in the spotlight, the theme is clear: momentum needs both market confidence and the right narrative. For crypto projects navigating similar turning points, Outset PR delivers that edge—through proprietary tools like Syndication Map, smart syndication strategies, and trusted media relationships. The result is visibility that scales beyond expectations, much like XRP’s potential rally. In both trading and PR, precision and timing make all the difference.

Its strong momentum and volatile trading range suggest that a breakout could be on the horizon. Just as traders rely on key resistance and support levels to gauge the next move, crypto projects rely on precise communication strategies to stand out. That’s where Outset PR comes in, bringing data-driven clarity and performance-based campaigns to ensure messages land at exactly the right moment. Solana Eyes New Heights as Investors Watch Key Levels Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is currently trading between mid to high $100s and low $200s. With a recent weekly gain near 20% and a monthly climb over 10%, Solana shows solid upward momentum. The nearest resistance is just under $260, and breaking through this could mean significant gains. If momentum continues, it might surge toward $305, marking a roughly 30% increase from the current range. However, if the price dips below $167, it could head down to the $120 level. The coin's volatility offers both challenges and opportunities, as recent trends show its potential for nearly doubling in value over six months. PR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results If PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics, which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect. Outset PR replaces vague promises with concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, narratives that emphasize the product-market fit, and performance-based media selection. Clients gain a forward-looking perspective: how their story will unfold, where it will land, and what impact it may create.

Each campaign is calibrated to match the client’s specific goals, budget, and growth stage. This is PR with a personal touch, where strategy feels handcrafted and every client gets a solution that fits. Outset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics. Proprietary Tech That Powers Performance One of Outset PR’s most impactful tools is its in-house user acquisition system. It fuses organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation tactics, enabling clients to appear in high-discovery surfaces and drive multiples more traffic than through conventional PR alone. Case in point: Crypto exchange ChangeNOW experienced a sustained 40% boost in reach after Outset PR amplified a well-polished organic coverage with a massive Google Discover campaign, powered by its proprietary content distribution engine. Drive More Traffic with Outset PR’s In-house Tech Outset PR Notices Media Trends Ahead of the Crowd Outset PR obtains unique knowledge through its in-house analytical desk which gives it a competitive edge. The team regularly provides valuable insights into the performance of crypto media outlets based on the criteria like: domain activity month-on-month visibility shifts audience geography source of traffic By consistently publishing analytical reports, identifying performance trends, and raising the standards of media targeting across the industry, Outset PR unlocks a previously untapped niche in crypto PR, which poses it as a trendsetter in this field. Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. Outset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market One of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. Conclusion As Solana braces for a possible breakout amid ETF speculation, one lesson is evident: timing defines outcomes in both trading and communications. For projects navigating the same kind of high-stakes environment, Outset PR offers a proven advantage. By combining proprietary analytics, tailored strategies, and forward-looking media insights, the agency transforms visibility into measurable growth.

52696223,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=827808,1759651813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52696223.jpeg,California Insurance regulator hits Tesla with enforcement notice,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tesla-hit-enforcement-california-regulator/,"Tesla has been hit with an enforcement action by the California Department of Insurance (CDI) over claims of routinely delaying or denying claims. The enforcement action is coming after years of warnings from the state regulators, according to a new pair of filings. According to its filing , the California regulator claims that Tesla’s insurance arm, along with its partner State National Insurance Company, engaged in what it called “willful unfair claims settlement practices.” These included “egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims in all steps” of the process and “unreasonable denials,” the CDI said. The regulator claims that the attitude of the company has allegedly caused financial harm and distress to policyholders. California Insurance regulator hits Tesla with enforcement notice The California regulator claimed that it first approached Tesla about these issues in 2022, according to the filings. Yet, it claims that the company refused to heed its warnings, and things have gotten worse since then. “In 2025, the Tesla Companies have already had more complaints, more justified complaints, and committed more violations than in the three previous years combined,” the regulator wrote. Tesla and State National could face up to $5,000 in penalties each for “unlawful, unfair, or deceptive act.” The pair could also face up to $10,000 in penalties each for a “willful” act, according to the filings. The companies have been given 15 days to respond to the notice. The enforcement action is expected to have knock-on effects for Tesla. In July, the company was hit with a proposed class action lawsuit over allegations that it purposely delayed and minimized payouts. The CDI, in its filing, wrote that the action undertaken by Tesla may have created a “potential third-party liability exposure.” Tesla created its in-house insurance product in 2019 with a mission to offer cheaper premiums and faster service. However, things got off to a rocky start as the website repeatedly crashed, and when it didn’t, it offered users quotes that far exceeded their expectations. Still, Musk promised users that the product would be revolutionary. CDI says things have gotten worse In the CDI filings, the regulator mentioned that it started noticing issues three years after the product launched. It said the website has a marked uptick in claims-related consumer complaints against Tesla. So, in December 2022, the regulator said it started meeting with Tesla and State National with a view to sorting the issue. The regulator claimed that it discovered that the company’s Head of Claims position had been vacant for months, accusing the company of not reporting the problems it had with handling claims. As a result of these issues, the regulator subjected Tesla and State National to a probationary period where it monitored their combined efforts to reduce these violations for six months. Tesla and State National claimed that they had underestimated the volume of claims and the staffing required to handle them. According to the CDI, the companies promised that they were going to increase hiring to make up for the shortfall. The regulator claimed that it wasn’t until 2023 that the firm eventually hired a new Head of Claims. Through the rest of the year, Tesla and State National reported several improvements in the quality of their claims handling and the resolution of customer issues. However, Reuters published an investigation into Tesla’s insurance arm that same year, showing that things weren’t that rosy. According to the filings, the CDI said it realized in 2024, with the regulator noticing a “significant increase” in both consumer complaints against the firm and “violations of the law.” According to the CDI, things have now gotten worse. Through September 22 of this year, the regulator said it has received 1,481 complaints against Tesla, and identified about 1,969 insurance code violations. In total, the CDI claims that the firm has accumulated 3,000 violations of state insurance law, with most of these happening within the 15 days that the company was supposed to respond to customers.

Leading the charge are Ethereum, continuing to solidify its role as the backbone of decentralized applications, Chainlink, powering real-world connectivity through its oracle network, and Zexpire, an emerging player drawing investor interest with bold growth potential. This dynamic has sparked renewed confidence in the altcoin market, where established projects and fresh contenders are rallying side by side. As Bitcoin holds its ground, the question becomes: how far can these altcoins run, and what does their momentum signal for the broader crypto cycle? Ethereum’s Growing Web: Why the Second-Largest Coin Keeps Leading the Pack Born from a 2013 vision of Vitalik Buterin and launched in 2015, Ethereum has evolved into a bustling digital city where self-executing programs run everything from trading hubs to lending desks. These applications operate without middlemen, and activity fees are settled in Ether, the network’s native currency. In 2022, the platform shifted to an energy-efficient validation method that relies on coin holders rather than power-hungry computers, opening the door to wider participation and greener growth. What sets Ethereum apart is its talent for reinvention. Developers can create their own tokens for voting, payments or stable value, all while riding on Ethereum’s security rails. Congested periods are eased by companion networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon, which batch transactions before sending them back to the main chain, keeping costs and wait times in check. The roadmap still points higher: an upcoming database split into dozens of smaller pieces, called sharding, promises even quicker service and broader decentralization. Chainlink: The Data Bridge Powering the Next Crypto Wave Imagine thousands of independent messengers rushing between the outside world and blockchain networks, delivering weather reports, sports scores, or stock prices so digital agreements can carry out their promises on time. That, in plain language, is Chainlink. Its native token, LINK, fuels the process: projects pay in LINK for reliable information, while node operators lock up the token to prove commitment and earn rewards. By spreading the work across many messengers rather than one central hub, the system keeps data flowing even if a few nodes falter. After soaring to $52.88 in 2021, LINK now trades near $23, a zone where it has lingered for months while Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds reignited enthusiasm across the entire market. Unlike many coins that rely on brand buzz alone, Chainlink sits at the core of fast-growing sectors such as decentralized finance, gaming, and tokenized real-world assets, all of which need trustworthy numbers from beyond blockchain walls. As rivals like Solana and Avalanche battle for transaction speed, they often end up turning to Chainlink’s feeds to settle prices, underscoring the token’s “pick-and-shovel” role in the digital gold rush. No More Losses From Crypto Volatility — Earn From It With Zexpire Crypto's greatest challenge has always been its volatility. Bitcoin can swing hundreds of dollars within hours — trading above $115,000 one day, plunging below $112,000 the next. For most traders, these swings mean painful losses. Zexpire turns that volatility into opportunity. No need to predict if the price will rise or fall: the platform reduces the trade to a binary choice: will Bitcoin stay within a set range today, or break out of it? Get it right, you win. Get it wrong, your loss is capped at the stake. No leverage. No margin calls. No liquidation spirals. Just a clear, fixed-risk play on the one thing crypto always delivers — volatility. $ZX Powers the Volatility Play Every prediction on Zexpire runs on $ZX, the platform's native token. It fuels the gameplay, and holders benefit from discounts, cashback, and governance rights.

Gain Exclusive Access to Zexpire Why $ZX Could Be a Breakout Zexpire directly addresses one of traders' biggest frustrations: losing money to volatility. Instead of punishing them, volatility becomes the core play. Zexpire matches the market as it truly is: fast, wild, and unpredictable. That's why adoption potential is high: traders finally have a way to earn from volatility, not lose because of it. And because every play runs on $ZX, the demand grows with user activity.

Zexpire is the first DeFi platform that turns crypto’s biggest problem—price swings—into pure upside. Instead of trading direction, users make a one-click call on whether Bitcoin stays in range or breaks out that day. Losses stay capped, with no liquidations or margin calls.

In 2027, it will range between $157.24 and $186.72, with an average price of $171.98. In 2031, it will range between $353.78 and $383.26, with an average price of $368.52. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability to support the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

According to an overall analysis, the currency has lost 2.76% of its value today. Technical indicators give bullish signals, but the price charts showcase a bearish market scenario at the time of writing. Why is Hyperliquid down? The cryptocurrency market is shedding, and HYPE is receiving the same sentiment. Moreover, it is encouraging that HYPE marked a new ATH a few days ago, that is, on September 18, 2025. From a broader perspective, the HYPE price decreased to $48.49, losing 2.14% of its total value in the last few hours. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does justify predicting a $50 target. In the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, but if the token maintains its price levels, a rally can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by any time in 2025 once again, as it did in September. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2026. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $137.58. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $383.26, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading higher than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $383.26 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

However, you should note that HYPE is still quite volatile. Negative market sentiment, such as market crashes, could derail the predictions. Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved during this period, reaching above $8 billion, showing significant growth, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February, when the broader trend turned bearish again. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached a high price of $45.57. A month later, on July 14, it marked another all-time high of $49.75, and on August 27, it discovered the $50.99 level with changing market dynamics. On September 18, HYPE achieved its ATH at $59.30, and in October, it is trending near $50.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP|ETH|ALTCOIN|USDC|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ZEC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-05 08:18:54

Bitcoin (BTC) leads the rally as it reached a new all-time high price, while popular altcoins like ZCash (ZEC) spiked by double digits. New Record Following a turbulent end to September, the primary cryptocurrency has kicked off “Uptober” in style, surging by more than $11,000 since the beginning of the month. Just a few hours ago, it surpassed the milestone of $125,000 and reached a new all-time high of approximately $125,500 (according to CoinGecko’s data). Shortly after, it slightly retraced to its current value of $125,000. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The impressive rally could be attributed to several bullish factors, suggesting that the upward momentum may persist in the coming weeks and months, potentially leading to even greater gains. Among those is the seasonal optimism that usually accompanies “Uptober” and the declining supply of BTC stored on crypto exchanges. Recently, the amount of coins held on such platforms plummeted to a seven-year low of less than 2.5 million, signaling that investors are not currently focused on profit-taking but are instead moving their holdings to self-custody methods – a trend that reduces immediate selling pressure. Meanwhile, BTC’s market capitalization soared above $2.5 trillion – the highest point ever. Its dominance over the altcoins stands at around 55%. ZEC on the Run The leading altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE), have followed BTC’s pump by registering daily price increases in the range of 2-3%. ZCash (ZEC) has posted a much more impressive gain of over 20%. Its price is up a whopping 190% on a weekly scale and now trades at roughly $160. On the other hand, Avalanche (AVAX), Cronos (CRO), Internet Computer (ICP), and Worldcoin (WLD) have registered minor declines. The total market capitalization of the sector has spiked by 1.5% and stands at over $4.35 trillion.

Traders are watching a decisive resistance zone at $4,650–$4,700; a clean breakout could push ETH toward $4,900–$5,000, while a rejection may retest support near $4,200. Key resistance: $4,650–$4,700 — tested four times Market cap ≈ $556 billion; 24h volume > $35 billion. Liquidations: $53M wiped out in 24h; shorts ~$37M, signaling easing bearish pressure. Ethereum price rebounds to $4,604; traders eye breakout above $4,650. Read concise analysis of resistance, liquidity data, staking trends, and likely targets. What is driving Ethereum’s rebound to $4,600? Ethereum price climbed back to $4,604 after a 2.3% 24-hour gain, supported by rising on-chain staking and falling bearish leverage. Liquidity data showing $53 million in recent liquidations and higher lows since mid-September indicate strengthening buyer conviction. How likely is a breakout above $4,650? ETH has tested the same descending trendline four times without a clean close above it, creating a critical resistance at $4,650–$4,700. If ETH closes decisively above this zone with elevated volume, momentum typically accelerates toward the $4,900–$5,000 range. Conversely, failure to hold above the channel could prompt a pullback to support near $4,200. Current RSI near 60 suggests healthy momentum without overextension, so watch volume and trendline confirmations closely. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/ethereum-reclaims-4600-traders-eye-breakout"" }, ""headline"": ""Ethereum Reclaims $4,600 as Traders Eye Breakout After Multiple Rejections"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-05T11:17:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-05T11:17:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""creator"": { ""@type"": ""Person"", ""name"": ""Alexander Stefanov"", ""jobTitle"": ""Reporter"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""description"": ""Ethereum climbs to $4,604 with growing momentum.

Over the past 24 hours ETH rose 2.3% to $4,604 and saw about $53 million in leveraged liquidations. Short positions accounted for approximately $37 million of that total, indicating short-squeeze dynamics helped the rebound. What on-chain and technical signals matter now?

Large liquidations—about $53M in 24 hours—likely accelerated the short-term rally. Short liquidation of roughly $37M suggests short-covering boosted upward pressure, reducing bearish liquidity. Will the Fusaka upgrade influence price action? The Fusaka upgrade scheduled for December and rising staking participation are supportive long-term catalysts. These fundamentals can underpin bullish sentiment but do not guarantee short-term breakout success. What should traders watch next? Traders should watch for a daily close above $4,650 with volume confirmation, RSI trajectory, and on-chain staking trends to validate a sustained breakout versus a false rejection. Key Takeaways Resistance tested: ETH has attempted the descending trendline four times; $4,650–$4,700 is critical. Liquidity shift: $53M liquidated in 24h, shorts accounting for $37M, easing bearish pressure. Actionable step: Seek a daily close above resistance with rising volume before assuming breakout continuation. Conclusion Ethereum’s reclaim of $4,600 reflects rising buying interest and reduced short liquidity, but the $4,650–$4,700 zone remains decisive. Monitor daily closes, volume, and on-chain staking metrics for confirmation. Published by COINOTAG on 2025-10-05; follow COINOTAG for timely market updates.

Here’s What 3 AIs Think,https://cryptopotato.com/will-xrps-price-keep-climbing-in-the-week-ahead-heres-what-3-ais-think/,"Ripple’s native token joined the broader market’s rise in the past week or so, surging from $2.70 to $3.10 in just several days. Now, though, the question is what might follow this spectacular rally, and we decided to ask around some AI chatbots for their take. What’s Next for XRP? Following an eventful and somewhat painful September, during which the asset jumped to $3.20 before it crumbled to the critical support at $2.70 on a couple of occasions, its price started to recover at the beginning of the business week that just ended, and especially since October began. In the span of just a few days, XRP went from the aforementioned support to around $3.10, adding roughly 15% of value from bottom to top. It has since settled between $3.10 and $3.00, which is considered a pivotal line for its future moves. ChatGPT also outlined the $3.00 level as key due to its psychological and technical significance. It noted that if XRP manages to turn it into a solid support, its mid-summer bull rally could resume, and the upcoming week could be the beginning of it. The first targets pointed out by the AI chatbot are situated at $3.30 and $3.60, which also align with recent predictions from popular analysts. However, it also warned that XRP could slump toward $2.80 or lower if the $3.00 support cracks. “Given the fresh momentum + importance of $3, I’d lean slightly bullish for Oct 5–12. If $3 holds early in the week, XRP likely targets $3.30–$3.50. But if volume dries up, expect sideways action with risk of slipping back to $2.80.” XRP’s Chances by Percentages Grok was a bit more specific when it came down to determining XRP’s chances for a surge or correction in the week ahead. It noted that the bullish sentiment is predominant at the moment, and set the percentages for a more favorable scenario for Ripple’s token at 50%. Interestingly, its target is similar to what ChatGPT said (and also Gemini): somewhere between $3.30 and $3.60. It ranked the probability of a neutral case at 30%-35%, where XRP would spend the upcoming seven days trading sideways between $2.90 and $3.10. The bearish scenario (20%-25%) sees the asset slipping below $3.00 and falling back to $2.80 or even $2.70, Grok noted. Gemini added that the trading volumes need to pick up the pace, as there were certain situations lately where buyers were falling behind . It also outlined the possibility of a massive surge if spot XRP ETFs are approved by the US SEC in the next several days, but said that seems unlikely.

It praised the progress in the rollout of the Digital Dirham (CBDC) project, as well as its proactive stablecoin regulations. The IMF statement called for modernization efforts to continue including careful assessments of risks while promoting local capital market development. When it came to crypto the IMF statement noted that while the UAE is growing as a global hub for virtual assets, this should be supported by continued strong coordination among regulators to monitor risks and developments. The IMF statement noted, “Ongoing efforts to continue alignment with international regulatory standards and strengthen supervisory capacity are welcome and will be critical to safeguarding financial stability while promoting responsible innovation. We welcome the major efforts under the National AML/CFT Strategy and Action plan that resulted in the recent removal of the UAE from enhanced monitoring under the Financial Action Task Force and encourage continued progress.” UAE increases cooperation in crypto information sharing In September 2025, Cryptopolitan reported that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Ministry of Finance signed a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) and joined the global Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The UAE framework is scheduled to roll out in 2027, after which the UAE is expected to begin sharing data with international tax authorities in 2028. CARF provides an international standard for the automatic exchange of crypto-asset-related information between tax authorities and is part of the global standards in the exchange of information for tax purposes. Close to 70 jurisdictions have committed to implementing CARF, with most preparing for their first information exchange in 2027 or 2028. UAE GDP projected to expand by 4.8 percent in 2025 The IMF praised the UAE’s resilience against global uncertainty and regional tensions, and noted that the financial sector remains strong and sound. It emphasizing that the UAE should monitor external shocks, real estate price developments, and cybersecurity, which is needed. As per the statement , the UAE is projected to grow strongly well above the global average. In 2025, GDP is projected to expand by 4.8 percent 2025, driven by robust non-hydrocarbon growth and a rebound in hydrocarbon output as OPEC+ production increases, accelerating further to 5.0 percent in 2026. It also noted that expansion in tourism, construction, and financial services continues to underpin growth, supported by major infrastructure projects. Inflation is projected at 1.6 percent in 2025 and around 2 percent over the medium term. Housing costs are expected to be the primary source of price pressures, raising potential concerns about affordability, while tradables remain subdued. The IMF also noted that the UAE’s financial sector remains strong and sound, with banks remaining profitable, while the UAE banks’ exposure to the sector has gradually declined to about 18% percent of risk-weighted assets.

In 2021, SHIB turned a small community-driven token into one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world, making early holders fortunes that few could have imagined. Today, with SHIB priced around $0.00001266, the possibility of repeating that explosive growth is much slimmer. That’s why many investors who missed Shiba Inu’s early run are now turning their attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new presale project projected by some analysts to deliver returns as high as 20,000% ROI once it lists on major exchanges. Shiba Inu’s Legendary Run Shiba Inu launched in August 2020 with little fanfare. Marketed as the “Dogecoin killer,” it built momentum through its community, the rise of meme culture, and key exchange listings. By October 2021, SHIB had surged to an all-time high of $0.00008845, representing gains of more than 40,000,000% from its earliest price levels. This rise created overnight millionaires. A $100 investment in SHIB’s early days turned into millions of dollars at the peak, cementing it as one of the most dramatic wealth-creation stories in crypto history. However, that kind of performance is nearly impossible to replicate now that SHIB sits at a multi-billion-dollar market cap. While Shiba Inu has since built a broader ecosystem with Shibarium, staking, and DeFi elements, its potential upside is far more limited than it once was. Investors entering today are unlikely to see the same life-changing gains that early adopters enjoyed. Why Investors Are Looking for the “Next SHIB” The story of Shiba Inu has left investors searching for the next meme-driven rocket ship. Retail traders in particular are drawn to projects where modest investments can potentially deliver outsized returns, something established tokens rarely offer anymore. With Shiba Inu’s best days likely behind it in terms of exponential growth, the hunt for the “next SHIB” has intensified in 2025. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Momentum is Unprecedented MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the hottest presale tokens of 2025, already raising more than $15.5 million from eager early backers. The project has also completed full HashEx and CertiK audits, giving investors additional confidence in its security and legitimacy. What has really sparked excitement is the projected upside. Analysts are speculating that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver returns of up to 20,000%, potentially outpacing Shiba Inu’s early trajectory. That means a $2,500 stake could turn into $500,000 if projections prove accurate. Demand has been so strong that presale rounds have sold out rapidly, fueling FOMO across trading communities. Like SHIB in 2021, MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefiting from viral attention and the momentum of retail-driven hype—key ingredients that often precede explosive price action. Shiba Inu vs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Comparison Community Power: Both SHIB and MAGACOIN FINANCE rely heavily on grassroots enthusiasm. Shiba Inu’s success showed the power of a motivated online community, and MAGACOIN is following a similar path with fast-growing engagement. Market Cap Potential: Shiba Inu is already a multi-billion-dollar asset, which limits its ability to deliver another 1,000x. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, is still early-stage, leaving far more room for exponential upside. Exchange Listings: SHIB’s breakout moment came when it was added to major exchanges. MAGACOIN FINANCE is widely expected to experience a similar surge once listings begin. Security & Audits: Unlike SHIB’s chaotic early days, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already undergone rigorous HashEx and CertiK audits, providing an additional layer of reassurance for investors. Why Timing Matters The biggest lesson from Shiba Inu’s story is that timing is everything. Those who got in early saw unimaginable returns, while latecomers found themselves holding through long stretches of sideways price action or painful corrections. MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its presale phase, meaning this is the earliest stage investors can get involved. If projections of 20,000% ROI materialize, early participants could replicate the kind of success that Shiba Inu’s first holders experienced. For many, it’s seen as a second chance at catching lightning in a bottle. Conclusion Shiba Inu has already made its mark on crypto history, proving that meme coins can deliver generational wealth for early adopters. But at today’s prices, SHIB’s days of exponential growth are likely behind it. That’s why investors who missed Shiba Inu’s early days are flocking to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has already raised $15.5 million and completed full audits. With analysts projecting up to 20,000% ROI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as the top presale of 2025, offering retail traders a shot at life-changing returns once major listings begin. For those searching for the “next SHIB,” this may be the most compelling opportunity of the year.

Community Responds",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-1000-by-2030-community-responds/,"Crypto commentator Jack The Rippler posed a straightforward question on whether XRP could achieve a price of $1,000 by 2030. The post drew a wide range of responses, reflecting both optimism and skepticism within the community. While some argued the possibility exists if specific conditions are met, others dismissed it as unrealistic given XRP’s historical performance. Current price and required growth According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP is currently trading at $3.06, recording an 11% increase over the past week. To reach $1,000, the asset would need to appreciate by approximately 32,579.7% from its present level. That scale of growth illustrates the difficulty of such a projection and sets the stage for why opinions on the matter are so divided. Community Perspectives Jeffrey Payne argued that the outcome is likely binary, stating it would either happen rapidly within a year or not at all. He added that if XRP truly resolves liquidity challenges in a fast, cheap, and secure way, adoption would be inevitable. Jason Leonard focused on the timeline itself, questioning why 2030 is often used as the benchmark. He pointed to the political environment in the United States, suggesting that institutional adoption would need to accelerate before 2028. In his view, the administration of President Donald Trump has an incentive to ensure progress before leaving office. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Crawdaddy offered a more skeptical view, labeling the $1,000 figure unrealistic. He noted that XRP has not surpassed $3.66 in its history and argued that even reaching $5 would be significant. From his perspective, a more effective strategy would be to hold XRP while also exploring smaller projects with greater untapped growth potential. Evaluating the possibility The debate highlights several key points. For XRP to reach $1,000 , it would require massive institutional adoption, significant advancements in global liquidity solutions, regulatory clarity, and broader integration into financial systems. It would also entail a dramatic increase in market capitalization, positioning XRP alongside or above the largest global assets. XRP reaching $1,000 by 2030 remains highly speculative. While some community members maintain it is possible under favorable conditions, others stress that past performance and market realities suggest otherwise. What is clear is that the scale of growth required is unprecedented, and the path forward depends on a combination of technological success, institutional demand, and regulatory developments that remain uncertain.

Global crypto market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The spike coincides with Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) latest surge past its $125,000 record high, fueled by over $3.2 billion in spot ETF inflows, renewed institutional demand, and growing optimism ahead of potential U.S. rate cuts. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency was valued at $124,736, up about 1.8% in the past 24 hours and nearly 14% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Altcoins such as Ethereum , Solana , and XRP also posted modest gains, lifting the broader market higher. Notably, Bitcoin and the wider crypto market are seeing renewed demand as investors seek protection from U.S. policy uncertainty amid the ongoing government shutdown. The flight to safe-haven assets has helped push BTC to new record highs, with traders viewing it as a hedge against fiscal instability. Bitcoin on exchanges plunge Meanwhile, there may still be room for Bitcoin to climb further. The total Bitcoin balance on centralized exchanges has fallen to a six-year low of 2.83 million BTC, according to Glassnode data retrieved on October 4. Bitcoin centralised exchange reserves. Source: Glassnode The last time exchange reserves were this low was in June 2019, when Bitcoin traded near $8,000 during a bear market. This decline suggests more investors are moving their holdings into self-custody or institutional storage, a sign of long-term confidence rather than intent to sell. With fewer coins available on exchanges, the supply that could hit the market is shrinking, a dynamic that often supports higher prices.

According to a recent CryptoQuant report, its Bull Score Index has remained between 40 and 50, matching the range seen at the end of Q3 2024. It is worth noting that this range is considered a threshold zone, with levels above 50 marking a clear shift to bullish territory. In fact, when BTC broke past that point in October 2024, it went on to surge from $70,000 to $100,000 for the first time in its history. Buying Pressure Builds As the new quarter begins, several indicators now point to a supportive environment. A recent CryptoQuant report highlights rising Bitcoin demand, steady stablecoin liquidity, and fewer unrealized gains among market participants, which can limit selling pressure. One key driver of this environment is spot demand, which has been increasing since July and now stands at a monthly pace of more than 62,000 BTC. That expansion is considered a necessary condition for rallies, and it was also present in late 2020, 2021, and 2024. Beyond the spot market, large wallets are also contributing to the trend. Whale holdings are rising at an annual pace of 331,000 BTC, up from 255,000 during Q4 2024 and 238,000 at the start of Q4 2020. This stands in sharp contrast to 2021, when whale balances fell by about 197,000 BTC. Current data suggests accumulation remains firmly above trend and far from contraction levels. Alongside whale activity, institutional demand through the U.S.-based ETFs could also prove influential in the months ahead. During the same quarter last year, ETFs increased their holdings by 213,000 coins, equal to a 71 percent rise. Key Level to Watch The on-chain report suggests that inflows similar to, or larger than, past cycles are possible if conditions align in 2025. Such movements would add to the already strong base of demand across whales and spot markets. Despite this favorable setup, Bitcoin has not yet triggered a breakout. CryptoQuant notes that the key level to watch is the Trader’s On-chain Realized Price, currently around $116,000. Crossing above that threshold would return the apex coin to the “BULL” phase of the Bull-Bear Cycle Indicator. On-chain models place the next potential range between $160,000 and $200,000 if momentum builds The post Bitcoin (BTC) Begins Q4 2025 in a Familiar Bullish Setup: CryptoQuant appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Top News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Bull Run,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-05 09:10:11

Some of this rally is a result of Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) rise over approximately the same time. Riot also has its own accomplishments that drove the stock higher. I think that Bitcoin and Riot will have another strong rally in the final phase of this crypto price cycle. I also see another strong potential opportunity with Riot's efforts to diversify into artificial intelligence/high performance computing [AI/HPC] . Company Background Riot Platforms is a $7 billion market cap, United States-based company that operates primarily as a Bitcoin miner. Riot reports results under two segments: Bitcoin Mining and Engineering. The Bitcoin Mining segment comprised 88% of total revenue for the first six months of 2025. This segment operates large-scale Bitcoin Mining facilities in Rockdale & Corsicana, Texas, and two facilities in Kentucky. The Rockdale facility provides 700 megawatts [MW] of total developed capacity. The Corsicana facility provides 400 MW of capacity. Riot's acquisition of Block Mining in 2024 gave the company another 60 MW of operational capacity in Kentucky. Riot plans to increase the Kentucky capacity to 100 MW in 2025. Riot's Engineering segment comprised the other 12% of total revenue in the first six months of 2025. The Engineering segment handles the designing, manufacturing, and installation of power distribution equipment and other custom electrical-related products. These products/services are provided to large-scale commercial and government-based customers. The markets for this segment include: power generation, data centers, water, utilities, industrial, and alternative energy. Riot has a new potential market opportunity with the development of AI/HPC. The company launched a scalable data center platform to support the development of AI/HPC applications at its Corsicana facility. Riot is also evaluating expansion opportunities for developing additional power capacity to support AI/HPC applications. The focus is to deliver strong risk-adjusted returns. These investments can be a long-term strategic investment in the data center sector. Growth Catalysts Riot should benefit over the long term from the rise in the price of Bitcoin over the long-term. I think there is a good chance that Bitcoin will make a higher-high in the near term, probably over the next couple of months. The price of Bitcoin has been consolidating since hitting its all-time high of about $124,000. We haven't seen the blow-off top yet in this current Bitcoin price cycle. While there is no guarantee that this will happen this time, I do think there is a strong possibility that it will based on past patterns, which have been fairly consistent. The blow-off top is indicated by the RSI indicator reaching extreme overbought levels on the RSI indicator on Bitcoin's monthly chart. Here's how that looks: Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Monthly Price Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) We can see how the price of Bitcoin increased to above 90 on the RSI in each price or halving cycle (in 2017 and 2021). The extreme overbought conditions are illustrated by the green shaded areas above 70 on the RSI indicator in the middle of the chart. The RSI did not yet reach that extreme overbought level yet in the current cycle. So, I think we are likely to see another strong rally that takes Bitcoin to new highs and an extreme overbought level. The price of Riot also tends to rise to extreme overbought levels. Here's how that looks: Riot Platforms (RIOT) Monthly Stock Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) Riot's monthly chart above shows the RSI above the bullish 50 level, but still below the overbought level of 70. This shows the recent positive momentum. The MACD is also showing positive momentum as the blue line crossed above the red signal line and the histogram bars are green and increasing in length. If this price cycle is similar to the previous cycles, the RSI has plenty of room to move higher. It is also worthy to note that Riot's stock price made a higher high from the 2017 cycle to the 2021 cycle. So, it is possible that it makes another all-time high in the current cycle. However, this may not occur in this cycle since Riot has lagged Bitcoin's price so far. Investors should also be aware of the sharp dips that Riot's stock makes after reaching its peaks. The price tends to drop over 90% from the peak to the bottom. So, profit taking at the extreme overbought levels is something to consider. AI/HPC Opportunity The company stated in the Q2 2025 earnings report that its AI/HPC initiative is not a pivot to do an AI/HPC 'deal.' Instead, Riot stated that its initiative was to add new data center capability. The company plans on adding that capability to as much of its power portfolio as possible. As a result, Riot expects this to transform the company in future years. It looks like Riot is aiming to optimize its efficiencies/productivity in its power business by incorporating AI/HPC. If executed effectively, this can give the company a competitive advantage by lowering costs. In a nutshell, Riot's mindset is to monetize its megawatts to use as much of its power portfolio as possible. If the company does decide to do a deal in the future, it could add additional growth. The global enhanced AI/HPC market is expected to grow at about 9.4% annually to reach over $6 billion by 2032 . The drivers for this expected growth include increased adoption of AI and machine learning in research & enterprise applications, demand for high performance data processing, and growth in cloud-based HPC services. The advances in CPUs/GPUs and increased computing demand from the healthcare, manufacturing, finance, and scientific research are also drivers of this expected growth. The Bitcoin Mining Business Riot Platforms plans to utilize Bitcoin mining where it is advantageous. The company also plans to increase its shareholders' exposure to value-accreting assets. Riot currently holds 19,287 Bitcoin on the balance sheet, which is worth $2.35 billion at a price of $122,000 per coin. The balance sheet can grow significantly if the price of Bitcoin continues to grow over the long term as it has in the past. Riot made operational efficiency improvements that rank the company as one of the most efficient operators in the industry. The company also maintains a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Riot's strategy has been to sell the monthly Bitcoin production that it mines to finance ongoing operations. The company also raises funds through a $200 million Bitcoin collateralized financing facility with Coinbase ( COIN ). This financing facility enables Riot to fund multiple growth opportunities while reducing the need to issue stock, which would be dilutive to shareholders. The company acquired additional land around the Corsicana facility. This brought Riot's total footprint in that area to 858 acres, up from 265 acres . The extra land ensures that Riot can fully use its large-scale access to power that they have onsite. Riot recently reported an 8% increase in the amount of Bitcoin produced in September 2025 as compared to September 2024. However, the Bitcoin produced declined 7% from August 2025. Another positive for Riot is that it increased the deployed hash rate by 29% to 36.5 EH/s while the average operating hash rate increased 65% to 32.2 EH/s yoy in September 2025. Power costs increased 19% to 4.2c/kWh over the same period. This demonstrates that Riot processed transactions at a much faster rate as compared to its increase in power costs. The Risks for the Stock Since Riot is highly correlated to the price of Bitcoin, the stock has experienced extreme declines during the crypto bear markets. As I previously mentioned Riot's stock declined by over 90% during the bear crypto markets. This is a larger percentage drop than Bitcoin experiences. Therefore, investors should consider keeping a close eye on the technical aspects of Riot's stock to buy the extreme dips and sell the extreme rips to maximize profits. One recent risk for Riot Platforms has been the inflationary environment and uncertainty regarding tariffs leading to logistics disruptions for miner delivery schedules. This has been driven by constraints in the global supply chains for miners, electrical distribution equipment, and construction materials. Constraints like this could lead to future delays. I should note that Riot is holding many electrical components and materials to develop the Corsicana facility and to expand the Kentucky facility to mitigate the effect of these constraints. There is no guarantee that Riot will be successful with incorporating AI/HPC into its business. The company is currently evaluating the feasibility of developing 600 MW of available capacity at Corsicana. There is no guarantee that a shift to AI/HPC will be feasible. If it is determined to not be feasible, it could lead to a significant sell-off for the stock, as optimism for a successful shift could be partially priced into the stock. Outlook for Riot Platforms I believe that Bitcoin will experience another leg higher in the current price cycle. I originally thought that this price cycle would end in October 2025 based on the length of the previous two cycles . However, it is possible that this cycle runs a bit longer since Bitcoin continues to consolidate near the all-time high. If Bitcoin does experience another leg higher for its price, Riot is likely to join the rise. Riot's stock is currently in a strong uptrend. So, I expect this to continue until the stock shows signs of waning momentum on the RSI and MACD technical indicators. The successful shift to AI/HPC represents a longer-term potential positive catalyst for Riot. If the company finds that AI/HPC is feasible, then the stock could experience better growth in future price cycles.",BTC-USD|RIOT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-05 09:10:50

According to reports, there has been at least one breach each month since the beginning of 2025. South Korea is known for its blazing-fast internet, near-universal broadband coverage, and as a leader in the digital space. The country plays host to global tech brands like Hyundai, LG, and Samsung , among others. However, this success has made the country a prime target for hackers, a development that has exposed how fragile its cybersecurity defenses remain, a move that has seen users call on several companies that have been affected in the past to do better. South Korea’s digital defenses under fire over cybersecurity breaches According to reports, South Korea is currently reeling from a string of high-profile hacks that have targeted companies dealing in services like credit cards, telecoms, tech startups, and even government agencies. In addition, some of these criminals have momentarily branched out of their usual targets, targeting the Korean population at several intervals. In each case, every hack has seen ministries and regulators scramble for help. Some critics have mentioned that the defenses in the South Korean cyber space are hindered by the fragmented system of government ministries and agencies. Local media have also blamed the slow and uncoordinated responses from agencies responsible for looking into these issues. With no clear government agency tasked as the first responder when it comes to cyberattacks, the country’s defenses are struggling to keep pace with its digital ambitions. “The government’s approach to cybersecurity remains largely reactive, treating it as a crisis management issue rather than as critical national infrastructure,” Brian Pak, the chief executive of Seoul-based cybersecurity firm Theori, said. Pak, who also serves as an advisor to SK Telecom’s parent company’s special committee on cybersecurity innovations, noted that because government agencies tasked with cybersecurity work in silos, developing defenses and training workers often get overlooked. Shortage of skilled experts compounds woes Brian Pak also mentioned that the country is facing a severe shortage of skilled workers in the cybersecurity space. “[That’s] mainly because the current approach has held back workforce development. This lack of talent creates a vicious cycle. Without enough expertise, it’s impossible to build and maintain the proactive defenses needed to stay ahead of threats,” Pak added. He added that political deadlock has also helped in pushing the habit of quick fixes after every hack crisis. Pak noted that while these are done, the more challenging and long-term work of building digital resilience continues to be sidelined. This year alone, South Korea has registered a major cybersecurity incident almost every month. The incidents continue to raise concerns over the resilience of digital infrastructure in the country. Some notable incidents include the $6.2 million hack of Wemix, the blockchain arm of Korean gaming platform Wemade, in February, the ransomware attack on Yes24, South Korea’s online ticketing and retail platform, in June, and the phishing attempt against the South Korean military by North Korean-backed hacking group Kimusky via AI-generated deepfake images, in July. Yes24 faced another ransomware attack in August, justifying the concerns that users have shown towards its security. Meanwhile, the South Korean Presidential Office’s National Security has promised to step in to tighten defenses, pushing for a cross-ministerial effort that brings multiple agencies on board in a coordinated, whole-of-government response. Last month, the National Security Office said it would implement “comprehensive” cyber measures through an interagency plan, led by the South Korean president’s office. However, Pak mentioned that the fragmented system leaves accountability weak and places authority in a presidential “control tower,” which could risk “politicization” and overreach.

Analysts now predict that Bitcoin will reach $200,000, Solana could surge to $1,100, and a new meme coin contender, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , is targeting $2 in the upcoming cycle. With institutional flows on one side and retail speculation on the other, the setup could deliver one of the strongest bull runs yet. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Outlook: Institutional Demand Signals $200K Potential Bitcoin is holding near $109,000 after its rejection in August at $118,000. While momentum looks fragile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to attract billions, with inflows now topping $60 billion. This institutional demand gives Bitcoin a new backbone, making historical cycle models unreliable. Bitcoin Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The halving in April 2024 reduced Bitcoin’s inflation rate to less than that of gold, setting up a powerful supply shock. Analysts now suggest June 2026 as the target window for the cycle peak, with projections indicating $200,000 if ETF momentum and global liquidity remain supportive. Solana (SOL) Price Outlook: ETF Optimism Meets Fragile Flows Solana is consolidating at $202, holding above $194 but struggling to retest $218–$220 resistance. The recent Fidelity Solana ETF filing has injected new optimism, prompting analysts to project $234 in the short term and as much as $1,100 in the long term if institutional adoption materializes. Solana Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Despite net outflows of nearly $22 million this week, derivatives activity and positioning by top traders remain bullish. The key level is $218; a breakout would reignite Solana’s uptrend and validate the ETF-driven narrative. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Coin With Real Fundamentals While Bitcoin and Solana dominate institutional talk, the most explosive upside may belong to Little Pepe . Unlike meme tokens that thrive solely on hype, LILPEPE has established a strong foundation to ensure sustainability. Little Pepe isn’t just another frog on the blockchain. Its sniper-bot-resistant EVM chain ensures fair trading at launch, while zero buy/sell tax and near-zero fees create a level playing field for traders. The team has also developed a meme-only launchpad, positioning LILPEPE as a breeding ground for future viral tokens. This differentiates it from other meme plays by turning it into a platform, not just a meme. Over 26M Raised, Why LILPEPE Presale Progresses Sharply The LILPEPE presale has been a breakthrough, with buyers drawn to the fundamentals and the fun. Each stage has sold out quickly, and demand shows no sign of slowing. This isn’t just about early profits. It’s about building a community that sticks. The project has already raised over $26.35 million in presale and sold 16.1 billion tokens, with prices climbing 120% from $0.001 to $0.0022. Its launch price is $0.003, positioning it for immediate upside once live. Adding fuel to the fire, the team has rolled out a $777,000 giveaway, along with a new ETH mega contest that rewards top Stage 12-17 buyers with prizes of up to 5 ETH. These incentives create buzz and strengthen long-term holders ahead of the CEX listings. Meme Power Meets Market Structure The genius of Little Pepe lies in its balance of meme culture and structured tokenomics. On one hand, it taps into the viral energy that made DOGE and PEPE legendary. On the other hand, it enforces safeguards, from vesting to audits, that instill investor confidence. Certik has audited the project, and a strict vesting schedule prevents pump-and-dump risks. These are rare qualities in the meme coin space, and they matter. This combination is rare. Most meme coins blow up and fade; LILPEPE is structured to blow up and sustain. That explains why analysts argue it could mirror the parabolic runs of past leaders while avoiding their pitfalls. LILPEPE Price Prediction: Path to $2 With a launch price of $0.003, analysts see the following trajectory for LILPEPE: Short term: $0.20–$0.30 on intense post-launch hype. Medium term: $0.50–$0.80 as CEX listings and the launchpad gains traction. Long term (complete cycle): Up to $2, aligning with meme coin history and its unique fundamentals. Factors such as new market entrant advantages, CEX listings, and a full-blown meme supercycle would be key to its progress. At $2, that’s a 666x gain from presale levels, the kind of return that turns meme believers into millionaires. Three Different Paths, One Bullish Market Bitcoin anchors the cycle with ETF-driven credibility and a potential run to $200K. Solana is the institutional Layer-1 play, targeting $1,100 with ETF momentum. Little Pepe is the high-upside wild card, with $2 in sight if meme energy collides with its strong fundamentals. For investors, the choice is clear: diversify for stability, but don’t miss the chance to join Little Pepe’s presale now at littlepepe.com , where the next meme legend is already being minted.

With staking activity, technicals, and potential ETF talk in play, the Cardano price outlook holds strong interest. At the same time, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a contender combining utility with high-growth potential. Some investors suggest that a similar $500 allocation in Remittix could generate even greater returns, positioning it as a more aggressive play than ADA within the same period. Cardano Price Outlook and Q4 Potential The Cardano price has held a bottom in the $0.84 zone over the recent trading, and the bulls have held that zone at bay as overall markets wavered. Volume patterns record consistency rather than explosive gains, which can weaken short-term breakout momentum. Still, for a $500 to $50,000 leap in Q4 alone, ADA must rally multiple hundred times, a stretch compared to its size and maturity. Its capital base is large, making a spontaneous 100x return in one quarter very improbable unless a major catalyst, such as ETF approval, arrives. Remittix Is The Alternative Altcoin With Huge Upside Compared to ADA, Remittix places its bet on payment utility, not just protocol fundamentals or staking yields. ADA competes on blockchain strength and network growth, while Remittix competes on real transactions flowing through its rails. That difference gives Remittix a theoretical edge in aggressive growth scenarios and makes it capable of turning $500 into $50,000. Remittix has achieved CertiK verification, the team is fully verified, and the project holds the #1 ranking among pre-launch tokens. Its wallet is in beta testing with community users actively engaged. It offers a 15% USDT referral rewards mechanism, and it launched a $250,000 giveaway. It has secured BitMart and LBank listings after raising above the $20 Million and $22 Million thresholds. To date, Remittix has sold over 674 million tokens, is priced at $0.113, and has raised over $27 million. Here is what gives Remittix the edge: Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Ranked number one among pre-launch tokens Ideal for freelancers, remitters and global earners Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd This difference highlights why many investors think $500 in Remittix could scale faster than ADA. It’s a play on real product adoption, where growing payment utility could deliver stronger compounding gains than ADA’s current trajectory. From $500 to $50,000: Which Crypto Has the Edge in Q4? Choosing a crypto for that kind of return in Q4 means balancing ambition and risk. Cardano price still has room to run, especially with any macro or institutional catalysts, but the scale is tough. Remittix offers a more aggressive bet powered by utility, verification, and traction. Those investing $500 should weigh whether they want a steadier climb or a shot at explosive upside, and Remittix positions itself as that audacious shot.

Dogecoin accumulation surges as whales add 30M DOGE; price eyes $0.27–$0.30 resistance—read COINOTAG’s expert breakdown and trader guidance now. What is the latest Dogecoin accumulation by whales? Dogecoin accumulation refers to concentrated buying by wallet cohorts; mid‑tier wallets (1–10M DOGE) added ~30 million DOGE in 24 hours, lifting combined holdings to approximately 10.77 billion DOGE. This fresh inflow coincides with technical setups that increase the probability of a near‑term breakout. How did whale balances and price move through July–October? Early July saw quiet accumulation while price hovered near $0.17–$0.18. Balances peaked above 11.13B during a mid‑July spike to $0.29 before retracing. Consolidation between August and early September kept balances near 10.7–10.9B with price in a $0.21–$0.24 range. Recent activity resumed accumulation and pushed price to ~ $0.255. Source: Ali on X Why do analysts see a potential breakout for DOGE? Multiple chart patterns are converging. Analysts highlight a trendline retest and an ascending triangle that together increase breakout odds. Repeated accumulation from wallets controlling 1–10M DOGE provides support underneath price, reducing the likelihood of an immediate collapse. What targets and risk levels do chart watchers cite? Some analysts map higher targets, including range extensions toward $0.50 on aggressive breakouts. Nearer‑term attention centers on $0.27–$0.30 as the immediate resistance belt. Conversely, a sustained decline under $0.23 would reopen downside toward $0.20 and invalidate bullish structure.

Mid‑tier wallets (1–10M DOGE) added around 30 million DOGE within a 24‑hour period, pushing their combined holdings to roughly 10.77 billion DOGE and signaling renewed buying interest. What technical patterns are supporting the bullish case? Analysts point to a trendline retest and an ascending triangle across higher timeframes. These setups, when paired with sustained accumulation, raise the probability of a bullish breakout toward the $0.27–$0.30 zone. Key Takeaways Whale accumulation resumed : 30M DOGE added by mid‑tier wallets, balances at ~10.77B. Converging technicals : Trendline retest and ascending triangle increase breakout odds. Manage risk : Watch $0.27–$0.30 for breakout confirmation and use stops below $0.23. Conclusion This COINOTAG analysis shows renewed Dogecoin accumulation from mid‑tier wallets combined with technical setups that place the $0.27–$0.30 belt in focus.

ETF optimism and institutional inflows DeFi TVL approaching $100 billion and record staked ETH support network utility Macro uncertainty (U.S. government shutdown) amplified safe‑haven demand for ETH and BTC Ethereum all-time high: ETH topped $4,600 on Oct 5 amid Spot ETF hopes and rising DeFi TVL — read the full analysis and price outlook. Read now. Published: 2025-10-05 | Updated: 2025-10-05 Why did Ethereum hit a new all-time high today? Ethereum all-time high occurred as ETH surged past $4,600 on Oct 5, 2025, led by renewed institutional appetite for an Ethereum Spot ETF and strengthening on-chain metrics. Rising DeFi Total Value Locked and record staked ETH reinforced demand, creating technical momentum above key resistance levels. What role did ETF anticipation play in ETH’s rally? Expectations for an Ethereum Spot ETF significantly increased institutional flows into ETH. Institutions view an ETF as easier access to spot exposure, which can translate to large, concentrated buy-side pressure that pushes prices higher. Coinotag research notes heightened custody and prime-broker interest ahead of formal approvals. How did DeFi metrics and staking support the move? DeFi TVL nearing $100 billion and all-time record staked ETH highlight growing on-chain utility and reduced circulating supply pressure. These metrics signal sustained demand from DeFi protocols and staking participants, strengthening the narrative that ETH is both a consumption and yield-bearing asset. What other factors are driving ETH’s rally? Macro uncertainty, including the recent U.S. government shutdown, drove some investors toward crypto assets as an alternative store of value. Bitcoin’s parallel strength provided a market-wide tailwind that amplified ETH inflows and momentum trading. What are the immediate technical levels to watch? Ethereum cleared key resistance near $4,260 and is eyeing a retest of the prior ATH near $4,900. Short-term support sits at $4,260–$4,400, while a sustained close above $4,900 would target higher extension levels. ETH key levels (short-term) Level Type Notes $4,900 All-time high Primary upside target $4,260–$4,400 Support Recent breakout zone $3,800 Lower support Macro risk buffer Source: TradingView (plain text) Ethereum price prediction After breaking above $4,260, ETH’s immediate path targets a retest of the $4,900 ATH. Short-term momentum suggests further upside, though pullbacks to the $4,260–$4,400 support band are possible during consolidation. “Safe-haven” narrative — why it matters Macro events can shift investor allocations rapidly. The recent U.S. government shutdown contributed to flows into alternative assets, reinforcing ETH and BTC’s safe-haven narrative in some investor segments. This reallocation can accelerate ETF-driven and spot buying. Frequently Asked Questions How high can ETH go after this ATH? Price trajectories depend on institutional inflows and risk sentiment. If ETF approvals bring sustained demand, ETH may probe higher extensions above $4,900; however, standard risk management expects volatility and potential retracements to $4,260–$4,400. Is the DeFi TVL near $100B accurate? Yes. Multiple on‑chain dashboards and protocol reports indicate DeFi Total Value Locked approaching $100 billion, reinforcing network activity and utility for ETH. Who provided expert commentary for this report? Coinotag research analysts and unnamed on‑chain strategists provided insights; all quotes and data references are based on public on‑chain metrics and TradingView technicals (plain text). Key Takeaways ETF optimism : Institutional anticipation for an ETH Spot ETF is the primary catalyst. On‑chain strength : DeFi TVL near $100B and record staked ETH validate utility and reduce supply pressure. Macro drivers : U.S. government shutdown and macro uncertainty boosted safe‑haven demand for crypto. Conclusion Ethereum’s new all-time high reflects a convergence of institutional ETF interest, robust DeFi activity, and macro-driven flows into crypto. Monitor ETF developments, DeFi TVL, and staking trends for confirmation. For traders, maintain risk controls; for long-term holders, these developments reinforce ETH’s role in decentralized finance. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@graph"": [ { ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Ethereum Hits New All-Time High as ETF Optimism and DeFi TVL Surge"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/eth-tv.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-05T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-05T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/ethereum-ath-2025"", ""description"": ""Ethereum all-time high: ETH topped $4,600 on Oct 5 amid Spot ETF hopes and rising DeFi TVL; analysis of catalysts, technical levels and outlook."" }, { ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why did Ethereum hit a new all-time high today?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Ethereum hit a new all-time high primarily due to institutional optimism around an Ethereum Spot ETF, rising DeFi TVL approaching $100B, and record staked ETH, which together increased demand and technical momentum."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How should investors interpret DeFi TVL nearing $100B?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""DeFi TVL near $100B indicates growing on-chain utility and capital locked in protocols, supporting ETH demand and signaling broader ecosystem adoption."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What technical levels matter after this breakout?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key levels are support at $4,260–$4,400 and the prior ATH near $4,900; sustained moves above or below these bands will guide short-term price action."" } } ] }, { ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Ethereum's all-time high for portfolio decisions"", ""description"": ""Steps to assess ETH’s ATH and adjust portfolio risk."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/ethereum-ath-2025#step1"", ""name"": ""Check institutional signals"", ""text"": ""Review official ETF filings, custody flow reports, and prime-broker activity as indicators of sustained institutional demand."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/ethereum-ath-2025#step2"", ""name"": ""Assess on-chain metrics"", ""text"": ""Monitor DeFi Total Value Locked and staked ETH levels to gauge supply-demand dynamics and network utility."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/ethereum-ath-2025#step3"", ""name"": ""Set technical risk levels"", ""text"": ""Use support and resistance bands (e.g., $4,260–$4,400 support, $4,900 ATH) to plan entries, exits, and stop-losses."" } ] } ]}",Analysis|Bitcoin|Ethereum|News|BTC|Core|ETH|FLOW,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-05 09:37:06

Institutional buying remains strong, with Pantera-backed treasuries acquiring more than $167 million worth of SOL. Analysts argue that while Solana may be preparing for a breakout, the scale of its market cap limits upside potential compared to smaller tokens. Nonetheless, projects like Little Pepe (LILPEPE) deserve a watch under your radar and for good reasons. Read on to find out why. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Culture Meets Layer-2 Utility Where Solana offers scale, Little Pepe offers asymmetry. Built on its own Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 chain, LILPEPE incorporates sniper bot , with ten winners set to receive substantial allocations. Meanwhile, the Mega Giveaway from Stage 12 to 17 offers ETH prizes to both whales and randomly selected protection, 0% buy and sell taxes, and a launchpad designed specifically for meme coins. These provide infrastructure that other meme tokens usually don't. Staking rewards, DAO governance, and an NFT market complete LILPEPE’s ecosystem and give holders ways to benefit. The presale is already validating demand. Now in Stage 13, more than 93% of tokens are gone, with over $26.3 million raised against a $28.775 million cap. This rapid pace leaves fewer tokens available at the current $0.0022 price, before Stage 14 lifts it to $0.0023. Importantly, every step pushes the presale closer to its confirmed $0.003 listing, ensuring that buyers at this stage are entering below launch value. Community-focused campaigns amplify momentum. The team has launched a $777,000 giveaway, with ten winners set to receive substantial allocations. Meanwhile, the Mega Giveaway from Stage 12 to 17 offers ETH prizes to both whales and randomly selected retail participants. These initiatives are drawing viral attention, positioning LILPEPE to debut with one of the strongest communities in the meme space. For investors, this setup creates an opportunity where a $450 allocation today could plausibly grow into $45,000 if LILPEPE repeats even a fraction of Shiba Inu’s early trajectory. Solana (SOL): Institutional Strength With a $500 Target Solana has emerged as the most scalable Layer-1 blockchain, processing more than 3,000 transactions per second for under one cent in fees. The integration of Firedancer, its new validator client, has added stability and further reduced the risk of outages, solidifying its position as a strong base layer. Its ecosystem is expanding, with over 1,000 decentralised applications spanning DeFi protocols such as Serum and NFT marketplaces like Magic Eden. Strategic partnerships with Web3 leaders continue to attract institutional backing, reinforcing Solana’s role in tokenized assets and cross-chain integration. Market data highlights the opportunity. With a market cap of $117 billion, analysts see a path to $500 by Q4 2025, implying a 2.5x gain from current levels. Technical setups are equally supportive: stablecoins now account for 58% of Solana’s DeFi volume, providing liquidity depth, while Wyckoff accumulation models shared by analyst ZYN suggest the network is in its final consolidation phase before a breakout. Targets between $250 and $295 are in play, with $500 emerging as the bullish scenario for the cycle. Yet, while these gains are significant for a large-cap network, Solana’s size naturally caps its upside. Solana vs Little Pepe: Growth Ceiling vs Explosive Potential The comparison comes down to scale. Solana, at a $107B market cap, is well-positioned for institutional growth and could reach $500 by the end of 2025 — an impressive milestone but limited in returns. Little Pepe , by contrast, is starting under $0.005 with infrastructure designed to sustain community-driven hype. Its presale progress, combined with viral giveaways, creates a setup where multiples far beyond Solana’s are possible. Conclusion Solana remains one of the strongest Layer-1 networks, backed by institutional inflows and real adoption. But for traders seeking outsized gains, Little Pepe’s under-$0.005 presale offers the higher-risk, higher-reward profile. With over $26 million raised, 93% of Stage 13 tokens sold, and viral campaigns driving engagement, LILPEPE is emerging as the best asymmetric opportunity heading into 2025. For portfolios balancing stability with explosive upside, Solana provides the foundation — but Little Pepe may deliver the life-changing multiples.

This highlights Solana's stable market trust and foundational strength in blockchain technology. Comparative Overview of Solana and Little Pepe While Solana is a seasoned player in the field, the crypto community is starting to notice Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a new entrant that merges meme culture with serious blockchain functionalities. Unlike Solana's broad-scale blockchain solutions, Little Pepe introduces a niche offering with its Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 solutions, catering primarily to meme coins and their ecosystems. The Potential of Little Pepe in the Meme Coin Market Little Pepe is strategically positioning itself within the meme coin market by integrating unique offers such as sniper bots and zero percent transaction taxes. Its ongoing promotional events like the $777,000 giveaway and the Mega Giveaway are significant in attracting a robust community backing, essential for any meme-based digital asset. The presale phases have so far been successful, indicating strong market demand and potential for significant valuation increases post-launch. Solana's Solid Market Positioning and Future Prospects As a major player, Solana continues to excel in transaction efficiency, boasting capabilities of handling over 3,000 transactions per second at minimal costs. The network's growth is supported by its expanding ecosystem, which includes numerous decentralized applications, and strategic partnerships that reinforce its market position and future growth trajectory. Analysts are optimistic about Solana's price trajectory, potentially reaching $500 by the fourth quarter of 2025, reflecting substantial future gains. Final Thoughts on Investment Opportunities Investors seeking growth might find Solana a safe bet due to its established market presence and continuous developmental strides. However, those looking for higher risk-reward scenarios might find Little Pepe appealing, especially with its current under-$0.005 valuation and strong presale performance. The contrast between Solana's steady approach and Little Pepe's explosive market entry strategy outlines a diverse investment landscape.

XRP is still in the spotlight with technicals set to trigger a short-term bounce, while Cardano (ADA) also retains its charm through ongoing ecosystem improvements and rising adoption. But attention is increasingly on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi altcoin with utility in mind that can be had for just $0.035. MUTM is at Stage 6 and already over 55% sold-out. More than 16,750 holders have joined in and $16.85 million raised, with proof of strong investor confidence. Mutuum Finance is a novel sub-$5 crypto with affordability and massive upside potential, making it the top altcoin to keep an eye on this October. XRP Shows Early Indications of Fresh Rally as Institutional Demand Increases XRP breaking above its confluence points to the likelihood of a new rally underway as technical trends are in its favor. Pending ETF filings, increasing institutional demand, and historically strong Q4 performance put XRP poised for a stunning move even while the majority of the market continues to be fixated on Bitcoin and Solana. As investors target XRP’s momentum, so is attention turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is attracting growing investor interest in a manner that can redefine the crypto profits of the next generation. Cardano (ADA) Targets Important Resistance As Bulls Stage Comeback Cardano (ADA) has rebounded strongly from support at $0.815 and is now holding above the key levels, suggesting possible near-term strength. Technical design suggests a retest of resistance at $1.017, and sustained trading above $0.85 should trigger a continuation breakout. A clean breakout above $1.017 could unlock the possibility for a greater move to subsequent psychological price points, cementing ADA as one of the top smart-contract platforms. As investors monitor these key levels for ADA, many are also looking at high-potential, utility-backed alternative Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that possesses strong fundamentals paired with strong growth potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Performance Mutuum Finance is leading the decentralized finance charge with its presale, supported by more than 16,750 investors and raising a total of over $16.85 million to date. Already 55% subscribed in Phase 6, MUTM tokens are on sale at $0.035 per token. Mutuum Finance has announced its advanced lending and borrowing protocol , a monumental step in its direction towards leveling up decentralized finance solutions. V1 will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, with key features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and so on. The launch will facilitate ETH and USDT as lendable, borrowable, and collateralizable assets at launch and set the stage for a heterogeneous and scalable DeFi ecosystem. Vowing to expand the DeFi scene, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles for enabling secure lending, exchange, and settlement of USD-backed tokens against established assets like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The project employs robust and reliable price feeds with fallback oracle guardrails, composite feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages to ensure precision at all times even under extreme market volatility. Mutuum Finance Leads the Sub-$5 Crypto Charge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the most thrilling sub-$5 cryptos this October. The presale has already been participated in by more than 16,750 investors, who have invested over $16.85 million, and Phase 6 is already 55% sold. The upcoming release of its V1 lending and borrowing protocol on Sepolia Testnet, coupled with advanced Chainlink oracle integrations, positions MUTM as utility-focused DeFi with substantial upside growth. While XRP and Cardano set technical standards, MUTM provides early investors with the possibility of high upside in a safe, scalable ecosystem.

Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has emerged as a frontrunner in this wave. At its current presale price of $0.0022, LILPEPE has already attracted over $26.3 million in funding and sold more than 16.1 billion tokens out of the 17.25 billion allocated for Stage 13. Analysts suggest that, given its initial market cap of zero, the token could potentially achieve gains of 10,000% or more if it meets expectations after its launch. LILPEPE’s Price Momentum The presale started at just $0.001 and has risen to the current $0.0022. Early buyers from Stage 1 have already seen over 120% gains on their investment. Stage 13 is now 93.6% sold out, with the listing price expected to move to $0.0030 once the presale stages conclude. That represents a 37% upside for those joining before the next price jump. This structured rise has generated excitement, as each stage sells out faster than the last, demonstrating strong investor confidence. What sets LILPEPE apart from other meme coins is its infrastructure. It is built on a Layer 2 network designed specifically for meme tokens, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. It also features sniper bot resistance and a zero tax policy on buys and sells, making trading fairer for both retail investors and whales. The project has been audited by CertiK, adding a layer of trust that most meme projects lack. A growing community and attractive incentives have fueled momentum. The ongoing LILPEPE presale has raised over $26 million, while the team is running a $777,000 giveaway with over 412,400 entries. In addition, the Mega Giveaway for buyers between Stages 12 and 17 has drawn over 73,000 participants, rewarding the biggest investors with up to 5 ETH and many others with smaller ETH prizes. These campaigns have turned curiosity into real engagement. Another bullish sign is whale accumulation during the presale stages, which tightens the circulating supply ahead of listings. With plans for centralized exchange listings in the near future, the token is expected to experience even higher liquidity and visibility at launch. Because LILPEPE starts from a zero market cap, even moderate adoption could translate into huge multiples. Analysts have floated speculative projections of 10,000% gains or more, noting that its blend of meme culture and real infrastructure makes it stand out. Dogecoin (DOGE) Targets $1 While LILPEPE rises, Dogecoin remains the original meme heavyweight. DOGE trades between $0.22 and $0.25 at the time of writing. Technical analysts highlight improving momentum indicators, which suggest room for upward movement if buying pressure increases. Volume confirmation remains key, as DOGE’s next moves will likely depend on fresh capital inflows. Reaching $1 remains a challenging but not impossible goal. It would require a substantial market cap expansion, wider retail participation, and continued positive sentiment. Analysts believe DOGE could gradually work toward that milestone if these factors align. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Aims to Delete a Zero Meanwhile, Shiba Inu trades around $0.0000117. The SHIB community has rallied around “deleting a zero,” meaning a move toward $0.0001 that would shift its price one decimal place forward. The token’s aggressive burn strategy recently recorded a surge of over 200,000% in a single day, destroying 4.56 billion tokens. Combined with the growing utility of its Shibarium Layer 2 network and reduced exchange reserves, this has encouraged bullish sentiment. Suppose SHIB’s ecosystem gains further traction and broader crypto market sentiment turns positive. Analysts predict that it could rise to the $0.0001 range over time, representing a roughly eightfold gain from current levels. This move is speculative and depends on continued supply burning and sustained investor demand. Conclusion The meme coin market is evolving beyond simple hype. LILPEPE combines the cultural pull of memes with technical infrastructure and fair tokenomics. At $0.0022 in its Stage 13 presale and analysts speculating about 10,000% potential gains, it offers a fresh growth story compared with DOGE’s long road to $1 or SHIB’s push to delete a zero. Investors looking for the next wave of meme-driven growth may want to consider LILPEPE before its presale closes and prices rise.

With a presale price of merely $0.0022, this coin has successfully raised over $26.3 million, selling more than 16.1 billion tokens. Financial analysts project that LILPEPE, starting from a market cap of zero, could see a rise in value by around 10,000% post-launch, provided it meets market expectations. Presale Success and Future Prospects The journey started with an introductory price of $0.001, and it's currently at $0.0022. Those who invested early in Stage 1 have seen a 120% increase in their investment. The presale is now at Stage 13, which is nearly sold out at 93.6%. Once this stage closes, the price is expected to jump to $0.0030, providing a potential 37% gain for new investors. The robust infrastructure of LILPEPE, including features like sniper bot resistance and a zero tax policy, enhances its appeal. Additionally, the coin has been audited by CertiK, strengthening its credibility. The ongoing presale of LILPEPE coupled with a $777,000 giveaway has sparked considerable investor interest, drawing over 412,400 participants. Moreover, a special Mega Giveaway is attracting even more attention, rewarding large investors with up to 5 ETH. Comparison with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu While LILPEPE is making waves, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a dominant player in the meme coin market, trading between $0.22 and $0.25. Analysts point out that DOGE needs increased buying pressure to reach the $1 mark, a goal that requires significant market cap expansion and positive market sentiment. Similarly, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is making its own mark with a current trading price of around $0.0000117. The SHIB community is focused on 'deleting a zero' from its price, which would significantly increase its value. This goal is supported by a substantial token burn and the development of its Shibarium network, enhancing its utility and demand. Conclusion With its strategic market positioning and strong presale performance, Little Pepe stands out in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Its competitive edge is bolstered by a solid infrastructure designed specifically for meme coins and attractive financial incentives for early investors. As LILPEPE nears the end of its presale phases, it presents a compelling opportunity for those looking to invest in the meme coin sector.

According to asset manager VanEck, the slide can be mainly attributed to a reduction in volatility in the digital asset markets. Ethereum network revenue experienced a 6% drop, while Solana fell by 11%. The VanEck report also noted that the Tron network recorded a 37% reduction in fees. Notably, the main reason for this slide is the governance proposal that was submitted in August, which saw gas fees reduced by over 50%. According to reports, the total daily network fees for Tron’s block producers, known as Super Representatives, dropped to $5 million on September 7, the lowest in over a year. Blockchain revenues drop by 16% in September The drop in revenue in the other blockchain networks has been attributed to reduced volatility in the crypto markets and the underlying tokens powering these networks. Ethereum volatility experienced the biggest slide, dropping by 16%, followed by Bitcoin, which dropped about 26% in September. Solana made up the top three, experiencing a drop of about 16% in the month. “With reduced volatility for digital assets, there are fewer arbitrage opportunities to compel traders to pay high priority fees,” the researchers explained in the report . Network revenues and fees are a critical metric to measure economic activity in crypto ecosystems. Market analysts, traders, and investors monitor the network fundamentals to ascertain the overall health of the ecosystem, individual projects, and the broader crypto market. Meanwhile, the Tron network has maintained its number one place among the crypto ecosystem in terms of revenue. According to data from Token Terminal, the network generated $3.6 billion in the last year. Last month, Token Terminal reported that the network also exceeded the Ethereum’s revenues over the past 90 days, accruing $435 million in fees compared to Ethereum’s $365 million. Tron experiences a rise in revenue Tron founder Justin Sun highlighted the revenue performance at the time, noting that it exceeded Ethereum’s protocol revenue by 50%. “If this trend continues, Tron’s protocol revenue could even surpass $2 billion this year, making it the most profitable blockchain on Earth!” he said. On the other hand, Ethereum generated a revenue of about $1 billion over the past year. This happened despite the asset hitting all-time highs in August, and a market capitalization of $539 billion, which represented over 16x the TRX market cap, which is just around $32 billion. Tron’s revenue has been attributed to its role in stablecoin settlements. About 51% of the circulating USDT supply was issued on the Ton network. The stablecoin market cap surpassed $292 billion in October 2025 and has been steadily rising since 2023, according to data from RWA.XYZ. Stablecoins have become a major case for blockchain technology, as governments attempt to increase the scalability of their fiat currencies by placing them on blockchains. For instance, China has been discussing the likelihood of creating its yuan-backed stablecoins to bolster its internationalization. The country, which is known for its restrictive approach to digital assets, would be looking to reverse its earlier policies and allow its fiat to be on-chain. The report was released by Reuters, which noted that it got credible intel from sources familiar with the matter. If approved, it will mark a shift in the approach of the country, which banned crypto trading and mining in 2021.

The trader bought early and held a concentrated position in the 4 memecoin. Rapid social amplification after a repost by Changpeng Zhao led to explosive price moves, producing roughly a 650x return on the initial $3,000 BNB stake. What on-chain evidence supports these gains? Blockchain analytics platforms reported wallet-level purchase history and unrealized profit estimates. Lookonchain-style wallet tracing and CoinStats-style portfolio snapshots show the trader realized partial profit and still holds significant unrealized value. A lucky cryptocurrency trader turned a $3,000 investment into roughly $2 million within hours after Changpeng Zhao shared a repost about a BNB Chain memecoin on X. Blockchain data shows the trader, identified by wallet address “0x872,” was one of the earliest buyers of the newly launched “4” ($4) token. The initial $3,000 BNB position grew into roughly $2 million — about a 650-fold return. Despite realized gains, the trader sold only a small portion and retains approximately $1.88 million in tokens. The portfolio cited onchain snapshots shows over 98% of the wallet’s assets remain in 4. Source: Lookonchain The token emerged after a phishing attack on the BNB Chain, where the attacker reportedly profited about $4,000 before the community turned the incident into a meme token. Community response and high-profile reposts turned attention to the new token. Source: CoinStats.app Portfolio analytics show the trader’s holdings generated roughly $1.8 million in unrealized profit over the past week, per on-chain portfolio snapshots.

Another wallet bought minutes before Zhao’s repost and saw gains exceeding $1.5 million hours later, according to visualization posts from on-chain mapping platforms. Market chatter and social reposts created a feedback loop that pushed prices higher. How can traders monitor memecoin surges safely? Use on-chain analytics and portfolio tracking tools to verify wallet purchases and supply concentration. Check transaction timestamps, liquidity pool sizes, and large-holder distribution.

Dogecoin is now benefiting from fresh ETF attention, Pepe Coin continues to draw speculative energy, and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is carving its own path with community power and strong presale traction. For investors, the mix of old favorites and new challengers paints an intriguing picture, with some projects signaling possible 45x gains before the end of 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) – The Original Meme Coin Goes Mainstream Dogecoin has long been the face of meme coins. With the launch of the DOJE ETF, DOGE now finds itself in a new spotlight that could open doors to institutional money. At the time of writing, the price of Dogecoin is $0.23. This comes after a vigorous defense of the $0.22 support zone, with whales adding to their holdings according to on-chain data. Analysts believe the ETF gives DOGE legitimacy in traditional finance. If momentum holds, projections suggest DOGE could test $0.29 and push toward $0.35. In an extreme bull scenario, the path to $0.60 becomes possible, although it will require consistent retail support and institutional inflows. Even with the optimism, it remains clear that Dogecoin’s rally will rely heavily on social energy, just as it always has. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – The Next Generation Meme Coin Where Dogecoin carries history and PEPE rides momentum, Little Pepe is combining meme culture with real infrastructure. At the time of writing, the token is in presale stage 13 at $0.0022, with $26,378,079 already raised out of a $28,775,000 target. Over 16.1 billion tokens have been sold, and the presale is 93.68% complete. Early buyers from stage 1 are already sitting on 120% gains. Investors joining now at stage 13 still stand to benefit with 36.36% projected gains by the time the token launches at $0.0030. What makes Little Pepe compelling is not only its rapid presale progress but also its credibility. The project has been audited by Certik and is listed on CoinMarketCap, both of which build investor confidence. On top of that, a $777k giveaway is live, alongside a Mega Giveaway offering over 15 ETH in prizes for top buyers from stage 12 to stage 17. Adding to its momentum, Little Pepe peaked above DOGE, PEPE, and SHIB in ChatGPT 5 memecoin question volume trends between June and August 2025. This signals real social traction at a time when visibility drives adoption. Pepe Coin (PEPE) – Riding the Retail Wave Pepe Coin has proven it is not a one-hit wonder. At the time of writing, the price of PEPE is $0.00000916, with trading volume consistently among the top meme coins on exchanges. Retail traders continue to flock toward PEPE as it remains one of the most liquid meme coins available. While Pepe does not yet have an ETF to give it a mainstream edge, it thrives on community hype and rapid circulation across social media platforms. Some investors see PEPE as the faster-moving alternative to DOGE, but with higher volatility risks attached. Final Thoughts Dogecoin may ride the ETF story toward a higher valuation, and PEPE continues to hold a strong spot in the meme coin rankings. But for investors who are looking ahead, Little Pepe offers something different. It is not only a meme coin but also a project building its own infrastructure while rewarding its growing community. With the presale nearly complete and early investors already seeing 120% returns, the token still offers 36.36% potential gains before launch and longer-term upside as the ecosystem grows. The meme coin market is evolving, and LILPEPE is positioning itself as more than a passing trend. For those seeking the next chapter of meme coin investing, the presale might be the entry point worth serious consideration.

Amid this resurgence, new entrants like Little Pepe are making significant strides, propelled by innovative presales and community engagement. The Resurgence of Dogecoin Dogecoin's integration into the mainstream through the recent launch of a dedicated ETF spotlights its significant role in the meme coin sector. Currently trading at $0.23, Dogecoin could potentially see an increase to $0.35 or even $0.60, bolstered by institutional investments and continued retail support. This trajectory depends heavily on maintaining its iconic social media presence. Emerging Star: Little Pepe Positioning itself as more than just a meme, Little Pepe combines popular meme culture with substantial infrastructure development. Currently priced at $0.0022 during its 13th presale stage, Little Pepe has almost reached its funding goal with over $26 million raised. It presents a promising opportunity for early investors, offering potential gains of 36.36% before its market launch. Pepe Coin: A Favorite Among Retail Investors While Pepe Coin may not have the institutional backing of an ETF like Dogecoin, it remains a top player among meme coins due to its liquidity and strong retail following. Trading at $0.00000916, Pepe Coin continues to attract investors looking for quick, albeit volatile, returns in the meme coin market. Deep Dive into Little Pepe's Features and Opportunities With an almost complete presale and significant community initiatives, Little Pepe not only resonates with meme enthusiasts but also stands out for its solid foundation and potential market growth. This dual appeal could be crucial as meme coins evolve from niche internet jokes to more mature investment opportunities. Interested in more details about Little Pepe?

Risk-on sentiment was reflected in gains across the entire sector as the total crypto market cap surged more than 11 percent, moving just shy of its all-time peak around $4.25 trillion. Traders viewed the rebound as a strong signal that confidence is returning after a turbulent September. In line with this fresh momentum, the crypto fear and greed index pushed into the upper bounds of the Greed territory at 63, recovering sharply from lows of 28 seen only a week earlier. The sudden shift in sentiment highlighted how quickly investors were willing to rotate back into risk assets once the market showed signs of strength. This sharp turnaround came after several weeks of muted price action and directionless trading that had left many participants cautious. The return of strong buying interest suggests that both institutional players and retail traders are positioning for potential upside through the final stretch of the year. Most of the major altcoins erased the prior week’s losses, with profits visible across the board. Why is Bitcoin price going up today? Bitcoin rallied to a multi-week high of $121,044 today, just shy of entering price discovery beyond its previous all-time high of $124,128. A mix of supportive macro factors, institutional flows, and renewed retail participation has triggered this week’s rally. Firstly, the United States entered a partial government shutdown yesterday, which has delayed crucial economic reports such as the September jobs data. Early labor indicators have already signaled weakness, and with the absence of new official figures, traders are leaning toward expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut at the Oct. 29 policy meeting. Futures markets now price in a near-certain 25 basis point reduction, a move that has pressured the dollar lower and driven investors into risk assets. Bitcoin, often seen both as a hedge against policy uncertainty and as a high beta proxy for risk appetite, has benefited directly. The dollar slipped by 0.5%, which was enough to draw capital flows back into crypto alongside equities. Shutdown periods in the past have tended to support stock markets, and the same dynamic is now visible across the digital assets market. Spot exchange-traded funds are playing an increasingly important role in the rally. According to SoSoValue, crypto ETFs absorbed $934 million in net inflows on Oct. 2 alone, with Bitcoin products taking in $627 million and Ethereum funds capturing $307 million. For Bitcoin, it marked the fourth consecutive day of net inflows. At the same time, stablecoin liquidity has expanded with Tether minting $2 billion in new USDT and Circle pushing further integration of USDC and EURC across European markets. This injection of liquidity is adding fuel to the rally. October’s reputation as a historically strong month for Bitcoin is also playing into sentiment. Average returns over the past decade have ranged between 20 and 30 %, and this year’s performance so far is tracking closely with that record. While a stronger-than-expected jobs report later this month could complicate the rate cut narrative and weigh on prices, analysts argue that the combination of ETF inflows, seasonal strength, and rising institutional adoption has set the stage for the market to move toward a $5 trillion valuation before year-end, led by Bitcoin. Confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory is now spilling over to Wall Street, where banks and hedge funds are publishing higher projections for the bellwether crypto. JPMorgan raised its year-end target for Bitcoin to $165,000, while Citi set a projection of $132,000 and Pantera Capital suggested $150,000 if ETF demand continues at the present pace. How high can Bitcoin price go? When writing this report, Bitcoin was already trading close to all-time high prices, and traders are all but certain that price discovery is imminent. A lot has changed on Bitcoin’s liquidity heatmap over the past week, with strong support areas now visible around the $115,000 to $117,000 zone. The heatmap shows that large clusters of short liquidations were triggered during the climb, and this cascade of liquidations created a clean path higher, removing much of the resistance that had capped prices in September. At current levels, the chart highlights significant liquidity stacked above $122,000 and extending toward the prior all-time high at $124,000. These pockets suggest that if Bitcoin manages to push through the immediate resistance near $121,500, another wave of liquidations could accelerate the move into fresh price discovery. Traders often view these liquidity zones as magnets for price, and the present setup points to a market where the path of least resistance is tilted upward. What stands out in the heatmap is how consistently higher support has been forming as the rally unfolded. Each dip has been met with strong bids, which have absorbed selling pressure quickly and prevented deeper pullbacks. This staircase pattern of support is usually a hallmark of sustained institutional buying and speaks to the conviction behind the latest move. If Bitcoin clears the $124,000 barrier, analysts believe the next target could quickly stretch into the $130,000 to $135,000 range as liquidity thins out above current levels. While some caution that a hotter-than-expected jobs report could temper rate cut bets later this month, the liquidation landscape suggests that the market is heavily skewed toward further upside in the short term. Bitcoin’s price was showing a lot of strength, especially as it successfully retested the $120k support level, according to crypto analyst Rekt Capital. See below.

At the same time, market analysis resource platform Barcharts noted that Bitcoin was also closing in on the highest weekly close in history. If that happens, it would further reinforce bullish sentiment over the short-term. Another upside target came from market watcher and analyst Kamran Asghar, who sees $133,000 as the next major target based on a long-term Fibonacci-based projection. (See below.) BTC/USDT 1-day price chart. Source: Kamran Asghar on X. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was hovering over $121,000, after climbing over 10% in the past 7 days. Altcoins strength starts to return This week, the altcoin market cap experienced a notable rally as it rose 9% over the period to $1.84 trillion at the time of writing. Ethereum, the largest altcoin by market share, surged 13%, briefly breaching the $4,500 psychological level before settling at $4,470. Other major altcoins, including XRP (XRP), BNB (BNB), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA), recorded gains ranging from 10% to 22%. Notably, only eight of the 99 leading altcoins by market cap ended in the red, while the rest traded in positive territory. Zcash (ZEC) outperformed the broader crypto market with gains of about 175%, while PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Ether.fi (ETHFI) followed with increases of 42% and 40%, respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap Zcash : Bulls managed to push ZEC past the $150 barrier this week, a level last seen in April 2022, while bringing its market cap up from $870 million to over $2.3 billion, placing it among the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Heightened concerns about digital surveillance, data breaches, and the rise of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have reignited interest in privacy coins like Zcash. Investors are also bullish on Grayscale’s launch of the Zcash Trust, which is open for private placement to accredited investors. The product allows exposure to ZEC without the need to directly hold the token. Additionally, the launch of the Zashi App’s CrossPay feature, which enables shielded ZEC transfers across more than 20 blockchains, has expanded Zcash’s utility in the decentralized finance space. PancakeSwap : For the CAKE token, the rally unfolded amid strong trader demand, highlighted by a record spike in trading volumes. PancakeSwap processed $772 billion in volume in Q3, marking a 42% quarter-over-quarter increase. One key driver of this growth has been the ongoing rally in Binance’s BNB token, which hit a new all-time high on Oct. 3, and the surge brought fresh liquidity into the BNB Chain, where PancakeSwap remains the leading DEX. With the chain’s total value locked climbing to $8.16 billion, PancakeSwap captured nearly a quarter of that activity, fueling higher trading volumes for CAKE. High trading volumes directly support CAKE’s tokenomics through its fee-burning mechanism. At present, around 12–15% of trading fees are used to buy back and burn CAKE, reducing the circulating supply and creating upward pressure on the token’s price. Pump.fun: PUMP’s gains can be largely attributed to the Pump.fun platform’s aggressive buyback strategy. Notably, Pump.fun has been actively accumulating PUMP tokens periodically from the open market, regardless of the prices, through revenue generated from trading on the platform. The platform generated $13.48 million in weekly revenue at press time, and has used fees to reduce the circulating supply by approximately 8% since July. Such permanent removal of tokens from circulation creates scarcity, reduces selling pressure, and is thus bullish for the token. Traders are also bullish as the token‘s price action confirmed multiple bullish breakout patterns and technicals flagged bullish signs throughout the week.

52699545,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85281,1759658410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"MUTM Lands in Expert Portfolio, Tipped to Explode 1000% Pre-Bull Run",https://timestabloid.com/mutm-lands-in-expert-portfolio-tipped-to-explode-1000-pre-bull/,"Professional portfolio managers are moving more and more money from idle large-cap crypto holdings into yield-first DeFi protocols that make steady income and boost demand for cleaner tokens. In this situation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting a lot of attention as a very useful, money-making tool that is ready to give huge returns before the next big market surge. Analysts think that MUTM will grow very quickly because it has a structured lending environment, a new stablecoin, and protocol incentives that directly link usage to token demand. Dual Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, with approximately $16.8 million raised so far. Around 55% of the 170M allocated tokens have already been claimed, and holders exceed 16,750. The total token supply is 4B MUTM. The upcoming Phase 7 will increase the price to $0.040, a 15% step-up. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has announced development of its lending and borrowing protocol , targeting V1 deployment on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Initial supported assets will include ETH and USDT, marking the start of its dual lending ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use a dual lending approach to find a good balance between stability and adaptability. Stablecoins and blue-chip assets will be handled by P2C pools, which will offer deep liquidity for stable returns and institutional involvement. P2P desks will help create separate markets for tokens with higher risk or volatility. This will let speculative or niche loans get access to capital without putting the whole system at risk. This design makes sure that the platform can handle both low-risk, yield-focused users and users looking for higher-risk opportunities. To show how Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will work in real life, a professional allocator will put $15,000 USDT into the mtUSDT pool and get back 1:1 mtUSDT coins. With an average APY of 15%, which depends on how much the pool is used, this deposit will earn $2,250 in interest every year. As a borrower, putting up $1,000 worth of ETH as collateral will open 75% LTV. This gives the borrower access to $750 in lending liquidity while keeping their exposure to the price of ETH going up. These processes show how stable, predictable returns and borrowing with too much collateral will encourage regular use, which will feed the token demand loop. Demand Drivers That Will Produce 1000% Analysts think that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a number of protocol-level features that will lead to huge demand for tokens and a possible 1000% increase before the bull run. First, the reserve factor will put some of the borrower’s interest into on-chain funds that will be used for controlled buybacks and incentives to stake. This method connects money-making to the need for tokens, making a cycle of decreasing quantity and giving rewards. Second, the buy-and-distribute system will turn some of the fees and penalties for liquidation into MUTM on the open market and give the tokens to people who have staked mtTokens. This establishes a straight link between TVL gene rates fees, fees that pay for buybacks, and buybacks that maintain demand. Third, the beta launch and Layer-2 spread will improve the user experience (UX) and lower fees, which will increase the number of daily users and loans. More activity will bring in more fee money, which will feed the buyback and staking loop more effectively. Finally, Chainlink main feeds with fallback and aggregated oracles will be used by the platform’s price discovery system. This will make the system more stable, which will cut down on risky liquidations, bring in big investors, and increase the fee base, which will boost both TVL growth and token demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also highlight its security and credibility. The CertiK audit will report Token Scan and Skynet Scores of 90.00 and 79.00 respectively. The platform will maintain a $50,000 bug bounty program with tiered rewards for vulnerabilities and a $100,000 giveaway for community engagement, rewarding 10 winners with $10,000 each. A dashboard and Top 50 leaderboard will further drive community participation and transparency. There are already 55% of MUTMs sold in Phase 6 of the presale, and the price will soon go up to $0.040 in Phase 7. Investors who act now will get early access to a DeFi platform that combines predictable borrowing, staking backed by income, and demand driven by buybacks. Now that these features are in place, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer one of the best chances for optimistic crypto estimates and big price increases in crypto right now.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/financial-expert-to-xrp-army-get-ready-for-what-is-coming-heres-why/,"XRP’s recent rebound has caught the attention of market observers and traders alike. In a recent video shared on social media, financial expert Levi addressed his followers with strong remarks regarding the cryptocurrency’s current trajectory. He recalled advising his audience to consider XRP when it was trading around $2.67, emphasizing that the asset has since approached the $3 mark, reflecting a significant recovery in a short timeframe. XRP ARMY DID YOU LISTEN?? GET READY #XRP pic.twitter.com/EF0Kg4it6Z — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 2, 2025 Whale Activity and Market Dynamics According to Levi, the rebound followed a period of whale-driven manipulation that contributed to prior price fluctuations. He described the move as a “v-shaped recovery,” suggesting that the asset swiftly regained its position after a notable downturn. Whale activity has long been a subject of analysis within the crypto market, as large-volume transactions are often capable of influencing price direction in the short term. Levi’s statement reinforces the perception that XRP’s movements have, in part, been shaped by such factors. Anticipating Further Volatility In his video, Levi cautioned the community to prepare for heightened volatility ahead. His comments suggest that while the price recovery is significant, the market may not settle into stability immediately. XRP has a history of abrupt shifts in both directions, and Levi’s warning aligns with ongoing observations that the asset is currently in a period where speculation and technical momentum are major drivers of price activity. His remarks underscore the importance of monitoring short-term conditions closely, as traders may encounter rapid changes in valuation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Price Levels and Market Position XRP’s move from $2.67 toward the $3 level coincides with broader strength across the digital asset sector. Bitcoin and other large-cap cryptocurrencies have also seen upward momentum, which tends to provide supportive conditions for altcoins. Alongside this, speculation surrounding potential institutional products linked to XRP , such as exchange-traded funds , has contributed to a more optimistic outlook among investors. This combination of macro factors, technical recovery, and heightened interest has positioned XRP as a focal point in the ongoing rally. Levi’s message to his audience centered on both recognition of XRP’s strong recovery and a reminder of the risks that remain. For participants in the market, the dual nature of opportunity and risk remains a defining feature of XRP’s current phase.

With a wild 1,000,000% price jump, those who invested just $1,500 early on watched it grow into millions. SHIB's massive rise came from its meme coin vibe, a huge group of fans, and constant chatter on social media. Sure, SHIB became one of the most famous meme coins, but 2025 is looking like the year when fresh tokens under $2 could pull off the same kind of magic. Here's a quick look at three tokens that might match SHIB's crazy wins: Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The New Meme Coin with 1000x Potential The meme coin scene has a cool new star popping up: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . LILPEPE is already making waves with its impressive presale run, raising $26.3 million and selling over 16 billion tokens across 13 rounds. Sitting at $0.0022 per token right now, Little Pepe is still extremely early, but high demand is nudging its price higher. Investors are loading up on LILPEPE, expecting huge growth as the project continues to gain momentum in the meme coin world. What really makes LILPEPE stand out from other meme coins is its clever token setup. 26.5% of the tokens are allocated to presale buyers, securing solid early support. Additionally, 30% is set aside for chain backup, and 13.5% is allocated to staking and community rewards, demonstrating that LILPEPE is built for the long run, not just for fast hype. As 2025 rolls on, LILPEPE could totally follow in Shiba Inu's footsteps and turn into the next giant meme coin that hands out life-changing cash to investors, especially the ones who hop in soon. Pengu (PENGU): The Meme That's Still Going Strong Pengu (PENGU) is another meme coin turning heads in the 2025 crypto world. It's currently trading at $0.0298, with a total value of $2.35 billion and $728 million exchanged in the last 24 hours. PENGU is still in its growth stage, but it has caught the attention of everyday folks and big-money players, and it has fun partnerships, such as the one with Hyundai Card in South Korea, which helps it gain more recognition. In addition to its solid community backing, PENGU is shaking things up in NFTs and DeFi, providing it with real-world applications beyond just being a meme. With 84% of its community feeling upbeat, PENGU has a chance to achieve gains similar to SHIB in the years ahead. Folks are guessing its 2025 high could hit between $0.05 and $0.10, which means big payoffs for early buyers. Ethena (ENA): Shaking Up the Stablecoin World Unlike meme coins like SHIB and PENGU, Ethena (ENA) brings a strong DeFi and big-investor story to the table. As of September 28, 2025, ENA is at $0.57 with a total value of $3.92 billion. With $13 billion tied up in its USDe stablecoin and 9% rewards for staking, Ethena is attracting significant interest from professionals. The system's integration with M2 Capital and its alignment with platforms like Aave and Binance Earn make Ethena a significant player in the crypto finance landscape. Experts are excited about ENA, anticipating that 2025 prices could range from $0.599 to $1.44, and possibly even $3 if the market heats up significantly. That makes Ethena a smart choice for people who want to get in before the pros pile on. Why Little Pepe Comes Out on Top in 2025 PENGU and ETHENA look pretty good as buys, but Little Pepe (LILPEPE) really shines as the best meme coin with the biggest chance to copy Shiba Inu's wild 2021 ride. The blend of lively community fun, smart token setup, and awesome presale wins makes LILPEPE the meme coin everyone wants for 2025. Meme coins are gaining popularity, and with Little Pepe's strong support and buzz from early buyers, it could be the next big hit in this space. If LILPEPE continues to grow its community and expand to popular spots, it may experience a significant price surge, similar to what Shiba Inu has seen. Conclusion: Jump In Early for the Biggest Wins Just like Shiba Inu (SHIB) turned $1,500 into millions for those who got in first, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has all the vibes of becoming the next meme coin superstar. With a price under $0.003 and tons of room for big gains, LILPEPE could be the move that 2025 investors talk about forever. As meme coin excitement continues to draw in the crowd, LILPEPE combines community power with solid fundamentals, making it a top pick for anyone chasing the next big crypto story.

As we look ahead, certain cryptocurrencies under the $2 mark are attracting attention with their unique propositions and burgeoning community support. Here’s an exploration of three such tokens that could be on the brink of substantial gains. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A Promising Meme Coin Contender The meme coin sector has been energized by the introduction of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , which has already made a splash during its presale phase by raising $26.3 million and distributing over 16 billion tokens. With a current price point of $0.0022 per token, LILPEPE’s foundation is strengthened by its strategic token allocation, where 26.5% is earmarked for presale participants, 30% for chain sustainability, and 13.5% for staking and community rewards. Recognizing its potential early could position investors similarly to early SHIB backers, especially with its robust community engagement and expanding market presence. Pengu (PENGU): From Meme to Mainstream Pengu (PENGU) has quietly grown its market cap to $2.35 billion, with tokens trading at $0.0298 each. What sets PENGU apart is not just its meme coin status but its practical applications in NFTs and DeFi sectors. With a strong community and innovative partnerships, like one with Hyundai Card in South Korea, PENGU is positioning itself as a meme coin with real-world utility. Ethena (ENA): Revolutionizing the Stablecoin Landscape While not a meme coin, Ethena (ENA) is disrupting the stablecoin market with its robust DeFi partnerships and a commitment to a stabilized crypto economy. Trading at $0.57 with a market cap of $3.92 billion, ENA offers a prospective haven for investors looking for less volatility but substantial growth potential. Its connections with major crypto platforms like Aave and Binance Earn hint at a promising future. Why Little Pepe Could Lead the Charge in 2025 Among the cryptocurrencies under review, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out with its vital community engagement and innovative approach to tokenomics. Its potential to replicate or even surpass SHIB’s 2021 success makes it a compelling prospect for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Conclusion: Seizing Opportunities in Emerging Cryptocurrencies Similar to the meteoric rise of Shiba Inu, Little Pepe presents a tantalizing opportunity for those willing to engage early. With each of these tokens showing unique strengths, the key to potentially replicating SHIB’s success lies in identifying and supporting early-stage projects with solid fundamentals and active communities.

Investors are searching for the best altcoins to buy, and any suggestions and tokens continue to compete for the position. However, amidst the myriad options, three projects and tokens that continue to emerge are: Pepe Coin (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Remittix (RTX) . Questions continue to arise about the three and which will offer the best maximum returns. Let’s find out. Is Dogecoin Worth Buying Now? Dogecoin is the pioneer meme coin, and it rose to fame in January 2021, trading at $0.004. By April, it had surged by 1,100% to reach an all-time high of $0.73. However, its growth has declined since then, and there have been no utility upgrades or developments. This decline is sponsored by a shift from meme coins to utility-focused projects in the market. Investors’ sentiments and choices have changed; the meme coin, which was once valued at $137 billion in 2024, crashed to $49 billion by 2025. Investors are now diversifying into utility-driven projects with a sustainable roadmap and a long-term plan. Pepe Coin, The Waning Meme Coin Launched in 2023, Pepe coin became one of the hottest meme coins in the market and delivered massive returns to early investors. However, after the 2023 run, PEPE’s tide changed. Pepe Price prediction indicates that it may struggle to reclaim its previous highs as trading volumes decline and hype fades. However, Pepe coin can still reverse if community hype is renewed and broader market conditions remain bullish. Remittix Set For A 1,000 % Run Remittix (RTX) leverages DeFi, blockchain technology, and local payment networks to bridge a $19 trillion payment gap. It facilitates crypto-to-fiat transactions to bank accounts in over 30 countries.

52699771,https://cryptonews.com/?p=433161,1759658780,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52699771.jpeg,Sam Bankman-Fried Says Handing FTX to CEO John Ray Was ‘Biggest Mistake’ in Prison Interview,https://cryptonews.com/news/sbf-says-handing-ftx-to-ceo-john-ray-was-biggest-mistake-in-prison-interview/,"Sam Bankman-Fried stated in exclusive prison interviews that handing FTX to CEO John Ray III was “ the single biggest mistake I made by far ,” claiming he signed over control at 4:24 am on November 11, 2022, under extreme pressure from Sullivan & Cromwell and company advisers. According to a report from Mother Jones , the convicted FTX founder maintains that he never defrauded anyone and that the company was never bankrupt, despite a jury finding him guilty of seven counts of fraud and money laundering in November 2023. Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence at Federal Correctional Institution Terminal Island in Los Angeles and has been ordered to pay $11 billion in restitution. His parents, Stanford law scholars Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, are preparing to appeal his conviction, arguing that Sullivan & Cromwell wrestled FTX away from him, installed Ray, and profited handsomely while playing a critical role in his imprisonment. Barbara Fried and Joe Bankman, parents of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. | Source: Mother Jones According to the report, the law firm has billed nearly $250 million in legal fees throughout the bankruptcy process, while Ray will receive a $30 million bonus in addition to his $1,575 hourly rate and a $3 million completion fee. Total bankruptcy costs are expected to exceed $1 billion , making it one of the most expensive in U.S. history. John Ray has called SBF’s claims about FTX’s solvency “ categorically, callously, and demonstrably false ,” stating he and Sullivan & Cromwell salvaged billions from the wreckage to repay customers. By last October, Ray had recovered at least $16 billion, with most creditors expected to receive 100% of their November 2022 account values plus interest. Sullivan & Cromwell’s Role Draws Scrutiny From Senators and Bankruptcy Experts Sullivan & Cromwell had represented FTX on at least 20 occasions since 2021, earning over $8.5 million in fees before the collapse. Some attorneys from the firm had joined FTX’s in-house legal staff, including Ryne Miller, General Counsel of FTX.US, who was a former staff attorney at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Days before the bankruptcy filing, Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys consulted with Miller. They reported accounting concerns to the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, the SEC, and the CFTC. SBF claims these discussions occurred without his knowledge. Ray’s team later stated that Sullivan & Cromwell’s pre-bankruptcy outreach was of “ critical importance to the speed with which federal prosecutors have been able to charge and arrest Mr. Bankman-Fried .” Bipartisan senators, including Elizabeth Warren and Thom Tillis , wrote to the bankruptcy judge in January 2023, questioning Ray’s hiring of Sullivan & Cromwell, given its extensive history with FTX. FTX's native token FTT soared after a new X post from Sam Bankman-Fried stirred speculation on Tuesday night. #SBF #FTT https://t.co/vak775fPZi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 24, 2025 The senators noted the firm advised FTX for years, leading to its collapse, while claiming to be “disinterested” in conducting the fraud investigation. Temple University bankruptcy expert Jonathan Lipson filed a court brief supporting the appointment of a special examiner to investigate whether Sullivan & Cromwell violated ethical duties. Lipson questioned whether the firm violated ethics by promising SBF a reorganization role “ while simultaneously seeking to induce his prosecution .” An independent examiner was eventually appointed over Sullivan & Cromwell’s objections, though the mandate was limited to compiling and summarizing completed investigations rather than conducting new interviews or reviewing primary documents. The examiner determined Sullivan & Cromwell’s past work did not disqualify it from representing FTX through Chapter 11. Creditors Fight Bankruptcy Fees While Bitcoin Holdings Surge 600% Sunil Kavuri, a former adviser at Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley, had $2 million in crypto assets frozen on FTX when the exchange collapsed. He launched a class-action suit against celebrity spokespeople, including Tom Brady, Shaquille O’Neal, and Shohei Ohtani, with O’Neal settling for $1.8 million in May. Kavuri became a self-appointed champion for creditors, building an online community that tracks bankruptcy developments. Italian creditor Lidia Favario, who lost her savings from a car crash settlement, filed numerous objections targeting Sullivan & Cromwell’s fees, noting one professional spent over $1,000 on taxis in a single week. Creditors argued that they should recover digital assets at their current values rather than the November 2022 frozen cash values. An account containing $50,000 in bitcoin would now be worth around $350,000, representing approximately 600% appreciation. SBF maintains that FTX had nearly $15 billion in net assets when it collapsed and estimates the estate would be worth at least $119 billion today if the bankruptcy team had done nothing. His legal team plans to center his appeal on questions surrounding FTX’s solvency, arguing that the jury never saw evidence that the company had sufficient assets to repay its customers. John J. Ray III, CEO of FTX Group. | Source: Mother Jones Ray sold FTX-owned LedgerX to investors, including Zach Dexter, the FTX.US chief who urged SBF to step aside, for $50 million after FTX paid nearly $300 million to acquire it in 2021. Sullivan & Cromwell’s Andrew Dietderich called LedgerX a “horrible investment,” though the firm had helped broker the original deal and billed $1.5 million for that work. FTX’s stake in Anthropic netted more than $1.3 billion during the bankruptcy. By late September, the FTX Estate had distributed nearly $8 billion to creditors. Oral arguments for Bankman-Fried’s appeal are scheduled for November 4 at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York. However, federal acquittal rates remain historically low at less than 1%.

Key Takeaways: Germany missed out on $3.57 billion in unrealized gains after selling 50,000 BTC before Bitcoin’s surge past $125,000. Lawmakers criticized the early liquidation, while the US opted to hold nearly 200,000 BTC in a strategic reserve. Despite the misstep, Germany continues advancing crypto regulation, adoption, and tax reform ahead of 2026. In early 2024, the German government held 50,000 BTC , then worth around $2.2 billion, following a seizure from the operators of Movie2K, a piracy website. By July 12, 2024, the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) had sold nearly the entire amount for approximately $2.89 billion, averaging $57,900 per coin. Germany Misses $3.57B Gain After Selling BTC Before $125K Surge Just over a year later, Bitcoin has more than doubled in price. At $125,000 per BTC, Germany’s 50,000 Bitcoin would now be worth $6.25 billion. The early liquidation cost the country an estimated $3.57 billion in unrealized gains. The sell-off was conducted in compliance with German law, which mandates the sale of volatile seized assets to protect against further price swings. Critics argue the move was shortsighted. Bundestag member Joana Cotar urged lawmakers last July to consider holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, saying, “It is not sensible to sell the Bitcoins now. It would be better to keep them as a reserve currency.” Statt #Bitcoin als strategische Reservewährung zu halten, wie es in den USA bereits debattiert wird, verkauft unsere Regierung im großen Stil. Ich habe @MPKretschmer , @c_lindner & @Bundeskanzler @OlafScholz darüber informiert, warum dies nicht nur nicht sinnvoll, sondern… pic.twitter.com/v9FpzmfLbp — Joana Cotar (@JoanaCotar) July 4, 2024 By contrast, the US government has taken a more patient approach. Washington currently holds 198,022 BTC, valued at over $24 billion, and recently launched a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve with no plans for liquidation. Germany’s missed windfall comes despite its growing commitment to the digital asset economy. Crypto is fully legal in the country under the European Union’s MiCA regulation, with oversight from BaFin, Germany’s financial regulator. User adoption is accelerating, particularly among Gen Z and millennials, who are expected to make up half of Germany’s projected 27 million crypto users by 2025 . Deutsche Bank is preparing to roll out digital asset custody services by 2026, and the government is pushing forward with tax reforms and stricter reporting rules. Gains on long-term crypto holdings remain tax-free if held for over a year, and DAC 8 regulations will soon require crypto providers to disclose transaction details to tax authorities. Germany May Have Missed $5B in Untouched Movie2K Bitcoin, Arkham Finds In September, crypto analytics firm Arkham uncovered over 45,000 BTC , worth nearly $5 billion, still sitting idle in more than 100 wallets tied to the defunct piracy site Movie2K. These coins, untouched since 2019, were not part of Germany’s official seizure earlier this year, raising concerns that authorities may have overlooked a major portion of the case’s digital assets. “This is most likely still under the control of the Movie2K operators,” Arkham wrote. “It has not moved since 2019 and is split across more than 100 wallets.” The post While Traders HODL, Germany Loses $3.6B Dumping 50K BTC Before $125K ATH appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|Germany,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|ARKM,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-05 10:11:27

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin hit a new all-time high above $125,700 as “Uptober” momentum kicked in. Exchange balances fell to multi‑year lows, with over 114,000 BTC leaving platforms in two weeks. Tightening supply and OTC desk chatter point to potential spot shortages if price fails to cool. The milestone comes as centralized exchanges report the lowest levels of Bitcoin reserves in six years, signaling a tightening supply backdrop amid growing investor demand. Bitcoin Kicks Off ‘Uptober’ With Sharp Rebound From September Lows The sharp recovery marks a strong start to October, often dubbed “Uptober” by traders, after Bitcoin slipped to $107,800 in early September. Over the past week, the asset has climbed steadily, buoyed by renewed optimism and tightening exchange liquidity. “Bitcoin hits new all-time high … And most people still don’t even know what Bitcoin is,” said Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store and Nova Dius. Bitcoin hits new all-time high… And most people still don’t even know what bitcoin is. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) October 5, 2025 Glassnode data shows the total Bitcoin held on exchanges dropped to 2.83 million BTC on Saturday, the lowest level since June 2019, when Bitcoin traded around $8,000 during a bear market. CryptoQuant posted a slightly lower reserve figure of 2.45 million BTC, placing it at a seven-year low. More than 114,000 BTC, valued over $14 billion, has exited exchanges in just two weeks. This mass outflow suggests a shift toward long-term holding, with Bitcoin moving into self-custody, institutional wallets, or digital asset treasuries. Coins held on exchanges are considered “available supply,” more likely to be sold. As reserves dry up, upward price pressure builds. “Hearing exchanges are out of Bitcoin,” tweeted Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck. “Monday 9:30 am might be the first official shortage,” he added, cautioning that this wasn’t financial advice—but suggesting it might be time to act. Hearing exchanges are out of Bitcoin. Monday 9:30am might be the first official shortage. Not financial advice… just: it might make sense to get some. https://t.co/yNSMEw2oms — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 3, 2025 Investor Mike Alfred echoed the sentiment, revealing a call with a major OTC desk operator who said they could run out of Bitcoin within hours of futures markets opening, unless the price breaks above $126,000. “Things getting wild,” Alfred said. Strategy Inc.’s Bitcoin Holdings Hit $77.4B as Treasury Bet Pays Off As reported, Bitcoin’s surge past $124,000 has driven Strategy Inc.’s BTC holdings to a record $77.4 billion, the company revealed Friday. The firm, which began accumulating BTC in 2020 as a corporate treasury asset, has seen its holdings grow exponentially from an initial valuation of $2.1 billion to over 35 times that amount in just five years. Strategy weathered the volatility of crypto markets with continued purchases during downturns, pushing its position to $8 billion in 2023 and more than doubling that to $41.8 billion by 2024. The 2025 rally has now pushed it to unprecedented levels, reinforcing the firm’s conviction that Bitcoin is a long-term hedge against fiat depreciation. In a further boost, Strategy confirmed it will not face billions in taxes on unrealized crypto gains after updated IRS guidance clarified that such gains are excluded from the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. With around $28 billion in unrealized profit, the tax exemption cements Strategy’s position as the leading example of corporate Bitcoin accumulation.

While ADA’s fundamentals remain strong, substantial portions of the crypto community are now buzzing about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a utility-oriented DeFi altcoin at $0.035. With its presale Stage 6 already over 55% sold, Mutuum Finance is gaining traction in a hurry. Its double lending infrastructure, real-yield dynamics, and non-custodial smart contracts give it sound foundations that set it apart from ordinary altcoins, making it the top choice for 100× gains in the next market cycle. Cardano (ADA) Searches for Key Levels Before Potential Bullish Trend Cardano (ADA) has remained technically strong in recent days, with the 3-day chart illustrating a steadfast move up to $0.85, touching the $0.87 zone briefly. The spike indicates the bull forces are building up after the consolidation period, showing investors buying confidently. Traders are now watching critical upside goals: $0.95, $1.00, $1.05, $1.17, and $1.33, each of which, if taken out, could signal the start of more sustained rally. The series of increasing higher lows and persistent accumulation warrants a measured but possibly powerful advance, making ADA an excellent point of attention for investors monitoring mid-cap altcoin potential. While market participants notice such technical developments with a great deal of interest, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also gaining popularity, a sign of the diversity of the opportunities available in the crypto economy. Mutuum Finance Presale Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its sixth presale round. The venture has already exceeded 16,750 signed-up members and more than $16.85 million, and continues to show growing confidence in the market in its long-term venture. Investors seeking long-term value and sustainable returns will find Mutuum Finance’s growing ecosystem as an investment opportunity to consider. The platform further has very robust Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation mechanism that real-time adjusts for shock collateral price. This is supported by another barrier of protection through management of 10% to 35% reserve multiplier on more riskier classes of collateral. Open architecture and security by design enable Mutuum Finance to be long-term, stable, and secure DeFi platform designed for the long term and to put the times to the test. The project classifies the vulnerabilities into four categories, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, and provides a rational model for detection and prevention of such a trap before it impacts users. Mutuum Finance New Lending & Borrowing Platform Mutuum Finance recently introduced a new lending and borrowing protocol for its decentralized finance platform. Version 1 (V1) will go live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will encompass major features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. Lending, borrowing, and collateralization of ETH and USDT will become supported on launch day, signaling the start of a seamless and open-ended crypto DeFi experience. MUTM Emerges as the DeFi Altcoin to Watch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about sub-$1 cryptocurrencies. Stage 6 of its presale is already over 55% sold, with more than 16,750 investors who have invested over $16.85 million to date. Its imminent launch of its V1 lending and borrowing protocol on Sepolia Testnet with ETH and USDT support places MUTM in the spotlight as a secure, utility-driven DeFi platform with massive upside potential. With advanced risk management tools and a secure foundation, the project is compelling to early investors as well as long-term holders. While Cardano (ADA) is eyeing $1.50, MUTM’s combination of state-of-the-art tokenomics, real-yield mechanics, and vertically scalable infrastructure has the market excited about its ability to provide 100× returns. Join the MUTM presale today to be part of what could be the next DeFi breakout project.

With that kind of capital inflow and momentum, one leading analyst is boldly claiming Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the best crypto to buy over Solana and Ripple, and gives three clear reasons to back it up. While Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) are established projects with track records, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out as a far more exciting opportunity right now. Compared to SOL and XRP, which at their current scale may see only incremental gains, LILPEPE’s early stage gives it asymmetric upside. With its explosive growth and unique positioning, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has captured the spotlight as the best crypto to buy, according to the leading analyst. The potential upside could outpace major cryptocurrencies and give early adopters a chance at extraordinary returns. Why Analysts Say Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the Best Crypto to Buy The analyst’s call is rooted in three major factors that separate LILPEPE from Solana and Ripple. These factors combine strong technology, community enthusiasm, and proven security to create one of the most promising new crypto assets. Built for the Meme Economy with Next-Level Technology Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is more than a meme coin. It is built on a Layer 2 blockchain that was made just for ecosystems that are based on memes. This design allows for very low fees, transactions that happen almost instantly, and the potential to support decentralized apps (dApps). Little Pepe (LILPEPE) came out of the marshes of Solidity and the jungles of JavaScript. He was small but powerful. Its community often says it is just green candles, legendary vibes, and glorious decentralization. Even better, its network is designed so that sniper bots cannot exploit it, something that makes it stand out in a market where fairness matters. With such a distinctive technological foundation, analysts see Little Pepe (LILPEPE) as the best crypto to buy right now, especially for those who believe in the meme economy’s explosive future. Presale Success and Strong Investor Momentum Another reason Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is attracting attention is its presale performance. Starting with Stage 1 priced at just $0.0010, each stage has sold out faster than the last. Stage 12 concluded at record speed, highlighting unprecedented demand, while Stage 13 tokens are now priced at $0.0022. With an expected launch price of $0.0030, early investors are already positioned to secure meaningful gains before it even lists on major exchanges. The presale accounts for 26.5% of the total 100 billion token supply and has already attracted thousands of unique wallets. While Solana and Ripple remain steady, they do not offer the same kind of early-stage asymmetric growth opportunity. That is why experts continue to argue that Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the best crypto to buy for forward-looking investors. Expert Backing and Verified Security Community confidence is further boosted by the project’s support from anonymous experts who have previously contributed to some of the most successful meme coins in the market. Their involvement has added credibility to Little Pepe (LILPEPE), which has already been listed on CoinMarketCap, signaling recognition within the crypto space. Security and trust also remain a top priority. LILPEPE has been successfully audited by CertiK, achieving an impressive security score of 95.49%. With both credibility and security in place, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) demonstrates why it stands apart as the best crypto to buy compared to larger but slower-moving assets like Solana and Ripple. Conclusion Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is still in its early growth phase, offering an unmatched opportunity for high returns. With advanced Layer 2 technology, record-breaking presale success, expert support, and a CertiK audit for security, LILPEPE has everything needed to dominate the meme token space. That is why analysts are calling it the best crypto to buy right now, outshining Solana and Ripple as the must-watch investment of the year.

Whale wallets holding 100K–1M XRP sold over $300M in 10 days, the lowest balance in 34 months. Markets price a 96.2% chance of a Fed rate cut on Oct 29, which historically supports risk assets like XRP. XRP breakout: concise analysis of whale selloff, wedge setup, and Fed-driven catalysts — read latest signals and key levels to watch. XRP whales dump $300M as price builds a bullish wedge. Can XRP trigger a breakout to $3.65. XRP is forming a bullish wedge and flipping key resistance levels into support. Whale wallets holding 100K–1M XRP dumped over $300M in 10 days, reaching the lowest holdings in nearly three years. Markets assign a 96.2% probability of a Fed rate cut on Oct 29, setting the stage for potential gains to assets like XRP. XRP has been steady under $3.20 for over 300 days , showing strong signs of a breakout. Despite a $300 million whale selloff, the coin gained nearly 10% last week, trading at $3.07 with high volume. What is driving the XRP breakout setup? The XRP breakout setup is driven by a weekly falling wedge pattern, flipped support zones near $2.50–$2.70, and consolidation below the all‑time high. High trading volume and macro catalysts like an anticipated Fed rate cut are increasing the probability of an upward breakout. How have technical patterns and volume contributed? Weekly chart structure shows a classic bullish falling wedge, with decreasing lows compressing toward the apex. Volume has expanded on recent upward moves, indicating buyer interest. Key levels to watch: support at $1.70 and $2.50–$2.70, resistance near $3.20 and $3.65. How did the whale exodus affect XRP price dynamics? On‑chain data from Santiment indicates wallets holding 100K–1M XRP sold over $300 million in 10 days, taking holdings to a 34‑month low. This distribution coincided with price strength, suggesting mid‑tier whales were taking profits into demand rather than forcing a sustained downtrend. EXPLOSIVE XRP BREAKOUT The longer it consolidates, the bigger the expansion… For over 300 Days $XRP has been trading just below its previous all time high holding its incredible gain, only a matter of time until $3.65 breaks… $4.50 is inevitable pic.twitter.com/tPMrtL3Esw — CRYPTOWZRD (@cryptoWZRD_) October 4, 2025 XRP has flipped resistance zones into support, particularly around the $2.50–$2.70 range, and the wedge is nearing its apex. A lower zone near $1.70 has also held firm, reinforcing a bullish structure that could push XRP past the prior peak near $3.20 from January 2018. This trajectory places an initial breakout target near $3.65. If that level holds as new support, technical projections indicate a run toward $4.50, with larger rallies possible if momentum and liquidity remain strong. Why does the macro outlook (Fed policy) matter for XRP? Markets are pricing a 96.2% probability of a Fed rate cut on Oct 29, according to CME data. Historically, lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of risk assets and can boost demand for cryptocurrencies. A confirmed cut would likely support broader altcoin gains, including XRP. What risks should traders monitor? Key risks include renewed whale selling, failure to hold $3.65 after a breakout, and macro surprises from central bank communications. Reduced liquidity near resistance and rapid profit‑taking can trigger volatility; traders should use risk management and monitor on‑chain whale balance trends. Frequently Asked Questions Can XRP reach $3.65 this month? XRP can reach $3.65 if the wedge breakout occurs with supporting volume and the Fed reduces rates as expected. Monitor confirmed closes above $3.20 and sustained support at $2.50–$2.70 for validation. Did whales actually sell $300M of XRP? On‑chain metrics indicate that wallets holding 100K–1M XRP sold over $300 million in a 10‑day span, representing the lowest holding level for that cohort in 34 months, according to Santiment and blockchain analytics cited by market observers. Key Takeaways Bullish pattern: Falling wedge near apex suggests breakout potential. Whale activity: $300M sold by mid‑tier wallets — distribution into demand. Macro catalyst: High probability of a Fed rate cut could lift XRP and altcoins. Conclusion XRP breakout prospects hinge on technical validation and macro catalysts. The falling wedge, flipped support zones, and favorable Fed rate expectations create a plausible path toward $3.65 and beyond. Traders should watch volume, whale balances, and confirmed closes above $3.20 before increasing exposure. For continued coverage, follow COINOTAG reporting and on‑chain analysis updates.

Additionally, the analyst noted that short-sellers between $118,000 and $108,000 are now trapped after the breakout, making this zone a likely area of significant buying pressure if retested. Now, any dip into this range would be a “blessing,” while avoiding a pullback could see Bitcoin surge past $150,000. Whales showing more interest in Bitcoin On-chain data further supports the possibility of continued momentum as large investors show growing confidence in the asset. To this end, data shared by Ali Martinez indicates that Bitcoin’s accumulation trend score has climbed to 0.74, reflecting steady balance growth among both new and existing wallets. The metric, tracked by Glassnode , signals aggressive accumulation when elevated, pointing to rising demand from larger entities.

According to CryptoQuant’s latest findings, this historic inflow was largely driven by strong stablecoin deposits as the exchange continues to reign as the leading liquidity hub in global crypto markets. Binance Dominates Q3 When deposits exceed withdrawals, it signals positive netflows. CryptoQuant explained that this means that investors are channeling new funds into the exchange. Such an influx provides meaningful purchasing power ready to be deployed across both spot trading and derivatives markets. Often described as crypto’s “dry powder,” stablecoin accumulation on exchanges signals investor readiness to deploy funds into assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and beyond. On the other hand, competitors have been significantly behind Binance. For instance, OKX recorded just $1.61 billion and Bybit $1.33 billion in Q3 inflows, as per DeFiLlama’s data. CryptoQuant stated, “This broad appeal stems from Binance’s ability to attract both institutional and retail investors across multiple regions, cementing its position as the primary gateway for crypto capital. Conclusion: The record-breaking Q3 net inflow not only reinforces Binance’s leadership among CEXs but also signals growing momentum across the broader crypto ecosystem.” Binance’s Lead in Spot Volume As reported by CryptoPotato earlier, in the first half of 2025, Binance registered over 37% of global market share, which is equivalent to $3.44 trillion in traded volume. This overwhelming lead positioned the crypto exchange as the premier hub for Bitcoin liquidity, where major flow activity and whale trades often originate. By comparison, competitors like Bybit, Crypto.com, Coinbase, and OKX collectively made up just 29%, while platforms such as Upbit, Bitget, and HuobiPro hovered near 5%. Meanwhile, other exchanges such as Kraken, KuCoin, and Gate.io contributed under 3%. In mid-September, Binance’s spot trading volume briefly surpassed the combined volume of all other exchanges. The last time this phenomenon occurred was immediately after the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, when BTC skyrocketed from 40K to 73K in a short period of time.

52702711,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=32090,1759661252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,Solana and the Institutional Pivot: Bitwise CIO Lays Out Vision,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-and-the-institutional-pivot-bitwise-cio-lays-out-vision/,"Solana is gaining renewed attention among institutional investors, according to Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer of crypto asset manager Bitwise. Hougan recently told Solana Labs that Solana has the potential to become “the new Wall Street” among blockchain networks. He emphasized that to traditional financial audiences, Bitcoin feels “very ephemeral” and difficult to conceptualize in institutional investment frameworks. Instead, he said, these investors are watching stablecoins and tokenization more closely: “Really important people are saying that stablecoins will reinvent payments and tokenization will reinvent stock, bond, commodity, and real estate markets.” When evaluating blockchain platforms, Hougan said institutions gravitate toward efficiency, low latency, and transaction finality. In that context, he pointed to improvements in Solana’s settlement speed—from 400 microseconds to 150 microseconds —as an attribute that interfaces well with how institutional players like to trade. Solana’s Place in the Stablecoin Landscape Despite Solana’s growing traction, it remains small in comparison to Ethereum in the stablecoin space. On Solana, on-chain stablecoin value totals about $13.9 billion , giving it 4.7% market share as measured by RWA.xyz. Ethereum, by contrast, holds a dominant position: ~$172.5 billion in stablecoin value, or ~59%, which rises to 65% when layer-2s are included (e.g. Arbitrum, Base, Polygon). AJ Warner, Chief Strategy Officer at Offchain Labs, contrasted the two platforms, asserting: “TVL is definitely not everything, but I don’t think you can doubt where the best place to launch new stablecoins is. Build within the EVM.” This underscores that many in the industry still see Ethereum’s ecosystem and compatibility as a strong moat. Bitwise’s Long Bet on Solana Bitwise has been publicly bullish on Solana before. At Token2049 in Singapore, its CEO Hunter Horsley argued that Solana may outshine Ethereum in the staking ETF arena. His argument hinged on Solana’s faster unstaking period , which is important for funds that must be able to redeem assets swiftly. Bitwise currently offers a Physical Solana ETP , allowing investors exposure to SOL via fully backed assets in institutional custody. However, this product remains modest in size, with approximately $30 million in assets under management. A more ambitious move is Bitwise’s application for a spot Solana ETF , with regulatory approval expected (or decided) around October 16. At the time of Hougan’s remarks, SOL was trading around $227 , down 2% on the day and more than 22% below its January high. Betting on the Future of Tokenization Hougan’s thesis frames Solana not merely as a blockchain, but as a platform poised for adoption by Wall Street players. Stablecoins and tokenization represent an entry point for institutional flows. If a network offers low friction, high throughput, and reliable finality, it could become a preferred infrastructure for tokenizing real-world assets. Whether Solana can climb further against Ethereum’s entrenched position remains a question—yet Bitwise is clearly positioning itself for that possibility.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|ETH|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-05 10:47:32

The warning comes as declining Layer 1 fee revenues coincide with rising ETH dilution for non-stakers, threatening the long-term value proposition for investors who don’t participate in staking. Source: VanEck VanEck Questions DAT Sustainability Amid Declining Volatility VanEck’s September monthly report highlighted how entities like Bitmine Immersion Technologies and Strategy have driven the DAT boom, though sustainability hinges on maintaining volatility-driven funding mechanisms. The firm noted that these “ volatility reactors ” require continual market turbulence to enable further cryptocurrency purchases. Yet, Bitcoin’s 30-day trailing volatility has trended lower over nearly a decade, largely due to its broader adoption. Source: VanEck The warning comes as Ethereum’s upcoming Fusaka upgrade , scheduled for December 3, threatens to accelerate dilution for non-stakers through increased Layer 2 adoption that has historically cannibalized mainnet fee revenue. Market pressures have intensified as many DAT valuations have slipped below their net asset values, with VanEck pointing to Bitmine’s recent capital raise, where the firm sold a package effectively valued at $104.61 for $70, representing a 75% discount in volatility. Several major DATs, including Semler Scientific, Strive, KindlyMD, and Empery Digital, now trade below their market NAVs, raising concerns about depleting the “volatility well” that enables further asset purchases. Notably, according to a recent Cryptonews report, Standard Chartered analysts offered a contrasting view, arguing that Ethereum could emerge as the biggest winner from the DAT trend due to staking yields that should command higher market-to-net-asset-value premiums than those of its Bitcoin counterparts. Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s global head of digital assets research, noted that Ethereum treasuries have accumulated approximately 3.1% of the circulating supply since June, compared to 4% for Bitcoin and just 0.8% for Solana. Ethereum Treasuries Accelerate Accumulation Despite Market Headwinds Corporate Ethereum accumulation has accelerated despite broader market weakness, with Bitmine purchasing another $69 million worth of ETH through Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter desk on September 19. The acquisition brought Bitmine’s holdings to roughly 1.95 million ETH valued at $8.66 billion, representing nearly 2% of Ethereum’s circulating supply and establishing the firm as the dominant corporate ETH treasury holder. Blockchain records showed Galaxy Digital settled 15,427 ETH to Bitmine across four coordinated transfers within an hour, following earlier September purchases of 46,255 ETH worth $201 million and 80,325 ETH valued at $358 million. BitMine stock ($BMNR) climbed over 6% after the company disclosed it purchased nearly $1 billion in Ethereum, increasing its total $ETH treasury valuation to $11 billion. #Ethereum #Bitmine #ETH https://t.co/O0hW0xUrLX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 29, 2025 SharpLink Gaming also expanded its position to 838,152 ETH while repurchasing nearly 1.94 million shares under a buyback program , citing undervaluation. The company reported a net asset value of $3.86 billion with no outstanding debt and has generated 3,240 ETH in staking rewards since June. Similarly, the Ether Machine filed a draft SEC registration statement on September 17 for its planned merger with Nasdaq-listed SPAC Dynamix Corporation. The firm added 150,000 ETH in August alone, bringing total holdings to 495,362 ETH worth approximately $2.16 billion. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter pending shareholder approval. Fusaka Upgrade Raises Stakes for Staked Versus Unstaked ETH Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled Fusaka as the network’s most ambitious scaling upgrade , introducing PeerDAS technology that allows validator nodes to verify information by checking small random pieces rather than downloading complete data blocks. The upgrade will more than double blob capacity within two weeks through automated parameter-only forks, expanding from the current limits of 6/9 blobs to 14/21. Source: VanEck The revolutionary approach uses mathematical probability to ensure data availability, requiring only that more than 50% of data chunks remain accessible across the network for complete reconstruction. Buterin described the technology as “ unprecedented ” for live blockchains and emphasized the cautious testing approach developers adopted despite years of preparation. The upgrade addresses mounting economic pressures as Ethereum’s August revenue fell 44% to $14.1 million despite ETH reaching new all-time highs above $4,950. It will also alleviate current network congestion, forcing over 2 million ETH into exit queues, which face 43-day delays, while entry processing is completed in just 7 days. VanEck stressed that as institutional actors like DATs and ETPs accumulate long-term ETH positions to stake for in-kind yield, investors holding unstaked ETH face increasing exposure to dilution. The firm noted Ethereum’s value proposition is trending away from fee-driven yield-bearing asset status toward a purely monetary role, with enhanced economic security for L1 settlements becoming increasingly important as more activity migrates to cheaper L2 networks.

52701387,https://cryptonews.com/?p=433172,1759661880,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52701387.jpeg,Stripe CEO: Stablecoins Will Force Banks to Offer Competitive Deposit Yields,https://cryptonews.com/news/stripe-ceo-stablecoins-will-force-banks-to-offer-competitive-deposit-yields/,"Stripe CEO Patrick Collison believes the growing popularity of stablecoins will eventually force banks to raise deposit yields or risk losing customers. Key Takeaways: Stripe CEO Patrick Collison says stablecoins will pressure banks to offer more competitive deposit yields. He criticized banks’ reliance on low-interest savings accounts, calling it an unsustainable and consumer-hostile strategy. As stablecoins grow, market forces may force traditional banks to adapt or lose customers. In a post responding to venture capitalist Nic Carter on X , Collison said that depositors “are going to, and should, earn something closer to a market return on their capital.” Collison Says Banks Rely Too Much on Cheap Deposits Amid Low Savings Yields Citing the current savings account yields, which are just 0.40% in the US and 0.25% in the EU, Collison argued that banks have relied too heavily on cheap deposits. “Cheap deposits are great, but being so consumer-hostile feels to me like a losing position,” he added. His comments come amid growing tension between the banking sector and the rapidly evolving stablecoin industry. Stablecoins have seen rapid adoption since 2023, particularly after the U.S. passed the GENIUS bill, which established a regulated framework for issuing stablecoins. However, the bill also barred issuers from offering yield, a provision heavily influenced by banking lobbyists. Good post on evolving stablecoin market structure. I would extend it further: yes, I think that stablecoin issuers are going to have to share yield with others, but this is just one instance. Everyone is going to have to share yield. Today, the average interest on US savings… https://t.co/yjjLOzxoOk — Patrick Collison (@patrickc) October 3, 2025 Banks have voiced concern that yield-bearing stablecoins could siphon off customer deposits. “Do you want a stablecoin issuer to be able to issue interest? Probably not, because if they are issuing interest, there is no reason to put your money in a local bank,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand at the DC Blockchain Summit in March. Despite restrictions, crypto executives see stablecoins as a looming threat to traditional banking rails. As demand grows for higher returns and seamless digital payments, the pressure on banks to compete could intensify. While financial institutions have so far relied on regulatory protections to block interest-bearing stablecoins, Stripe’s chief executive warns that market forces may push banks to finally offer fair yields. “The business imperative here is clear,” Collison said. Crypto.com Integrates Morpho for Stablecoin Lending on Cronos As reported, Crypto.com is integrating Morpho , the second-largest DeFi lending protocol, into its platform to launch stablecoin lending markets directly on the Cronos blockchain. The partnership will allow users to deposit wrapped versions of Bitcoin and Ethereum (CDCBTC and CDCETH) and borrow stablecoins against them without leaving the Crypto.com ecosystem. The move aims to enhance user experience by embedding Morpho’s protocol into Crypto.com’s interface, removing the need for third-party wallets. Morpho, which has over $7.7 billion in total value locked, will also be accessible to US users, despite restrictions from the Genius Act, since lending stablecoins remains legally permissible. Furthermore, Swiss digital asset bank Sygnum has introduced a new fund offering investors the ability to earn yield on their Bitcoin holdings while maintaining full price exposure. The BTC Alpha Fund, launched in collaboration with Athens-based Starboard Digital, employs arbitrage trading strategies to target annual returns between 8% and 10%, paid directly in Bitcoin. The fund is domiciled in the Cayman Islands and is designed for institutional and professional investors. It allows participants to grow their Bitcoin positions by converting trading gains into BTC, rather than fiat.

Notably, this bullish form coincided with an impressive price performance by Bitcoin during which the premier cryptocurrency gained by 11.35% to move to around the $122,000 price region. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Attract Second-Highest Record Weekly Net Deposits According to data from SoSoValue , Bitcoin Spot ETFs are back in strong form, recording $3.24 billion in net inflows at the start of October. This rebound follows the $902.5 million in net outflows during the final week of September and marks the second-largest weekly inflow since the ETFs launched in March 2024. The week’s highest inflow came on October 3, with $985.08 million, while the lowest was seen on September 30, at $429.96 million. In analyzing each of the 12 Bitcoin spot ETFs’ performances, it was generally a widespread positive performance. BlackRock’s IBIT shone brightly with $1.82 billion in net deposits, moving its cumulative net inflow to $62.63 billion and total net assets to $96.20 billion. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC also grabbed a share of the spotlight, securing a massive $691.92 million in net inflows. Ark/21Shares’ ARKB brought in $254.54 million, while Bitwise’s BITB added $211.86 million. Grayscale recorded similar results on both products: its BTC fund secured $87.25 million, while the converted GBTC posted $57.27 million. Notably, VanEck’s HODL followed with $65.06 million, and Invesco’s BTCO took in $35.35 million. Smaller but still positive inflows were noted for Franklin Templeton’s EZBC ($16.52 million) and Valkyrie ($4.03 million). Meanwhile, WisdomTree’s BTCW and Hashdex’s DEFI both reported no inflows for the week. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin spot ETFs have a cumulative net inflow of $60.05 billion, while their combined total net assets are valued at $164.50 billion, representing. 6.74% of the Bitcoin market cap. Ethereum ETFs Match Market Optimism With $1.30 Billion In Net Inflows In other news, Ethereum Spot ETFs also shared in the Q4 market euphoria, recording $1.30 billion in aggregate inflows. Leading the charge was BlackRock’s ETHA, which continued to outperform peers with $691.66 million in net deposits. Combined, these funds now hold $30.57 billion in total net assets, representing 5.58% of Ethereum’s total market capitalization. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $121,997 following a 0.31% decline in the last day.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-xrp-will-benefit-from-uptober-heres-why/,"Crypto commentator Austin Hilton recently shared his perspective on October’s importance for XRP , noting that several factors could make the month unusually significant for the digital asset. In his video update, Hilton pointed out that October, often referred to in crypto circles as “Uptober,” has historically been favorable for the market, particularly for Bitcoin. While XRP’s history has been complicated by years of litigation that limited its participation in previous cycles, Hilton believes that this October presents a different picture, with developments that could drive price and interest upward. XRP will benefit from Uptober! pic.twitter.com/VFF0W8GagO — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) October 3, 2025 SEC Decisions and ETF Prospects Hilton emphasized that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to decide on an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) during October . He also referenced the broader landscape of ETF applications, with more than a dozen awaiting review and potential approval. According to him, these rulings could open the door for institutional inflows, similar to what was observed when Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs entered the market. Hilton explained that this kind of financial instrument enables investors to gain exposure without directly holding the tokens, a move that typically boosts liquidity and trading activity. Government Shutdown and Its Market Effects Another major factor Hilton raised was the current U.S. government shutdown. Drawing from historical precedent, he reminded his audience that the last extended shutdown in 2018 lasted 35 days. However, the cryptocurrency market at that time was smaller and less connected to mainstream financial dynamics. What makes the present situation different, according to Hilton, is that a large portion of today’s crypto investors have never experienced a government shutdown’s influence on the market. Early indications suggest that this event is pushing some capital away from traditional assets into alternatives such as gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies. Hilton pointed out that XRP itself has gained around 15% in recent days, which he views as a sign of shifting sentiment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Impact Hilton’s analysis also touched on Bitcoin’s recent strength, which he sees as directly influencing the altcoin market. With Bitcoin nearing potential new highs, he argued that XRP and other digital assets are benefiting from the broader upward momentum. He noted that only a week prior, he had expected the first half of October to remain relatively flat. However, those expectations changed with the unexpected impact of the government shutdown. The combination of liquidity inflows, ETF anticipation, and shifting investor behavior has created what Hilton described as uncharted territory for XRP and the wider crypto market. Hilton concluded by stressing the importance of monitoring how these variables unfold over the remainder of October. The government shutdown’s duration, SEC decisions on ETFs, and the re-entry of retail investors are all key elements he believes will determine how the month plays out. He added that stablecoin reserves remain high, which suggests that significant amounts of capital are still on the sidelines, waiting for the right moment to re-enter the market. For Hilton, this combination of factors makes October one of the most critical months to watch for XRP in recent memory.

DOGE closed the latest period up 9% despite a broader $20 billion memecoin pullback, and it has rallied ~21% over 30 days. This relative strength matters because it signals rotation back into higher-risk assets, with whales and HODLers reducing selling pressure and preserving support levels. Source: Coinglass (plain text) How do on-chain metrics support a bullish Dogecoin price outlook? On-chain metrics show a healthier structural setup: net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) indicates a support band near $0.23–$0.25, while net-realized profit-loss trends and whale injections point to accumulation rather than distribution. What evidence shows whales are accumulating DOGE? Large addresses injected an estimated 30 million DOGE at the start of Q4. With top-1% holdings at a record share and derivatives positions muted, the pattern is consistent with smart-money accumulation rather than short-term speculative leverage. DOGE’s on-chain metrics translate to stronger gains Dogecoin’s recent on-chain activity is translating into tangible returns for traders. Q3 delivered an approximate 41% ROI for DOGE, showing renewed investor interest after earlier volatility. Source: Glassnode (plain text) At press time DOGE trades around $0.26, up intraday, with $0.24–$0.25 acting as a multi-touch support aligned to realized price clusters. With HODLers returning to profit and smart-money stacking, a $0.30 breakout would strengthen the Dogecoin ETF narrative if spot demand sustains. Frequently Asked Questions Is Dogecoin accumulation by whales a reliable bullish signal? Yes. Large-address accumulation often precedes sustained rallies when derivatives risk remains controlled. DOGE’s top-1% holdings at ~96.45% and recent 30M DOGE inflows suggest supply concentration supporting higher lows. What price levels should traders watch for DOGE? Traders should monitor $0.23–$0.25 as support and $0.30 as a key breakout target. Maintaining support in the $0.24 region would reinforce bullish momentum and re-open upside toward $0.30. How does derivatives activity affect Dogecoin’s outlook? Lower derivatives leverage reduces short-term liquidation risk, allowing spot accumulation to drive price discovery. Current data show derivatives are not signaling an overheated market, favoring a measured rally. Key Takeaways Whale-backed supply : Top 1% addresses hold ~96.45%, indicating concentrated accumulation and reduced free float. On-chain support : NUPL and net-realized metrics point to $0.23–$0.25 as meaningful support levels. Actionable insight : Monitor $0.24 for continuation and $0.30 for confirmation of a bullish breakout; maintain risk management. Conclusion Dogecoin’s price outlook is improving on a foundation of large-address accumulation, supportive on-chain metrics and contained derivatives risk. While past volatility remains a reminder to manage position size, COINOTAG’s analysis shows a credible path to $0.30 if spot demand continues. Stay focused on support bands and institutional flows for the next directional clues. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Dogecoin price outlook: whale accumulation and on-chain support set stage for $0.30 test"", ""description"": ""Dogecoin price outlook: DOGE shows whale-backed accumulation and strong on-chain support—watch $0.23–$0.25 for a potential $0.30 breakout.

While XRP maintains steady growth potential, analysts suggest that holders could unlock far higher upside by hedging into emerging PayFi opportunities. This has led many Ripple holders toward Remittix (RTX) — a viral presale project projected by some experts to deliver returns as high as 5,000%. As a PayFi platform combining crypto payments, fiat integration, and cross-border utility, Remittix offers what many view as the next evolution beyond XRP’s remittance model — giving investors a new frontier for long-term utility and growth. XRP Price and Wider Investor Sentiment Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP is currently worth $2.99, a 1.33% daily drop. The asset has a market capitalization of $179.48 billion with $5.98 billion in trading volume — falling by 20.11% over 24 hours. Despite this short-term adjustment, most long-term investors would rather invest in new DeFi projects and PayFi tokens that can be used for more than just sending money. This move into cross-chain DeFi initiatives and low gas fee cryptocurrency aligns with broader market trends that prioritize scalability and global access. As investors seek the next big altcoin 2025, Remittix is positioning itself as a strategic hedge in diversified crypto portfolios. Remittix Beta Wallet Live With Cross-Border Utility Remittix (RTX) costs $0.1130 per token and has raised over $27 million, selling 674 million+ tokens already. With Remittix Beta Wallet now live, users can manage 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies in real-time FX conversion. A major step for a crypto that’s addressing real-world problems, facilitating easy crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries. For remitters, freelancers, and international businesses, Remittix bridges traditional finance and blockchain via a deflationary token framework and low gas fee architecture. As a leading crypto presale 2025, it already demonstrates both tech readiness as well as adoption potential. How Remittix Is Building Market Steam: Effortless cross-border crypto payments for freelancers & remitters Real-world PayFi model harmonizing traditional banking & DeFi About 40,000 and rapidly expanding worldwide community of early supporters Fully audited and CertiK-verified smart contract Strategic exchange partnerships for enhanced liquidity Security, Listings, and Community Incentives Remittix is now fully verified by CertiK and is #1 in pre-launch tokens. This accreditation adds to its transparency, trust, and technical credibility. Investors can verify the full verification on the CertiK dashboard. The project has also confirmed two CEX listings — BitMart at the $20 million level and LBank after going past $22 million raised — which is proof of initial access to global liquidity. Meanwhile, the community giveaway of $250,000 and a 15% USDT referral program through the Remittix dashboard incentivize the community. As a DeFi project on its way to expansion, RTX is on investors’ radars for the next 100x crypto with real-world practicality and solid fundamentals. As XRP Price Prediction narratives unfold, Ripple owners are looking more and more towards diversification into PayFi coins like Remittix, which brings real-world payments, DeFi scalability, and certified security together.

Bitcoin’s bullish Elliott Wave structure signals strong momentum, with analysts eyeing a continued rally toward the $150K milestone. CrediBULL Crypto highlights a crucial buy zone between $110K and $120K as traders prepare for possible dips before the next surge. Sustained demand and market confidence could drive Bitcoin to new record highs, reinforcing optimism for a $165K target by early 2026. Bitcoin’s latest surge has sparked renewed market attention as analyst CrediBULL Crypto shared a chart-based forecast indicating the next major leg of the bull run has begun. The analysis, posted on social media, points to an impulsive breakout that supports targets above $150,000 while highlighting a demand band for buyers. According to CrediBULL Crypto, Bitcoin’s impulsive price breakout marks the start of a new upward phase. “We blast through it. Now that we’ve made new ATH’s in an impulsive manner, the next leg to 150k+ has begun imo,” he stated. His chart showed Bitcoin trading at $125,181.71 on October 5, 2025, with intraday gains as momentum strengthened. When is the buy zone and how should traders use it? The chart highlights a green buy zone between $110,000 and $120,000 as a prime demand area. CrediBULL noted that shorts initiated between $118K–$108K are likely “underwater” and that a dip into this zone could trigger heavy buying. Traders should view the $110K–$120K band as a strategic accumulation area, with risk management using clear stop levels below the zone and position sizing aligned to individual portfolios. Source: CrediBULL Crypto What are the projected targets and timeline?

52702598,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/shiba-inu-shib-vs-dogecoin-doge-traders-are-betting-on-a-third-meme-coin-little-pepe-lilpepe-for-22073-gains/,1759663140,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52702598.jpeg,Shiba Inu (SHIB) vs Dogecoin (DOGE): Traders Are Betting on a Third Meme Coin Little Pepe (LILPEPE) for 22073% Gains,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/shiba-inu-shib-vs-dogecoin-doge-traders-are-betting-on-a-third-meme-coin-little-pepe-lilpepe-for-22073-gains/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), once branded as the “Doge Killer,” has spent years trying to grow beyond its meme beginnings. With ShibaSwap and plans for its Shibarium network, the Team has added layers of utility. But market performance tells a different story. At the time of writing, the price of SHIB is $0.00001176 with a market cap of $6.96 billion and daily volume around $113 million. The token is down more than 43% year to date, showing how hard it is to spark another rally when supply runs in the hundreds of trillions. While SHIB maintains a loyal base, its oversized supply continues to suppress price growth. Investors who rode the 2021 wave remember the massive gains, but for newcomers, the coin feels like a slower-moving ship. This explains why traders who once bet on SHIB are now looking elsewhere for opportunities that may deliver the kind of exponential upside they crave. Dogecoin (DOGE): “The Original Meme Coin” Still Holds Its Crown Dogecoin (DOGE), often called “The Original Meme Coin,” has held onto mainstream attention longer than most predicted. Its simplicity, celebrity endorsements, and grassroots charm made it a cultural symbol. At the time of writing, the price of DOGE is $0.22 with a market cap of $35.65 billion and daily trading volume above $2.3 billion. That liquidity keeps it relevant, and its adoption stories, including tipping systems and even an ETF launched earlier this month, show it still commands serious recognition. Yet DOGE is down about 23% year to date. The coin’s massive scale makes sharp gains harder to achieve. While it continues to function as a steady meme asset, most investors agree the wild upside of DOGE’s early days is behind it. It is now more of a household name than a moonshot bet. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): “The Next Meme Evolution” Turning Heads This is where Little Pepe (LILPEPE) comes into play. Billed as “The Next Meme Evolution,” Little Pepe is capturing attention because it offers something both DOGE and SHIB no longer provide: the chance for fresh exponential growth. The presale is in Stage 13, with tokens selling at $0.0022. At the time of writing, $26.37 million has already been raised out of a target of $28.77 million, with more than 16.1 billion tokens sold out of 17.25 billion available in this stage. Early buyers from Stage 1 are already up 120% and even those entering now may see 36.36% gains by the time of launch at $0.0030. Certik has also audited Little Pepe, added to CoinMarketCap listings, and is running a $777k giveaway alongside a Mega Giveaway that rewards top presale buyers between Stage 12 and Stage 17 with over 15 ETH in prizes. The project has zero trade tax, anti-bot measures, and is built on a next-generation Layer 2 framework. This combination of meme culture and infrastructure is why many traders believe it has the right ingredients for breakout growth. Adding to its momentum, Little Pepe recently peaked at 100 on ChatGPT 5’s memecoin question trend between June and August 2025, overtaking PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB. That kind of community-driven interest suggests the token is resonating in ways that established meme coins may no longer achieve. Conclusion: The Third Wave Could Belong to Little Pepe Shiba Inu and Dogecoin remain cultural icons, but their growth curves now look more steady than explosive. For traders chasing fresh opportunities, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is being viewed as the superior bet. Its presale traction, audit, giveaways, and community buzz position it as a serious contender. While risks remain, the numbers and momentum suggest that the third wave of meme coins belongs to Little Pepe. Investors who missed DOGE and SHIB in their early days are watching closely. With the presale nearly sold out at Stage 13, many believe this is the window to enter before the token moves to higher stages. If sentiment holds, Little Pepe could be the project that turns speculative dreams into reality, with the projected 22,073% gains serving as a reminder of why meme coins still have the power to surprise.

Key Takeaways: Bitwise CIO believes Solana’s speed positions it as Wall Street’s preferred blockchain for stablecoins and tokenization. Hougan says tokenized stocks will reshape payments, stocks, bonds, and real estate. Bitwise sees Solana gaining ground, especially in ETF potential due to faster unstaking and trading efficiency. Speaking with Solana Labs’ Akshay Rajan on Oct. 2 , Hougan said, “I think Solana is the new Wall Street,” citing its performance and technical capabilities as key factors drawing institutional attention. Bitwise CIO: Stablecoins and Tokenization Will Reshape Global Finance According to Hougan, financial institutions are starting to take tokenization and stablecoins seriously, viewing them as transformative technologies that will reshape everything from payments to capital markets. “Really important people are saying that stablecoins will reinvent payments and tokenization will reinvent stock, bond, commodity, and real estate markets,” he said. Solana’s rapid settlement speeds, improving from 400 microseconds to 150 microseconds, are particularly appealing to institutions accustomed to fast-paced trading environments. “That’s how they like to trade,” Hougan noted, framing Solana’s architecture as better aligned with Wall Street expectations than slower alternatives. “Solana is the new Wall Street” – @Matt_Hougan , CIO @BitwiseInvest pic.twitter.com/gNfEu8Pbdr — Solana (@solana) October 3, 2025 Despite Ethereum’s dominance, Solana is making measurable progress. It now hosts $13.9 billion in onchain stablecoins, giving it a 4.7% share of the market, according to data from RWA.xyz. Ethereum still leads by a wide margin, with $172.5 billion in stablecoins across its mainnet and layer-2 ecosystems such as Arbitrum, Base, and Polygon. Still, momentum is slowly shifting as new projects seek out alternative blockchains with faster throughput and lower fees. Not everyone is convinced. Offchain Labs’ Chief Strategy Officer AJ Warner pointed to Ethereum’s vastly higher total value locked (TVL), arguing that EVM-based ecosystems remain the best venues for launching stablecoin projects. Bitwise, however, has been increasingly vocal about its support for Solana. At Token2049 in Singapore, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley suggested Solana may have a structural advantage over Ethereum in the race for staking ETFs. Faster unstaking times, he explained, could prove crucial for products that need to return assets quickly. The firm currently offers the Bitwise Physical Solana ETP, backed by actual SOL with institutional-grade custody. While interest remains modest at $30 million in assets under management, Bitwise also has a spot Solana ETF awaiting a final decision from the SEC by Oct. 16. Solana ETF Filings Signal Institutional Momentum Several top asset managers, including Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Bitwise, have submitted updated S-1 filings for spot Solana ETFs, some with staking features. ETF analyst Nate Geraci expects the US SEC could approve them by mid-October , calling it a pivotal month for digital asset products. The filings follow the recent launch of the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange, which drew $12 million in first-day inflows. Analysts say Solana is quickly becoming the next altcoin favored by institutions, with strong inflows also reported in Europe-based Solana ETPs. Geraci and others believe the inclusion of staking language in these filings could pave the way for long-awaited spot Ethereum ETFs with staking capabilities. Meanwhile, Bitcoin exchange-traded products now hold over 1.47 million BTC , representing around 7% of the total supply, with U.S.-based ETFs dominating the landscape. BlackRock’s IBIT leads with 746,810 BTC, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at nearly 199,500 BTC, according to data from HODL15Capital.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently at just $0.035, has already seen over 55% of its Stage 6 presale sold. The project has raised more than $16.85 million and attracted 16,750+ holders. Provided Mutuum Finance continues on its present trajectory, early investors can earn up to 5000%, which makes it one of the most intriguing under-$1 cryptos to watch in the coming months. Solana (SOL) Price Set for More Gains with Bulls Eyeing $262 Solana (SOL) has continued to build momentum in recent days, climbing to $227, over the $205 target, and approaching the $230 resistance. The daily chart technical analysis suggests that the bullish trend can continue, with the next upside targets being $242, $254, and $262, suggesting ongoing interest from traders as well as investors. As SOL is gaining attention for its performance, several market participants are also searching for an under-$1 opportunity with greater asymmetrical upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor attention as a top pick due to its utility-based DeFi model and excessive growth potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Reaches New Heights Mutuum Finance is taking DeFi by storm with its presale, in which it has attracted over 16,750 investors and raised over $16.85 million so far. Phase 6 of the presale is currently live at 55% complete and selling MUTM tokens at $0.035 per token. As a gesture of gratitude to its early investors, the team has also started a $100,000 giveaway , to reward 10 random winners with 10,000 MUTM tokens each. Mutuum Finance is going to introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to bear market-stopping algorithmic stablecoins, the token is non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and is designed to become price-stable even in bear markets. The protocol also has a risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism wherein each asset has an associated collateral cap according to its risk factor. That is for facilitating proportionate and arm’s length lending. Apart from safeguarding users in bad times, the protocol also has a buffer reserve mechanism wherein riskier assets are assigned more reserves as additional collateral and to subsidize the ecosystem. With its presale growth, risk control innovations, and transparency, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a safe, stable, and innovative DeFi platform. Mutuum Finance Announces Development of Its Lending & Borrowing Solution Mutuum Finance has announced the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , a milestone in its DeFi development. The initial version (V1) of the protocol will go live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with the key features being a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Lending, borrowing, and utilizing ETH and USDT as collateral will also be available at launch for users to get the first taste of a solid and secure decentralized finance platform. Mutuum Finance Paves the Way for Explosive Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still taking the market by storm as one of the most promising under-$1 cryptocurrencies. With Stage 6 of its presale already 55% sold, over 16,750 investors registered, and over $16.85 million raised, the project’s momentum is evident. Its upcoming lending and borrowing protocol, USD-pegged stablecoin, and advanced risk management features also provide a strong foundation for long-term growth. While Solana is shooting for $262, MUTM’s utility, innovation, and early-stage status have investors eyeing returns as high as 5000%. Secure your portion in the presale today to position yourself at the leading edge of the next giant wave of decentralized finance.

Bitcoin UTXO Count Declines As Price Surges In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, market analyst CryptoOnchain revealed that long-term Bitcoin investors seem to be changing their investment strategy by increasingly holding on to their coins. This on-chain observation is based on the Bitcoin UTXO Count metric, which tracks the total number of individual unspent transaction outputs on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $123,000 As Rising Open Interest Signals More Action Ahead For context, an unspent transaction output is an amount of a cryptocurrency (in this case, Bitcoin) that has been received by an address, but has not yet been used as input for a new transaction. CryptoOnchain shared that this on-chain metric has been on a steady decline since January 2025. In the post, the crypto analyst pointed out that the UTXO count recently reached about 166.6 million, the lowest point seen since April 2024. Since the Bitcoin UTXO reached a peak of approximately 187.5 million in January, it has witnessed a contraction of up to 11% — an event which CryptoOnchain interprets as a clear sign of network consolidation. Interestingly, this decline seen with unspent transaction output contrasts with Bitcoin’s price action. While the UTXO has maintained a steady bearish structure, Bitcoin’s value has continued to ascend. The flagship cryptocurrency saw a price growth from about $99,000 to its current market price of around $122,000. This “inverse relationship” is one that the online pundit explained to be a “classic hallmark of a maturing market.” Why The Decline And What To Expect A decreased UTXO count could be a result of several underlying factors, including that long-term holders are choosing to hold their coins rather than selling for profit. Owing to this “hodling” behavior, it can be said that the market is starting to gain maturity. Also, CryptoOnchain explained that low UTXOs could indicate reduced transactions within the Blockchain. By extension, this could mean that fewer sales are going on, which translates to reduced selling pressure on price. Also, a lower UTXO count points to increasing network efficiency. As users aggregate smaller UTXOs into larger ones, they optimize the blockchain space, leading potentially to a less congested network. Ultimately, the simultaneous decline in Bitcoin’s UTXO and its price increase paints an exciting picture for the cryptocurrency’s future. This combination signals that the premier cryptocurrency is at a reaccumulation phase, meaning that investors are strategically positioning themselves in expectation of the next significant upward move. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at about $122,720, showing an over 1% growth in the past day.

According to the FTX account, these scammers are now targeting creditors awaiting bankruptcy distribution. In the statement released , the platform noted that there have been several phishing campaigns targeting users waiting for information as it prepares its new round of payouts to creditors. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the FTX Recovery Trust announced that creditors will receive $1.6 billion in a third round of payments. This is not the first time that the entity has made the distribution plan public; it has been sharing it with creditors and the general public since last year. FTX issues alert over phishing campaigns targeting creditors According to FTX, the alert was necessary after several reports of deceptive emails impersonating Kroll Restructuring Administration and the FTX Recovery Trust. In the post, the handle urged claimants to remain vigilant for phishing emails that may appear to be from Kroll or the FTX Recovery Trust. The firm also advised users to be cautious of the platform they visit, warning that scammers even go as far as creating websites to mimic the official FTX Customer Portal. Please remain aware of phishing emails that look like they are from Kroll or the FTX Recovery Trust and links to scam sites that may appear to look like the FTX Customer Portal ( https://t.co/DkYi2hDLbI ), such as the examples shown below. Reminder: We will never ask you to connect… pic.twitter.com/vHaXYLzzo8 — FTX (@FTX_Official) October 3, 2025 The company stressed that it will never ask its users to connect their emails before they claim funds belonging to them. The said fraudulent email, according to the firm, appears to come from “Kroll Settlement Advisory” or “Digital Disbursements.” The email claims that FTX clients are eligible for 118-142% recoveries on petition-date claim values. The scammers then attach links such as clientid-ftxclaims.com or other spoofed domains mimicking the original claim portal, asking users to click the link. “Kroll, the restructuring administrator for FTX’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy, is preparing distributions… To access your funds, please review the email from our trusted partner, Digital Disbursements,” one of the fake emails read. The handle also claimed that another false email asks users to confirm their eligibility for a second distribution that has been scheduled for September 30, 2025. FTX and Kroll have repeatedly asked claimants to listen only to directives from the official domains. Users asked to consult official platforms for information Users have been advised to also visit the official claims portal for all information regarding payouts and inquiries. In addition, the platform has urged users to avoid clicking links that come in unsolicited emails, noting that it is the first stage of scammers trying to confuse them and take their details. Users have also been asked to cross-check sender addresses and domain names to ensure they are the right ones. Finally, users are asked to report all suspicious emails and messages to the support team. Notably, this warning follows ongoing efforts to finalize creditor repayments. On September 30, FTX distributed $1.6 billion to creditors as part of its third round of payments under its Chapter 11 reorganization plan. Eligible creditors who have completed identity verification checks, filled tax forms, and selected their preferred payment provider (BitGo, Payoneer , or Kraken), were to receive their funds within 1-3 business days. The new round included several classes of claimants, including US claimants, Convenience claimants, Dotcom customers, and Unsecured & loan claimants. According to reports, future payments will require verification and onboarding on the Customer Portal, and only registered claim holders will be eligible to receive distributions. The platform kick-started its repayment process after its reorganization plan was approved by a court in October 2024. The platform is set to return up to $16.5 billion to creditors.

After a highly volatile period, investor sentiment is again turning bullish, and capital is flowing once again into risk assets. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are still at the forefront, retail investors are starting to focus more on MAGACOIN FINANCE, the latest presale project, slowly but surely making its way into one of the hottest projects of 2025. Bitcoin Rebounds After Pullback Bitcoin is selling at $123,000, up from $109,000 less than two weeks ago. Analysts say the recovery showcases the resilience of Bitcoin against market turbulence following consistent institutional flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Data reveals nearly $700 million in ETF inflows over the last few days, up sharply after outflows from three straight days in late September. The rebound has boosted market confidence, with technical charts now indicating that the $126,000-$130,000 range is the next range of resistance. Whales have also been adding positions, and that means a potential upside is in store as macro conditions remain in favor of digital assets. Altcoins Join the Rally The recovery has not been restricted to Bitcoin. Ethereum is trading at $4,500, and Solana has strengthened to $230. Cardano is trending towards the psychological $1 mark, and XRP is consolidating towards $2.85 (after heavy whale accumulation). The Altcoin Season Index has increased to 73/100, denoting a move of capital away from decentralized digital currency dominance by Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies. Meme tokens, DeFi initiatives, and Layer 1 networks are noticing a revival with volume of percentage change up across the board for daily trading activity. This hints retail investors are again taking on riskier bets in their quest for higher returns. Retail Flocks to MAGACOIN FINANCE Among those risk-on bets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is clearly rising as one of the best bets. The presale is unique as it has an overwhelming support from retail investors who think that this is an investment that may give them a chance to lock up positions before such big exchange listings. Social media buzz and presale participation figures confirm clamour from small-to-mid-sized investors into MAGACOIN is coming in thick and fast. Unlike projects with a strong institutional base of support for their journey, MAGACOIN FINANCE established its momentum from scratch and drives with community-driven momentum. Analysts point out that retail participation is often the driver of exponential growth in early-stage tokens, such as in previous cycles with Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, and PEPE. The fact that MAGACOIN has already sounded the alarm bells at over $15.5 million raised speaks volumes to how widespread grass-roots demand has become. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the ideal balance of money and potential. Retail investors who didn’t get in on the earlier bull market breaks are seeing it as their chance to get in ahead of the broader market. Market Confidence Builds Ahead of Q4 The overall market outlook for Q4 2025 is still bullish. Institutional flows into Bitcoin are expected to remain strong, while speculation around the future Ethereum and Solana ETFs could provide more fuel for altcoins. Derivatives activity has also picked up with open interest across futures and options increasing fairly steadily – a sign that traders are positioning for ongoing upside. On the macro front, improving inflation numbers and risk appetite of low interest rates are creating good conditions for risk assets. Historically, such periods have coincided with solid performance levels throughout the crypto market, especially Altcoins. Conclusion The crypto market has shaken off the recent volatility with Bitcoin rebounding by $123,000 and altcoins springing off the floor. Ethereum, Solana, Cardoon, and XRP are all seeing strength and trading activity hints that confidence is returning to the trading market. At the same time, retail energy is going into MAGACOIN FINANCE. With more than $15.5 million raised and overall grassroots growth, it’s rapidly becoming the presale to monitor in 2025. For many, the combination of Bitcoin’s resilience mixed with MAGACOIN’s exploding upside potential makes it especially a great time to be in crypto.

However, research suggests bitcoin (BTC) holders themselves are barely engaging. Some 77% of bitcoin holders have never tried a BTCFi platform, according to a survey of more than 700 respondents across North America and Europe by BTC mining ecosystem GoMining. Just over 10% reported having experimented once or twice, while only 8% said they actively use BTCFi services for yield or lending. The survey highlights a stark disconnect between the sector’s promise and its actual reach. “There’s an enormous appetite for these opportunities, but the industry has built products for crypto natives, not for everyday bitcoin holders,” said GoMining CEO Mark Zalan in a statement. That appetite shows up in the data: 73% of respondents expressed interest in earning yield on their BTC through lending or staking, while 42% want access to liquidity without selling. Yet hesitation dominates. More than 40% said they would allocate less than 20% of their holdings to BTCFi products, underscoring the sector’s trust and complexity problem. Awareness Gap Perhaps most striking is how invisible the industry still is. GoMining found that 65% of Bitcoin holders couldn’t name a single BTCFi project. Despite millions in venture funding, BTCFi platforms appear to be speaking mainly to themselves rather than the market they’re built to serve. The report argues that BTCFi’s adoption problem may stem from its reliance on Ethereum’s DeFi model. Bitcoin users, GoMining suggests, are more conservative: they favor custodial services , regulated ETFs and simplicity over self-custody experiments and complex protocols. “Bitcoin holders aren’t ether (ETH) users,” Zalan said. “Coinbase and Bitcoin ETFs succeeded because they prioritized accessibility. BTCFi platforms that focus on education and user experience, rather than complex features, will capture this market."" For the industry, the survey is both a warning and an opportunity. Millions of Bitcoin holders want the yield and liquidity BTCFi promises, but they need to be met with products they can trust and understand. However, it should be kept in mind that the survey respondents were a ""random selection"" of just 700 GoMining users. GoMining is a digital BTC mining platform that connects users to real-world mining operations through Digital Miners non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and a gamified ecosystem, so the survey's findings are subject to the extent to which its users represent typical bitcoin users. ""Our user base represents the bitcoin holders universe quite nicely,"" a GoMining spokesperson told CoinDesk over email. ""More than 80% of our users open their first crypto wallet with us and enter the Bitcoin ecosystem through our digital mining product.""",Tech|Bitcoin|DeFi|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MINING|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-05 12:00:00

Sharps’ entry into SOL occurred around the $200 price level, below its $293 all-time high, positioning it well for upside if SOL rallies. Sharps’ core safety syringe business continues to face low revenue and inventory buildup, with Q2 revenue at $223k. Q2 net income of $5.5 million was mainly driven by a non-cash fair value gain on warrants remeasured under ASC 815. Sharps Technology (NASDAQ: STSS ) has been on the radar lately since announcing its crypto treasury strategy pivot based on Solana ( SOL-USD ). In this article, I’ll draw insights from how the SOL pivot, which relies heavily on capital raises, has materially changed Sharp technology’s risk profile and capital structure. Sharps Technology - The Core Business Sharps Technology primarily operates in the medical device sector, focusing on ""smart"" safety syringes. The company's product portfolio includes the Sharps Provensa, SecurGard, and SoloGard, all products aimed to address critical safety and efficiency needlestick injuries, syringe reuse, and broader safety risks within the healthcare industry. Looking at the company's financial performance in the years leading up to the recent Solana pivot shows what looks like persistent struggle, but it could also be seen as a typical pre-revenue setup if the company keeps making meaningful strides in delivering on commercialization. Despite operating in a market projected to grow, with the global safety syringe market valued at about $9 billion in 2025 (according to several market research firms, including Business Research Company , Research and Markets , and Cognitive Market Research ), Sharps consistently reported operating losses and paltry revenue. Sharps’ filings show a pattern of negative net income year after year, accumulated deficit, and inventory buildup with little to no sales. Inventory reserve in Q2 was $730k, which shows the scale of unsold or slow-moving inventory relative to sales. Company filing Revenue was $223k as of the latest filing (Q2 2025) . While EPS flipped GAAP positive to $3.58, which was mainly driven by a large non-cash fair-value gain of about $6.5 million on warrant liabilities remeasured under ASC 815. Operating loss persisted in Q2 and was about $3 million. Excluding the warrant remeasurement, adjusted EPS and operating cash flow remained negative. Sharps' trend of low sales and persistent losses could shift moving forward, as sales from previously secured purchase agreements are beginning to convert into shipments. Sharps has reported its first revenues tied to those agreements, which include a latest $400,000 SoloGard initial order, though still modest in scale compared to expenses and operating loss. There was also a $100k purchase order for Sharps’ SecureGuard smart syringes by a Hungarian vaccine provider in Q2. Then there is also an existing five-year, $200 million syringe sales agreement with Nephron Pharmaceuticals with $30 million commitments in the first 12 months, which I believe would likely gain traction as the company’s facility in Hungary has seen recent upgrades in molding and automation technologies (according to the company) to ramp up mass production and deliveries. In addition to that, U.S. production is expected to commence at the InjectEZ facility in South Carolina . Sharps Technology - The Solana Treasury To each company, their own motive for pivoting to a crypto treasury strategy. The size of recent capital raises for crypto strategies has been massive; thus, some firms with failed core businesses have rebranded as crypto treasury vehicles to capture investor demand. And regulators have recently stepped up scrutiny around crypto treasuries as mid-cap companies flood the space. In analyzing Sharps' crypto pivot and ambitions, I think the first question right off the bat is whether Sharps Technology fits the profile of a company with a struggling core business that pivoted to a crypto treasury to prop up valuation? This is the reason for opening this piece with a review of the company’s core business and pre-crypto-pivot financial reality and pointing out how the company is transitioning to commercialization through fulfillment of already secured purchase order agreements. Though Sharps has made progress, I think it still has a lot to prove in that regard, and the coming quarters will be crucial to watch. I think Sharps, to some extent, ticks the boxes when it comes to the question of whether its core business and financial reality stand on their own apart from the crypto treasury. Then the choice of crypto assets matters a lot. This is similar to how an individual investor's choice of assets (after due diligence) in his personal portfolio could determine stability and growth or exposure to downside risk in the long term. Sharps’ already-acquired 2 million SOL allocation funded by the $400 million PIPE equity raise early this month is more or less an early-stage bet at this juncture. And I think timing is the next best edge for crypto treasuries. Markets are forward-looking and reward the early movers. Just like how Strategy’s ( MSTR ) early Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) pivot has paid off and the company still enjoys an attractive cost basis, with an average purchase cost now around $74,000, despite follow-up BTC purchases above $100k. With BTC now trading at $122k, a $74,000 cost basis would be an implied gain of about 62% on MSTR's holdings. While other fancy crypto-treasury-focused metrics have been developed, this simple cost basis gap is the number one benchmark for attractiveness. I believe Sharps’ entry into SOL comes at an interesting point, where SOL is trading just above $200 and still shy of its all-time high of about $293. This positioning will likely put Sharps and other early Solana treasury pivots like DeFi Development ( DFDV ) on the path of becoming one of the more attractive balance sheets among crypto treasuries in the near future if SOL maintains momentum and reaches or goes past its all-time high. To top that, SOL hasn’t seen a spot ETF approval yet but has the potential to secure one, as it is inarguably one of the strongest and fastest-growing layer-1 networks with an ever-expanding ecosystem and developer base. Both the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have proven that demands for the spot ETFs directly influence the price of their underlying crypto assets. With roughly 2 million SOL in Sharps’ treasury and 26.6 million shares outstanding, each share effectively represents about 0.075 SOL, which is derived by dividing the total SOL holdings of around 2 million by the total shares outstanding of 26.6 million, giving 2 million ÷ 26.6 million ≈ 0.075 SOL per share [SPS]. Now in a direct peer comp, Upexi ( UPXI ) current shares outstanding are around 58.9 million, and a market cap of $438 million puts its 2,018,419 SOL holding at 0.0343 SOL per share. Upexi's SPS metric is lower because of its higher share count, which dilutes the per-share SOL exposure. Note that Upexi also reports an adjusted SPS figure, which reflects the cost basis of its SOL holdings rather than the current market price, providing a more conservative measure of per-share SOL value. DFDV currently has a higher SPS at 0.0816 SPS compared to UPXI and STSS. Though Solana treasury companies like to tout the SPS metric as a main measure of crypto exposure, I believe a mere look at the SPS metric, especially in a peer comp, isn't enough; though the metric becomes more useful when trying to gauge how SPS has grown, which implies how share count has changed against the SOL holding over time. Sharps’ currently has an edge in SOL exposure per dollar, and it boils down to its lower valuation. With an SPS of 0.075 and a share price around $6.75, each dollar invested buys roughly 0.0111 SOL (0.075 SPS ÷ 6.75 share price ≈ 0.0111) or around $2.5 worth of SOL, more than DFDV, which has an SPS of 0.0816 and a ~$15 share price, giving about 0.00544 SOL per $1 invested, and Upexi, with 0.0343 SPS and a ~$7.45 share price, offering around 0.0046 SOL per $1. Even though DFDV reports a higher raw SPS and Upexi holds a slightly larger SOL treasury compared to Sharps, the higher valuation of both DFDV and Upexi dilutes the “cost-efficiency” of each share for investors. Sharps’ combination of meaningful SOL holdings (nearly matching that of DFDV and Upexi, both holding slightly above 2 million SOL currently) and a lower market valuation makes it the most efficient vehicle for investors seeking SOL exposure through equities among the mentioned peers. Sharps has a lower share price, so each $1 buys more of the SOL that each share represents. On top of that, Sharps’ promising core business, which is moving into commercialization, makes it an even stronger contender beyond the SOL per share exposure. Though the recently announced $100 million share buyback program was the main driver that made the stock see some rally this week, I think STSS has the potential to see a lasting rally and rerate higher to match the valuation of peers if per $1 exposure to SOL remains attractive and if dilution is kept in check. Risks While STSS shows strong efficiency in SOL exposure per $1, there are risks that are common risks for all crypto treasury companies, and STSS isn't immune to them. Being a crypto treasury company means heavy balance sheet exposure to crypto volatility, which creates inherent financial risk and uncertainty. Sharps also filed a $1 billion mixed shelf offering recently. While investors expect management to deploy capital prudently at favorable timing and market conditions, the exposure to crypto’s inherent volatility means there could be some pressure that can push the execution decisions of management to suboptimal timing. There is also the risk of dilution from the offering, which could erode the attractive per-share SOL value of STSS if dilution rises faster than accumulated SOL. Also, Sharps’ medical equipment manufacturing business still remains unproven until the revenue from that business and product line takes proper shape. Takeaway Though I've highlighted Sharps’ attractiveness in terms of SOL exposure per $1 invested and the potential to rerate to the valuation of peers also pursuing a SOL treasury strategy, I’d still lean towards a cautious Hold here. The unproven nature of its core operations and aggressive capital allocation warrant a Hold rating. I believe investors should wait for initial commercial traction or a more sustainable capital strategy before turning fully bullish. Personally, I see the $100 million share buyback as a stretch and a rather bold move that raises questions, given the company’s ongoing operating losses and negative cash flow, which makes the financial prudence of this decision uncertain. The $100 million share buyback feels ambitious for a company still facing operating losses and negative cash flow, making a cautious Hold the prudent stance.

An S-1 registration is a formal document required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a new security, like a crypto ETF, to be offered to the public. The Bitwise Aptos ETF filing is just the initial step, and the approval timeline can take several months or longer. Earlier in March, @BitwiseInvest began the regulatory process for a potential Aptos ETF, the 1st offering of an Aptos-linked ETF in the U.S. Since then, Aptos Labs' @AveryChing appeared in front of Congress, & @worldlibertyfi announced USD1 is coming to Aptos. Let that sink in. https://t.co/JxQ92YGXMq — Aptos (@Aptos) October 4, 2025 Bitwise Aptos ETF Faces SEC Review: Approval Could Take Months The SEC will carefully review the application, assessing factors such as market risk, investor protection, and regulatory compliance before making a decision. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley confirmed the filing in a recent X post, which revealed that the Aptos Layer-1 blockchain has led development activities among new blockchain entrants by over 897%. Horsley added that he can’t say more about the Aptos ETF during the quiet period, “But fired up about the momentum in the Aptos ecosystem.” Bitwise @BitwiseInvest has an S-1 filing in for an Aptos ETF — Can’t say more during quiet period. But fired up about the momentum in the Aptos ecosystem. https://t.co/BSl2loKqq3 — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) October 4, 2025 Within hours of the filing announcement, Aptos surged from $4.63 to a high of $5.65 before settling around $5.52 at press time. Source: CoinMarketCap Trading volumes also exceeded $3.98 billion, marking a three-month high for both price and volume. Recall that Aptos Labs CEO Avery Ching is officially part of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) Digital Assets Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) subcommittee. The CFTC specifically pointed out that Ching will collaborate with other leaders from Web3 and financial services to help shape digital asset regulations. Many believe his appointment could help facilitate internal discussions with regulators on the need for an Aptos ETF. For European investors, Bitwise already has a similar product listed in Switzerland, on the SIX Swiss Exchange, which shows growing confidence that the U.S. counterpart might see an Aptos ETF go live before the end of 2025. When asked about the gap that Aptos fills in the Layer-1 blockchain space, where the likes of Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Sui, and Tron have already dominated, Horsley responded that Aptos is favored by institutions because it offers maximum speed and cost efficiency. The claim of institutional preference for Aptos appears to be genuine. BlackRock’s $2B BUIDL Fund Backs Aptos Ahead of ETF Decision In November 2024, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, expanded access to its tokenized real-world asset fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), to include Aptos. Securitize’s CEO, Carlos Domingo, cited that the choice for Aptos was about broadening the accessibility of what has become the largest money-market token of its kind. According to him, “we’ll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do.” When it comes to transaction speed and cost, Aptos, a layer-1 blockchain platform developed by former Facebook employees, recently set a new record in blockchain transactions. In May, Aptos surpassed Solana by recording an astounding 115.4 million transactions in a single day, far exceeding Solana’s 31.7 million, according to Aptoscan.

Aside from transaction volume, Aptos has also been showing growth in stablecoin activities. According to data shared by the Aptos protocol , native USDT activity on Aptos has now surpassed $30 billion in volume, making it the fourth-largest layer-1 blockchain by net circulation of native USDT, valued at approximately $830 million. The blockchain’s stablecoin dominance extends beyond USDT to include USDC and USDe, creating a comprehensive ecosystem that has attracted significant user engagement.

Here’s What It Means for Coming Rally,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-pinkish-square-3-13-3-20-heres-what-it-means-for-coming-rally/,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has highlighted a significant technical zone for XRP, stressing that the $3.13 to $3.20 range is the most important level for the asset in the current market structure. He referred to this range as the “pinkish square” and explained that, despite multiple attempts, XRP has not yet closed a single 3-day candle above it. According to him, until that confirmation happens, XRP remains in a broad consolidation phase rather than entering a definitive breakout trend. The chart shared by the analyst shows XRP trading around $3.02 at the time of posting, moving within an ascending structure but still struggling to push through resistance. The outlined zone between $3.13 and $3.20 represents the barrier that bulls must overcome to confirm strength. Until then, the asset remains vulnerable to fluctuations within the established range. #XRP – Pinkish Square ($3.13 – $3.20) : I love seeing the bears get wrecked! I can't explain why, but it feels like revenge against those who had no solid technical analysis or math behind their Bearishness. Now, the same goes for the bulls! You need to get wrecked… pic.twitter.com/4worTQq7Wn — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 3, 2025 The Broader Range and Downside Scenarios Egrag Crypto opined that XRP has been moving in a macro range, between $2.65 and $3.65 for some time, with repeated rejections and bounces. This range continues to define the market’s behavior, and he noted that until a breakout is confirmed, traders should expect price action to remain contained within it. He also warned that a failure to close above the pinkish square could bring downside pressure, particularly if Bitcoin and Ethereum face rejections at their own resistance levels. In his view, such a scenario would likely see XRP drop back toward lower support levels, potentially retesting the $2.65 region. This would keep the market in a corrective stance before any decisive upward move takes place. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Potential for an Explosive Move Despite his caution regarding the current resistance, Egrag emphasized that once XRP does manage to close above the $3.13 to $3.20 zone, the move could trigger a sharp and impulsive breakout. He suggested that such an event would likely generate significant gains, describing the next leg higher as potentially explosive. This aligns with his ongoing analysis that XRP is building strength for a larger rally, but only once key technical confirmations are met. Staying Focused on the Bigger Picture Egrag reminded the XRP community that patience remains essential in this stage of the market. While short-term volatility can cause both bullish and bearish positions to be tested, the broader technical setup points toward eventual strength. Until a decisive close above resistance occurs, however, he cautions that the asset is effectively ranging. His analysis provides a clear framework for traders and long-term holders alike: the $3.13 to $3.20 range is the level that must be broken for momentum to shift decisively. Until then, the market remains in waiting mode as both downside risks and upside potential are firmly on the table.

Solana has rebounded, climbing above $229 despite limited ETF inflows. Traders are watching resistance zones and institutional support for both tokens. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a viral PayFi altcoin. With over $27 million raised, 674 million tokens sold, and a live wallet beta, Remittix combines real-world crypto-to-bank utility, strong security, and deflationary tokenomics. BNB Breaks $1,100 As Uptober Momentum Builds BNB price is currently $1,152. Binance Coin (BNB) is starting October on a high note, having risen above 6.5% in one day to reach above $1100. The token has hit a new high of all time at $1,111 and then found a base at $1,096. The rally indicates the strength of BNB amid macro-level issues such as the U.S. government shutdown and monetary policy changes, which demonstrates its increasing power in the crypto market. The company has experienced a recent spurt, and the price has crossed over $1,111, increasing by over 17% in the last seven days. Analysts say the breakout above $1,050 unlocked new momentum, with traders targeting $1,200 as the next psychological barrier. CoinGlass data shows nearly $400 million in leveraged positions liquidated during the rally, including $268 million in shorts. This indicates that institutional buyers were active while retail traders were forced out. Technically, BNB is strong above major moving averages, and the RSI is bullish but not overbought. Support lies near $1,050, and as long as it holds, a move toward $1,150–$1,200 is possible. Solana Price Gains Momentum Despite ETF Stalling Solana price is currently $229. SOL has rebounded in October, climbing as high as $236 despite minimal inflows into its first U.S. spot staking ETF from REX-Osprey. The ETF reached a $500 million milestone in AUM, but inflows over the last two days were zero. Earlier, SOL ETFs recorded strong daily inflows, $27 million on Sept. 22, $19.1 million on Sept. 18, and $18.3 million on Sept. 30. Despite ETF inactivity, Solana continues its uptrend, with investors optimistic for a $260 breakout. Technical indicators suggest buyers are gaining control, and SOL could continue rallying as institutional support and on-chain activity drive momentum. Remittix: The Trending Altcoin Everyone’s Watching Remittix , the viral PayFi altcoin, is attracting attention alongside BNB and Solana. Remittix has raised over $27 million, sold more than 674 million tokens, and is currently priced at $0.1130. The project is verified #1 on CertiK, and its wallet beta is live, enabling fast crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries. Why Remittix Is Turning Heads PayFi Expansion: Remittix is building one of the first payment networks that lets users send crypto directly into any bank account worldwide, making digital money work like cash. 15% USDT Rewards: Every user can earn a 15% referral bonus paid in USDT. This is claimable daily through the Remittix dashboard. Strong Community Growth : Over 25,000 holders and global testers are already using the wallet beta. This proves rising adoption before launch. Top Industry Ranking: Verified as #1 on CertiK, Remittix stands out for transparency, tech reliability, and investor trust ahead of its exchange listings. Conclusion: Uptober Brings Opportunities Across Crypto BNB continues to ride strong momentum, with short-term targets between $1,150 and $1,200. Solana maintains its uptrend, eyeing a $260 breakout despite ETF inactivity. Meanwhile, Remittix, priced at $0.1130 with over 674 million tokens sold and $27 million raised, provides investors with a promising altcoin that combines security, real-world utility, and strong adoption potential. Uptober is shaping up to be an exciting month for crypto, and careful positioning in BNB, SOL, and Remittix could capture significant upside.

If this product gets approved, it would be the first altcoin ETF tied to the Move chain, Bitwise claims. After the boom of Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked ETFs, institutions are looking for diversification in altcoins. The CMC Altcoin Season Index is flashing a “63” rating, hinting that Bitcoin season is slowly giving way to altcoin season . The global crypto market printed green indexes as the US government shutdown continues. The total digital assets market cap stood at $4.21 trillion with a trading volume of above $180 billion. Aptos soars 30% on Bitwise ETF filing Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, in an X post, confirmed the filing. He added that he couldn’t share further details due to the SEC’s regulatory “quiet period.” However, Horsley’s enthusiasm was evident when he wrote , “Fired up about the momentum in the Aptos ecosystem.” The market reacted quite well to the Bitwise update. Aptos’ APT price token jumped nearly 30%, leading it to breach $5.3 mark in a rally that began from around $4.2 levels. Its trading volume spiked to hit $614 million, the highest in two months. Anticipation around Aptos ETF helped APT to recover from the past losses. APT is trading at an average price of $5.51 at the press time. Bitwise @BitwiseInvest has an S-1 filing in for an Aptos ETF — Can’t say more during quiet period. But fired up about the momentum in the Aptos ecosystem. https://t.co/BSl2loKqq3 — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) October 4, 2025 Chain Broker data shows that Aptos has led development growth across major blockchains. It has posted a 897% surge in developer activity, outpacing networks like Celo, Nym, and Skale. The timing of Bitwise’s filing looks strategic as Aptos aims to expand in DeFi, gaming, and more. Aptos awaits SEC nod Regulatory approval remains uncertain as the SEC has historically taken a conservative stance toward non-Bitcoin, non-Ethereum ETFs. This suggests that Aptos may face a longer review window. But the filing alone signals a clear shift. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETF s are roaring back. US spot Bitcoin funds bagged $3.24 billion in inflows last week . It is the second-largest weekly total since their debut in January 2024. That reversed the previous week’s $902 million in outflows and pushed four-week cumulative inflows near $4 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the surge with $1.8 billion, lifting its AUM to $96.2 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC added $692 million. Together, the two giants now account for more than 60% of all US. spot Bitcoin ETF activity. Analysts estimate that ETF demand in Q4 could soak up more than 100,000 BTC from the circulating supply. This is nearly twice the network’s new quarterly issuance. BTC miners will be dealing with pressure ahead. Bitcoin price jumped by more than 12% over the past 7 days. BTC briefly topped $125,500 on Sunday. Historically, such BTC-led environments have preceded capital rotation back into altcoins once Bitcoin stabilizes. The biggest altcoin, Ethereum, is leading the altcoin bull run. ETH price is up by around 14% in the last 7 days. Ethereum is trading at an average price of $4,540 at press time.

This surge enabled it to surpass NEAR Protocol’s 51.8 million and Solana’s 45.8 million, marking the first time the latter has been dethroned since August 2024. Aster Hype Interestingly, BNB Chain surpassed Solana in terms of daily chain fees and maintained the lead for three consecutive days last month. The renewed momentum on BNB Chain is largely attributed to the hype surrounding Aster, which has sparked massive user engagement and boosted on-chain activity across the ecosystem. On October 4th, Aster’s TVL reached $2.34 billion, a 570% increase from $347 million, according to data compiled by DefiLlama. The sharp growth indicates that users are increasingly leveraging Aster for decentralized trading and yield farming. While the BNB Chain Layer 1 recorded a 22% increase in active addresses over the past month, the Layer 2 scaling solution OpBNB, which is built on the OP Stack, also saw an impressive 66.4% increase during the same period. Weighing on the development, analyst Darkfost said, “All of this puts it ahead of chains like Base, Solana, or even Ethereum. The interest is clearly there right now.” The increased demand for the BNB Chain ecosystem, combined with shrinking supply and growing on-chain liquidity, has driven the BNB token to record highs. Record-Breaking BNB Rally BNB hit a new peak of over $1,189 this week. CryptoQuant found that the futures market is showing renewed buying strength as Taker Buy dominance returns. Taker Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), which tracks the net difference between market buy and sell volumes over 90 days, is now positive and rising. Historically, a rising 90-day CVD indicates a Taker Buy-dominant phase, while a falling or negative CVD points to seller dominance. The current trend suggests strong buying pressure in BNB futures, which supports the possibility of further short-term gains. However, overly aggressive long positions in the derivatives market can quickly trigger corrections.

Demographics drive asset demand: aging populations increase capital available for investment, raising demand for store-of-value assets. Rising global wealth and productivity encourage portfolio diversification into cryptocurrencies and alternative assets. Federal Reserve research projects aging could raise asset demand by roughly 200% of GDP between 2024 and 2100. Bitcoin demand: Aging populations and rising wealth boost crypto adoption — explore portfolio implications and expert perspectives. Read COINOTAG analysis now. What is the effect of global aging on Bitcoin demand? Global aging increases long-term Bitcoin demand by concentrating wealth in older cohorts with larger investable assets and longer-term allocation perspectives. The effect is amplified if real interest rates remain low, making alternative stores of value like Bitcoin relatively more attractive. How does the Federal Reserve view demographic-driven asset demand? The US Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City projects that population aging will continue the upward trend in asset demand, with demographic shifts potentially raising asset demand by an additional 200% of GDP between 2024 and 2100. This projection suggests a structural increase in demand for long-duration and alternative assets, which can pressure real interest rates lower. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin demand to rise as global aging and rising wealth drive crypto adoption"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/0199b3fa-2543-7ba7-81e4-a89c5dd909dc""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-05T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-05T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Analysis: Global aging and rising wealth could boost Bitcoin demand and crypto adoption through 2100 as asset demand increases and real rates decline.""} Global aging and rising wealth could boost demand for assets like Bitcoin, with the Fed projecting stronger investment growth through 2100. Global demographic shifts and rising wealth could power cryptocurrency adoption and asset demand well into the next century. Front-loaded capital in older cohorts, combined with greater productivity, is likely to increase overall demand for financial assets, including cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Demand for global assets, including cryptocurrencies, is expected to be driven by an aging global population and increased productivity worldwide, resulting in an older population with more capital to invest. This dynamic favors assets perceived as scarcity stores of value and long-duration holdings. This dynamic will drive asset demand until the year 2100, according to the US Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. “For asset demand, population aging means that the upward trend from recent decades will continue,” a research report published on Aug. 25 said. “Using demographic projections to extend our historical analysis, we project that aging will raise asset demand by an additional 200% of GDP between 2024 and 2100.” The report also noted that persistent increases in asset demand could imply a continued decline in real interest rates, improving the investment case for alternatives such as Bitcoin. Source: Kansascityfed.org Rising wealth is a second structural force. Analysts and industry executives say higher household wealth supports greater risk tolerance and broader portfolio diversification into newer asset classes. Institutional product development — such as spot ETFs and regulated custody — further lowers barriers to entry for older, risk-averse investors. Why might older investors value Bitcoin like gold over the next 75 years? While cryptocurrencies remain volatile, regulatory clarity and institutionalization can shift perception. Gracy Chen, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, argued that with clearer rules and government engagement, the aging cohort may eventually view Bitcoin similarly to gold: a scarce, digitally native store of value. Industry data shows adoption is already moving beyond younger cohorts. Triple-A reported that 34% of global cryptocurrency holders were aged between 24 and 35 as of December 2024, and institutional allocations to crypto have increased since late 2024. These trends suggest a broadening investor base that could include older demographics as products and regulation mature. Crypto investor asset allocation. Source: Bybit Research Bitcoin accounted for one-third, or 30.95%, of total assets in investor portfolios as of May, up from 25.4% in November 2024. Greater allocation snapshots reflect both retail enthusiasm and growing institutional exposure. How will rising wealth change investor behavior toward crypto? Analysts at cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex noted that increasing personal wealth tends to increase diversification into newer assets. As wealth accumulates, investors with longer horizons can tolerate crypto volatility and allocate a portion of portfolios to digital assets for potential upside and uncorrelated returns. Younger, tech-savvy investors remain most inclined toward altcoins and emerging crypto projects. Over time, as households age and regulatory frameworks solidify, demand could shift toward perceived stores of value like Bitcoin, while a segment continues to pursue higher-risk, higher-reward crypto opportunities. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will global aging increase demand for Bitcoin?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s analysis projects aging could raise asset demand by roughly 200% of GDP between 2024 and 2100, a structural shift that supports long-duration and alternative asset demand. Who currently holds most cryptocurrency assets? As of December 2024, 34% of global crypto holders were aged 24–35, showing strong younger adoption. Institutional and older investor participation has been increasing with new regulated products and clearer policy signals. What should investors consider when allocating to crypto? Consider time horizon, diversification, regulatory developments, and risk tolerance. Use small strategic allocations for long-duration exposure and maintain liquidity for shorter-term needs. Key Takeaways Demographics matter : Aging populations concentrate investable wealth, lifting demand for financial assets. Wealth and regulation : Rising wealth plus regulatory clarity can broaden crypto adoption to older cohorts. Portfolio action : Investors may allocate a small strategic percentage to Bitcoin as a long-duration store of value while maintaining diversification. Conclusion Global aging and rising wealth create a multi-decade tailwind for Bitcoin demand and broader crypto adoption. As real interest rates adjust and regulation matures, older investors may incorporate cryptocurrencies into diversified portfolios. Monitor demographic research, regulatory updates, and institutional product launches to inform allocation decisions. COINOTAG will continue tracking these structural shifts. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to prepare a portfolio for demographic-driven asset demand"", ""description"": ""Steps to adjust portfolio allocations in response to aging-driven increases in asset demand and potential lower real rates."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/0199b3fa-2543-7ba7-81e4-a89c5dd909dc"", ""totalTime"": ""P1D"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess time horizon and risk tolerance"", ""text"": ""Review investment horizon and liquidity needs to determine the appropriate allocation to long-duration assets like Bitcoin."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Allocate strategically"", ""text"": ""Consider a modest allocation to Bitcoin for store-of-value exposure while preserving core holdings in diversified assets."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Use regulated products and custody"", ""text"": ""Prefer regulated investment vehicles and reputable custody solutions to reduce operational risk."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor macro and regulatory signals"", ""text"": ""Track demographic research, central bank reports, and regulatory developments that affect asset demand and interest rates."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Rebalance periodically"", ""text"": ""Rebalance portfolio to maintain target exposures and respond to changing risk profiles over time."" } ]} Published by COINOTAG • Updated: 2025-10-05",Analysis|News|BTC|Core,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-05 12:42:08

Analyst Ali says a $0.96 break could launch ADA toward $1.90, a key resistance test ahead. ADA trades between $0.76 and $0.96 Fibonacci bands, indicating tightening price action within consolidation. Cardano’s addition to the Nasdaq Crypto Index increases institutional access despite no ETF confirmation yet. What is Cardano’s current breakout outlook? Cardano price is consolidating inside a multi-month symmetrical triangle, trading near $0.857 between the 0.618 ($0.76) and 0.786 ($0.96) Fibonacci bands. A confirmed close above $0.96 could open targets at $1.28 and $1.86–$1.90, while failure to hold $0.75 risks a retracement to $0.65–$0.55. How could a $0.96 break affect ADA? A decisive break above $0.96 would invalidate the upper triangle boundary and likely trigger momentum-driven buying. Fibonacci extensions indicate technical targets at $1.28 (≈50% from current) and $1.86–$1.90 (≈115% from current). Volume expansion on the breakout would increase reliability. Symmetrical Triangle Range The price structure shows repeated tests of converging trendlines, confirming the symmetrical triangle pattern. Compression between rising support from the $0.32 zone and declining resistance near $1.80 has reduced volatility over months. Source: Ali on X Fibonacci checkpoints at 0.382 ($0.55) and 0.5 ($0.65) serve as fallback supports if downside momentum accelerates. Historical triangle breakouts often follow a period of compression, so traders should watch for volatility expansion accompanied by volume. Breakout and breakdown levels — what to watch? Near-term support sits at $0.75; a retest could act as a springboard for upward continuation. The $0.95–$0.96 zone is the critical resistance cluster; a confirmed breakout targets $1.28 and $1.86–$1.90 via Fibonacci extensions. Conversely, a failure to defend $0.75 would expose ADA to the $0.65–$0.55 region, likely prolonging consolidation. Risk management should prioritize tight stops and position sizing given potential 50%+ moves in either direction. Why does Nasdaq inclusion matter for Cardano? Cardano’s listing in the Nasdaq Crypto Index under asset manager Hashdex increases institutional visibility and may ease access through regulated products. This institutional layer complements the technical setup by widening potential buyer pools. There are no public filings confirming an ADA ETF at this time. Institutional index inclusion, however, can be a precursor to more structured product interest and merits monitoring alongside price action. Frequently Asked Questions What levels confirm a bullish Cardano breakout? A daily close above $0.96 with rising volume confirms a bullish breakout; initial targets are $1.28 and $1.86–$1.90, based on Fibonacci extensions. How should traders size positions around ADA’s triangle? Use smaller allocations until a confirmed breakout occurs. Place protective stops near $0.75 and reduce exposure if price falls below $0.65 to limit downside risk. Will Nasdaq Crypto Index inclusion force price movement? Index inclusion increases institutional access but does not guarantee immediate price movement. It improves market structure and could attract flows over time. Key Takeaways Critical breakout level : $0.96 daily close with volume signals a bullish move toward $1.28–$1.90. Key support : $0.75 guardrail; failure risks $0.65–$0.55 retracement. Institutional context : Nasdaq Crypto Index inclusion enhances visibility but no ETF filings confirmed. Conclusion Cardano price sits at a pivotal moment inside a symmetrical triangle, trading between key Fibonacci bands and eyeing a $0.96 breakout. Combine technical confirmation with institutional developments — including Nasdaq Crypto Index inclusion — to assess probability.

After a year dominated by ETF headlines and the accumulation of the asset by institutions, XRP is back. Although XRP is stable, MAGACOIN FINANCE is an emerging cryptocurrency that is offering good returns to early investors. Moreover, it is gaining attention as a new high-conviction play that is likely to deliver greater returns. Together, they illustrate the two sides of the 2025 bull market — resilient blue-chips vs high growth opportunities . XRP Maintains Strength Above $3.00 XRP is trading at approximately $3.04 with a market cap of nearly $182.7 billion. In the past week, the token increased roughly 10 percent in price, preserving momentum which began in early October. The support would be between $2.88 and $2.94 while the resistance zones would be at $2.99-$3.13 and $3.40–3.60. Moving up these levels could potentially extend the rally. Analysts attribute the recent increase to fresh optimism concerning spot ETF approvals and larger whale accumulation. According to wallet analytics, several new institutional addresses are taking in the supply. This implies that there is a quiet confidence that ETF confirmation could trigger another major rally before the end of the year. Technical forecasters project a broad range for the next quarter. October: $2.95 – $3.66 depending on ETF outcomes and trend confirmations. November: averages near $2.97 with highs to $3.02. December: consolidation near $3.00 – $3.07 as traders lock profits. Machine-learning price models have a median target of $3.18 for October. Further bullish extension to $3.45 also exists. If the ETF ruling favors XRP which is expected to be announced mid-month, it could rise above $3.50 and aim for summer highs of $3.60. Long-Term Outlook — Late 2025 and Beyond The bigger picture remains constructive. Several research houses projection targets of $4 by late 2025 if ETF inflows hold. The price can reach $5 to $6. There is also a possibility of reaching $8 to $10 if the market remains liquid and institutions continue to buy. XRP Weekly Price Chart: Source: CoinMarketCap In best-case scenarios for 2026-2027, some algorithmic models even show peaks of $15 to $20, which is full-scale tokenized payments and corporate remittance rails. XRP is unlikely to produce several explosive returns given its massive market cap, which is where investor attention is shifting to next. MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Deliver the High Growth Upside in 2025 While XRP provides long-term reliability, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become the new focal point for traders seeking high-growth exposure. Analysts describe it as a next-generation altcoin project blending verified audits, community traction, and fixed-supply scarcity the same early ingredients that once fueled XRP’s and Solana’s historic climbs. The project’s momentum has surprised even seasoned market watchers. As reports emerge of increasing participation from both retail and mid-tier funds, forecasts suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE could potentially transform a $1,000 allocation into as much as $50,000 over the next cycle, if current demand and liquidity trends persist. Unlike speculative hype plays, the MAGACOIN FINANCE appeal lies in its transparency, high upside, and unique value , establishing it as a credible growth candidate rather than a passing narrative. Its unique ecosystem reinforces investor trust, while its traction across Telegram and X reflects genuine organic interest. Portfolio Strategy: Balance Between Confidence and Conviction A good strategy for well-disciplined investors going into 2025 may be to hedge their bets between XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE. Both XRP and MAGACOIN are significant cryptocurrencies to consider for investment. According to experts, XRP is best for those who are risk-averse, whereas MAGACOIN offers exponential potential. Joining both creates a structure that evens out return and risk – a hedge between predictable strength and calculated asymmetry. Conclusion Investors who can combine conviction with timing can benefit from the crypto market as it enters 2025. XRP continues to be one of the most reliable large-cap assets. If ETF approvals are granted, the growth will be steady. In the meantime, MAGACOIN FINANCE symbolizes the breakout story – a project with community power, verifiable roots, and the capacity to turn tiny stakes into life-altering results. For those seeking both security and scale , pairing these two assets could prove to be one of the most strategic moves of the upcoming cycle.

Rally to $6 Loading?,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-trump-just-shocked-xrp-holders-rally-to-6-loading/,"Levi Rietveld, a finance expert and popular commentator in the digital asset space, recently shared his perspective on how U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest economic proposal could impact the cryptocurrency market—particularly XRP. In a video post, Rietveld claimed that Trump’s announcement about potentially reintroducing stimulus payments to Americans could become one of the most significant market catalysts since 2020. Trump Just SHOCKED #XRP Holders! pic.twitter.com/X1GhsYWueO — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 3, 2025 Trump’s Stimulus Plan and Its Market Implications According to Rietveld, Trump intends to put “stimulus back in the hands of every single American,” similar to the direct relief payments distributed during the COVID-19 pandemic. He noted that the last round of stimulus led to explosive gains across the digital asset market. Rietveld reminded his audience that when the 2020 stimulus measures were implemented, most cryptocurrencies, including XRP , Solana, and BNB, experienced dramatic price increases. He emphasized that this liquidity injection helped XRP achieve nearly 100% gains at the time. XRP’s Price Potential and Rietveld’s $6 Target Building on that comparison, Rietveld projected that a similar event under Trump’s current plan could push XRP’s price toward $6 per token . He described this target as a “base case” scenario purely from the expected capital inflow associated with stimulus spending. In his view, such an economic policy would significantly expand retail investment and could rejuvenate overall market sentiment that has remained relatively cautious in recent months. Rietveld urged XRP holders to prepare for this potential move, saying that those who are not positioned early enough might regret missing out. His comments were aimed directly at the XRP community, which has long been known for its strong belief in the asset’s long-term potential within the global payments ecosystem. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reaction to Rietveld’s Forecast The video also attracted several reactions from the broader crypto community. One user, J Berlin, echoed Rietveld’s forecast and stated that $6 was his current “buy ceiling,” indicating he would continue accumulating XRP until it reached that level before holding long-term. Another user, identified as Mike, expressed even greater optimism. He argued that Rietveld’s $6 target might be too conservative given the number of catalysts currently aligning for the cryptocurrency market. Mike highlighted the ongoing U.S. government shutdown as a contributing factor, suggesting it could accelerate financial shifts and pressure the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. He claimed that the resulting “reverse carry trade” would lead to a surge in asset prices, potentially amplifying XRP’s upward momentum beyond Rietveld’s base case projection. While Rietveld did not delve deeply into macroeconomic mechanisms, his message was clear: renewed stimulus spending could reignite enthusiasm in digital assets, with XRP among the leading beneficiaries. The argument relies heavily on the assumption that additional liquidity entering the economy would once again find its way into risk assets, as occurred in 2020.

Ethereum’s selling pressure is driven by large-scale spot sales from entities like Trend Research and heightened retail selling in futures, which raised exchange inflows and increased netflow. On-chain monitors report 102,355 ETH (~$455M) deposited for sale since Oct 1, pressuring short-term upside. How much ETH did Trend Research sell and what does CryptoQuant show? On-chain trackers (EmberCN, CryptoQuant) show Trend Research deposited 102,355 ETH (~$455 million) since Oct 1, including 41,421 ETH (~$189 million) on Oct 5. CryptoQuant data also indicates a positive Exchange Netflow (~81.7k ETH), consistent with elevated inflows and selling pressure. Key Takeaways Why is Ethereum facing renewed selling pressure? Trend Research has launched its second ETH sell-off, unloading 102,355 ETH worth $455M since the 1st of October. Can Ethereum hold its ground despite whale and retail selling? So far, yes. ETH remains resilient, trading near $4,590. If bulls absorb the sell pressure, ETH could retest $4,673 and aim for $4.8K. Since the market rebounded, Ethereum (ETH) has slowly responded with moderate gains. Since hitting a low of $3.8k, ETH traded within an ascending channel, reaching a high of $4,619. As of this writing, Ethereum was trading at $4,590 after a daily rise of 2.03%. But why is ETH still struggling? The selling spree from large wallets and derisking among retail traders is the main factor. Why are Ethereum whales offloading aggressively? On-chain analysis identifies large spot orders after the market rebound. Spot Average Order Size metrics pointed to repeated big whale orders across several days, suggesting renewed participation from large holders. Whale selling often signals reduced market conviction and can dampen sustained rallies if not absorbed by buyers. Source: CryptoQuant (plain text) EmberCN’s on-chain monitoring attributed a large portion of the deposits to Trend Research, which executed aggressive selling on Oct 1–5. Since Oct 1, Trend Research deposited 102,355 ETH worth roughly $455M, including a 41,421 ETH (~$189M) tranche on Oct 5. Source: EmberCN (plain text) Exchange Netflow remained positive for consecutive days, reflecting higher inflows. Netflow at press time was ~81.7k ETH, highlighting aggressive spot selling into exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant (plain text) How are retail traders influencing the market? Retail activity shifted to futures, where average order size data indicated dominant small-scale participation. CryptoQuant’s Futures Average Order Size and Futures Taker CVD metrics showed retail-heavy, taker-sell-dominant flows. When Taker CVD is sell-dominant, it often indicates position closures and derisking among retail traders, adding to short-term downside risk. Source: CryptoQuant (plain text) Source: CryptoQuant (plain text) Can ETH defy all odds? Despite elevated selling, momentum metrics suggest resilience. The Directional Movement Index (DMI) rose from 20 to 28, and the Relative Vigor Index (RVGI) sits at ~0.22, pointing to strengthening upward momentum. If bulls continue absorbing sell pressure, ETH could reclaim $4,673 and target $4.8k; a sustained break above $4.8k opens a path to $5k. Conversely, renewed heavy selling by whales could push support tests toward $4,415 and $4,248.

According to on-chain monitors (EmberCN, CryptoQuant as plain text references), Trend Research deposited 102,355 ETH (~$455 million) since Oct 1, including 41,421 ETH (~$189 million) on Oct 5. What on-chain metrics should traders watch now? Watch Exchange Netflow, whale deposit patterns, Futures Taker CVD, and momentum indicators (DMI, RVGI) for early signs of selling exhaustion or renewed downside. Key Takeaways Trend Research selling : 102,355 ETH (~$455M) deposited since Oct 1, elevating selling pressure. Exchange inflows : Netflow ~81.7k ETH, indicating significant spot selling into exchanges. Market outlook : Momentum metrics show resilience; reclaiming $4,673 and clearing $4.8k would be bullish, while heavy whale selling risks a decline toward $4,415–$4,248. Conclusion This on-chain analysis shows Ethereum selling pressure driven by large spot deposits and retail derisking in futures. While Trend Research’s offloads and positive netflows highlight near-term risk, momentum indicators suggest buyers are still absorbing supply.

The businessman, a resident of Haryana, filed a complaint with the police against the accused, who hails from Ahmedabad. The Indian businessman is accusing the scammer of breach of trust, cheating, among other things, after allegedly losing funds in the elaborate scam . The 48-year-old Indian businessman reported the incident to the Detection of Crime Branch, citing violations under sections related to criminal breach of trust, cheating, and criminal conspiracy. Indian businessman loses funds to scammer In his complaint, the Indian businessman claimed he was introduced to the accused by a friend living in the United Arab Emirates. He mentioned that his friend mentioned that the accused was involved in money exchange, but noted that he lacked the necessary licenses. However, the Indian businessman decided to ignore the warning and proceed with the crypto investment. The businessman explained that after discussions between his Dubai-based friend and the accused, a WhatsApp group for cryptocurrency investments was created. The complainant claimed that on September 18, he sent Rs. 1 crore through an angadia firm from Delhi to Ahmedabad. An Angadia is a service that functions as a parallel private banking or courier system, which is usually used to transfer large sums of money or expensive items between cities. After receiving the funds, the accused transferred 111,871 USDT into a crypto wallet, building trust. After the first transaction, the Indian businessman decided to carry out more transactions with the accused. In addition, he introduced several clients of his Dubai-based friend to the accused. On September 19, the businessman claimed he transferred an additional Rs. 8.50 crore through an angadia firm to Ahmedabad. However, the Indian businessman claimed that the accused failed to transfer the corresponding USDT to both his wallet and that of the other clients. He noted that instead of carrying out the service like he did the first time, he started offering excuses and even went as far as avoiding communication. The Indian businessman claimed he was able to retrieve Rs. 2.1 crore and another Rs. 6.40 crore from the accused, but claims he is still missing Rs. 1 crore and the remaining USDT that he was promised. This scam mirrors the rising criminal activities that have been reported in the Indian crypto industry since the beginning of the year. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the Central Bureau of Investigation carried out a raid under Operation Chakra-V against cybercrime, arresting five suspects in connection with the HPZ token scam.

The crypto market leader rose to near $124,000 before experiencing a slight retracement, which has now forced prices to $122,070. With the market maintaining a consolidation pattern, prominent analyst Ali Martinez has shared some important price insights based on the MVRV pricing bands. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP Testing Key Resistances And Could Turn Messy Again – Here’s Why Holding Above $117k Could Propel BTC To $140k Next The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) metric measures how far Bitcoin’s market price deviates from its realized price, effectively assessing whether BTC is overvalued or undervalued relative to historical norms. The chart’s color-coded deviation bands visualize these extremes, with the +0.5σ ($117,644) band presently acting as an important threshold. In an X post on October 4, Maritnez explains the importance of this deviation band, stating that BTC’s ability to maintain price action above this mid-level band could precede large-scale bullish continuations. In contrast, the chart below suggests that a sustained price drop below the +0.5σ has often marked deeper corrections or mid-cycle resets. Notably, the upper red band, marked around $139,800 (+1σ), represents the next key resistance level and an area where traders are expected to start taking profits. However, a steady consolidation above +0.5σ is necessary to maintain bullish structural strength and provide the push for the next leg, which is expected to propel BTC beyond its current all-time high at $124,457. However, a price fall below this level could result in Bitcoin heading to the mean deviation band around $95,394. This would represent a 21.8% decline from present market prices and potentially the start of a bear market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $160k By Early 2026? Analyst Identifies 2 Conditions For Uptrend Bitcoin Realized Price Steady At $54,000 As Market Remains Healthy In other news, Glassnode MVRV pricing bands data reveal that the current BTC realized price is set around $54,348. For context, this metric reflects the average price at which investors last moved their BTC, effectively serving as a psychological support during market corrections. Notably, the current gap between the spot price, around $122,000, and the realized price underscores a healthy bull phase, with most holders sitting on substantial unrealized gains. As long as the realized price continues to rise steadily, it reinforces the underlying strength of the market and signals long-term confidence in an upward trajectory. At press time, Bitcoin is valued at $122,197 following a 0.3% decline in the past day. In tandem, the daily trading volume is down by 55.52% representing a fall in trading activity.

Entities like Bitmine and MicroStrategy drive total DAT assets to approximately $135B, although sustainability depends on maintaining volatility-driven funding. Aster and Hyperliquid captured nearly one-third (32%) of all blockchain fees as perpetual futures trading volumes jumped (+30%) MoM, powered by Aster’s token launch and incentive farming.. September brought familiar weakness across crypto markets with token declines, lower blockchain revenues from fading volatility, and renewed focus on Solana’s Alpenglow upgrade, Ethereum’s Fusaka milestone, and enterprise blockchain revival.

September was a disappointing month for most cryptocurrencies as the selloff in the waning days of the month dragged most tokens underwater. Out of the 35 major native blockchain tokens we track, 23 of them experienced a decline in value in September. BTC was positive (+5%), ETH was down (-5%), and the performance of the alt-token complex was mixed, with the MarketVector Smart Contract Leaders Index (MVSCLE) flat (0%). Thematically, stablecoins once again seized the narrative with Plasma’s ((XPL)) $10B chain launch that included a $1.25B+ airdrop to users of the platform as well as Binance’s BNB token stakers. This, alongside the emergence of Binance’s Perps exchange, called Aster ( ASTER-USD ), contributed to BNB’s (+16%) outperformance on the month. The seasoned crypto investor is not surprised by September’s weak performance. Since 2016, across the 35 tokens we track, September has delivered negative returns (62%) of the time. While both BTC and ETH recorded positive returns in September in each of the last two years, looking back further in history reveals a typical weakness. BTC posted negative results in six consecutive Septembers prior, while ETH was negative in five of the previous six. On average, since 2016, BTC has returned (–3%) in September, while ETH has lost (–7%). Onchain, spot crypto decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes were roughly equal to those in August at approximately $365B. However, the trading volume of perpetual futures (perps) on DEXes was (+30%), and this surge was almost entirely due to the trading on BNB’s Aster, which we cover later in this write-up. Absent the explosion in “farming” volumes on Aster, perp volumes were actually down (-15%) month-over-month. Blockchain Revenues Decline due to Reduced Volatility One of the most notable onchain developments in September was the broad decline in blockchain revenues, which fell (-16%) MoM. Among major networks, Ethereum’s revenue decreased by (-6%), Solana’s ( SOL-USD ) by (-11%), and Tron’s by a striking (-37%). This contraction was largely driven by reduced crypto market volatility, evidenced by volatility declines of SOL (-16%), ETH (-40%), and BTC (-26%) MoM. With reduced volatility for digital assets, there are fewer arbitrage opportunities to compel traders to pay high priority fees. Tron’s sharp drop, however, was more related to the onchain governance Proposal #104, which more than halved transaction fees.

Notable Performance Winners and Laggards for September Winners Mantel (MNT): (+53%) Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ): (+24%) Binance ( BNB-USD ): (+16%) Laggards Polygon (POL) ( MATIC-USD ): (-19%) Arbitrum (ARB): (-17%) Toncoin (TON) ( TONCOIN-USD ): (-14%) Digital Asset Treasury ((DAT)) Update Thematically, September 2025 was characterized by the continued growth of digital asset treasuries (DATs), which swelled to hold around ~$135B in assets (~53% in MSTR). DATs are entities that utilize financialization to increase common share exposure to digital assets. Some DAT EVs currently trade at mNAV premiums to the value of their digital asset treasury holdings. We believe this is partly explained by the market assigning a premium to entities that have a credible long-term ability to increase per-share digital asset exposure. To purchase more digital assets, companies often sell securities whose valuations are linked to the underlying volatility of the company’s stock. In order to “reap” the benefits of the volatility of their common shares (and the underlying digital assets), these entities must price the volatility they are selling well below the implied volatility of options. This allows sophisticated market participants to buy relatively cheap volatility (through common shares, convertible debt, or warrant sales) and hedge against relatively expensive options portfolios. These savvy traders then expect the volatility of the two positions to converge over time, enabling a profit on the trade. BNMR Enjoys Almost Twice the Daily Turnover of Other DATs Source: Bloomberg as of 9/29/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. One issue that many new DATs are encountering is the lack of deep and liquid markets for the secondary trading of their securities (particularly options). As a result, DATs without a developed options market must offer investors large discounts on volatility. Recently, Bitmine Immersion, the largest ETH DAT with >$11B in ETH holdings, sold common shares priced at $70 (when the stock was trading at $61.39). Alongside these common shares were two attached warrants to purchase additional shares at a higher price. Effectively, Bitmine sold investors common shares in BNMR with two free call options with a strike price of $87.50. Using options math, each of these warrants is worth about $20 on its own. Combined, Bitmine sold a package worth $104.61 ($61.39 + $21.61 + $21.61) for $70. This means BNMR is underpricing volatility by selling warrants at a steep discount, which is quite a caper for the trader who can manage the options risk. Stepping back, BNMR is the most widely traded DAT by nearly a factor of two and still had to underprice its volatility by ~75% to provide enough juice for speculators to buy its securities. Apt investors should take note that these “volatility reactors,” as Saylor calls DATs, necessitate continual volatility to enable further purchase of cryptocurrencies. For almost a decade, cryptocurrency volatility has declined, and if this trend persists, it threatens the ability of DATs to finance more crypto purchases. As speculative zest fades at the same time and more digital asset products become available, mNAV should therefore fade because investors can no longer count on most DATs to expand their treasuries consistently. BTC 30-Day Trailing Volatility Trending Lower Due to Adoption Source: Artemis XYZ as of 9/29/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Another developing narrative is that DATs may actively compress implied volatility by selling options (and by selling warrants) to generate income. Saylor recently confirmed at a conference that Strategy would pursue this approach under circumstances where he could not issue shares due to MSTR mNAV Solana Update (+2%) SOL/ETH Below 1-Year Trendline Source: Artemis XYZ as of 9/29/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The SOL token had a relatively good, but deeply unsatisfying, end to the month after it punched above $250 mid-month before falling below $200 in the span of a week. SOL’s price action was mostly driven by ebullience surrounding the potential SOL ETP and the start of several new SOL-focused digital asset treasuries (DATs). In September, the two major DAT behemoths, Forward ($1.5B) and Helius ($500M), began operations, which translated into increased buying demand for SOL. At the time of writing, it is estimated that Solana DATs hold 2.5% of the total SOL supply, and there are rumors that more SOL DATs may be forming. From the technical development standpoint, Solana opened the month with its validators voting to pass the Alpenglow upgrade by a (98%) margin. Many believe this is the largest upgrade to Solana’s consensus in its history, as it is the first step towards changing many core features of the Solana software. Some of the most monumental impacts include: Faster finality time, dropping from 12s to 150ms Offchain voting on blocks Improved validator economics Simpler, faster network communication mechanisms Higher levels of consensus stability Improved efficiency As a consequence of the Alpenglow upgrade, there have been calls by some developers to increase the capacity of each block on Solana. Each transaction on Solana is quantified by the computing power needed to process it. The measurement of computing power is called “compute units,” and there is a limit to how many compute units a transaction can demand. Additionally, there is a limit on how many compute units an entire block of transactions can contain. Effectively, Solana’s transaction throughput is limited by the number of compute units that can be packed into each block. Already, Solana is on track to increase block capacity by 25% by the end of the year, while Jump’s Firedancer team recently proposed SIMD-0370 to remove Solana’s fixed compute unit block limit entirely. Another, deeper change to Solana’s architecture comes from creating the “P-token” which is intended to replace the current token format called “SPL token.” The SPL tokens are inefficient because they consume a substantial number of compute units when they are transferred or traded. Around 10% of all of Solana’s blockspace (a rough synonym for compute unit capacity of each block) is utilized by SPL token compute units. The “P-token” will reduce the compute needs of tokens by 95%. As a result, Solana can increase its transaction throughput by nearly 10%. In terms of its offering for the current financial system, Solana has been winning market share for products like tokenized stocks. In the past few months, Solana has hosted 60% of the volume on its Chain. At the same time, Solana added $2B worth of stablecoins to its blockchain to bring its total to $14.3B. Enterprise Blockchains Re-Emerge Cryptocurrency is the nexus of cryptography, distributed systems, and economics to create a private money that competes with government-backed fiat. Once Bitcoin proved that decentralized networks could coordinate and transfer value, others began to experiment with building blockchains with fewer technical limitations. Amongst these actors were corporations and foundations dedicated to building chains that solved issues plaguing large companies. While blockchains presented a range of potential applications, the majority of corporate endeavors were exploratory in nature, motivated by a desire to align with perceived trends rather than by serious strategic intent. For example, in 2016, JP Morgan forked Ethereum to create Quorum, a permissioned chain for use by financial institutions, that incorporated smart contracts to speed up asset settlement, enforce repo transactions, and reduce compliance checks in cross-border payments. By 2018, entities such as Walmart and Carrefour were utilizing blockchain to trace the origin of vegetables sold in their stores. Another interesting experiment was HSBC’s Voltron digitizing letters of credit and MineHub, which placed a BHP iron-ore trade on a private blockchain in 2020. In the shipping sector, Tradelens, a collaboration of IBM and Maersk, used IBM’s Fabric distributed ledger to document global shipping data and documentation. The majority of these early projects delivered little more than PR buzz and tax breaks from R&D spending. Most were proof-of-concepts that either lacked a real-world problem to solve or were blocked by regulatory constraints. Many collapsed altogether when their values failed to exceed the necessary moment to launch beyond the gravitational pull of stakeholders wedded to legacy systems. With the latest surge in token prices as well as the pending legislation on stablecoins and digital assets, corporations are once again exploring blockchain use. However, this time appears to be different because there is both legal clarity and encouragement for utilizing blockchain coming from Washington, DC. It appears that this is the “crypto moment” in the same way that 2009 was a “green energy moment” with the ascension of Barack Obama to the presidency. Some of the most eye-catching “enterprise” blockchain projects include: Figure Technologies Provenance is a Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ) blockchain that is used as a ledger of record for HELOCs and, in the future, other asset-backed securities. SWIFT SWIFT is collaborating with 30 financial institutions to create a shared digital ledger that will be interoperable with existing blockchains. Societe Generale Forge is a fully regulated and compliant platform for tokenization and stablecoins, enabling connections to public blockchains and traditional market infrastructure. Stripe Tempo is an Ethereum based network that will become a neutral stablecoin payments network which can be used by agentic AI. Digital Asset Canton, a collaboration between DRW, Tradeweb, and GS, is a privacy-first, settlement network for securities trading and asset exchanges between financial institutions. Circle Arca, Circle’s USDC-focused payments blockchain. OpenAI Worldchain is blockchain created to host the ID system that will distinguish human users from AI users on the internet. Coinbase Base is Coinbase’s ( COIN ) home for DeFi and crypto payments including the likely home of Cloudflare’s AI agentic payment stablecoin NET. Ripple The Ripple ( XRP-USD ) network is creating a settlement system and payments financial entities like the major prime broker Hidden Road. JPMorgan Kinexys Digital Payments network to create programable, cross-chain payments 24/7. Ethereum Update (-2%) ETH traded down slightly (-2%) in September, underperforming BTC’s (+7%) gain after two months of double-digit outperformance in July and August. Daily transactions fell (-8.7%) to 47.2M from the all-time high of 51.7M set in August but remained the second-highest month on record. Similarly, DEX trading volumes fell (-20.3%) to $111.9B from all-time highs of $140.5B set in August, the third-highest month on record behind the previous cycle highs of $118.1B set in June 2021. At $1.74T, stablecoin transfer volumes on Ethereum were also the second highest on record in September, down (-4%) from all-time highs of $1.80T in August, up (+105%) YTD. The Fusaka Upgrade Ethereum’s scaling roadmap is entering its next phase with the planned Fusaka upgrade in December 2025, which will introduce Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS). PeerDAS helps improve Ethereum’s Layer-2 (L2) blockchain scalability by reducing the data requirements needed by Ethereum validators to verify the L2s. As a result, Fusaka is designed to relieve one of the network’s most pressing bottlenecks: data availability for rollups. Blob Count Reached New Target For The First Time Since The Dencun Upgrade Source: Dune Analytics @hildobby as of 9/29/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The chart above shows that average blob usage has reached the six-blob target for the first time since Dencun went live in March 2025. Dencun initially launched with a conservative cap of three blobs per block, but after developers confirmed network stability, the ceiling was raised to six in May. Since then, L2 rollups have increasingly filled this expanded blob space, demonstrating sustained demand for cheap data availability and marking another milestone in Ethereum’s transition toward rollup-centric scaling. Currently, Coinbase’s Base and Worldcoin’s World Chain represent around 60% of all data submitted by L2s to Ethereum. World Chain and Base Submit 60% of All L2 Data Source: Dune Analytics @hildobby as of 9/30/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Fusaka will allow Ethereum to raise blob capacity further by enabling nodes to validate blocks through probabilistic sampling rather than downloading full blob data. This approach reduces bandwidth and storage demands on validators, making higher blob throughput feasible without undermining security. The roadmap envisions incremental increases in blob targets through “Blob Parameter Only” (BPO) forks, with Fusaka providing the critical technical foundation. That said, PeerDAS introduces complexity, relying on erasure coding and statistical guarantees. Developers are intentionally conservative in their approach, rolling out capacity in phases to minimize the risk of bandwidth spikes or validator stress. The implications of Fusaka are significant. By expanding blob capacity, the upgrade should lower costs for L2 rollups, translating into cheaper transactions for end users. All else equal, this should bring more onchain economic activity into Ethereum’s orbit. While Fusaka may not materially restore L1 fee burns, since L2 adoption has historically cannibalized Ethereum’s mainnet fee revenue, the upgrade reinforces ETH’s role at the center of Ethereum’s broader ecosystem. The chart below highlights this dynamic, showing how declining L1 fee revenues have coincided with rising ETH dilution for non-stakers. Falling L1 Fees Are Driving Net ETH Dilution for Non-Stakers Source: Artemis.xyz as of 9/29/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. As more economic activity takes place on L2s due to increased bandwidth and reduced fees, the economic security of Ethereum L1 settlements becomes increasingly important. This enhances ETH’s importance as a store of value and monetary asset, even against the backdrop of a secular decline in L1 fee economics. In other words, investors should be aware that the case for ETH is trending away from its status as a fee-driven yield-bearing asset and instead towards a monetary one. Moreover, as institutional actors like DATs and ETPs continue to accumulate long-term ETH positions to stake for in-kind yield, investors holding unstaked ETH should be aware of their exposure to dilution. The Battle of Perpetual Futures DEXs: Hyperliquid vs. Aster Perpetual DEXs Surge: Aster and Hyperliquid Capture One-Third of Crypto Fee Revenues Source: Artemis.xyz as of 9/29/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Perpetuals are becoming the fastest-growing corner of DeFi, and two names now dominate the conversation: Hyperliquid and Aster. Hyperliquid ( HYPE-USD ) gained (+1.5%) this month, cooling off after being one of the Top 100 crypto’s best performers YTD (+88%). Aster (ASTER), another decentralized exchange specializing in perpetual futures trading, stole the spotlight after launching its ASTER token in September, which is up (+1,667%) since it began trading on September 17th. Beyond price action, both protocols are now among the top fee generators in the crypto space, together accounting for nearly one-third (32%) of all blockchain fee revenues as of late September. Perpetual futures (“perps”) are derivatives that let traders speculate on the price of an asset with leverage but without expiry dates, making them the dominant product on centralized exchanges like Binance and OKX. Hyperliquid’s success comes from transplanting this model onchain with a fully on-chain, high-performance order book deployed on its own Layer-1. Unlike earlier perp decentralized exchanges (“DEXs”) that relied on automated market makers (e.g., GMX’s GLP pools) or hybrid off-chain order books (e.g., dYdX v3), Hyperliquid handles matching and risk management natively at the chain level. This architecture enables it to provide instant user feedback on centralized exchanges while maintaining non-custodial settlement. Hyperliquid offers a superior user experience to legacy AMM-based DeFi applications that have been lauded by sophisticated and retail traders alike. The result has been strong adoption in perp trading volume and fee generation, with Hyperliquid now ranking among the top protocols in DeFi revenues. Hyperliquid’s native HYPE token is a fee-sharing token, allowing holders to earn a share of the protocol’s fees when staking the asset. On a circulating basis, HYPE’s $12.2B market cap against $976M in annualized revenues values the DEX at 12.5x P/S, roughly in line with centralized exchange (“CEX”) comps such as Coinbase (11.5x) or Robinhood (23.7x). However, on a fully diluted basis, HYPE trades at 45.7x revenues, a valuation more akin to high-growth SaaS than exchanges. We think this is a more appropriate valuation. There is ongoing uncertainty around how uncirculated HYPE tokens will be treated; a proposal to burn (45%) of HYPE’s 1 billion supply cap was rejected in late September. It is also important to note that Hyperliquid’s annualized revenues can be highly volatile and may not be sustainable in the long term. This is because substantial amounts of the application’s trading activity is driven by HYPE token incentives. Backed by CZ’s family office YZi Labs, Aster leapt into the perps DEX conversation since launching its ASTER token on Binance’s BNB Chain in mid-September. The platform announced a points program that allocates (4%) of total supply, worth roughly $524M at a $13.1B FDV, to users based on their trading volumes, holding time, and other activities. While these incentives have driven sufficient volumes to reach the #1 position in crypto-native fees in late September, open interest suggests that this hasn’t earned users’ long-term capital. Rather, much of Aster’s fee generation appears to be wash trading by users “farming” the airdrop, as opposed to organic perp demand; at ~$1.6B, Aster’s open interest remains less than one-eighth that of Hyperliquid’s.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. ASTER’s sharp price rally reflects the size of its airdrop carrot and corresponding market hype, but the real question is whether Aster’s open interest can sustainably steal market share from Hyperliquid’s more dominant liquidity after these incentives dry up. This remains uncertain because Aster has not made nearly the claim that Hyperliquid has beyond the ASTER token price pump. Additionally, Aster is an application wedded to Binance and may experience usability issues if Binance’s blockchain becomes saturated with activity. On the other hand, Hyperliquid has demonstrated its functionality during extreme market events without serious degradation to the user's ability to trade.

Bitcoin to $150,000: onchain accumulation and macro catalysts point to a possible late-2025 rally — follow support levels and options flow. Read COINOTAG analysis. Onchain dynamics and falling whale selling suggest a renewed accumulation phase for Bitcoin, which some analysts say could drive BTC toward $150,000 before the end of 2025, according to market commentary and blockchain data platforms. Bitcoin breached a new all-time high over the weekend, prompting market participants to reassess accumulation behavior and medium-term price targets. Bitcoin (BTC) recently set a new all-time high above $125,700, and market capitalization briefly exceeded $2.5 trillion, marking a notable milestone in crypto market capitalization. Macro factors—including the recent US government shutdown—have renewed debate about Bitcoin’s role as a store of value amid political uncertainty and loose liquidity conditions. Fabian Dori, chief investment officer at Sygnum Bank, highlighted that periods of political dysfunction have historically driven interest in decentralized assets, potentially creating the conditions for major price milestones. BTC/USD, year-to-date chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView What is driving the current Bitcoin accumulation phase? Onchain data and macro liquidity conditions are driving the current accumulation phase. Metrics show easing selling pressure from large holders, shorter-term holders stabilizing, and a reset in options open interest that can precede concentrated upside moves. How are whales and long-term holders affecting BTC supply? Onchain indicators show reduced outflows from known large-wallet clusters and growth in exchange-held balances slowing. Glassnode and other blockchain data platforms report lower realized selling and increased long-term holding, which historically compresses circulating supply and can amplify upside when demand reappears. Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen, notes the market impact of political events will hinge on how they change Federal Reserve rate expectations. A move toward dovish policy would likely strengthen risk-asset flows into crypto. Source: Glassnode When could Bitcoin reach $150,000? Analysts project a potential breakout to $150,000 in late 2025 if BTC sustains momentum above the $120,000 psychological level and macro liquidity remains favorable. Confirmation would require multi-week stability and volume-backed moves. What technical and macro levels matter most? Key technical levels: support near $120,000 and resistance clusters around recent highs. Macro catalysts include Fed guidance, US political developments, and shifts in institutional flows such as ETF inflows and options positioning. How to read the current options and open interest signals? Options open interest recently reset after expiry. A lower open interest can reduce short-term leverage, which may limit downside volatility and set the stage for directional moves when fresh demand appears. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to identify Bitcoin accumulation phase"", ""description"": ""A step-by-step checklist to recognize onchain and market signs of accumulation."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199b481-e4f8-7ca2-8d66-589194b52316.webp"", ""totalTime"": ""P0DT0H30M"", ""tool"": [ ""Onchain data platform (e.g., Glassnode - plain text)"", ""Options flow monitor"", ""Price chart with volume"" ], ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": """", ""name"": ""Check whale selling"", ""text"": ""Look for declining large-wallet outflows and lower realized selling from long-term holders."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": """", ""name"": ""Monitor open interest"", ""text"": ""Confirm options open interest has reset and observe whether new positions are building on dips."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": """", ""name"": ""Confirm macro backdrop"", ""text"": ""Assess Fed commentary and liquidity indicators; dovish shifts favor risk-on assets."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Bitcoin entering an accumulation phase?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Onchain indicators give leading evidence of supply-demand shifts but are not timing tools alone. Combine onchain data with price action, volume, and macro signals for a higher-confidence view. Will the US government shutdown directly cause a BTC surge? Political events can increase interest in decentralised assets, but sustained price impact depends on subsequent Fed policy and market liquidity responses rather than the shutdown alone. Key Takeaways Accumulation signal : Onchain metrics point to reduced selling from whales and steadier short-term holders. Macro catalyst : Fed tilt toward dovish policy and liquidity conditions could amplify upside. Actionable insight : Watch $120,000 as key support; sustained closes above it increase the probability of a move toward $150,000. Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent all-time highs and onchain signals indicate a potential renewed accumulation phase. While markets require multi-week confirmation, the combination of easing whale selling, an options open interest reset, and favorable macro conditions could support a rally to $150,000 by late 2025.

As of early October, the most recent report available is from July . That delay puts USD1 out of step with rivals like Circle’s USDC, which published reserve data through August, and Tether, which reports quarterly, Greg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at NYDIG, said in a report. “For a project of USD1’s stature, up-to-date attestations are non-negotiable,” Cipolaro wrote. CoinDesk has reached out to BitGo and World Liberty Financial for comment but hasn’t heard back by the time of writing. The BitGo connection While BitGo Trust oversees custody of the stablecoin’s reserves, the issuer, BitGo Technologies, hasn’t explained the gap in reporting. The lapse is notable given USD1’s rising profile and $2.7 billion in supply, he noted. At the same time, USD1’s token distribution suggests most of its traction is offshore. NYDIG claims that its analysis of top wallets shows that roughly 78% of the supply sits in addresses linked to overseas exchanges. Looking ahead, USD1’s structure may conflict with the incoming GENIUS Act. The law, expected to take effect by early 2027, limits stablecoin issuance to subsidiaries of regulated banks or state-qualified entities. NYDIG also said that BitGo Technologies doesn’t currently appear fit either in the regulated banks or state-qualified entities category, meaning structural changes may be required, Cipolaro wrote.",Finance|World Liberty Financial|Stablecoin|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-05 14:00:00

Watch for a sustained close above the wedge with rising volume as confirmation for a valid breakout. LINK testing upper trendline of a falling wedge—breakout above $22 is key. Target near $30 on a confirmed breakout; prepare for an ~38% upside move. Volume confirmation is critical to validate the breakout and reduce false‑break risk. ChainLink breakout: LINK eyes $30 after falling wedge breakout—watch $22 resistance and volume confirmation. Read analysis and trade signals on COINOTAG. What is the ChainLink breakout outlook? The ChainLink breakout outlook shows LINK consolidating in a falling wedge on the 12‑hour chart, which often precedes bullish reversals. A decisive close above the wedge and the $22 level, confirmed by rising volume, would increase the probability of a move toward the $30 area. How can LINK break above $22 and what confirms it? LINK can break above $22 if buying pressure overcomes the upper wedge trendline on sustained timeframe closes. Key confirmations include a 12‑ to 24‑hour close above $22, a clear volume uptick relative to the recent average, and follow‑through candles that form higher lows. Binance 12‑hour data shows the pattern; Source: CliftonFx (plain text). Source CliftonFx Via X Why is the falling wedge significant for traders? The falling wedge is significant because it signals weakening selling pressure and potential accumulation. Historically, breakouts from this setup can produce fast moves. In LINK’s case, the measured move projects roughly an $8.68 increase from the breakout area—about a 38.7% gain from current levels. What are the risk factors traders should monitor? Watch for failed breakouts, low-volume spikes, and rejections at overhead resistance. If LINK closes back below the wedge with higher selling volume, the pattern can invalidate. Risk management should include stop placement below recent lows and position sizing aligned with volatility. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""ChainLink breakout: LINK eyes $30 after falling wedge"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/a883341b-b05c-4f45-9004-b85714cdc9e2.jpg"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-05T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-05T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""ChainLink is forming a falling wedge on the 12‑hour chart.

Measured‑move targets project roughly 38% if the breakout is confirmed. Probability is conditional: success hinges on a sustained close above $22 and clear volume confirmation. Without volume, the chance of a false breakout rises. How should I set stops and targets for a LINK trade? Set an initial target near $30 and a protective stop below the last swing low within the wedge. Size positions to limit risk per trade to your plan and adjust stops as price action confirms the breakout. Key Takeaways Falling wedge pattern : Suggests weakening sellers and potential bullish reversal. Breakout level : A sustained close above $22 is the primary trigger to watch. Confirmation needed : Rising trading volume and follow‑through candles reduce false‑break risk; manage risk with stops. Conclusion ChainLink’s current 12‑hour falling wedge positions LINK for a potential breakout that could target near $30 if the $22 level is convincingly cleared with volume confirmation. Traders should prioritize confirmation and risk management while watching on‑chain and exchange liquidity signals.

52707241,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85423,1759672931,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Crypto Proponent: I Firmly Believe XRP Will Reach $100 By 2030,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-proponent-i-firmly-believe-xrp-will-reach-100-by-2030/,"Crypto investor 24HRSCRYPTO has made a bold prediction that XRP will reach a price of $100 by 2030, adding that such a milestone could occur much earlier than that. The comment has attracted significant attention across the XRP community, as the investor’s confidence reflects a broader sentiment among long-term holders who believe XRP’s true valuation is yet to be realized. My firm belief is that XRP will reach $100 by 2030… But honestly, I think I’m wrong. It’s going to happen sooner than that. — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) October 3, 2025 Investor’s Confidence in XRP’s Trajectory In his statement, 24HRSCRYPTO reaffirmed his conviction in XRP’s long-term value, emphasizing that the digital asset’s potential extends beyond current market expectations. His belief that the $100 target could arrive sooner than 2030 reflects growing optimism surrounding XRP’s role in the evolving financial landscape, where cross-border settlement, institutional liquidity, and tokenized asset transfers are becoming focal points of blockchain integration. This outlook aligns with the growing narrative that XRP could play a pivotal role in a future financial ecosystem designed for real-time, interoperable transactions. The investor’s remark was not speculative in tone but rather positioned as a reasoned forecast grounded in the expectation of accelerating adoption and increasing demand. Community Perspectives and Forecasts Several commentators weighed in under the post, each presenting their own analysis and timelines for XRP’s future valuation. One user, Lj26ft, connected the projection to Bitcoin’s potential future movement, noting that if Bitcoin were to reach $392,000 and XRP maintained its historical XRP/BTC ratio, XRP’s value could sit between $90 and $100. Another community member, Crypto Life, went further, suggesting that XRP could trade between $400 and $2,000 by 2030, while forecasting triple-digit prices by the end of 2026. A third commentator, Right Wing Inkorporated, stated that after using artificial intelligence models to simulate potential adoption outcomes, XRP’s price projection ranged between $100 and $1,000 depending on market integration and global usage. These varied outlooks reflect a shared conviction among XRP proponents that the asset’s utility-driven growth could produce extraordinary results once broader adoption is achieved. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Context and Price Outlook According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP is currently trading at $3.02. For the digital asset to reach $100, its price would need to rise by approximately 3,211%. Based on its current circulating supply, such an increase would place XRP’s total market capitalization in the multi-trillion-dollar range, positioning it among the most valuable financial assets globally. 24HRSCRYPTO’s projection reinforces the growing perception that XRP’s price potential is not tied to speculation alone but to the expansion of its real-world use cases. Should adoption accelerate and liquidity demand rise in line with the ongoing digital transformation of finance, the scenario outlined by the investor may arrive sooner than many anticipate.
