In other words, XRP’s liquidity reality may be far smaller than its theoretical supply, meaning smaller inflows of capital could trigger disproportionately large price reactions. Understanding the Market Cap Multiplier In a recent video, Jake Claver, managing partner at Digital Wealth Partners, tackled the growing debate head-on: “People look at total supply of XRP when, in reality, the supply-demand dynamics are going to be on the available supply of XRP,” he explained. This distinction — between XRP’s total supply of 100 billion and the much smaller circulating amount that actually trades — is at the heart of the multiplier effect. Let's look at what the XRP market cap multiplier effect means pic.twitter.com/5tiUdpHt6i — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 3, 2025 Claver illustrated this with a practical example: “There might be 2 billion XRP left on exchanges — probably less than that if you include retail and what they’re going to exit or sell.” He added that even if XRP’s price skyrockets to $10, $20, or even $50, some retail investors would inevitably sell portions of their holdings, adding perhaps another billion XRP to the liquid market. But that still represents a small share of total supply. The Math Behind the Multiplier Claver broke down the logic simply: “If you only had, let’s say, 2 billion [XRP] out of 100 billion, you’d be that 50x that Zach Rector talks about. It’s total supply versus available supply — and that’s why you get a shift in how much liquidity moving in is going to cause the market cap to rise in a multiplier effect.” When buyers enter the market, their demand impacts a smaller pool of available tokens, rather than the total supply. This limited float magnifies price movements, which in turn amplifies market capitalization faster than would occur in a fully distributed asset. Institutional Holdings and Market Liquidity Claver also revealed that his firm, Digital Wealth Partners, currently manages around 200 million XRP, accounting for roughly 8% of retail-owned XRP, based on his estimates. This institutional custody further concentrates holdings, reducing the amount of XRP readily available on exchanges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 “Retail doesn’t hold more than maybe 1.2 to 2 billion total XRP in my opinion,” he said, emphasizing that these liquidity dynamics are critical for understanding XRP’s future price behavior. Broader Context and Implications While the multiplier concept doesn’t change XRP’s total supply — which remains capped at 100 billion — it reframes how market participants should interpret liquidity and price discovery. Ripple’s monthly escrow releases , typically capped at 1 billion XRP, also control how much new supply enters circulation, keeping active liquidity relatively tight. The takeaway is clear: XRP’s potential price response is not purely a function of total supply, but of how much XRP is actually tradable. As Claver summarized, “It’s total supply versus available supply. That’s the reason there is a multiplier effect.” The XRP market cap multiplier effect shows how small changes in liquidity can lead to significant price movements. It’s not speculation — it’s a structural feature of how XRP trades in real-world conditions, where limited availability magnifies every dollar of demand that flows into the asset.

But what you've heard or seen so far doesn't necessarily align with what's actually coming out.” The company announced that the new program will be called MetaMask Rewards and will not be a farming-focused system. It was announced that more than $30 million in LINEA token rewards will be distributed in the first season (Season 1).

Timing is crucial: the best stories sync with industry cycles like regulation, restaking, or stablecoins. Syndication multiplies reach: one article can turn into dozens of pickups across CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, Yahoo Finance, and more. Long-term PR builds reputation and trust — moving projects from short-term hype to lasting influence. For many founders, PR begins and ends with a press release. You raise a round, launch a feature, or announce a partnership — so you send a statement to the media and hope it lands somewhere. But in crypto, where attention cycles move at breakneck speed and skepticism is the default, a press release alone rarely does the job. The projects that break through are the ones that treat PR not as a one-off announcement, but as a way to shape narratives, influence conversations, and build credibility over time. Crypto PR Turns Features Into Stories That Matter The crypto industry is littered with updates that sound alike: staking pools, wallet upgrades, bridge integrations. On their own, they blur together. What cuts through is when a feature becomes part of a bigger story. Take gas fees: no journalist is writing about a dashboard redesign. But if a protocol slashes fees at a time when high costs are throttling DeFi activity, that update suddenly taps into one of the space’s biggest debates. Agencies like Outset PR build entire campaigns on this principle. They argue that newsworthiness comes not from the feature itself, but from the tension it addresses in the wider market. It’s a simple filter: if it matters beyond the company’s walls, it matters to the press. Why Timing Is Critical in Web3 Narratives In crypto, timing can be as important as substance. The industry shifts focus every few weeks: one moment it’s restaking, the next it’s stablecoins, then regulation. The strongest stories can fall flat if they land just a few days too late. This is why timing is often cited as the biggest mistake projects make in their outreach — assuming that because something is big for them, it will automatically matter for everyone else. PR done well is less about hype and more about syncing with the rhythm of the industry. Get it right, and your project feels relevant. Miss the window, and even a solid story disappears. Tailoring for Media and Community Crypto PR also has to work on two fronts: journalists and communities. Both care about the same story, but they consume it differently. Media want clarity and independence. They need verifiable data, not just claims. Communities want belonging. They want to feel like progress is happening because of them and with them. Smart PR reframes the same narrative for both. For the press: “Our protocol reduced gas fees by 70%, backed by hard numbers.” For the community: “We heard your feedback, and together we solved one of the biggest pain points.” It’s the same story, just told through different lenses — and that balance is what builds trust. Syndication in Crypto PR: From One Press Release to Dozens of Mentions One of the most overlooked aspects of crypto PR is what happens after an article runs. A single placement can spark dozens of secondary mentions across aggregators, media hubs, and community feeds. This ripple effect is often invisible to teams who only track traffic from the first article. Yet it’s what determines whether a project’s story feels like a blip — or like it’s everywhere. For example, Outset PR tracked how a tier-1 feature for StealthEX turned into 92 republications across platforms like CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance. The outreach from those pickups reached billions, far beyond what the original article could have achieved alone. Outset PR even developed a syndication map , a tool that identifies which outlets trigger the most secondary coverage. It’s a rare data-driven approach in a space that usually treats PR results as intangible. From Attention to Reputation Ultimately, PR isn’t about a single headline. It’s about compounding. Each story, AMA, and narrative that ties back to a project’s mission builds over time. Journalists begin to view the team as credible commentators. Communities start to see the project not just as another token, but as part of the industry’s direction. That shift — from chasing attention to earning reputation — is what separates projects that flash and fade from those that last. Why Crypto PR Is More Than Announcements A press release says you exist. PR, at its best, explains why you matter. It frames features as part of larger narratives. It aligns with industry cycles instead of fighting them. It adapts to different audiences without losing authenticity. And it ensures stories don’t just land once, but echo across the ecosystem. As cases from Outset PR show, crypto PR is not about vanity mentions. It’s about giving every story both meaning and momentum. For founders trying to figure out if PR is worth the effort, some common questions always come up. Let’s tackle them. FAQ: Crypto PR and Web3 Storytelling Q: Is a press release enough to promote a crypto project?A: Not really. A press release can announce your update, but it won’t shape the narrative or guarantee visibility. Effective crypto PR connects your update to industry-wide conversations and ensures amplification across media, aggregators, and communities. Q: What’s the difference between PR and marketing in crypto?A: Marketing drives direct results — clicks, traffic, signups. PR builds reputation and credibility by shaping how your project is perceived in the media and among investors. In crypto, where trust is often the barrier, PR makes marketing more effective. Q: How does PR help with investor trust?A: Third-party validation. When investors see your project covered by credible outlets, it reduces skepticism. PR places you in those outlets and frames you as part of the broader conversation. Q: What is syndication in crypto PR?A: Syndication is when one article gets echoed across dozens of platforms like CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, or Yahoo Finance. It multiplies your visibility far beyond the original hit — sometimes 10x over. Q: How do I choose the right crypto PR agency?A: Look for agencies with a track record in Web3, that understand narrative cycles, and that can show data on outcomes — not just placements, but the ripple effects of coverage.",More News,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BNB|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-04 20:51:38

Tether To Launch Digital Asset Treasury Firm With XAUT: Report On Friday, October 3rd, Bloomberg reported that Tether and financial services firm Antalpha Platform Holding are leading an effort to raise at least $200 million to set up a digital asset treasury company. Citing unnamed sources close to the matter, this public vehicle would use the capital to purchase XAUT, Tether’s gold token. Bloomberg revealed that Antalpha Platform Holding has close ties to Bitmain Technologies, the world’s largest Bitcoin hardware supplier based in China. According to a report from the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, the Bitcoin hardware manufacturer supplies about 82% of the world’s crypto mining machines. Bloomberg posited that this capital-raising effort would further strengthen the relationship between two of the largest companies in the global crypto industry. Meanwhile, this venture would represent a continuation in digital asset treasury companies’ craze happening this year, with more than 80 firms set up so far in 2025. Furthermore, the report revealed that asset manager Cohen & Company is the lead advisor on the deal, with further talks kept private. While most parties declined to comment, Tether reportedly pointed out a post on the social media platform X about its recent announcement with Antalpha. As per the post on X , Antalpha revealed that it would be integrating Tether Gold into its Real-World Assets (RWA) Hub, offering tokenized gold-backed lending and infrastructure solutions. The financial services firm also announced that it would set up physical vaults in major financial centers around the world to allow holders to exchange the tokens for gold bars. This move to offer XAUT-backed lending came after Tether had purchased an 8.1% stake in Antalpha during its initial public offering (IPO) earlier in May 2025. Tether Gold, launched in 2020, offers investors an exposure to gold without physically owning the metal. With a market capitalization of about $1.5 billion, Tether claims that the almost 250,000 XAUT tokens in circulation are backed by an equivalent of more than 7.66 tons of gold . USDT Market Cap At $175 Billion At the same time, Tether owns the largest dollar-backed stablecoin and the fourth-largest digital asset in the cryptocurrency market, with a market cap of more than $175 billion.",Tether (USDT)|Antalpha|Bitmain|Bloomberg|crypto|gold|Tether|USDT|xaut,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDT|FIAT|XAUT|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 21:00:06

With recent price gains and steady market momentum, many are wondering if ADA can finally break through the barrier and push beyond the dollar mark. This article looks at the key indicators shaping ADA’s next move—and also highlights how Outset PR applies data-driven clarity to help crypto projects, much like ADA itself, position for lasting growth in a competitive environment. Cardano on the Rise: Potential Growth Amidst Recent Gains Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is on an upward swing, trading between about 75 to 88 cents. In the past week alone, its price has jumped over 12%. Heading towards the 95-cent resistance mark, Cardano shows promise. If it breaks this barrier, it could target a rise beyond one dollar, which implies a sharp climb. Over the last six months, Cardano has seen a growth of over 31%. Key support at around 69 cents could act as a cushion if prices dip. With a relative strength index near 50, Cardano seems balanced between overbought and oversold, suggesting room for potential further upward movement.

Analyst Identifies 2 Conditions For Uptrend,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-to-160000-by-early-2026-analyst/,"The price of Bitcoin made a dreamy start to the last quarter of the year, beginning the historically bullish month of October with a reclaim of the $120,000 level. After over a month of choppy price action, the world’s largest cryptocurrency seems to be resuming its bullish uptrend. With the price closing in on its all-time high price above $124,000, investors will be looking to see how far and long the premier cryptocurrency can go in the latest leg up. According to an on-chain analyst on social media platform X, the price of BTC could rise as high as $160,000 in the current run. Why A Break Above $128k Is Critical To BTC’s Bull Run In an October 3 post on X, crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. put forward a $160,000 target for the Bitcoin price at the start of next year. According to the online pundit, the sustained progression of BTC’s price action to this unprecedented high hinges on two primary conditions, or two price levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forecast: Expert Predicts Final Impulse Wave Targeting $18,000 This bullish analysis revolves around the historical price performance of Bitcoin following the halving event. Typically, the halving event is viewed as a catalytic event that triggers long-term price rallies for BTC, as it involves slashing by half the volume of the premier cryptocurrency created at a time. As observed in the chart above, the scenario-based model shows through a trend-based forecast that each halving cycle produces an exponentially higher peak for the Bitcoin price. According to this model, the price of BTC printed a post-halving peak around $57,000 following the 2020 event, beating the previous high of $4,250. Adler Jr. revealed that the Bitcoin price could head for $160,000 after the 2024 halving event, which saw miner rewards fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. However, for this rally to be confirmed, the first condition is that the flagship cryptocurrency will need to break above the $128,000 and hold above this “base” level on multiple weekly closes. In the second condition, the on-chain analyst shared that Bitcoin’s upward movement toward the $160,000 mark could be at risk of invalidation should the price fall below the $102,000 level. According to Adler Jr., a breakdown beneath this level could lead to a quick scenario reset, potentially changing the target or overall trend for the Bitcoin price. Ultimately, the price action of BTC in the short term is one to look out for, as the market leader looks to reclaim its current all-time high. Moreover, a break above the record-high price could clear the path for Bitcoin to reach the ‘base” level of $128,000. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $122,710, reflecting a 2% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the top cryptocurrency is up by more than 12% in the last seven days.

TON price faces a critical test at $2: buyers must reassert control with clear volume support and declining exchange inflows to prevent a slide to $1.60–$1.20. Current taker CVD and netflow signals favor sellers, so momentum confirmation is essential for a sustainable defense. How does taker CVD reflect current market bias? Toncoin’s spot taker CVD chart shows dominant red zones, indicating aggressive taker sells. Short, repeated red spikes suggest sellers are executing market orders more frequently than buyers. Without a sustained shift to green CVD, the bias remains bearish and hinders meaningful recoveries. TON’s extended consolidation near key support — what does it mean? TON has traded inside a prolonged channel between $2.50 and $3.68, retesting mid-range levels without conviction. Price indecision points to a balance between weak bulls and persistent bears. If $2.50 collapses, downside momentum may accelerate; holding near $2 supports the case for a gradual rebound. Buy-side weakness around $2 diminishes the probability of an immediate recovery. Traders should treat the $2 zone as a make-or-break area: a sustained hold can open recovery targets at $3.20–$3.50, while failure increases the chance of reaching $1.60 or $1.20. Source: TradingView Do inflows and cooling volumes confirm a bearish market outlook for TON? Yes. Weekly Netflow data shows steady inflows—most recently around $4.12M—consistent with tokens moving to exchanges for potential liquidation. At the same time, the Spot Volume Bubble map shows shrinking bubbles, signaling declining trading conviction. These combined metrics support a bearish outlook until they diverge. How should traders interpret cooling spot volumes? Cooling spot volumes indicate reduced participation. Historically, declining volumes often precede major moves—either accumulation or distribution. For TON, diminished volumes alongside selling inflows suggest distribution, increasing the likelihood of lower prices unless buyer capital returns. Source: CryptoQuant How do exchange inflows affect downside risk for TON? Exchange inflows raise downside risk because they increase sell-side supply. The latest weekly netflow reading (~$4.12M) aligns with weak CVD and fading volumes, reinforcing the seller-controlled narrative. Without a notable shift to outflows, accumulation signals remain absent and rallies are likely to struggle. Source: CoinGlass Frequently Asked Questions What price targets should traders watch if $2 fails? If $2 fails, the next meaningful targets are $1.60 and then $1.20, driven by increased selling pressure and exchange inflows. Watch for accelerating taker sells and expanding outflow volumes for confirmation of those moves. How quickly can TON recover if buyers return? Recovery speed depends on volume intensity: a sustained shift to green taker CVD and measurable outflows from exchanges could push TON toward $3.20–$3.50 over several sessions. Absent strong volume, recoveries are likely to be shallow and short-lived. Which indicators provide the clearest signals for TON right now? Primary indicators to watch: taker CVD (aggression), Spot Volume Bubble map (conviction), and weekly exchange netflows (supply/demand balance). Together they reveal whether buyers or sellers control the next directional move. Key Takeaways $2 is TON’s pivotal level : A sustained defense requires renewed buyer volume and reduced exchange inflows. Seller dominance on CVD : Persistent red zones and shrinking spot volumes point to distribution, not accumulation. Actionable watchlist : Monitor taker CVD, spot volume bubbles, and weekly netflows for early signs of reversal or continued breakdown. Conclusion Toncoin (TON) remains in a fragile state around the $2 support; current metrics favor sellers and emphasize the risk of a slide to $1.60–$1.20. Traders should prioritize volume-confirmed signals and exchange flow shifts.

This isn’t about hype or speculation—it’s a data-driven analysis of what could be a defining moment for XRP’s price movement. According to a prominent analyst, this setup might be the very opportunity XRP holders have been waiting for. A Defining Moment for XRP Holders In a video shared on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO sounded the alarm: “XRP holders, this could literally be the moment we have been waiting for here on the channel.” He explained that XRP had been consolidating within a bull flag pattern since mid-July and is now beginning to show “very bullish signs.” Steph emphasized that this pattern could lead to a major breakout in the coming days or weeks if confirmed, saying, “I want you guys to be prepared for this. I want to show you exactly what my game plan is, what my expectations are. Is the momentum bullish? Is there a potential bull trap? What’s the best thing right now?” IF YOU HOLD #XRP I GOT NEWS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!! (urgent) pic.twitter.com/AkTJkXiv6i — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 3, 2025 The Key Confirmation Level: $3 Daily Close The analyst stressed that confirmation is essential before calling a full breakout: “For me to absolutely call and to confirm this breakout, I would need to see the daily candle of today close above three dollars.” According to Steph, a confirmed daily close above this level would strongly suggest that XRP is “most likely heading a lot higher in the next days and the next weeks.” He maintained a technical target of around $5 , derived from the height of the bull flag’s pole, but cautioned traders to remain realistic. “There are no guarantees on the way up,” he said. “Maybe XRP is not going to go to five dollars—maybe we’re going to stop at four dollars or $4.50. It’s important that you have an exit strategy and that you secure profits on the way up.” Bullish Momentum Confirmed by EMA Ribbons Steph also highlighted a significant technical signal—the EMA ribbons on the daily chart. He noted that XRP is “right now actually breaking above daily ribbons, which is a strong sign and shows a lot of bullish momentum, a lot of buying pressure going on.” Historically, when XRP breaks above these ribbons, it often indicates the start of a larger upward move, especially if accompanied by increasing volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He added that the broader market context supports this potential surge. “Historically, October and November tend to be very bullish for crypto and for XRP,” he explained. “I think Q4—the next few days and the next few weeks—could be very bullish for XRP . But once again, for absolute confirmation, wait for the daily candle of today to close above three dollars.” Market Context and Outlook As of now, XRP trades just below the critical $3 threshold, consolidating after several attempts to break higher. Analysts widely agree that this level represents a major resistance zone. A confirmed breakout above it could open the door to a sustained rally toward $4–$5, while rejection might lead to renewed consolidation or a temporary pullback. For long-term investors, Steph’s message serves as both encouragement and caution. The current technical setup appears promising, but as he reminded his audience, “There are no guarantees on the way up.” Ultimately, the coming days will determine whether XRP confirms its long-awaited breakout. Traders and holders alike are watching the charts closely—because in crypto, decisive moments often arrive without warning, and being prepared can make all the difference.

The report noted that Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT) holdings have reached approximately $135 billion, with institutional investors, in particular, continuing to accumulate and stake ETH. VanEck noted that this creates a dilution risk for investors outside of staking. The report also touched on Ethereum's upcoming Fusaka upgrade in December. This update is expected to reduce Layer-2 rollup costs by increasing blob capacity and improve network efficiency by allowing nodes to perform block validation using probabilistic sampling. According to VanEck's report, 23 of the 35 major tokens closed the month lower. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 5%, while Ethereum (ETH) fell 5%. The overall decline in market volatility has dampened both price action and blockchain revenue, causing stagnation in the sector. According to the report, blockchain revenues fell by 16% month-over-month: Ethereum revenues: -6% Solana revenues: -11% Tron revenues: -37% VanEck stated that the primary reason for this decline was the decrease in market volatility. In September, volatility fell by -40% for ETH, -26% for BTC, and -16% for SOL. While decentralized spot exchange (DEX) volumes remained at August levels of approximately $365 billion, futures volumes increased by 30%. Much of this increase was driven by the token launch of the Aster platform within the Binance ecosystem and incentivized trading pairs.

Network revenue fell 16% MoM in September Ethereum fees down 6%, Solana down 11%, Tron fees dropped 37% after a governance fee cut. Volatility fell sharply: ETH -40%, SOL -16%, BTC -26% — reducing arbitrage-driven fee demand. Blockchain network revenue fell 16% in September due to lower crypto volatility; read the full analysis, data, and investor takeaways. Learn how fees and fundamentals changed. Asset manager VanEck attributed the broad decline in blockchain network revenue in September to lower volatility in the crypto markets. What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September? Blockchain network revenue declined 16% month-over-month in September primarily because lower crypto volatility reduced traders’ need to pay priority fees, decreasing total fees across major networks. VanEck’s analysis cites reduced arbitrage and fewer high-priority transactions as the main drivers. VanEck reported that overall network revenues across the blockchain ecosystem dropped by 16% month-over-month in September, linked to diminished volatility and lower transaction fee demand. Ethereum network revenue fell by 6% and Solana’s by 11%. The Tron network recorded a 37% reduction in fees, which VanEck attributes to a governance proposal that halved gas fees in August. Most cryptocurrencies experienced reduced volatility in September. Source: VanEck How did volatility changes affect crypto network fees? Reduced volatility curtailed arbitrage and time-sensitive trading that typically pushes users to pay higher fees for faster settlement. Ether (ETH) volatility dropped about 40% in September, SOL volatility fell 16%, and BTC volatility declined 26%, according to VanEck’s figures. Lower volatility means fewer rapid price moves and thus fewer priority transactions, translating directly into lower network revenue and smaller fee pools for validators and miners. Why did Tron lead revenue metrics despite lower fees? Tron remains the top revenue-generating crypto ecosystem, producing roughly $3.6 billion over the last year, according to Token Terminal data cited in market reporting. This leadership stems largely from stablecoin activity — 51% of circulating Tether USDt supply is issued on the Tron network. A comparison of crypto network fees over the last year. Source: Token Terminal By comparison, Ethereum generated about $1 billion in annual revenue despite ETH reaching all-time highs in August and a market capitalization near $539 billion — roughly 16x TRX’s market cap of about $32 billion. Stablecoins continue to expand: the stablecoin market cap crossed $292 billion in October 2025, per RWA.XYZ data, reinforcing Tron’s role in settlement and recurring fee generation. How should investors interpret network revenue and fees? Network revenues and fees are a core metric for assessing blockchain economic activity and protocol health. Monitor fees as a short-term gauge of transaction demand and revenue as a longer-term indicator of platform monetization and product fit. Analysts track fundamentals such as active addresses, transaction value, and fee revenue to evaluate project trajectories and ecosystem resilience. Frequently Asked Questions How large was the month-over-month revenue decline in September? The blockchain ecosystem saw a 16% month-over-month decline in network revenue in September, driven largely by reduced volatility and lower priority-fee transactions. Did any networks buck the trend in September? Tron continued to lead annual revenue generation despite a 37% monthly fee drop, thanks to heavy stablecoin settlement activity and prior fee-structure changes. What role did governance changes play in fee reductions? On Tron, a governance proposal reduced gas fees by over 50% in August, contributing to a 37% drop in network fees in September as reflected in revenue data. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Reduced crypto volatility lowered arbitrage and priority-fee demand, leading to a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why did Tron still lead revenue metrics?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Tron generated the most annual revenue due to heavy stablecoin settlement activity, with 51% of circulating USDT issued on Tron, supporting recurring fee volume."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Blockchain network revenue drops in September as volatility falls"", ""description"": ""VanEck reports a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September driven by reduced crypto volatility and lower transaction fees."", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199b0f3-c6e7-7260-b34f-183b28f6d0b8""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret a drop in blockchain network revenue"", ""description"": ""A brief step-by-step guide for investors to assess causes and implications of falling network fees and revenue."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check volatility metrics"", ""text"": ""Compare ETH, SOL, and BTC volatility changes to see if lower price swings explain fee reductions."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review protocol governance changes"", ""text"": ""Identify recent fee-structure proposals, such as Tron’s gas fee cut, which can materially reduce revenue."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Analyze stablecoin flows"", ""text"": ""Assess stablecoin issuance and settlement trends, as stablecoin volume can sustain fee revenue even in low-volatility markets."" } ]} Key Takeaways Revenue decline: A 16% MoM drop in September shows fees are sensitive to volatility and governance changes.

Conclusion September’s 16% fall in blockchain network revenue reflects lower crypto volatility and targeted protocol changes that cut fees.

What are Defiance Investments’ proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Defiance Investments’ prospectus requests 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs , offering triple daily exposure to crypto firms, token-linked ETFs and select tech names. The filing lists single-stock, ETF and crypto ETP targets and repeatedly warns these funds are suited only for aggressive, short-term traders. How do the proposed 3X leveraged crypto ETFs differ from existing 2X products? Three-times leveraged ETFs aim to deliver approximately 3X the daily return of an underlying asset, versus 2X funds that seek double daily moves. Because leverage compounds daily, 3X funds amplify volatility and path dependency, increasing the chance of significant losses over multi-day holding periods.

Defiance targeted crypto firms and token-linked ETFs to meet rising investor demand for direct and derivative exposure to digital assets. The surge in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows — with Bitcoin-related funds commanding sizable assets according to CoinGlass — encouraged issuers to explore leveraged versions despite higher risk. What specific companies and token ETFs are named in the filing? The prospectus lists funds tied to Coinbase, MicroStrategy (Bitcoin treasury exposure), Robinhood, BitMine Immersion (Ethereum treasury exposure), Circle (USDC issuer), Grayscale mini-trust ETFs tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a Solana ETF from Volatility Shares. The filing proposes both 3X long and 3X inverse share classes for many of these exposures.

Recent filings — including Defiance’s — indicate the SEC is receiving applications for higher-leverage products. Market analysts, such as ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy, note the regulator may permit more volatile products, but approvals will depend on disclosures, structure and investor-protection considerations. How should investors evaluate proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Evaluate leverage objectives, daily rebalancing mechanics, expense ratios, underlying liquidity, and prospectus risk disclosures. Compare historical one-day return replication and understand compounding effects for multi-day holdings. These funds are primarily for experienced, short-term traders. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to evaluate a 3X leveraged ETF"", ""description"": ""Steps to assess whether a 3X leveraged ETF aligns with a trader's objectives and risk tolerance."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Read the prospectus"", ""text"": ""Review leverage goal, daily reset rules, and risk warnings contained in the fund's prospectus."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Analyze volatility and liquidity"", ""text"": ""Check historical intraday and daily volatility of the underlying asset and the ETF's trading volume."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Simulate multi-day scenarios"", ""text"": ""Model multi-day returns to understand compounding effects and potential drawdowns for holding periods beyond one day."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Compare costs"", ""text"": ""Compare expense ratios and transaction costs relative to alternative exposure methods."" } ]} Key Takeaways Defiance filed for 49 3X ETFs : Proposals include crypto firms, token ETFs and tech stocks, with both long and inverse classes. Higher leverage increases risk : 3X daily leverage amplifies volatility and can produce large multi-day divergences from expected returns. Investor due diligence required : Read prospectuses, assess liquidity and model compounding before trading these products. Conclusion The Defiance prospectus signals a push to expand 3X leveraged ETFs across crypto and tech exposures, reflecting issuer interest in meeting aggressive trader demand. 3X leveraged ETFs may arrive if approved, but their complexity and high risk make careful evaluation essential. Monitor regulatory decisions and read fund disclosures before trading. NEW: @Defiance_ETFs has just filed for just shy of 50 3X levered ETFs. Some on single stocks, some on other ETFs, some on crypto ETPs.

Investors are curious whether these quirky coins can trigger a new wave of excitement in the market. Could these underdogs lead to a fresh rally? Explore the potential growth drivers and market sentiment in the full article. Dogecoin on the Rise: Is a Surge Around the Corner? Source: tradingview Dogecoin is currently trading between twenty-two and twenty-six cents. Its recent upward trend has seen a price surge of over 15% this week and nearly 20% for the month. The coin's momentum hints at breaking through the nearest resistance level of about twenty-eight cents. If it continues this path, it might soon challenge the second resistance level of roughly thirty-two cents. This could signal a potential growth of over 25%. With its popularity and community backing, Dogecoin remains a digital currency to watch, as its price movements suggest more potential climbs in the future. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Pepe (PEPE) Price Watch: What to Expect from this Crypto Adventure Source: tradingview Pepe (PEPE) is showing mixed signals. Its current price range swings between a few thousandths of a cent, landing at around $0.000009. Despite it passing a week with almost a 9% rise, the momentum is cautious. It's below the 10-day moving average but slightly above the 100-day average, which points to stable but slow progress. If Pepe breaks the nearest resistance level, it could see a growth of about 15% from its current spot. However, dropping below support could mean a slide of 20%. With its RSI below 50, Pepe’s current potential leans more towards recovery than rapid growth. Conclusion DOGE and PEPE have both shown potential for growth. DOGE remains popular with a strong community backing. PEPE has recently gained attention due to its memes and social media trends. If interest in meme coins continues, both could see price increases. However, market dynamics always play a big role. Keeping an eye on market trends and investor interest is crucial for predicting future movements of these coins. Just as crucial as crafting a narrative that fits the market, the key ability of Outset PR.

The SEC is reviewing 21 such ETF filings amid government shutdown delays. SEC review of 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs underway Funds propose staking exposure to altcoins including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SUI and others. Up to 40% of assets may be allocated to non-U.S. crypto ETPs from issuers like 21Shares and CoinShares. Meta description: staking crypto ETFs under SEC review — 21 REX-Osprey filings offer yield plus price exposure to ADA, AVAX, NEAR; follow regulatory updates on en.coinotag.com. SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs offering yield and price exposure to altcoins like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR amid shutdown delays. SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs as shutdown delays approval and review timelines. New ETFs include staked tokens like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR, offering both yield and price exposure. Up to 40% of ETF assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto ETPs from 21Shares, CoinShares, and Valour. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing multiple staking-based crypto ETF filings while operating with reduced staff during a government shutdown. REX Shares and Osprey Funds have proposed 21 spot ETFs that combine staking rewards with token price exposure, broadening regulated access to altcoins for institutional and retail investors. What are the REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs under SEC review? REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs are proposed funds that would hold and stake selected proof-of-stake tokens, paying staking rewards to the ETF while tracking token price movements. The filings name tokens such as ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI and SUI and outline use of Cayman subsidiaries to meet regulatory and tax requirements. How do these ETFs combine yield and price exposure? The funds are structured to both participate in on-chain staking (generating rewards) and provide market exposure to token price changes. Staking rewards would be retained or distributed according to each fund’s prospectus. Issuers emphasize the ability to deliver staking yield without investors directly managing private keys. Why is the SEC review delayed and what are the regulatory implications? The SEC’s standard review period for ETF filings is approximately 75 days, but reduced staffing from the government shutdown has slowed processing. Past shutdowns, such as in 2018, caused notable approval delays; analysts expect a similar impact now. Any approvals will still need to satisfy custody, custody-provider oversight, and compliance requirements for staking activities. Which tokens and issuers are named in filings? Filings list staked tokens including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI, SUI, TAO and HYPE. The documents reference allocation flexibility allowing up to 40% of fund assets to be invested in non-U.S. exchange-traded products from issuers named in plain text: 21Shares, CoinShares and Valour. Issuers plan Cayman Islands feeder structures to preserve regulated investment company status under U.S. tax rules. How might investor exposure differ compared to existing spot ETFs? Staking crypto ETFs differ from spot ETFs by adding a yield component from protocol-level staking. Investors gain passive yield (subject to slashing and validator performance) in addition to price appreciation or depreciation. The funds aim to reduce operational friction for institutional investors while preserving tradability on U.S. exchanges. Summary comparison of proposed ETFs (example allocation) ETF Primary Token Staking Enabled Potential Non‑U.S. Allocation Target Investor REX-Osprey ADA Staked ETF ADA Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey AVAX Staked ETF AVAX Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey NEAR Staked ETF NEAR Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional When could decisions resume and what should investors watch? Approvals are likely to resume once full SEC operations return; October 2025 is noted as a key month for several pending crypto ETF deadlines. Investors should monitor SEC notices, prospectus amendments, and custody disclosures for staking mechanics, fee schedules, and counterparty arrangements. Frequently Asked Questions Will staking ETFs increase investor access to altcoins? Yes. Staking ETFs aim to broaden access by allowing investors to gain price and yield exposure through regulated vehicles, avoiding direct custody and staking complexities. Product terms will determine yield distribution and fee impact. Can fund assets be invested in non-U.S. ETPs? Yes. Filings state up to 40% of a fund’s assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto exchange-traded products from issuers referenced in the filings. This may diversify access to European and Canadian markets within a U.S.-listed wrapper. Are staking rewards guaranteed? No. Staking rewards depend on network conditions, validator performance and protocol rules. Rewards can fluctuate and may be subject to penalties such as slashing for misbehavior or downtime. Key Takeaways Regulatory review active : The SEC is reviewing 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETF filings; approval timelines are delayed by a government shutdown. Yield + market exposure : Proposed ETFs combine staking rewards with token price exposure for altcoins like ADA, AVAX and NEAR. Cross-border allocation : Up to 40% non-U.S. ETP allocation may link funds to international issuers while using Cayman subsidiaries for tax and regulatory alignment. Conclusion The SEC’s review of staking crypto ETFs from REX and Osprey could expand regulated yield-bearing access to major altcoins, but approval timing remains uncertain due to the government shutdown.

Keep Eye On These 3 Coins,https://bitzo.com/2025/10/fear-greed-increase-is-crypto-preparing-for-the-next-explosive-rally-keep-eye-on-these-3-coins,"The mood in the crypto market is shifting as excitement and caution begin to blend. Amid this atmosphere, three cryptocurrencies appear ready for significant movement. Experts are analyzing patterns and signals that hint at a possible surge. This article delves into which coins show promise and why they might be on the brink of explosive growth. TRON (TRX) Eyes Growth Amid Steady Price Range Source: tradingview TRON is trading between thirty-three to thirty-four cents. It's facing resistance at thirty-five cents, while support stands at thirty-two cents. With a six-month increase of almost fifty percent, the coin shows strong growth potential. If TRX breaks through the thirty-five cents resistance, it could target thirty-six cents, suggesting a rise of about three percent. The Relative Strength Index indicates the coin is far from overbought, and its momentum is growing. This stability around the thirty-four cents moving averages suggests TRON might continue its gradual climb. Keep an eye on market shifts, as the coin's current positioning hints at further upward movement. Hedera (HBAR) Shows Promise Even Amid Market Fluctuations Source: tradingview Hedera , a rising player in the crypto market, currently trades between twenty and twenty-three cents. It hovers just below the twenty-five-cent resistance, suggesting room for upward movement. If the price breaks this, it could target over twenty-eight cents, almost a twenty percent rise from its upper range. Over the past six months, Hedera has climbed nearly fifty-eight percent, showing strong growth potential. Despite slight dips recently, it continues to maintain a steady course with key support holding at just under nineteen cents. With positive signs, including a six-month surge, Hedera's future looks promising for those watching closely. Arbitrum (ARB) Eyes Potential Bounce After Recent Lows Source: tradingview Arbitrum's current price stays within x cents to a few cents below half a dollar. Though it saw a big drop over the month, it still holds a considerable rise over six months. The coin is near its support, which might hint at a bounce. Its nearest challenge lies above the half-dollar mark, needing a climb of around a fifth more to get there. If enthusiasm grows, it could shoot to a price that is a bit more than five dimes. While past patterns show mixed signals, the coin's price holds room for recovery. If it gains ground, investors might see significant jumps in the coin's value. Conclusion TRX, HBAR, and ARB show strong potential in the current market. TRX focuses on fast transactions and low fees, which attracts many users. HBAR offers high efficiency and unique technology, making it appealing to developers. ARB is gaining interest due to its innovative features in governance. These coins may see significant growth if the market remains favorable. Keeping an eye on them could be worthwhile for those interested in the crypto space.

Technical structure shows higher highs and higher lows after two channel breakouts, supported by increased trading volumes that confirm active buying. How did analysts interpret the technical setup? Chart analysts, including Captain Faibik, identify a descending channel breakout from late 2022–April 2023 and a confirming breakout in October 2023 that formed a bullish flag continuation pattern. The pattern’s measured move places a near-term target near $140,000, assuming volume supports the advance. $BTC #Bitcoin Bulls are in Complete Control.. pic.twitter.com/QEWWLwItN8 — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) October 4, 2025 The pattern demonstrates strong technical strength, showing that selling pressure was absorbed within the consolidation phase. Historical data confirms that after each breakout, Bitcoin maintained upward momentum, indicating sustained buying strength. Trading volumes during breakout phases provide factual confirmation of active market participation from both institutional and retail investors. Source: MichaelvandePoppe (X) Market expert Michael van de Poppe noted that “Bitcoin has held the 20-week moving average as support, broken the downtrend at $112,000, and is on track for the highest weekly close in history.” He added that recent price action included “a 7% weekly candle,” confirming renewed bullish control. Why does institutional demand and seasonality matter for Bitcoin’s outlook? Institutional inflows and historical seasonality amplify bullish momentum and help sustain higher price levels. Citigroup’s published forecast and other institutional commentary point to substantial upside scenarios, while seasonality data shows October historically favors Bitcoin performance. According to Citigroup’s forecast (plain text citation), Bitcoin’s base case target sits near $181,000 with a bullish scenario up to $231,000 over a 12-month horizon. Institutional adoption, growing trading desks, and derivatives activity are cited as primary drivers in institutional research notes (plain text reference). Data compiled by The Bull Theory on X shows Bitcoin closed October in the green in 10 of the last 12 years, with an average October return of 20.62%. Those historical tendencies, paired with improving macro conditions, support a scenario where Bitcoin could extend toward $150,000 in the coming quarter if institutional flows continue. How are domestic retail premiums and macro policy influencing flows? Analysts note domestic demand disparities—U.S. investors have paid premiums on certain exchanges—indicating stubborn retail participation. As the Federal Reserve signals a more cautious stance, macro liquidity conditions could remain supportive for risk assets, allowing institutional allocations to increase. Frequently Asked Questions What is the immediate technical target for Bitcoin after the bullish flag breakout? BTC’s technical setup points to an initial upside target near $140,000 based on the measured move of the bullish flag, supported by rising volume and sustained buying pressure. How likely is a sustained rally to $150K or higher? With institutional demand rising, favorable October seasonality, and easing macro conditions, a rally to $150,000 is plausible within a quarter. Broader analyst scenarios range higher but depend on continued inflows and macro stability. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the immediate technical target for Bitcoin after the bullish flag breakout?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""BTC’s technical setup points to an initial upside target near $140,000 based on the measured move of the bullish flag, supported by rising volume and sustained buying pressure."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How likely is a sustained rally to $150,000 or higher?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""With institutional demand, positive October seasonality, and easing macro risks, a rally to $150,000 is plausible within a quarter, while longer-term analyst scenarios range higher and depend on continued inflows."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Breakout Confirms Bullish Flag, Targets $140K"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin bullish flag breakout signals upside to $140K; rising volume and institutional demand boost momentum."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/article-image-44.png"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T00:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T00:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo.png"" }, ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-bullish-flag-140k"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin's bullish flag breakout"", ""description"": ""A short, actionable guide to reading Bitcoin's bullish flag and assessing price targets."", ""totalTime"": ""PT10M"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Identify the breakout"", ""text"": ""Confirm a clear price break above the flag's upper trendline with increasing volume."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Measure the target"", ""text"": ""Measure the flagpole height from prior swing low to the start of consolidation and add it to the breakout point to derive a target near $140K."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm with volume and moving averages"", ""text"": ""Ensure rising trading volume supports the breakout and that key moving averages, such as the 20-week, act as support."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor macro and institutional flows"", ""text"": ""Track institutional desk activity and macro policy shifts that could either reinforce or undermine the breakout."" } ], ""supply"": [], ""tool"": []} Key Takeaways Bullish Flag Breakout : Bitcoin’s technical breakout targets near $140,000 based on pattern measured move.

The rise of these meme coins is stirring excitement and speculation in the market. As traders scramble to catch the next big thing, the question remains: which meme coin will dominate in 2025? Dogecoin Drifts Amid Market Uncertainty, Potential for a 25% Rise in View Source: tradingview Dogecoin's recent price movements show it trading between 21 and 26 cents. With a rise of over 66% in the past six months, DOGE holds potential for future gains. Eyes are on the resistance levels at 28 and 32 cents. If DOGE breaks these barriers, it could see a rise of around 25% from its current price. The support levels stand at 19 and 15 cents, serving as safety nets. Despite a weaker short-term momentum reflected by the RSI and other metrics, the semi-optimistic price change over recent months hints that DOGE could regain strength if market conditions improve. Pepe (PEPE) Shows Steady Growth with Potential for Breakout Source: tradingview Pepe's price now sits snugly between nine and ten-thousandths of a cent. The coin's journey over the past six months shows a remarkable growth of more than 50%. Recently, it rose by a little over 5% in just a week, hinting at bullish momentum. If trading gathers steam, it might rise to just above one cent, a jump of about 25% from where it stands now. The current movement suggests it can test the first hurdle set slightly higher, around the twelve-thousandths mark. Support sits a bit lower, below eight-thousandths of a cent. With its strength yet mild, attention focuses on when it might decisively break upward. Bonk Sees Steady Gains, Eyes Higher Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Bonk (BONK) is experiencing a steady price movement, trading between $0.00001789 and $0.00002185. The coin has the potential to rise toward its first resistance level at $0.00002413. If it gains momentum, it could aim for the second resistance level at $0.00002809. Bonk's price has increased by over 3% in the last week, showing potential for further growth. Over six months, it has seen an impressive increase of over 100%. With stable support levels and promising resistance targets, Bonk may continue to demonstrate growth, capturing the attention of investors looking for emerging cryptocurrencies with upward momentum. Conclusion DOGE has been underperforming recently, while PEPE and BONK have shown impressive gains. The question remains which coin will come out on top by 2025. DOGE has a strong community and established presence. PEPE and BONK, with their recent performance, could attract more interest. The deciding factor will likely be the ability to maintain momentum and continue to engage users. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The stablecoin, called A7A5, is pegged to the ruble and has been used heavily by Russian users since its launch in January. Despite being part of a sanctioned network, A7A5 was visible at the TOKEN2049 event with a booth, staff wearing its logo, and a speaking slot for one of its executives. TOKEN2049 is a top-tier global crypto event held annually and registered in Hong Kong. This year, it drew more than 25,000 attendees, over 500 exhibitors, and a lineup of high-profile speakers, including Donald Trump Jr., chairman of U.S. brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald Brandon Lutnick, and senior executives from major crypto companies. The appearance of A7A5 at such a high-profile event came even after it was sanctioned by both Washington and London in August. A7A5 sponsors TOKEN2049 despite U.S. and U.K. sanctions The U.S. and Britain said in August that they had sanctioned several companies linked to A7A5, which they described as part of a network designed to help Russians evade Western sanctions. The stablecoin was created in Kyrgyzstan by a Russian defense lender and a payments firm. On the official TOKEN2049 website, A7A5 had been listed as one of more than 20 platinum sponsors. Event staff were seen wearing A7A5-branded shirts, and its director for regulatory and overseas affairs, Oleg Ogienko, appeared on stage to speak about the project. By 1300 GMT on Thursday, references to A7A5 had been removed from the conference’s website and Ogienko was no longer listed as a speaker after Reuters contacted the event for comment. TOKEN2049’s organizers did not respond to multiple requests for comment about why A7A5 had been included. When approached at the conference, Ogienko confirmed that the operation in Singapore was part of the sanctioned group. “We were sanctioned several times,” he told Reuters on Thursday from the sidelines of the event. He added that A7A5 had no ties to money laundering and complied with Kyrgyz regulations. “We just regularly applied for our participation, and the organisers confirmed the participation (at TOKEN2049),” he said. Trading volumes surge as sanctions struggle to stop flows A7A5’s presence at TOKEN2049 underscores how difficult it has been for Western governments to restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in sanctions evasion. Neither Singapore nor Hong Kong has imposed sanctions on the companies connected to A7A5. Three lawyers who specialize in sanctions told Reuters that the U.S. has no jurisdiction in cases where no U.S. persons are involved. Western sanctions following Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, especially the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT global payment system, have forced Moscow to search for alternative payment channels. A7A5 has quickly become one of them. According to blockchain research firm Elliptic, more than $70.8 billion of A7A5 has been transferred since its January launch, up from $40 billion recorded in July. Elliptic also said the daily number of A7A5 transactions had doubled over the past month. Reuters was unable to independently verify the source of the funds or the purpose of the transfers. Ogienko, who is based in Russia, told Reuters that A7A5 is mainly used for cross-border payments by Russian companies and their trading partners. He said its target markets are Asia, Africa, and Latin America. “There are many countries who trade with Russia, and some of them, many of them, use our stablecoin… and these are billions of dollars,” he said. The Singapore event’s scale made the visibility of A7A5 even more striking. TOKEN2049 remains one of the largest industry gatherings, featuring not just high-profile U.S. figures like Donald Trump Jr. but also senior leaders from top crypto companies worldwide.

The enthusiasm for AI was reignited this week following global partnerships involving Nvidia Corp., pushing the MSCI All-Country World Index to an all-time high. Twelve companies, including Accelleron Industries AG, Arcadis NV, Legrand SA, National Grid Plc, Nokia Oyj, Orange SA, OVH Groupe SA, Prysmian SpA, Siemens Energy AG, and Veolia Environnement SA, have surpassed traditional tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple in percentage gains this year. AI infrastructure trades boom in Europe A custom basket of ten European data center operators , grid providers, and infrastructure companies has surged 23% this year, outpacing both the 12% gain in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index and the Nasdaq 100. The Stoxx 600 Technology Index has gained only 6.7% this year. However, the 23% surge is still significantly lower than the 69% jump in U.S. power stocks. The basket includes major players such as Accelleron Industries AG, Arcadis NV, Legrand SA, National Grid Plc, Nokia Oyj, Orange SA, OVH Groupe SA, Prysmian SpA, Siemens Energy AG, and Veolia Environnement SA. “It’s not as sexy to talk about infrastructure as it is to talk about some of the big U.S. tech names,” Helen Jewell, the Chief Investment Officer for EMEA fundamental equities at BlackRock, said . “But we are literally just at the beginning of it. Power infrastructure, grid stability, energy efficiency—that is the AI story in Europe, less on the software side.” Investors light up stocks powering AI As artificial intelligence models grow more complex, they demand vast energy resources , which is advantageous for power and infrastructure companies. Siemens Energy AG, for instance, has seen its shares soar 111% this year, making it a top pick in Ninety One’s European equity fund, which manages $192B in assets. “It is absolutely mission critical in getting power from the grid to data centers,” Ben Lambert, the fund manager at Ninety One, said. Despite the gains, Siemens Energy still trades at a 60% discount to its U.S. peer GE Vernova Inc., based on price-to-earnings ratios. The energy firm’s prospects were boosted in January when President Donald Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank Group, OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. to fund billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Siemens, GE Vernova, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries together account for over 70% of global gas turbine production capacity. The Italian cable manufacturer Prysmian SpA has also benefited from AI-driven infrastructure demand. Its stock has surged 41% in 2025, trading at 20 times forward earnings, which is a significant discount to chip-equipment leader ASML Holding NV, which trades at 35 times. Prysmian’s cables are key for transmitting electricity and data across growing AI networks. Legrand SA, a French producer of electrical and digital infrastructure, has seen its shares climb 52% this year after raising full-year sales guidance in July. About 20% of its revenues now come from data centers. “We’re seeing European industrials really benefit from the surge in data center growth driven by AI,” Alexandra Sentuc, the European equity portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, said. Telecom firms like Orange SA, France’s largest telecom operator, manages over 70 data centers, and plans to expand its AI-ready capacity. Similarly, Nokia Oyj is a critical part of Europe’s AI infrastructure due to its network switch technology used in data centers. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that Nokia’s 2026 revenue could rise by €300M if hyperscaler-linked sales continue to grow. “It’s still a tangible play from the geopolitical standpoint,” Xiadong Bao, the co-manager of the Edmond de Rothschild Fund Big Data, said. He noted that European governments prefer local suppliers over U.S. or Chinese switch makers. Despite the optimism, challenges like thin liquidity and limited passive investment exposure to infrastructure-focused AI themes raise concerns for investors. There’s also regulatory scrutiny around AI and energy use that could also temper growth. However, both public and private investments are accelerating. Nvidia is expanding its European footprint with new technology centers in the U.K., France, Spain, and Sweden. “The AI world is a bit like the Cold War, where everybody wants to get to the moon,” Bao said. “But for us, especially European investors, it’s better to look at the AI race as a marathon—monetization will increase progressively.” Get seen where it counts.

Despite market cycles, their capacity to surprise investors with sudden rallies has ensured that they maintain positions in the investors’ portfolios. Among them, Dogecoin remains a subject of interest for its suggested climb near the symbolic $1 milestone. However, Dogecoin is not the only coin that is being watched over by analysts. Predictions of explosive growth surround a newly established presale project, MAGACOIN FINANCE. Some analysts argue it might repeat Dogecoin’s early stages and provide a 75x breakout in 2025 . This tie between the two tokens has led to increasing interest from retail and institutional investors alike. Dogecoin Builds Toward $1 Target Dogecoin is currently trading within an ascending megaphone pattern. Historically, this feature has produced big breakouts in the price. Analysts note the growing formation has a target of $1. The rising megaphone has higher lows gradually increasing and higher highs spreading, indicating increasing momentum. In the case of Dogecoin, the pattern has been developing since mid-2023 and is still holding in 2025. This pattern sets up a structure for potential rallies as long as the buyers maintain control. Historical Rallies Confirm Uptrend This outlook is also supported by historical evidence. Since 2023, Dogecoin has been following a consistent pattern of accumulation, breakout, and consolidation. For instance, the meme coin consolidated around $0.06 in late 2023, then rose to above $0.15 in early 2024. After each upward move, DOGE retreated into consolidation zones before repeating the cycle. Analysts believe this action gives weight to the overall bullish framework that might ultimately drive DOGE to $1. Tight Consolidations Before Steep Rallies One analyst, Trader Tardigrade, points out other shorter-term cycles that put Dogecoin’s strength in perspective. His chart displayed repetitive tight consolidations followed by strong rallies. The same compression and expansion cycle was seen in July and September 2025. Source: X Most recently, Dogecoin consolidated between $0.22 and $0.23, then broke higher to $0.25. If the same pattern is to continue, there is another spike above $0.34. This is similar to the megaphone structure, which gives both short and mid-term confirmation. Higher Highs and Higher Lows Strengthen Trend Furthermore, Dogecoin’s historical price performance establishes the upward trend. The coin had hit a low of $0.055 in October 2023 before jumping back above $0.42 in March 2024. Another high exceeded $0.38 in April 2025. Even amid corrections, DOGE held near major support at $0.16 in September 2024 and August 2025 near $0.19. The higher lows and highs confirm the long-term bullish channel. The Relative Strength Index is close to 55, which corresponds to a balanced momentum. Analysts point out that as long as demand remains, there is room for the indicator to continue upward pressure. MAGACOIN FINANCE Analysts Call It the Next 75x Breakout Play While Dogecoin continues to capture headlines with its push toward $1, analysts are also turning their attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE. A number of market watchers describe it as the next breakout token, forecasting a potential 75x return within a year . According to analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trajectory mirrors the early days of Dogecoin. When DOGE first entered the market, it was dismissed as a meme before proving its staying power through repeated rallies. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now showing similar signs, with strong community backing driving momentum. One recurring point among analysts is the striking resemblance between MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early growth curve and Dogecoin’s initial breakout cycles. Both projects began with grassroots community energy and active participation in social channels. That combination has historically fueled explosive rallies, and MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be repeating the formula. Analysts argue this timing could amplify returns, setting up MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most closely watched breakout plays in 2025 . Conclusion Dogecoin’s climb toward $1 underscores its resilience as a leading meme coin. With clear bullish patterns, strong support levels, and repeated breakout cycles, the coin continues to attract both retail traders and institutional interest. Analysts believe that if current momentum holds, DOGE could eventually achieve the symbolic $1 milestone. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be the breakout play of 2025 as analysts see echoes of Dogecoin’s early rallies. For investors seeking a balance between established momentum and high-growth potential, Dogecoin and MAGACOIN FINANCE represent two of the most compelling opportunities in the current market.

But what is surprising most analysts is that these same whales are not putting all of their capital into Bitcoin, they are investing in high-upside altcoins, and one of the best picks is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . At just $0.035 and already over 55% sold out in Stage 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance is attracting whale-sized attention due to its two-layer lending infrastructure built to generate sustainable returns. With more than 16,750 investors and $16.8 million+ raised, many institutional investors now are diversifying into Mutuum Finance as a high-conviction hedge alongside Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s Strategic Position Enlarges as U.S. Legislators Call for a National Reserve Bitcoin’s role in the global financial system could surge to the level of billions with U.S. legislators calling for its inclusion in the country’s strategic reserves. Rep. Nick Begich and Sen. Cynthia Lummis have introduced the BITCOIN Act, a landmark bill that would purchase one million BTC in five years via budget-neutral mechanisms. The bill follows the lead of an executive order signed by former President Donald Trump, blocking the government from selling off seized crypto assets and instead keeping them as a permanent “digital stockpile.” Begich argues that diversifying the gold-dominant national balance sheet with Bitcoin would make America economically safer and more competitive in the digital economy. With institutional belief in Bitcoin becoming more firm, the large traders are diversifying too, and it is here that young altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are increasingly finding themselves on their radar screens as second-tier high-upside wagers. MUTM Presale Momentum Picks Up Pace MUTM tokens are currently going for $0.035 in Presale Round 6, an increase of 16.17% over the previous round. Demand from investors remains very high with over 16,750 investors already pouring in over $16.8 million to date. While attempting to make the platform safer, Mutuum Finance has launched recently a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat developers and hackers are invited to report bugs. Four severity levels of bugs, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, have been used so that bugs could be detected and corrected early on. The protocol is supported by strong collateral management that makes the network and participants secure. Unlimited collateral ratio, lending ability, and deposit ability are among the security attributes that make it safe. Remedy of real-time undercollateral positions and fees and penalties stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Efficiency is at the core of the Mutuum Finance model. By maximizing Loan-to-Value (LTV) rates and taking overcollateralized positions, the protocol interacts with all available capital with aggressive guards. Reserve requirements provide to serve as a cushion against market volatility with overlying reserves to borrow against in riskier assets to hedge against volatility. Mutuum Finance Announces Upcoming Lending & Borrowing Protocol Launch Mutuum Finance has unveiled the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , reiterating its commitment to providing wider decentralized finance solutions. The release V1 will be available in the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will feature vital elements such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be the initial assets for borrowing, lending, and collateral and the backbone of a dynamic and strong DeFi platform. Mutuum Finance is reshaping decentralized finance on three fundamental axes: long-term viability, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable borrowing and lending platform is introducing DeFi to institutions and retail investors. Whereas lawmakers are calling for a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, whales are diversifying their bets away from BTC, and the top pick among them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). As $0.035 and over 55% sold with $16.8M raised, MUTM’s twin lending architecture, solid security, and imminent DeFi protocol launch make it a high-leverage hedge and one of the strongest altcoins in 2025.

52677237,https://nulltx.com/?p=152262,1759615980,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"BNB Chain Tops Active Addresses in September, Surpassing Solana and NEAR",https://nulltx.com/bnb-chain-tops-active-addresses-in-september-surpassing-solana-and-near/,"BNB Chain has emerged as the leading blockchain by active addresses in September. Data shows the chain recorded 52.5 million monthly active addresses, surpassing both NEAR Protocol’s 51.8M and Solana’s 45.8M. It marks the first time since August 2024 that Solana has been dethroned in this metric. The shift signals a major momentum swing in the battle for user activity across top Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. BNB Chain is the top chain by active addresses in September With 52.5M, @BNBCHAIN surpassed @NEARProtocol (51.8M) and @solana (45.8M). It’s the 1st time since Aug 2024 that Solana was dethroned by this metric. BNB Chain's spike in activity is fueled by the hype around Aster. pic.twitter.com/LZ7bv99Ofg — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) October 3, 2025 Aster Hype Fuels BNB Chain’s Surge The sudden spike in BNB Chain activity ties closely to the buzz surrounding Aster, a new project driving engagement across the ecosystem. On-chain data points to users flocking toward Aster-related activity, pushing BNB Chain into the spotlight. BNB Chain’s core Layer 1 logged a 22% month-on-month increase in active addresses. But that’s only part of the story. The chain’s Layer 2 solution, opBNB, built on Optimism’s tech stack, exploded with a 66.4% surge in active addresses. That dual growth has set BNB Chain apart from competitors. The surge isn’t just a one-off blip,it shows increasing demand from users who are actively transacting, not just holding tokens. I knew there was some activity on the Binance Chain, but I wasn’t expecting this level of traction. This map shows the evolution of active addresses over one month, essentially for September, and the numbers speak for themselves. The BNB Chain Layer 1 recorded a 22%… pic.twitter.com/FCcB3BIlEy — Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) October 3, 2025 Solana Slips After Holding the Crown For over a year, Solana maintained dominance as the chain with the highest active addresses, consistently outpacing rivals. Its low-cost transactions and thriving memecoin culture gave it strong grassroots traction. But the September data shows a clear shift. At 45.8M active addresses, Solana now trails behind both BNB Chain and NEAR. While still one of the most active ecosystems, its lead has narrowed. This dethroning in September is a reminder that even the most dominant networks can lose momentum when rivals capitalize on new trends. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL trades at $228.45, down 1.2% on the day but still up 10.4% in the past month, reflecting solid investor confidence despite activity shifts. NEAR Holds Strong at Second Right behind BNB Chain, NEAR Protocol posted 51.8M active addresses in September. That keeps it competitive, with only a narrow gap separating it from the top. NEAR’s ecosystem continues to benefit from its push into Web3 gaming and user-friendly dApps. Unlike Solana, NEAR hasn’t had to rely on memecoins to maintain its user activity. Instead, it’s building steady growth through core ecosystem plays. On CoinMarketCap, NEAR is priced at $2.94, up 8.6% over the past week, suggesting both retail and institutional traders are paying close attention to its progress. Ethereum and Base Trail Behind While BNB Chain, NEAR, and Solana battle for the top three spots, other ecosystems lag behind in activity. Ethereum, despite being the leading Layer 1 by total value locked and DeFi dominance, continues to lose ground in active address metrics due to higher gas fees. Similarly, Base, Coinbase’s Layer 2 network, is gaining traction but hasn’t yet matched the scale of BNB Chain or NEAR. The latest numbers put it well behind the leaders, even though it benefits from one of the largest centralized exchange ecosystems in the world. ETH currently trades at $4500, slightly up 0.8% in 24 hours, while BASE’s native activity token metrics remain outside the top traded assets on CoinMarketCap. The Significance of opBNB’s Growth What stands out most in September is the growth of opBNB. Built on Optimism’s OP Stack, the Layer 2 solution was designed to make transactions on BNB Chain cheaper and faster. With a 66.4% increase in active addresses, it’s clear users are adopting it at a rapid pace. This move mirrors the broader trend across the industry,where Layer 2 solutions are increasingly becoming the real battleground for user engagement. Just as Arbitrum and Optimism compete for Ethereum’s Layer 2 crown, opBNB is helping Binance’s ecosystem strengthen its footprint. BNB, the native token, trades at $1147.20, up 17.8% this week. The token’s price movement reflects renewed interest from traders betting that higher user activity will translate to long-term value capture. What This Means for the Market The fact that BNB Chain overtook Solana and NEAR in active addresses suggests a dynamic shift in user interest. Instead of one chain holding a dominant lead, we’re seeing a back-and-forth battle where hype cycles, new dApps, and Layer 2 innovation play major roles. For now, BNB Chain’s rise is powered by Aster and the rapid adoption of opBNB. But history shows that activity can shift just as fast,whether to Solana with memecoins, NEAR with gaming, or Ethereum with DeFi. What’s clear is that the market no longer belongs to one single chain. Users are moving between ecosystems depending on cost, speed, and opportunity. That keeps competition fierce and innovation constant. BNB Chain’s climb to the top in September is more than a vanity metric. With 52.5M active addresses, it proves users are actively engaging, not just passively holding tokens. The Layer 1’s 22% growth combined with opBNB’s 66.4% surge show Binance’s ecosystem is attracting real traction. Whether this momentum sustains or fades will depend on how long projects like Aster can capture attention and how effectively the ecosystem continues to expand. For now, BNB Chain leads the pack. But as Solana, NEAR, Ethereum, and Base fight back, the race for active users is far from over. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This week, the non-profit sold 1,000 ETH through decentralized exchange CoWSwap, using a TWAP (time-weighted average price) strategy. The swap brought in $4.5 million USDC, marking the Foundation’s largest on-chain move in recent months. The sale is not random. Funds are officially allocated to research, grants, and donations,the backbone of Ethereum’s long-term ecosystem growth. But every time the Foundation moves ETH, traders take notice. This latest sale comes at a critical point for the market. Why Traders Care About Foundation Moves Ethereum’s price sits around $4,500 today, according to CoinMarketCap, up nearly 10% this past week. On-chain activity is also surging, fueled by new DeFi flows, NFT transactions, and institutional inflows. Against this backdrop, the Foundation’s $4.5M conversion to stablecoins raised eyebrows. Historically, when the Foundation sells ETH, the market interprets it as a signal of caution or profit-taking. Past sales have coincided with short-term dips. Traders know that when one of Ethereum’s biggest holders moves tokens, the ripple effects are real. This is why blockchain watchers and analysts scan Foundation wallets closely. Every move sets off speculation: Are they predicting volatility? Or simply managing their treasury responsibly? The Strategy: Using TWAP via CoWSwap The Foundation didn’t just dump tokens into the market. Instead, they used TWAP, a strategy that spreads out sales over time to reduce slippage and avoid spiking volatility. Executed on CoWSwap, the method ensured that the sale looked more like a risk management play than a market shock. This also signals sophistication. Rather than destabilizing ETH price, the Foundation chose a method that preserves liquidity. For traders, it’s a subtle reminder that Ethereum’s core stewards balance development needs with market sensitivity. Why Now? The Timing Behind the Swap The timing of the move is key. Ethereum has been climbing steadily, riding the wave of institutional interest and broader crypto optimism. Spot Ethereum ETFs are under review in multiple regions. Meanwhile, Layer-2 activity is soaring, with networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base driving traffic and fees. At the same time, volatility is intensifying. Bitcoin dominance is softening, altcoin rotations are in play, and ETH sits at a critical resistance level. In such moments, large treasury moves can be interpreted as profit-taking at the top of a rally. By moving to USDC, the Foundation shows it’s not betting recklessly on price action. Instead, it’s ensuring stable resources for ongoing projects. For developers and researchers, that’s reassurance. For traders, it’s a reason to pause and reassess bullish bets. What the Funds Will Support The Ethereum Foundation clarified that proceeds are earmarked for: Research: advancing Ethereum protocol development, scaling upgrades, and next-gen cryptography. Grants: supporting builders, open-source projects, and infrastructure teams. Donations: contributing to ecosystem-aligned initiatives that extend Ethereum’s reach. This allocation reinforces the Foundation’s role as more than just a holder of ETH. By cycling value back into the ecosystem, it ensures Ethereum stays competitive as rivals like Solana and Avalanche attract attention. Market Signals: Stablecoins as a Treasury Tool The Foundation’s choice of USDC over other assets is also telling. Stablecoins remain the most reliable hedge for organizations managing large treasuries. By parking $4.5M into USDC, the Foundation highlights the role stablecoins play in reducing exposure while preserving liquidity. This isn’t just about managing risk. It’s about signaling discipline to the market. Stablecoins have become the crypto-native equivalent of cash reserves. For traders, seeing Ethereum’s core organization lean on them validates their role in treasury management. How Traders Interpret the Move Blockchain sleuths often joke that when the Ethereum Foundation sells ETH, a dip follows. While correlation doesn’t always mean causation, history shows that these events coincide with increased sell pressure. 1/ Today, The Ethereum Foundation will convert 1000 ETH to stablecoins via @CoWSwap 's TWAP feature, as part of our ongoing work to fund R&D, grants and donations, and to highlight the power of DeFi. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 3, 2025 Already, analysts on X (formerly Twitter) are flagging the move. Ethereum Foundation’s official announcement confirms the sale. Market watchers, including CryptoPost Official, are tracking sentiment shifts. For retail traders, the lesson is simple: Foundation sales often signal caution. For institutions, it’s a sign that even Ethereum’s core players diversify when volatility looms. Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem. With ETH trading near $4,500 and demand for block space rising, the long-term outlook is strong. But Foundation moves like this remind everyone that markets are not one-directional. By selling 1,000 ETH for USDC, the Ethereum Foundation demonstrated strategic treasury management. It ensures that development, grants, and donations continue,regardless of short-term price swings. For traders, the signal is mixed. On one hand, the ecosystem gains funding security. On the other, the move injects caution into bullish momentum. In crypto, perception often drives price. And when Ethereum’s most influential entity makes a treasury adjustment, the market listens. The Ethereum Foundation’s $4.5M ETH-to-USDC swap isn’t just a trade,it’s a message. It’s about sustainability, funding, and risk management. For the community, it reassures that growth is supported. For traders, it sparks speculation about what comes next. As Ethereum pushes through a volatile market, one thing is clear: every Foundation transaction is more than just a number on the blockchain. It’s a signal. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

Bitcoin has broken above the $120,000 price level. XRP, on the other hand, hasn’t found it as easy to establish a firm breakout, although it has pushed as high as $3.10 in the past 24 hours. Technical analysis points to possible short-term price gains if resistance levels holds, but it also outlines a scenario where both Bitcoin and XRP could face another round of declines in the coming week. Related Reading: Space Meets Crypto—Spacecoin Executes 1st Blockchain Transaction Beyond Earth XRP’s Struggle Against The Downtrend Technical analysis of XRP’s daily candlestick timeframe chart, which was posted on the social media platform X by a crypto analyst called Guy on the Earth, shows that XRP’s price action in the past 48 hours is pushing above a downtrend resistance, with the top of its consolidation rectangle at $3.12 now in focus. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency narrowly missed this target during its latest surge, stalling at $3.10 before slipping back to $3. However, XRP has so far managed to retest and find support on the downtrend line, which suggests there is still a chance for continuation higher. However, the analyst noted that the rally could fade quickly, unless XRP can closes the week and hold above the $3.12. A drop back below $3.00 would invalidate the breakout attempt and reopen the possibility of a breakdown to the $2.72 support. The pink circle drawn on the chart below shows the risk of XRP falling back to retest the ascending trendline around $2.40 to $2.50 if $2.72 is broken. XRP Daily Price Chart: @guyontheearth Bitcoin, on the other hand, has been displaying stronger momentum. The breakout above $120,000 has been decisive, and this can be seen as a healthier technical structure compared to XRP. The Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) is also pointing higher, meaning Bitcoin could continue leading the market regardless of whether the next move is up or down. A Big Weekend Ahead For Both Bitcoin And XRP The next few days will be important for both XRP and Bitcoin. The three-day candle closes within hours, and the weekly candle will confirm the broader direction soon after. For XRP, holding above the $3.00 downtrend retest is important to maintain bullish momentum. On the other hand, Bitcoin maintaining strength above $120,000 could confirm its breakout and establish new grounds for further rallies. Failure for Bitcoin to hold above $120,000, would likely usher in another bloody phase next week, with XRP at risk of dropping back toward $2.72 or even lower. The week’s close will determine whether this rally has legs or whether the correction scenario plays out instead.

The move is an evolution in how public blockchain companies raise capital, blending traditional debt instruments with decentralized infrastructure models. Why This Move Redefines Capital Formation For Ethereum DATs In an X post , BitDigital_BTBT revealed that the company has made history as the first publicly traded Ethereum Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) to deploy unsecured leverage through a convertible notes offering, marking a new milestone in blockchain-based corporate finance. The latest move by the financial behemoth will be beneficial to the company shareholders. However, this initiative will enhance capital efficiency for shareholders, without immediate dilution notes due in October 2030. The proceeds will be used to acquire ETH, expand BitDigital’s treasury, and increase institutional staking capacity. This strategic financing deepens BitDigital’s exposure to ETH, while positioning the asset as a programmable treasury instrument capable of generating institution-grade staking yield. By leveraging traditional debt structures within a decentralized framework, BitDigital reinforces its leadership in ETH-native treasury management and staking strategies. The move also signals ETH’s advanced role in institutional finance, bridging the gap between Web3 infrastructure and legacy capital markets. Amid the growing exposure to Ethereum, multiple potential projects are being consistently launched on the leading chain. Kriptoloji, an ambassador at Irys_xyz, points out that their restaking design project’s focus isn’t on flashy incentive yields, but on building genuine utility and layering right on top of ETH’s ecosystem. Kriptoloji noted that most projects in DeFi tend to chase the same hype cycles and loops, but Ekoxofficial is building something different with this move. Instead of creating another yield, it aims to make network participation more seamless, efficient, and sustainable. Meanwhile, the early indicators suggest that a well-received testnet, growing momentum from the Arichain collaboration, and a pipeline of upcoming integrations are starting to establish the foundation for credibility as a long-term infrastructure play rather than a fleeting experiment. “This is not financial advice, but the way they are structuring it’s definitely something worth paying attention to.” Kriptoloji mentioned. Institutional Adoption Strengthens ETH Long-Term Outlook Ethereum is still very much recognized at the institutional level. Goldman Sachs’ latest report reveals a powerful trend unfolding as institutional investors are deepening their involvement with ETH, with over $3.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM) now linked to the ecosystem. This level of exposure highlights the ETH transformation from a speculative blockchain into a critical layer of institutional-grade infrastructure. According to Crypto Patel, Elite KOL CoinMarketCap and Binance, this institutional pivot is one of the strongest bullish signals for ETH’s future.",Ethereum|Assets Under Management|AUM|binance|BitDigital|Coinmarketcap|Crypto Patel|DAT|digital asset treasury|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|goldman sachs|Kriptoloji,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 22:30:47

Source: Annbessa (X) On-chain observers note XRP remains above the one-week 50 EMA at $2.77 after a prolonged consolidation that preceded the 2024 breakout. With Bitcoin trading above $123,000, altcoin rotation has favored XRP’s short-term momentum. Frequently Asked Questions What are the immediate support and resistance levels for XRP? Immediate resistance sits at $3.10; support levels to watch are $3.00 (pivot), $2.90, and $2.80. Maintaining $3.00 is critical for a push toward $3.30–$3.50. How much institutional interest is there in XRP ETFs? Early ETF adoption is measurable: the XRPR ETF holds $77.6 million in assets, suggesting growing institutional allocation to XRP via spot ETF exposure. Key Takeaways Pivot level : $3.00 is decisive for next directional move. ETF tailwinds : XRPR ETF assets ($77.6M) show institutional demand forming.

His latest analysis comes as the asset continues to face resistance below $3.10 despite Bitcoin’s strong rebound. At the time of writing, XRP trades around $2.95 , up roughly 45% since the start of the year but still significantly below its historical peak. In contrast, Bitcoin recently reclaimed $122,000, reinforcing its dominance during the current market recovery. The Historical Role of the Chasm Line According to EGRAG’s multi-year price analysis, the Chasm Line has historically served as a marker for XRP’s cyclical tops. His chart review, based on three-week intervals, shows that XRP has approached or interacted with this trendline in previous market cycles, with each retest signaling a major turning point. #XRP – The Chasm ($10.30) : As of today, the price of touching The Chasm is $10.30 . As time goes on, the price of the Chasm continues to rise. ONLY FEW AND PATIENCE TRULY GETS IT #XRPFamily STAY STEADY and STRONG , Together We Rise and Soon We Shall Fly… pic.twitter.com/rTA4YAkvta — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 3, 2025 For instance, XRP peaked at $1.96 in April 2021 during the 2020-2021 bull run. This price coincided with the Chasm Line, which subsequently acted as resistance. The token struggled to break above that level and later entered a period of correction as overall market momentum slowed. XRP demonstrated similar behavior in the 2017–2018 cycle. In May 2017, the token surged to $0.3988, aligning with the Chasm Line at the time. Although it experienced a short-term pullback, XRP later exceeded the trendline, rising to a record high of $3.31 by January 2018. EGRAG classified this breakout as an exception rather than the norm but noted that it underscored the importance of this technical level as a long-term reference point. What the Chasm Line Means for Today’s Market In the current cycle, the Chasm Line appears much higher, now positioned near $10.3. EGRAG’s analysis suggests that XRP would need to rally to at least this level to retest the trendline. Achieving that target would represent a more than threefold increase from current prices and could mark the lower boundary of a potential cycle top if the pattern continues to hold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While such a move may appear ambitious, EGRAG pointed out that historical cycles indicate that XRP has the potential to extend beyond this line under favourable conditions. In the 2017 cycle, XRP advanced more than 600% above the Chasm Line before its eventual peak. Applying a similar trajectory in the current context could imply prices exceeding $70, although he acknowledged that such levels may not be realistic within this market phase. Market Outlook and Analyst Commentary EGRAG emphasized that investors who maintain long-term positions may be best positioned to benefit from the next significant rally, reiterating the importance of patience. This perspective aligns with comments from financial educator Coach JV, who has consistently advised that meaningful movements in XRP tend to occur rapidly once market catalysts align, leaving little time for late entrants to participate. Other analysts have also weighed in on potential price targets. Market observer Mikybull recently suggested that XRP could be approaching the final upward phase of its current cycle, projecting a conservative target between $6 and $10 , with an extended target of $21 under ideal conditions. The Chasm Line remains a focal point in EGRAG’s technical framework, serving as both a benchmark for XRP’s cyclical performance and a reference for assessing its future potential. If XRP were to approach or surpass this line again, it could signal a new phase of market expansion. However, reaching such levels would depend heavily on sustained momentum across the broader cryptocurrency market and renewed investor demand for XRP.

The discussion highlighted that the two agencies intend to cooperate on crypto regulation, despite having little history of collaboration. Alignment on Crypto Rules Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham acknowledged at Monday’s roundtable that while the SEC and CFTC have had many opportunities to work together for market participants and global capital markets, unclear regulatory boundaries have sometimes caused friction and difficulties for the public. Pham said she was pleased that both regulators are now aligning rules to reduce unnecessary costs, support responsible innovation, and create fair competition. She pointed to the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint as early examples of coordination, suggesting that greater harmonization could lead to increased efficiency, clarity, and expanded investor access to digital assets. Addressing concerns about the CFTC’s effectiveness, Pham reported that from January 20 to September 3, the agency has carried out 18 non-enforcement actions and 13 enforcement actions, with some involving digital asset lawsuits. Since September 4, the Commission has initiated 14 more legal proceedings in just a few weeks. The acting chair said these figures show that the CFTC is active and effective, adding that “there needs to be no more FUD about what’s happening on the other side of town.” The roundtable also featured panels on market structure and innovation, with discussions on topics such as extended trading hours, perpetual contracts, prediction markets, and crypto assets. The participants included executives from major crypto firms such as Kraken, Robinhood, and Crypto.com. On the sidelines of the recent event, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said that crypto is the agency’s “top priority right now.” He also identified asset tokenization as a key area of regulatory focus, cautioning that it may take a year or two to establish proper guardrails, and described its potential as “pretty much endless.” Earlier in the year, the financial watchdog had held discussions on tokenization and crypto regulation, with the aim of harmonizing rules amid increasing crypto adoption. Tensions Rise Over Classification of Tokenized Securities Elsewhere, the crypto X community has reignited debate over how tokenized securities should be classified. The conversation follows tensions at the recent joint panel, where traditional finance representatives resisted innovation exemptions and advocated for strict fungibility requirements under Reg NMS. Crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro argued that tokenized securities should indeed be fungible. In response, former regulatory adviser Justin Slaughter questioned the belief that these instruments are inherently derivatives, suggesting they could represent either the underlying asset itself or an idealized version. Shapiro countered that such ambiguity may reflect poor tokenization practices through SPVs and similar structures, compared with more native approaches like Superstate or MetaLeX.

52680220,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-ada-and-magacoin-finance-emerge-as-a-power-combo-for-smart-investors/,1759622340,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52680220.jpeg,Cardano (ADA) and MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerge as a Power Combo for Smart Investors,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-ada-and-magacoin-finance-emerge-as-a-power-combo-for-smart-investors/,"With the new crypto bull run making waves in the market, two names are attracting the attention of forward-looking investors: Cardano (ADA) and MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining status among investors as one of the promising digital assets for 2025. Together with ADA, they are stable and explosive assets that anyone looking to build a strong portfolio should consider adding. Cardano Builds Long-Term Trust Cardano is trading at near $0.89 and has regained momentum. The project has always focused on research, scientific rigour, and a slow-but-steady approach to blockchain development. Supporters of Cardano make a strong argument in favor of the crypto asset. Unlike competing crypto assets such as Ethereum and Solana that have seemingly caught on faster, Cardano has a decently sized user base to reflect upon the future success of the crypto coin. The ecosystem is growing, and applications for DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and governance are coming along. Future upgrades that will boost scalability and interoperability are in the works, leading commentators to believe ADA could soon be seen by institutions. ADA has had a strong recovery from its lows and now has stabilised just under the important $1 level. According to technical analysts, ADA has the potential to retest levels of $1.20-$1.30 if it manages to secure a firm break above resistance at $1, provided the market continues to remain bullish. Smart Money Eyes ADA Many large holders, often referred to as whales, have been buying more ADA. This shows that they believe Cardano has a future in blockchain. The increasing accumulation trend, along with rising unique wallet addresses, hints that another breakout could be in the cards for ADA. Institutional interest is also a key factor. Cardano is poised to integrate with traditional financial firms thanks to its strong commitment to compliance and sustainability. As global regulations tighten, Cardano’s nature as a supposed slow and steady project might be more of a blessing. MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outpace Solana’s Early Days While ADA provides the foundation of stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating the type of hype reminiscent of Solana’s early explosive growth. Analysts are already noting that MAGACOIN’s momentum is surprising even the most optimistic forecasts, with early-stage investors anticipating massive upside potential. If current growth continues, MAGACOIN FINANCE could eclipse the early returns that Solana delivered when it rose from under $1 to triple-digit prices in just a few years. The project has gained traction by tapping into retail enthusiasm and institutional curiosity at the same time. Its limited supply, strong presale performance, and ambitious roadmap have set it apart in a crowded market. By positioning itself as both accessible to smaller investors and appealing to larger funds, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out a unique position in the 2025 bull market. As capital flows increasingly rotate into early-stage projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most attractive bets for those who don’t want to miss the next generational altcoin success story. ADA’s Role in Investor Portfolios Many investors are now looking at ADA as a necessary token for long-term blockchain exposure. ADA’s proven track record, growing developer community, and strong institutional prospects make it a great way to balance riskier assets in a portfolio. The ability of the token to survive through previous bear markets has certainly contributed to its reputation as one of the safer long-term plays on crypto. ADA has a great case to eventually be considered as a core digital asset along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, due to its sustainability narrative plus iterations. Conclusion The ongoing bull run is creating opportunities for established tokens and new tokens to shine. Cardano (ADA) offers reliability, as a well-known crypto with strong fundamentals, while MAGACOIN FINANCE has breakout potential to do a Solana, or better. This is an opportunity that you don’t want to miss. Together, they form a powerful combination for investors: ADA as the solid foundation, and MAGACOIN FINANCE as the high-upside play. In 2025, the smartest portfolios may very well be those that include both.

52679628,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85380,1759622453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Predicts Timeline for $100 XRP,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-timeline-for-100-xrp/,"Crypto market analyst 24hrscrypto1 has shared a bullish outlook for XRP, stating that the digital asset could reach the $100 milestone sooner than 2030. Although he initially projected a five-year window for the target, he now believes the price surge may happen even earlier, citing growing confidence in XRP’s long-term fundamentals and utility within the financial sector. At the time of his remarks, XRP was trading around $3.02, but it has declined to $2.94, meaning it would need to appreciate by more than 3,301% to reach $100. Despite the steep climb, 24hrscrypto1’s position reflects an increasing sentiment among XRP supporters who believe that broader adoption and sustained market recovery could drive such exponential growth. Increasing Optimism Among Analysts Several analysts have suggested that XRP could eventually reach $100, indicating that this target is not just a singular prediction. Several figures in the crypto community have shared similar expectations over the past year, reinforcing growing confidence in the asset’s long-term trajectory. My firm belief is that XRP will reach $100 by 2030… But honestly, I think I’m wrong. It’s going to happen sooner than that. — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) October 3, 2025 Earlier in 2025, Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer at CryptoCharged, described an XRP valuation between $100 and $1,000 as highly attainable within the next decade. He attributed this prediction to XRP’s expanding role in cross-border payments and global remittance solutions, areas where the token has established a strong presence through Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions. Similarly, Linda Jones, a well-known crypto wealth strategist, reiterated her belief that XRP could eventually trade at $100. While she did not specify a timeline, Jones emphasized the importance of holding the asset long-term, noting the dramatic difference between XRP’s early prices and today’s valuation. She illustrated this by comparing her early $100 purchase, which once bought 400 XRP, to the same amount now buying fewer than 35 XRP, emphasizing the coin’s gradual increase in value over time. Her view was supported by community figures like Rob Cunningham, host of KUWL.show, who advised investors to stay patient, and Mr. Hillard, another early adopter, who shared that his early accumulation of XRP has yielded consistent satisfaction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Contrasting Forecasts for XRP by 2030 Although optimism is high, projections for XRP’s price in 2030 vary widely across analysts. Among the most ambitious assessments is a Valhil Capital study , which applied its “Athey & Mitchnick Model” to estimate XRP’s potential fair value at $4,813 by 2030. The model considers factors such as global adoption, liquidity, and transactional velocity. In contrast, more conservative estimates from Changelly and Telegaon place XRP between $21 and $48 by 2030, while Bitwise suggests a possible upper limit of $30. Despite differing figures, most projections share a common theme: strong expectations of significant long-term appreciation compared to XRP’s current market price. Assessing the Market Cap Challenge For XRP to hit $100, its market cap would need to exceed $5.9 trillion, representing a 32x increase from its current valuation of around $181 billion. This level of growth would position XRP among the largest global financial assets, raising questions about the practicality of such projections. Nonetheless, some analysts maintain that this level of expansion could be achievable if institutional adoption, bank integrations, and tokenization of financial assets continue to grow at their current pace. The expanding use of Ripple’s technology across global payment systems could also strengthen XRP’s utility, potentially driving demand and long-term valuation. While opinions vary on XRP’s $100 target, the recurring forecasts among analysts reflect increasing optimism about its future significance in the digital financial landscape. Whether or not this price level materializes before 2030, the ongoing discussion underscores the sustained optimism surrounding XRP’s role in the crypto economy.

52680086,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85359,1759623319,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"7 Altcoins Leading the Next Bull Run Including XRP, SOL, ETH and Top New Cryptos to Join Now",https://timestabloid.com/7-altcoins-leading-the-next-bull-run-including-xrp-sol-eth/,"Top new cryptos to join now are shaping the final stretch of Q4 2025 as market sentiment heats up. Bitcoin is holding strong at support, Ethereum’s ascending triangle points toward the $3,000 mark, and Solana is regaining its stride through dApps and NFT activity. Analysts are split on whether the rally will peak before year-end, but one project is already capturing attention: MoonBull ($MOBU). With its blend of meme culture and structured tokenomics, it isn’t just background noise—it’s positioning as a core contender for those seeking entry before the cycle turns. MoonBull ($MOBU) demonstrates why it belongs in every conversation about the top new cryptos to join now. Built on Ethereum, it leverages liquidity locks, token reflections, and supply burns to strengthen scarcity while rewarding holders. Its presale format with multiple stages, combined with staking rewards and governance features, gives it more utility than typical meme plays. Ripple continues to expand into finance, Cardano keeps delivering upgrades, yet MoonBull has emerged as the freshest breakout pick. As momentum builds through October, it’s proving to be more than hype—staking its claim as one of the projects to watch closely going into 2026. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Meme Energy Meets Real Mechanics MoonBull ($MOBU) is structured around auto-liquidity, reflections, and supply burns, ensuring every trade pushes its ecosystem forward. Community members are rewarded passively while liquidity deepens and token supply shrinks, creating sustainable scarcity. Unlike short-lived meme projects, MoonBull is audited, liquidity-locked, and fully transparent. This makes it a meme-driven token with functional mechanics that encourage stability. Its staking program promises an impressive 95% APY, while referral rewards bring viral potential. Community governance ensures each holder has direct influence. By combining memes with mechanics, MoonBull positions itself as a project that transforms trading conviction into actual returns and collective ecosystem growth. MoonBull’s presale rollout spans 23 stages, steadily tightening supply and rewarding early participants with better entry points. Fifty percent of its total 73.2 billion tokens are committed to this phase, supported by allocations for staking, liquidity, and referral growth. Stage 10 unlocks staking, while Stage 12 delivers governance rights. A unique launch safeguard prevents dumping, ensuring entry prices hold firm. Deployed on Ethereum, MoonBull is backed by security, liquidity, and scale. This combination of structure and strength has placed MoonBull presale into spotlight discussions as the best crypto to buy now and one of the top new cryptos to join now. Top New Cryptos to Join Now: Moonbull’s 27.40% Surge Is Next Moonbull is leading the list of top new cryptos to join now. In Stage 4 at $0.00005168, the token has already attracted over $200K in tally and 700+ holders. With its listing price set at $0.00616, ROI projections sit at 11,800%. A $5,000 entry secures 96.7 million tokens, which rise to $595,975 by launch. With a 27.40% price surge expected next, Moonbull presale is proving why early movers are locking in their allocations before the next stage begins. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): Still the Market’s Anchor in Q4 2025 Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor heading into Q4 2025. It is consolidating near crucial levels, with analysts eyeing $80,000 as the next upside target. ETF inflows continue to support liquidity, while trading volumes hold steady across global exchanges. Institutions are still active, cementing Bitcoin’s role as the backbone of digital finance. Despite volatility, its position as digital gold has only grown stronger. Bitcoin continues to attract both newcomers and veterans. For many, no portfolio feels complete without BTC exposure. Its dominance frames the narrative for every altcoin, influencing which projects are spotlighted as top new cryptos to join now. Market setups indicate a decisive Q4 ahead for Bitcoin. Technical patterns show consolidation zones forming strength before a breakout. Traders are watching whether BTC will initiate the rally or simply provide stability for altcoins to thrive. Whichever path plays out, Bitcoin remains essential to crypto market direction. Its presence creates liquidity, confidence, and gravitational pull that other projects rely upon. Without Bitcoin’s foundation, few tokens can sustain broader adoption. That’s why it remains not only the original but also the most important benchmark asset in the sector. Altcoins may grab headlines, but Bitcoin writes the market’s story. 3. BullZilla (BZIL): A Meme Powerhouse With Bold Potential BullZilla has built its identity as a viral contender in the meme economy, positioning itself as the top meme coin to buy now. Its branding has immediate recognition, designed to spread across TikTok, Discord, and Twitter feeds. Beyond aesthetics, BullZilla has structured its tokenomics to strengthen community growth. Scarcity mechanics mirror viral meme tokens of the past but with added engagement strategies for stronger longevity. Early chatter highlights grassroots adoption, with community-driven promotions fueling liquidity and consistency. Unlike projects that fade after initial excitement, BullZilla has created a repeatable cycle of engagement, making its presence difficult to ignore. The coin’s biggest strength lies in its culture. Participants are not only holding tokens but actively building memes, stories, and integrations that expand the brand. This viral feedback loop makes BullZilla unique among new meme projects. If Dogecoin and Shiba Inu showed what cultural power can achieve, BullZilla is shaping its own trajectory by locking its focus on branding and engagement. Whether it cements itself as a permanent player depends on execution, but few meme projects are structured with this level of attention. In the race to become crypto’s cultural icon, BullZilla has the raw potential. 4. La Culex: Why It’s Being Ranked as a Top Meme Coin La Culex is quickly capturing the attention of the meme coin community with its playful style and strong engagement. Built around creativity and collective energy, it offers more than just short-lived trends. The project’s ability to spark conversations and attract participants highlights why it is being discussed as a top meme coin to follow in the coming cycles of 2025. What makes La Culex stand out is the energy of its supporters who continue to amplify its presence across platforms. Meme tokens live and die on community strength, and La Culex is proving it has the momentum needed to thrive. With rising chatter and growing traction, it is steadily cementing its reputation as a top meme coin, one that blends fun with genuine staying power in the wider crypto conversation. 5. Ethereum (ETH): Gearing Up for Another Breakout Ethereum remains at the center of crypto adoption as Q4 2025 begins. Its price action is coiling within an ascending triangle, with analysts eyeing $3,000 as the key level to reclaim. If it breaks through, projections point toward higher highs by year-end. Beyond technicals, Ethereum dominates decentralized finance, NFT markets, and smart contract ecosystems. Its rollup upgrades continue to reduce fees and strengthen scalability. Ethereum’s unmatched developer base and vast network effect ensure its relevance. For many community members, ETH is a must-hold asset, especially when compiling any serious list of the top new cryptos to join now. Ethereum’s adaptability has secured its leadership across multiple Web3 sectors. From powering complex decentralized apps to enabling yield strategies in DeFi, ETH maintains utility across diverse functions. Its ecosystem is larger than any competitor, making it the prime launchpad for innovations. Institutional adoption through staking further reinforces its position as a strong long-term play. Market signals point toward Ethereum being ready for another defining run in Q4 2025, which could cement its influence once again. Whether held as an infrastructure asset or speculative driver, Ethereum remains one of the most important projects in global crypto discussions. 6. Solana (SOL): The Speedster Regaining Confidence Solana has re-entered the spotlight as one of 2025’s best comeback stories. Known for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, Solana is re-establishing its place as the preferred chain for developers and NFT creators. Q4 adoption metrics show surging activity in decentralized applications and token launches. Reliability concerns that haunted Solana in the past have largely been resolved, giving participants renewed confidence in the network. By late 2025, Solana is climbing charts again, both in ecosystem usage and price performance. It has regained momentum as one of the top new cryptos to join now for utility-driven opportunities. Developers and traders are flocking back to Solana for its speed and efficiency. New partnerships and ecosystem expansions continue to push innovation, with applications spanning from gaming to decentralized finance. Solana’s consistent focus on performance at scale makes it a top contender for long-term relevance. Its recovery underscores resilience and its ability to overcome setbacks. For those who once doubted its staying power, Solana is proving why it can reclaim its former glory.

52681501,597775,1759624255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52681501.jpeg,Bored Ape NFTs Win Big: Court Says They’re Not Securities,https://bitcoinist.com/bored-ape-nfts-win-big-court-says-theyre-not-securities/,"A US federal judge has tossed a high-profile investor suit that accused Yuga Labs of selling unregistered securities through Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs and ApeCoin. The decision , handed down by Judge Fernando M. Olguin, found that the plaintiffs did not meet the legal test for an investment contract. According to reports, the suit dated back to 2022 and was aimed at forcing a legal finding that the tokens were securities; the court disagreed and dismissed the case. Judge Found Howey Test Unmet Judge Olguin ruled the plaintiffs failed to show all three prongs of the Howey Test were satisfied. Based on reports, the court said buyers were not shown to have a shared enterprise tied to Yuga’s efforts, nor were they promised returns that would come primarily from Yuga’s work. The judge emphasized that many BAYC sales were framed as collectibles and membership benefits rather than investment contracts. Plaintiffs Had Argued For Profit Expectations The investors argued that market talk about trading and rare traits created profit expectations. The court, however, saw those claims as too thin to convert a collectible into a security. Purchasers’ fortunes, the ruling noted, were not made to depend directly on Yuga’s future business actions in the way required by securities law. This narrower view left the complaint without the necessary legal footing. Regulators Still Watchful Reports say the SEC has taken enforcement steps in other NFT cases, meaning the space remains under close regulatory scrutiny. Historical actions noted by regulators included instances associated with projects that provided revenue sharing or paid promotional aspects. Courts have not always offered a consistent interpretation of their findings. That uncertainty means that creators and platforms may be facing legal exposure even after the ruling. Not A Complete Shield For NFTs Legal experts cautioned that the ruling does not imply that all NFTs are free from securities claims. Yuga Labs itself has faced other legal fights; in July 2025 an appeals court overturned an $8.8 million judgment that Yuga had won in a trademark dispute and sent that matter back for trial. The mixed outcomes in related suits show courts are treating each case on its own facts. The decision is expected to offer some reassurance to NFT holders and marketplaces, since one major challenge was dismissed. Still, projects that promise revenue sharing, profit splits, or that are marketed mainly as investments could attract a different outcome if challenged. The ruling is useful, but it is not a universal safe harbor.

At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention as one of the top best crypto to buy now, offering traders a chance to diversify before capital rotation accelerates. Bitcoin Crosses $120K With ETF Demand Bitcoin rose 0.88% in the past 24 hours to $120,524, adding to a 10% weekly rise. The driver is the surging demand for ETFs. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs brought in $1.3 billion in two days , tightening supply. Data also shows futures open interest jumped 14.6% to $88.5 billion, with institutions buying at a premium on Coinbase. Citibank has recently updated its outlook, setting a base target of $181,000 in 12 months and a bullish case at $231,000 . With limited supply and consistent ETF inflows, traders are watching daily flow data to see if inflows above $500 million continue. If so, Bitcoin could push even higher in the coming weeks. Solana Pulls $291M Inflows as Adoption Grows Solana is drawing attention with $291 million in weekly inflows , taking its yearly inflows to $1.86 billion. This rush of liquidity is linked to expectations around upcoming U.S. ETF approvals. Corporations are also starting to add Solana to their treasuries, with Japanese firm Mobcast Holdings announcing a $10 million SOL buy . This shows how Solana is being used not only for network activity but also as a treasury and corporate reserve asset. With inflows stacking and new institutional adoption coming in, Solana is keeping its place as one of the top best crypto to buy now .

XRP Mega Breakout Gains Speed XRP is back in focus after breaking out of a wedge formation that kept it range-bound for months. It has now cleared the $3 level and is trading at $3.05. Analysts describe this as a “mega breakout” and expect further gains if XRP pushes through $3.40 and $3.66. Analysts like Matt Hughes and EGRAG see XRP climbing anywhere between $8 and $27 in the next wave. Some even suggest $50 if ETF approvals arrive. With upcoming SEC decisions on XRP ETFs and Ripple’s pursuit of a U.S. bank charter, the conditions for more upside are aligning. This makes XRP a key pick on the list of the top best crypto to buy now . Ethereum Outlook Turns Bullish Ethereum is holding above $4,500, gaining 2.5% in the past day. Citibank set a base target of $5,400 and a bullish case at $7,300 in its latest outlook, with some traders even eyeing $15,000 down the line. Institutional adoption is still centered on Bitcoin, but Ethereum’s evolving ecosystem, along with ETH ETFs, is driving steady inflows. With altcoins like Solana and XRP gaining traction, Ethereum remains the blue-chip crypto that many consider essential for a balanced portfolio. This keeps ETH among the top best crypto to buy now . How Traders Should Position Bitcoin is setting the pace, but smart traders spread out their bets. Diversifying into Solana, XRP, Ethereum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE makes sense as liquidity rotates across assets.
