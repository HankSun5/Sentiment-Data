According to a report from Politico, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a key negotiator for the Republican side, expressed optimism that a new draft of the bill could be released this week. Lummis aims to have the bill ready for markup before Congress adjourns for the holiday break, stating, “Knock on wood, I hope to share a draft at the end of this week that reflects our best efforts to date.” Lummis Urges Swift Progress On Crypto Legislation During a panel discussion hosted by the Blockchain Association, Sen. Lummis emphasized the urgency of progressing with the legislation. She remarked that it might be advantageous for lawmakers to finalize a product and proceed with the markup next week, allowing everyone to take a break for the Christmas holidays. In related developments, Politico reported that Senate Banking Republicans submitted a proposal to their Democratic counterparts last week, suggesting over 30 amendments to a previous draft of the legislation.

Predictions Point To A $150,000 Rally In 2026 The three-page document, which comes from GOP senators on the Banking Committee, seeks to maintain certain elements of the original bill while incorporating adjustments acceptable to Democratic lawmakers. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and other Republicans are eager to finalize the markup next week, although some Democrats have expressed skepticism about this ambitious timeline. Following a meeting on Monday, Democrats sent a response to the GOP offer, but details of their feedback remain unclear. Concessions In GOP’s Proposal The GOP’s proposal outlines the aspects from a September crypto market structure framework that they agree to integrate into a bipartisan bill, hoping to reconcile differences with their Democratic colleagues. The proposal includes a two-column table delineating 38 concessions the Republicans are willing to make, in exchange for retaining or modifying 32 sections of the original Responsible Financial Innovation Act discussion draft.

Additionally, the proposal contains ethics provisions aimed at addressing scrutiny over the Trump family’s business connections in the crypto sector. However, Lummis noted a previous ethics proposal she negotiated with Sen. Ruben Gallego was rejected by the White House, and she plans to collaborate further with Democrats to revisit the issue. Other notable concessions from the Republicans include a section on consumer protection standards for digital assets, proposed language regarding bankruptcy, the establishment of a federal baseline for crypto ATMs, and risk management standards for digital asset intermediaries.

Saylor generated a buzz with his comments during his keynote at the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi on December 8, 2025. Saylor’s tour across the Middle East puts the Bitcoin proponent in direct contact with large investors from wealthy petrodollar countries. Strategy’s stock is far from its historical highs as BTC slowly fights back from a collapse in BTC price to the $80,000 range. What did Saylor say at Bitcoin MENA? According to him, BTC is not just a simple investment, but should be regarded as the foundation for a new era of “digital capital” and yield-generating financial products. During his keynote in Abu Dhabi, he talked about Strategy and its accumulation strategy. He described the market as a “$200 trillion opportunity,” referring to the potential scale of global credit markets that could be unlocked via Bitcoin-backed banking, custody, and lending. He likened BTC to “digital gold,” acknowledging its current valuation level and highlighting bullish projections expected in 4 to 8 years, implying that if the Middle East moved now, it could become a global hub for BTC innovation. And that’s how the region could attract “trillions” in foreign capital seeking yield. The wealth funds in these areas collectively manage trillions in assets, much of which comes from oil revenues, and are traditionally invested in assets like U.S. Treasuries, real estate, and equities. However, Saylor wants them to pivot toward BTC to future-proof their economies amid the declining petrodollar system. “All the money will come to you,” he said. Critical MSCI decision looms for Strategy The firm is now navigating the most complex period in its storied history as a corporate Bitcoin treasury. In the past, the Tysons Corner-based firm operated with a distinct advantage that allowed its equity to trade at a significant premium to the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings. This premium was the engine of the company’s capital strategy and helped management raise billions in equity and convertible debt to acquire Bitcoin, effectively engaging in regulatory arbitrage that benefited mainly from the lack of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market. While naysayers like Peter Schiff delight have rolled out the drums as Strategy fell on hard times recently, Saylor made a big statement with the firm’s latest BTC purchase of almost $1 billion on Monday, as Cryptopolitan reported . While the vanishing premium has stalled the company’s growth engine, the looming decision by MSCI Inc. has become a more immediate structural threat. The index provider is currently conducting a consultation on the classification of digital asset treasury (DAT) companies. A decision is expected on January 15, 2026, after the review period ending December 31. Should Strategy be reclassified as a DAT , it could be pushed out of flagship equity benchmarks, potentially triggering forced selling of between $2.8 billion and $8.8 billion by passive funds.

The answer carries immense weight, determining which regulator oversees a project and what rules it must follow. In a revealing interview, former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Paul Atkins provided crucial clarity, stating that a significant number of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are not securities . This perspective from a seasoned regulator cuts through the noise and offers a more nuanced view of crypto asset classification. What Did the Former SEC Commissioner Actually Say? Paul Atkins, who served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008, spoke with Decrypt to share his expert analysis. He argued that many tokens sold during ICOs possess clear non-security characteristics. His core point is that tokens designed for specific utility within a network—like accessing a service, representing digital collectibles, or functioning as tools—should not fall under traditional securities laws. Therefore, he believes a blanket application of SEC rules to all ICOs is incorrect. Why Does It Matter If ICOs Are Not Securities? The distinction between a security and a non-security token is not just legal jargon; it’s the difference between two entirely different regulatory worlds. When the SEC classifies a token as a security, the project faces stringent registration, disclosure, and compliance requirements designed for traditional investments like stocks. This can stifle innovation and burden early-stage projects with immense cost and complexity. Atkins suggests that tokens with genuine utility should instead be overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates commodities like gold and oil. This framework could be more appropriate for digital assets that function as a medium of exchange or a consumable product within an ecosystem, rather than an investment contract. What Types of ICOs Might Avoid Security Classification? Based on Atkins’s comments and existing legal guidance like the Howey Test, several token models may legitimately argue they are not securities. Here are key examples: Utility Tokens: Tokens that grant access to a current or future software service, platform, or network function. The primary purpose is use, not investment. Digital Collectibles (NFTs): Unique tokens representing ownership of a digital or physical asset, such as art, music, or in-game items, where value is derived from scarcity and ownership rights. Payment & Exchange Tokens: Tokens designed primarily to be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services, similar to traditional currency. Governance Tokens: Tokens that provide holders with voting rights on protocol decisions, focusing on ecosystem participation rather than profit expectation from the efforts of others. What Are the Challenges for Crypto Projects? Despite this clarifying perspective, the path forward is not simple. The main challenge is the lack of clear, formal rules from regulators. Projects often operate in a gray area, unsure of how their token will be viewed. This regulatory uncertainty can deter serious developers and legitimate investors. Furthermore, the SEC’s current enforcement-focused approach has created a climate of fear, where the threat of action looms over even well-intentioned projects trying to build functional networks. Actionable Insights for Investors and Builders So, what can you do with this information? For investors, it underscores the importance of deep due diligence. Look beyond the hype and ask: What is this token’s actual utility? Is there a working product, or just a promise? Understanding the difference between a security token offering and a utility token sale is critical for assessing risk and regulatory exposure. For project founders, the message is to design with intention. If your goal is to create a functional network, structure your tokenomics to emphasize utility, access, and consumption from the very start. Document this purpose clearly. Proactive engagement with legal experts who understand the evolving ICOs are not securities argument is no longer optional—it’s essential for longevity. Conclusion: A Step Toward Sensible Crypto Regulation Paul Atkins’s comments are a vital contribution to the debate on crypto regulation. They highlight that a one-size-fits-all approach is ineffective and potentially harmful. Recognizing that many ICOs are not securities is the first step toward creating a regulatory environment that protects investors without crushing innovation. The future of cryptocurrency depends on this kind of nuanced understanding, where utility is distinguished from investment, and rules are fit for purpose. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean no ICOs are securities? A> No. Atkins stated that “many” ICOs are not securities, not “all.” Tokens that represent an investment contract where buyers expect profits primarily from the efforts of others are likely still securities under the Howey Test. Q: What is the Howey Test? A> It’s a legal test derived from a 1946 Supreme Court case used to determine if a transaction qualifies as an “investment contract” and is therefore a security. It examines if there is (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with an expectation of profits (4) derived from the efforts of others. Q: If a token isn’t a security, who regulates it? A> As Atkins suggested, the CFTC may have jurisdiction if the token is considered a commodity. Other aspects might fall under consumer protection laws, money transmission rules, or, in some cases, no specific financial regulator at all. Q: How can I tell if a token I’m interested in is a utility token or a security? A> Analyze its stated purpose. Is it used to power a network or app right now? Or is the main pitch about its future value and the development team’s work to increase that value? The latter leans toward a security. Q: Will the current SEC change its stance based on this? A> While insightful, this is the opinion of a former official. The current SEC leadership, under Chair Gary Gensler, has generally taken a broader view, suggesting most crypto tokens are securities. However, it adds weight to the ongoing legal and political debate. Join the Conversation Regulatory clarity is essential for the healthy growth of the crypto ecosystem.

Most analysts are expecting the Federal Reserve to cut rates, something which has increased positivity in the crypto market after a difficult couple of months. As for SHIB, it has experienced a 248% increase in its burn rate over the past 24 hours, as chain activity increases. This suggests that a recovery could be on the way, and when combined with some bullish chart patterns, the Shiba Inu price prediction is starting to look very good. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Market Thinks SHIB Is Dead – But This Chart Pattern Says a Monster Move Is Coming Soon As the Shibburn X account revealed today, Shiba Inu has burned 75.7 million SHIB tokens in the past week and 14.3 million SHIB tokens in the past 24 hours. HOURLY SHIB UPDATE $SHIB Price: $0.00000846 (1hr -0.61% ▼ | 24hr 0.42% ▲ ) Market Cap: $4,984,165,047 (0.43% ▲) Total Supply: 589,246,095,654,536 TOKENS BURNT Past 24Hrs: 14,288,659 (248.18% ▲) Past 7 Days: 75,668,582 (-35.14% ▼) — Shibburn (@shibburn) December 9, 2025 This 24-hour figure is encouraging, indicating a growth in activity as we approach tomorrow’s FOMC rate decision. And if we look at SHIB’s price chart, we see that it may have begun a sustained recovery after weeks in a heavily oversold position. Its relative strength index (yellow) is about to rise above 50, having spent the previous three months below this level almost constantly. Source: TradingView Similarly, its MACD (orange, blue) is also on its way up and could turn positive in the next few days. This could signal a breakout, and if the Fed does provide a rate cut tomorrow, such a breakout could arrive quickly. As far as the longer term is concerned, Shiba Inu does have some things to look forward to, including the possible launch of a multi-crypto ETF from T. Rowe that classes SHIB as an eligible token . Such a launch could drive considerable interest in SHIB, although so far there’s no indication of how much of an allocation the meme coin would receive, if any. Otherwise, Shiba Inu has been having a problem attracting significant investment, with its price down by 71.5% in the past 12 months. Despite attempts to make itself fundamentally stronger and more valuable (e.g., by launching layer-two network Shibarium in 2023), the market seems to have lost interest, with shibariumscan.io recording only 2,635 transactions on Shibarium in the past 24 hours. Hopefully, upcoming upgrades can make layer two more attractive next year, boosting the Shiba Inu price over the longer term. Shibarium aiming for a privacy upgrade in 2026 says something bigger than just SHIB news. It shows where the entire industry is heading: 𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗿𝘆𝗽𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘀, 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝗰𝘆 𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀.

What’s exciting about presale coins is that, if they generate enough momentum during their sales, they can often rally hard when they list for the first time. Accordingly, one of the most interesting presale tokens available right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has raised just over $2.3 million. Upgrading Nodes is like leveling up in life. Suddenly everything feels easier. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/FHs8HwglBs — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 5, 2025 Its sale will end in just under 30 days, giving newcomers only a limited window in which to buy the token at what could end up being a steep discount. It has attracted lots of interest by virtue of its unique slant on mining, with its platform giving users the opportunity to grow and operate virtual mining rigs. Rather than needing expensive – and power-hungry – physical hardware, PEPENODE enables users to mine simply by spending PEPENODE tokens on virtual nodes. By purchasing more nodes and upgrading, users can earn more mining rewards, which PEPENODE will pay out in external tokens, such as Fartcoin and Pepe. This system could make PEPENODE incredibly profitable and popular, with demand potentially surging for the PEPENODE token. Holders will also be able to stake the token for a regular income, making the coin doubly profitable. Latecomers to the sale can join it by going to the PEPENODE website , but should remember that it will end in 30 days. The token is currently selling for its final presale price of $0.0011873, although this could rise much higher once it goes live in the next few weeks.

Analysts believe this could push the Bitcoin price prediction beyond the current cycle high of $126,000.

Moreover, the Bitcoin hash ribbon indicator has now flashed green, historically signaling favorable entry points for market participants. The hash chart reveals the 30-day moving average of hashrate dropping below the 60-day MA, a pattern indicating miner capitulation that typically coincides with major price discounts and long-term accumulation opportunities. This comes as Bitcoin experienced a short squeeze that propelled the price through the $94,000 resistance level. Crypto analyst Trader Mayne notes Bitcoin is currently testing the yearly open around $93,000, with potential to extend gains toward $98,000 and subsequently $106,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction: $106K Next as MACD Flips Bullish The daily chart shows Bitcoin attempting to break free from a multi-week descending trendline after spending most of November in controlled decline. Price is now pushing above diagonal resistance with noticeably increased volume, indicating buyers are re-entering the market. The MACD has crossed bullish and is accelerating upward from deeply oversold levels, a configuration that typically precedes mid-term reversals rather than temporary bounces. Price is also reclaiming the daily pivot zone, suggesting momentum is shifting from defensive consolidation toward early recovery. Source: TradingView If this breakout holds, Bitcoin is positioned to retest major pivot levels around $98,000–$100,000, which will serve as the first significant barrier to trend reversal. A decisive close above that range would unlock movement toward $105,000–$110,000. However, failure to maintain support above the trendline would pull the price back toward the $85,000–$82,000 support band, where lower pivot levels align with the former breakdown zone. Bitcoin’s First Real Layer 2 Token $HYPER Could Skyrocket Next Bitcoin isn’t the only asset investors anticipate experiencing a supercycle in 2026 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is another project generating substantial attention as it develops the first genuine Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, utilizing Solana-based technology to deliver speed and scalability while preserving Bitcoin’s security model. Powered by a fast and scalable Solana-based Layer 2 infrastructure, the project has raised over $29M to enable developers to launch Bitcoin-native decentralized applications. This provides BTC holders with new opportunities to deploy their assets productively, using on-chain tools built specifically for the Bitcoin ecosystem. As leading wallets and exchanges integrate this scaling solution, demand for $HYPER is anticipated to go up very fast. To acquire $HYPER before the next price increase, visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your preferred wallet (such as Best Wallet).

Earlier in October, total market capitalization reached a record level of approximately $4.27 trillion. That momentum proved short-lived, as prices retreated sharply following widespread selling pressure days later. Since then, the global market has struggled to regain its earlier strength. After briefly recovering to around $3.9 trillion in mid-November, the market faced renewed resistance and reversed course once again. At present, the global crypto market stands at $3.22 trillion, reflecting a loss of more than $1 trillion from the early October peak. These developments have affected nearly all large-cap assets, including XRP. XRP’s Position Amid the Downturn XRP, currently ranked among the largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, has also experienced a substantial decline during this period. Over the past month, its market value has dropped by roughly $40 billion, leaving XRP with a market capitalization of around $137 billion. This decline has occurred alongside a broader downturn affecting the entire sector. Despite the reduction in value, XRP’s share of the total market has not decreased at the same pace. On October 6, the asset held approximately 4.28% of the market. As of now, its share stands at about 4.25%, representing only a slight change. This indicates that most major cryptocurrencies have been impacted in a similar manner, preserving their relative positions. Even with this stability in relative terms, XRP’s dominance remains below its yearly peak of 5.53%, recorded earlier in July. This suggests that the asset has experienced a gradual decline in comparative influence over the past several months, even before the most recent downturn. Evaluating a 15% Market Share Scenario Several analysts maintain that XRP could eventually regain some of its lost share, with a few expressing confidence that it could even surpass Ethereum’s current level of market dominance, which is near 11.9%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Based on this sentiment, a hypothetical scenario was examined to determine the potential valuation of XRP if the asset reached 15% dominance within the current market environment. Historically, XRP has reached far higher dominance levels. In early 2017, the asset accounted for more than 31% of the total market, though this figure corresponded to a much smaller global market size at that time. If XRP were to secure 15% of today’s $3.22 trillion market, its capitalization would rise to roughly $483 billion. With an estimated circulating supply of 60 billion units, this valuation would imply a price near $8 per token . Compared to the current price of approximately $2.27, this would reflect an increase of more than 250%. Analyst Expectations and Outlook Predictions of a potential rise to the $8 range are not new within the XRP community. Some market analysts, including Dark Defender, have proposed that the asset could reach this level based on technical wave patterns. Others, such as Cobb, expressed confidence earlier in the year that XRP has the potential to approach or reach $8 under favorable market conditions. While such projections remain speculative, the analysis illustrates how a relative gain in market dominance, even without an expansion of the global crypto market, could significantly affect XRP’s valuation.

The company will also expand its three existing regions in Chennai, Hyderabad, and Pune. Microsoft is introducing Sovereign Public Cloud and Sovereign Private Cloud solutions that are designed to give Indian organizations more control over data compliance and operational sovereignty. Microsoft 365 Copilot will allow India’s data to be processed inside the country by the end of 2025, making India one of the top four global markets to receive this option. The company now plans to equip 20 million Indians with essential AI skills by 2030, up from its earlier goal of 10 million. Through its ADVANTA(I)GE India initiative, Microsoft has already trained 5.6 million people since January 2025. Its programs have enabled more than 125,000 individuals to secure jobs or start businesses. Microsoft announced plans to integrate advanced AI capabilities into two government platforms operated by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The e-Shram and National Career Service platforms will use Azure OpenAI Service to provide multilingual access, AI-assisted job matching, and automated resume creation for more than 310 million informal workers. Microsoft employs over 22,000 people in India across cities, including Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Gurugram, and Noida. The company has operated in the country for more than three decades and continues to expand its presence to support growing demand for cloud services and AI tools. Why is India attracting massive tech investments? With approximately one billion internet users, India represents one of the largest potential customer bases for cloud services and AI applications. The nation can also boast of millions of software developers and engineers who can build and support AI infrastructure. The Indian government has introduced financial incentives aimed at attracting global chipmakers and major technology companies. Data centers are viewed as India’s best opportunity to participate in the AI boom, given that the country has limited chip manufacturing capabilities. Total data center capacity in India is expected to more than triple to about 4.5 gigawatts by 2030. In October 2025, Google announced a $15 billion investment to last over a period of five years to build an AI data center in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The AI data center is Google’s largest investment in India and one of its biggest AI infrastructure projects globally. The facility will feature gigawatt-scale data center operations and an international subsea cable gateway. Microsoft also announced plans to invest $10 billion in AI infrastructure in Portugal and $15 billion in the United Arab Emirates last month. On the same day as the India announcement, Microsoft revealed it would invest more than $5.4 billion in Canada over the next two years, expanding its Azure Local cloud offering and partnering with Canadian AI startup Cohere. Microsoft and other big U.S. cloud providers are expected to spend more than $400 billion on AI this year to build data centers needed to support services like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini.

Most major tokens have not escaped this decline, although Zcash has posted a 7% gain in the past 24 hours, while newcomer MemeCore has risen by 9%. Despite the wobble, the market could be in a prime position for an end-of-year rally, especially if the Fed does cut rates by another 0.25%. Assuming a surge in positivity, we’ve picked our best new meme coin to buy today, which is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a new Ethereum-based token that’s aiming to innovate mining. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today Under 1 Cent – 9 December PEPENODE’s presale will end in 30 days, giving latecomers a limited window of opportunity in which to buy the token early. The sale has already raised $2.3 million , a sign that, even in a bearish market, it has generated considerable interest from investors. The PepeNode countdown has begun! Fire up your virtual mining rigs and get ready to upgrade some nodes. In 30 days the Presale will end! https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/a3m07joFrH — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 8, 2025 As noted above, its unique selling point is that it takes a unique approach to mining, enabling users to mine tokens without having to invest in expensive mining equipment and facilities. It will launch a virtual mining platform in which users can build and run their own virtual rigs, complete with virtual nodes that they can buy and sell. By buying more nodes using PEPENODE tokens, users will increase their mining rewards, which they can increase even further by upgrading nodes and combining them in novel ways. Because the PEPENODE token is necessary to build mining rigs, it could attract massive demand, pushing up its price over time. Demand will also come from the fact that holders can stake the token, earning themselves a passive income in the process. In fact, PEPENODE’s staking yield currently stands at 562% APY , and while this will decline in proportion to staking volumes, it remains a hugely competitive rate. PEPENODE Launches in 30 Days: How to Buy Before Listing These tokenomics and features make PEPENODE more than just another Pepe-themed meme token, which is why it’s our best meme coin to buy at the moment. Again, its sale will end in 30 days, at which point presale buyers will receive their tokens, in time for exchange listings. While the clock is ticking, investors can still join the sale by going to the official PEPENODE website . By connecting a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet), they can buy any amount of PEPENODE, using ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat. The coin is now selling at its final presale price of $0.0011873, and judging by its early successes, it could eclipse this price once it lists. Indeed, in 30 days, crypto may have reentered a bull market, giving PEPENODE the ideal platform for strong growth.

The designation allows firms licensed by the ADGM’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) to conduct regulated activities involving USDT on Aptos, Celo, Cosmos, Kaia, Near, Polkadot, Tezos, TON, and Tron blockchain networks. Extending USDT’s Regulated Footprint The move follows what the company described as ongoing engagement with the FSRA to demonstrate the resilience, transparency, and compliance elements of its operations. The latest approval expands on earlier ADGM recognition of USDT on Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, thereby broadening the regulatory coverage of the stablecoin across a wider range of blockchain networks. According to the official press release, the combined approvals create a multi-chain framework that lets ADGM-licensed firms support more networks while operating within one of the sector’s established regulatory jurisdictions. With this decision, USDT is now recognised in ADGM on nearly all major blockchains supported by the issuer. Tether said the multi-chain approval increases interoperability and allows USDT to be used as a settlement asset for trading and decentralized applications, while meeting AFRT requirements set by the FSRA. Following the development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said “The UAE continues to set the global standard for digital asset regulation, and Tether is proud to contribute to this leadership. This milestone highlights Tether’s dedication to advancing financial inclusion and innovation on a global scale. Introducing USDT within ADGM’s regulated digital asset framework reinforces the role of stablecoins as essential components of today’s financial landscape. It also creates fresh opportunities for collaboration and growth throughout the Middle East. By extending recognition to USDT on several major blockchains, ADGM further strengthens Abu Dhabi’s position as a global hub for compliant digital finance.” In November, Tether expanded its presence in Bitcoin-backed finance through a strategic investment in Ledn, a lending platform that provides credit secured by BTC. Ledn offers products such as risk management tools, advanced custody, liquidation systems, and allows users to access loans without selling their digital assets. Tether said the investment aligns with its goal of supporting real-world credit markets and broadening access to both retail and institutional borrowers. Circle’s UAE Expansion Meanwhile, the latest approval for USDT in ADGM comes as rival stablecoin issuer Circle also strengthens its foothold in the UAE. Circle announced securing a Financial Services Permission license from the FSRA of Abu Dhabi Global Market, which will allow the company to operate as a Money Services Provider within the international financial center. Alongside the regulatory milestone, the fintech also said it has appointed Dr. Saeeda Jaffar as Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa. Dr. Jaffar, who joins from Visa where she served as Senior Vice President and Group Country Manager for the Gulf Cooperation Council, will oversee the company’s regional operations and lead efforts to advance partnerships with financial institutions and enterprises. The USDC issuer also stated that her focus will include supporting the adoption of digital dollars and on-chain payment solutions across the UAE and wider MEA markets.

The altcoin is growing in scarcity this market cycle, with adoption channels like staking, restaking, layer-2s, digital asset treasuries, and private wallets siphoning off exchange liquidity. These pipelines have created the tightest supply conditions to date. Exchanges now control just 8.7% of circulating Ethereum, the lowest share since Ethereum went live in 2015. Ethereum Exchange Supply. Source: Glassnode . Fresh exposure through U.S. TradFi products such as ETFs deepens the trend. Institutional-grade demand has driven aggressive accumulation under long-term holding strategies. With fewer tokens available, traders are watching for signs of a supply squeeze. Scarcity could trigger sharp upside volatility as demand collides with shrinking liquidity. Ethereum Price Prediction: Is ETH Ready To Surge? This scarcity could help fuel the breakout of a bullish head and shoulder pattern, now unfolding. The Ethereum price has confirmed a local bottom at $2,750 , forming higher lows in a fresh uptrend that solidifies the right shoulder. ETH USD 1-day chart, bullish head-and-shoulders pattern. Source: TradingView . Momentum indicators add validity to the trend. The RSI has made a decisive move above the 50 neutral line for the first time since the downtrend began in October, a telling sign of a bottom. The MACD follows suit, continuing to widen its lead above the signal line and demonstrating a lasting uptrend. A fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline reclaimed around $5,500 , reclaiming past all-time highs and entering new price discovery in a 60% move . But as the bull market matures, scarcity only stands to increase, compounding the effects of mainstream adoption and use cases. The move could extend 200% to $10,000 .

The TRUMP memecoin, a digital asset inspired by the 45th U.S. President, has just announced plans to launch a President Trump-themed mobile game. This bold move blends political meme culture with the fast-growing play-to-earn gaming sector, offering a total of $1 million in TRUMP tokens to participants. But what does this mean for investors and gamers alike? Let’s dive into the details of this ambitious project. What is the TRUMP Memecoin Game All About? The official announcement came via the project’s X account, revealing a mobile game built around a presidential theme. The core incentive is powerful: a massive $1 million prize pool in TRUMP tokens, distributed to users who simply join a free waitlist before the launch. This strategy aims to create immediate buzz and user acquisition. The game will operate using OpenLoot technology, a platform known for facilitating blockchain-based in-game assets and economies. This suggests the game might integrate NFTs or other tradable digital items, adding a layer of true digital ownership for players. Why is This a Big Deal for the TRUMP Memecoin? This announcement represents a significant pivot from being a pure speculative asset to having a tangible utility. Memecoins often struggle with long-term viability, but providing a fun, engaging product can foster a stronger, more active community. Here are the key potential benefits: Utility Creation: The game gives the TRUMP memecoin a purpose beyond trading, potentially increasing its intrinsic value. Mass Adoption: Mobile gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry. A fun, free-to-play game could introduce countless new users to the TRUMP token effortlessly. Community Engagement: It transforms holders from passive investors into active players and promoters of the ecosystem. However, challenges exist. The success hinges entirely on the game’s quality and fun factor. A poorly executed game could damage the token’s reputation. Furthermore, the volatile nature of memecoins means the $1 million prize’s dollar value could fluctuate wildly. How Does OpenLoot Technology Power the Experience? The choice of OpenLoot is a critical technical detail. OpenLoot provides the infrastructure for Web3 gaming, allowing for: Seamless wallet integration for players. Secure management of in-game tokens and NFTs. A marketplace for players to buy, sell, or trade their earned assets. This means players might earn unique, tradeable digital items (like themed NFTs) while playing, which they can truly own and sell. It moves beyond simple point-scoring to a player-owned economy, a core philosophy of Web3 gaming. For the TRUMP memecoin, this technology is the engine that could drive real, sustainable engagement. Should You Join the TRUMP Memecoin Game Waitlist? Joining the waitlist is a no-risk, high-reward opportunity for anyone curious about crypto gaming or the TRUMP memecoin. It’s free and positions you for potential token rewards. For crypto enthusiasts, it’s a fascinating case study in how memecoins are evolving. For gamers, it could be a gateway into the world of earning digital assets through play. The actionable insight is simple: if the theme intrigues you, sign up. It costs nothing but could provide early access and a shot at the prize pool. In conclusion, the TRUMP memecoin’s foray into mobile gaming is a daring and innovative experiment. It seeks to solve the utility problem plaguing many meme-based cryptocurrencies by building an engaging product around its brand. While its ultimate success depends on execution and market reception, it undeniably sets a new precedent. It shows that the future of memecoins may not lie in speculation alone, but in building vibrant, interactive ecosystems that reward participation. This game could be the spark that transforms the TRUMP memecoin from a cultural token into a gaming powerhouse. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need to own TRUMP memecoin to play the game? A: Based on the announcement, no. The game is free-to-play, and joining the waitlist is the primary requirement to be eligible for the $1 million prize pool. Q: What is OpenLoot? A: OpenLoot is a Web3 gaming infrastructure platform. It handles the blockchain elements of the game, like digital wallets and NFT marketplaces, making it easy for players to manage their crypto assets earned in-game. Q: When will the TRUMP memecoin game launch? A: The announcement did not specify a precise launch date, only stating the game is “slated” to come. Interested users should follow the official TRUMP X account for updates. Q: Is the $1 million prize guaranteed in US dollars? A: No. The prize is $1 million worth of TRUMP tokens. The actual dollar value will depend on the market price of the TRUMP memecoin at the time of distribution. Q: What kind of mobile game will it be? A: Specific gameplay details haven’t been revealed yet. The theme is “President Trump-themed,” but the genre (strategy, runner, simulation, etc.) remains to be announced. Q: Is this an official product endorsed by Donald Trump? A> There is no indication this is an officially licensed product.

With technical indicators also flashing buy signals, the question now is whether this consistent inflow will fuel a breakout and shift the current Solana price prediction toward new highs. Last week, $20 million flowed to Solana ETFs despite the latest decline that the token has experienced. The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) is currently the largest of these vehicles with assets under management of $660 million, followed by Grayscale’s Solana Trust ETF (GSOL), with nearly $160 million in assets. The staking rewards offered by the Solana blockchain make these vehicles quite attractive for passive investors, especially now that the token has hit an 8-month low at around $125. The odds that the downturn will continue are much lower than they were a couple of months ago. Hence, buying Solana at this level could offer both an attractive opportunity to generate passive income and capital gains if the token starts to recover after the upcoming FOMC meeting. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Needs a Bullish Breakout Above $160 to Start Recovering SOL rose near the $140 level yesterday, but the selling pressure is once again pushing the token back to the low 130s. Trading volumes remain relatively low at $4 billion, accounting for less than 6% of the asset’s circulating market cap. Historically, SOL needs trading volumes above $10 billion to get moving. Source: TradingView Thus far, SOL has found strong support at $130. However, volumes need to confirm that buying interest is picking up its pace before jumping to conclusions. Ideally, the price should break through the $160 level to reverse its downtrend and confirm a bullish outlook for the next few weeks. If that happens, the next stop will likely be $200 as SOL may commence a new uptrend as a result of this move. Top meme coins in the Solana ecosystem had their moment earlier this year, and now seems to be the time for crypto presales to shine. One of this cycle’s hidden gems could be Maxi Doge ($MAXI), a project that has raised $4 million by tapping into the same energy as Dogecoin’s early days. Maxi Doge Is Reviving Dogecoin’s Early Hype And $4 Million Says It’s Working Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has already raised $4 million by channeling the same breakout energy that fueled Dogecoin in its early days. More than just a meme coin, MAXI is creating a hub where holders can share early opportunities , trading setups, and alpha . By building a high-energy, community-driven ecosystem, MAXI is designed to thrive in the next crypto cycle. Through fun competitions like Maxi Ripped and Maxi Gains, traders will get the chance to earn rewards and bragging rights by sharing their best-yielding traders. In addition, the project plans to invest up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds in promising projects, using the returns to reinvest in Maxi Doge for marketing purposes. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, simply head to the official Maxi Doge website and link up your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ).

Since early October, the broader digital asset market has been affected by global economic uncertainty, including recent developments in Japan’s monetary policy. These conditions have contributed to XRP’s inability to maintain earlier support zones. The asset is currently trading near $2.14, which reflects a decline of roughly 30% over the past two months. November’s performance has also been weak, with the token showing additional losses that place it on course to record its third straight month of negative returns. The last time XRP experienced three consecutive monthly declines was during the aftermath of the FTX collapse in late 2022. Analyst Identifies Two Price Barriers Before Wave 3 Completion Even with the ongoing deterioration in market sentiment, several analysts note that XRP has shown resilience by remaining above the $2 mark. Among these analysts is Tara, a widely followed market observer who recently reviewed XRP’s technical structure and highlighted two major resistance areas that must be cleared before the asset can advance toward the upper boundary of its current Wave 3 formation. This is exactly what we want to see on #XRP My next target is $2.73 for Wave 3. What we're waiting for now is an impulse wave UP breaking past the 2 local resistances at $2.18 and $2.30. Once those levels break, #XRP will be able to reach W3. I have W4 and W5 measured but keep… pic.twitter.com/wdG0PQ1HOP — TARA (@PrecisionTrade3) December 8, 2025 Tara’s projection places the potential Wave 3 peak around $2.73. This figure represents an increase of approximately 32% from the present value and aligns with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level used in her analysis. The market last reached this price in early October, just before the sharp downturn that began on October 10. To move toward this projected target, Tara emphasizes that XRP must first break through its nearest resistance at $2.18, which aligns with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement zone. Clearing this point would represent the first sign of a meaningful reversal. The second critical barrier lies at $2.30 , marked by a persistent horizontal resistance line that has repeatedly halted upward attempts. Tara argues that overcoming both levels would position XRP for a potential move toward the expected Wave 3 completion. Path Beyond Wave 3 and Future Projections According to Tara, preliminary targets for Waves 4 and 5 are already outlined, although she notes that adjustments may be necessary once the Wave 3 point is confirmed. She expects these developments to shape XRP’s performance throughout 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Her analysis also flags additional resistance near $2.80, another level that has historically limited progress upward. If XRP successfully surpasses this area after completing Wave 3, the market may see an attempt at $3 for the first time since early October. While resistance areas remain central to the immediate outlook, analysts are also monitoring key support zones. Tara points to $2.07 as an essential level that needs to be held to maintain the broader upward structure. XRP briefly dipped below this level, moving to $2.06 at the time of analysis, but has not yet confirmed a deeper breakdown. Another market participant, known as “Guy on the Earth,” identifies the $2 threshold as the primary support to watch. In his view, losing this level would introduce considerably more downside risk. Conversely, he suggests that reclaiming price action above $2.20 could create favorable conditions for a more substantial recovery. XRP’s path forward hinges on how it performs around the tight cluster of support and resistance levels that now define its short-term structure. Analysts like Tara maintain that the asset still has a viable setup for completing Wave 3 , but progress depends on clearing the hurdles at $2.18 and $2.30. At the same time, holding firm above $2.07, and especially above $2, remains essential for preserving the broader upward pattern.

Even as U.S. spot XRP ETFs approach the $1 billion AUM milestone, the asset continues to trade within a narrow band, leaving market participants to question whether the prolonged consolidation is setting the stage for a larger move. The disconnect between inflows and price has become one of the week’s most notable themes. Analysts note that while institutional capital continues to accumulate, XRP’s chart remains muted, indicating heavy profit-taking following November’s rally and lingering sell-side pressure across higher timeframes. ETF Momentum Builds as XRP Price Stalls The XRP price is hovering near $2.06, slipping slightly despite consecutive days of ETF inflows. Analysts highlight that large holders likely sold into strength, offsetting the fresh demand entering through regulated products. Even so, XRP ETFs have outperformed Bitcoin ETFs in terms of relative inflow strength, indicating that institutions are positioning themselves early. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that XRP became one of the fastest-growing U.S. crypto ETFs of the year, arguing that broader access through traditional investment accounts is expanding the asset’s investor base. The market reaction remains mixed, with some traders viewing ETFs as a stabilising force, while others see them as limiting upside volatility. Regulatory and Structural Developments Add New Variables Beyond market flows, regulatory commentary added another layer of attention. Former SEC Chair Paul Atkins emphasized tokenization as a practical path forward, highlighting its benefits, including increased transparency and faster settlement. His remarks sparked debate within the XRP community, particularly among those who argue that the XRP Ledger is well-positioned for enterprise-grade tokenization systems. Meanwhile, Ripple’s recent $500 million equity round, structured with downside protection for Wall Street investors, reinforced how closely the company’s valuation is tied to its XRP holdings. Funds reportedly concluded that around 90% of Ripple’s net worth derives from its XRP treasury, underscoring the token’s central role in the firm’s long-term outlook. Technical Picture Shows Compression, Not Capitulation On the charts , XRP remains locked between the $2.07 support level and the $2.18 and $2.30 resistance levels. Analysts note weakening momentum indicators but stable underlying demand. If XRP breaks above these levels, a move toward Wave 3 targets near $2.73 becomes more likely, though failure to do so could trigger another retest of lower support. The XRP price continues to compress, supported by some of the strongest ETF inflows of the year, but constrained by steady selling and broader market caution. Whether this tension resolves upward or downward is the question traders will carry into the next week.

Twenty One Capital Moves 43,500 BTC Amid Major Losses As the token trades around $0.14, its price behavior reflects a broader phase of consolidation, characterized by tighter volatility and increasing on-chain engagement. With new real-world use cases emerging and traders watching for a breakout, DOGE’s long-term trajectory is becoming a point of renewed discussion. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Network Activity Strengthens as Dogecoin Price Holds Key Support Despite muted market reaction to Dogecoin’s 12th anniversary, activity on the network continues to rise. Daily active addresses reached over 67,000 earlier in December, marking the second-highest level in three months. This increase comes as DOGE repeatedly defended the $0.14 support, forming a tight compression range between $0.1406 and $0.1450. Short-term charts indicate multiple rebounds from the $0.14 level, accompanied by decreasing sell volume, an early sign of accumulation. Analysts identify $0.16 as the threshold that would shift DOGE from range-bound movement into a potential trend continuation. Failure to hold support, however, could expose deeper downside toward $0.081, an area highlighted by realized on-chain distribution clusters. Adoption Expands Beyond Market Narratives Recent developments show Dogecoin slowly expanding beyond its memecoin label. In Argentina, certain taxes can now be paid using DOGE, while Alternative Airlines has begun accepting the token for ticket purchases. These integrations, although still modest, indicate real-world traction that supports a longer-term use case narrative. Broader sentiment, however, remains closely tied to macroeconomic conditions. Analysts note that liquidity trends, regulatory developments, and institutional risk appetite continue to shape DOGE’s outlook. The launch of the first Dogecoin ETF in November drew little initial inflow, signaling that large investors remain cautious despite the token’s growing visibility. Long-Term Structure Points to Potential Upside From a structural standpoint, Dogecoin continues to follow a multi-year pattern that some analysts view as constructive. Long-term charts show price action moving within a large triangle formation dating back to 2021, with a cup-and-handle structure still intact on higher timeframes. Weekly RSI levels near 50 resemble conditions seen before DOGE’s 2021 rally, while MACD indicators approach bullish crossovers on both weekly and monthly charts. Forecasts place Dogecoin’s path toward $1 as a possibility later in the decade, with projections suggesting a climb toward that level by 2030. In the near term, the $0.145–$0.16 zone remains the defining barrier that could determine whether DOGE transitions into a stronger upward phase or remains confined to its current band.

This signals a crucial shift from preliminary discussions to actionable frameworks that could reshape the entire digital asset landscape. For investors and builders in the crypto space, understanding this accelerated timeline is now more important than ever. Why is the SEC Accelerating Cryptocurrency Policy Now? According to reports from The Block, Chairman Atkins stated that current regulatory efforts are merely the opening act. He emphasized that several key initiatives are in advanced preparation and will soon yield tangible results. This acceleration addresses years of industry calls for clarity and aims to bridge the gap between rapid technological innovation and existing financial regulations. The move suggests regulators now recognize the urgent need for a structured approach to digital assets. What Are the Key Pillars of the New Cryptocurrency Policy? The accelerated push will focus on three major projects designed to create a more coherent regulatory environment. Atkins highlighted these as foundational to the SEC’s strategy. Token Taxonomy: This initiative seeks to establish clear criteria to determine whether a digital token qualifies as a security. A definitive taxonomy would resolve the long-standing “Howey Test” debates that have created uncertainty for countless projects. Project Crypto: This is a dedicated effort to amend and update existing digital asset regulations. The goal is to tailor rules specifically for the unique properties of blockchain-based assets, moving beyond applying old securities laws to new technology. Innovation Exemption: Perhaps most anticipated, this would create a temporary safe harbor for cryptocurrency startups. It would allow companies to develop and test their networks without immediately facing the full burden of securities regulations, fostering responsible innovation. How Will Accelerated Policy Impact Crypto Markets? The move to fast-track cryptocurrency policy is a double-edged sword for the market. On one hand, clear rules reduce regulatory risk, which is a major barrier for institutional investment. Defined guidelines can legitimize the sector, potentially leading to increased capital inflow and more stable market growth. For developers, it means knowing the rules of the game before building, reducing the chance of costly legal battles down the line. However, acceleration also means change is coming quickly. Projects operating in gray areas may need to adapt their models rapidly. The specific details of the “token taxonomy” will be critical; a broad definition of a security could place significant compliance burdens on many existing tokens. The market’s reaction will likely hinge on the perceived fairness and practicality of the final rules. What Challenges Remain in Crypto Regulation? Despite the positive momentum, significant hurdles persist. The SEC must coordinate with other U.S. agencies like the CFTC, which views many cryptocurrencies as commodities. Achieving a unified, non-contradictory cryptocurrency policy across the government is a complex task. Furthermore, the global nature of blockchain technology means U.S. rules must be considered alongside international frameworks to avoid stifling domestic innovation. Another challenge is ensuring the rules are flexible enough to accommodate future technological advances without requiring constant revision. The SEC’s ability to balance investor protection with the permissionless ethos of crypto will be its ultimate test. A Turning Point for Digital Asset Regulation Chairman Atkins’s commitment marks a potential turning point. The shift from slow, reactive enforcement to proactive, accelerated cryptocurrency policy development is a welcome change for an industry starved for guidance. While the devil will be in the details, the stated focus on taxonomy, tailored rules, and innovation spaces provides a coherent blueprint. The coming year will be decisive, revealing whether this accelerated timeline delivers the clarity needed to unlock the next phase of crypto’s growth in the United States. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did SEC Chair Paul Atkins actually say? He stated the SEC intends to accelerate its push for cryptocurrency policy in the coming year, moving beyond preliminary work to deliver tangible results from several key initiatives. What is the “token taxonomy” project? It’s an effort to create clear criteria for determining if a digital token is a security, aiming to resolve the major legal uncertainty that has plagued the crypto industry. How will an “innovation exemption” help crypto companies? It would provide a temporary safe harbor, allowing startups to develop and test their networks without immediately facing the full scope of securities regulations, encouraging experimentation. When can we expect to see these new policies? While no exact date is given, the “accelerated” timeline and mention of initiatives being prepared suggest proposed rules could emerge within 2025. Will this affect Bitcoin and Ethereum? Policies focused on token taxonomy could impact how all digital assets are classified. However, the SEC has previously suggested Bitcoin is a commodity, and Ethereum’s status may be clarified through this process. What should crypto investors do now?

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has climbed four points to a reading of 26, officially moving the market out of ‘Extreme Fear’ and into the ‘Fear’ zone. This improvement in sentiment, while cautious, offers a revealing glimpse into the collective psychology of crypto investors. But what does this shift really mean for your portfolio? What Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Now? According to data from Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rose from 22 to 26 in a single day. This tool is a crucial barometer, measuring emotions and sentiment from a scale of 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). A move from 22 to 26 might seem small, but it represents a meaningful psychological threshold. It suggests that the pervasive panic that often leads to capitulation is receding, replaced by a more measured, though still nervous, outlook. How Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This index isn’t just a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. Understanding its components helps explain why sentiment is improving. The index analyzes six key market factors: Volatility (25%): Measures price swings. Reduced extreme volatility can calm fears. Market Volume (25%): Tracks trading activity. Sustained volume can indicate renewed interest. Social Media (15%): Gauges the buzz and conversation tone on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polls community sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Monitors Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search volume for cryptocurrency terms. The recent rise in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index indicates positive movement across several of these metrics. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This Shift? Market sentiment is a powerful, often self-fulfilling, force. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a contrarian indicator for many seasoned traders. Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have sometimes presented buying opportunities for long-term believers, while periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ have signaled potential market tops. Therefore, a move away from extreme fear can be an early sign of stabilizing conditions. However, it is vital to remember that this is not a timing tool. A reading of 26 still firmly sits in ‘Fear’ territory, suggesting caution remains the dominant emotion. Navigating the Market with a Clear Head So, how should you respond to this change in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ? First, use it as context, not a crystal ball. It confirms the market mood is thawing but is far from euphoric. Second, combine this sentiment data with fundamental analysis of the projects you believe in. Third, consider dollar-cost averaging as a strategy to navigate ongoing uncertainty without trying to predict the exact bottom. The index reminds us that emotions drive markets, and recognizing that can be your greatest advantage. In conclusion, the climb of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index from 22 to 26 is a noteworthy development. It marks a psychological shift from the depths of despair to a state of wary apprehension. For the astute observer, this transition phase highlights the importance of disciplined investing over emotional reacting. While the road ahead may still be bumpy, this subtle improvement in sentiment is a reminder that market cycles are always in motion. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 26 mean? A: A score of 26 falls into the ‘Fear’ category. It indicates that overall market sentiment has improved from ‘Extreme Fear’ but investors are still predominantly cautious and nervous about price declines. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy/sell signal? A: Not by itself. It is best used as a contrarian sentiment indicator. Extreme values (near 0 or 100) can signal potential market turning points, but it should always be combined with other technical and fundamental analysis. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, typically once per day, based on the latest available data for its component metrics. Q: Does the index only track Bitcoin? A: While it heavily weights Bitcoin-related data (like dominance and search volume), it is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market, as many altcoins move in correlation with Bitcoin. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me, which provides the daily score, historical data, and a breakdown of its components.

Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis finds herself locked in difficult negotiations with the White House over a pivotal crypto bill . The core disagreement? A potentially explosive ethics clause that could prevent government officials from trading digital assets they oversee. This impasse highlights the complex challenge of creating clear rules for a rapidly evolving industry. Why is the Crypto Bill Ethics Clause So Controversial? According to reports from CoinDesk, negotiations have reached a critical impasse. Senator Lummis is championing a strict provision within the broader crypto bill that would block senior officials from personally profiting from the cryptocurrency sector they help regulate. The goal is clear: to prevent conflicts of interest and build public trust in the regulatory process. However, the White House reportedly views this proposal with significant skepticism, creating a major roadblock. The tension stems from the clause’s potential implications. Media reports suggest the disagreement is particularly thorny because it indirectly involves figures from the previous administration, including former President Donald Trump and his associates. This historical context adds a layer of political complexity to what is already a technically challenging legislative effort. What Are the Stakes for the Cryptocurrency Market? This isn’t just political theater. The outcome of this debate over the crypto bill carries real weight for investors and companies. Clear, fair regulation is widely seen as the missing piece needed for mainstream institutional adoption of digital assets. A strong ethics clause could signal a commitment to a transparent and stable regulatory environment. Conversely, a weakened or removed clause might raise concerns about insider advantages and regulatory capture. Market Confidence: Strong ethics rules can boost long-term investor confidence in a fairly regulated U.S. crypto market. Innovation vs. Protection: Legislators must balance fostering innovation with protecting consumers from potential abuses of power. Global Leadership: The U.S. risks falling behind other jurisdictions if it cannot pass coherent crypto legislation. Can This Impasse Be Resolved? Finding common ground will require compromise from both sides. Senator Lummis may need to adjust the scope or specifics of the ethics provision. Meanwhile, the White House might need to articulate clearer safeguards it would accept to achieve its policy goals. The path forward likely involves: Redrafting the clause to address specific administrative concerns. Seeking bipartisan support to increase the bill’s negotiating power. Clearly communicating how ethics rules benefit the entire ecosystem, not just target individuals. The deadlock over this crypto bill provision is a microcosm of the larger struggle to govern Web3 technologies with Web2-era political frameworks. The core question remains: can the U.S. political system craft rules that are both effective and equitable for a decentralized future? The Bottom Line for Crypto Investors While the political process grinds on, the market watches closely. Regulatory clarity reduces uncertainty, which is often a catalyst for growth. Therefore, any progress on the comprehensive crypto bill , ethics clause included, should be viewed as a positive long-term signal. However, investors should prepare for continued volatility as these high-level debates continue to influence market sentiment. The key takeaway is that the push for definitive U.S. cryptocurrency regulation is active, complex, and fraught with political challenges that extend far beyond technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main point of disagreement in the crypto bill? The central conflict is over an ethics clause proposed by Senator Lummis that would prevent senior government officials from trading or profiting from cryptocurrencies they regulate. The White House opposes this specific provision. Why does the White House oppose the ethics clause? While not stated explicitly in reports, the skepticism likely relates to the clause’s breadth, enforceability, and its perceived connection to officials from the previous administration, making it a politically sensitive issue. How would this crypto bill affect the average investor? A passed bill with clear rules, including strong ethics standards, could lead to a more stable and trustworthy market, potentially encouraging more institutional investment and consumer protection. Has Senator Lummis proposed crypto legislation before? Yes. Senator Lummis is a leading advocate in the Senate for comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation and has previously co-sponsored the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, aiming to create a full regulatory framework for digital assets. What happens if they can’t agree on the ethics clause? The entire bill could be delayed or fail. Alternatively, the ethics provision could be removed or heavily diluted to secure enough votes for passage, which would be a significant setback for its proponents. Is this the only cryptocurrency bill being discussed in Congress? No. Several bills addressing different aspects of crypto regulation, from stablecoins to market structure, are circulating in both the House and Senate. This bill is one of the most comprehensive efforts. Found this breakdown of the Washington crypto clash helpful? The debate over regulation affects everyone in the digital asset space.

GME's U.S. sales grew 12% y/y, outperforming key competitors and demonstrating resilience despite macro headwinds and divestiture of underperforming international segments. The collectibles division surged 50% y/y to $256.1 million, driving a favorable shift in sales mix and boosting GAAP gross margins to 33.3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 7.8%, and YTD free cash flow reached $410 million, reflecting operational efficiency post-Canada exit. As we look to wrap up a very volatile 2025, I'm preparing for a downside in the stock market next year, which is encouraging me to look for more contrarian rebound investments to put in my portfolio in place of large-cap growth stocks. GameStop Corp. ( GME ) is looking increasingly appealing. Undoubtedly, GameStop's fall this year is tied to waning enthusiasm for Bitcoin (BTC-USD), into which GameStop has made a significant balance sheet/treasury investment. Yet we shouldn't let this smaller issue distract us from the real improvements in GameStop's core business as a specialty retailer, which is showing U.S. sales growth despite macro headwinds. Data by YCharts I last wrote a Buy article on GameStop in October, when the stock was trading around $23 per share. GameStop just released fresh Q3 results that showcased continued growth in the company's collectibles division, alongside substantial gains in adjusted EBITDA and operating margins amid the company's exit from unprofitable markets. I'm reiterating my Buy rating here, and think the post-earnings dip is a terrific time to buy into this stock at a modest price. Healthy sales trends and improving margins post-Canada exit Let's first address the positive signals coming from GameStop's latest earnings release . GameStop's revenue in Q3 declined -5% y/y to $821 million. GameStop Q3 results by market (GameStop Q3 earnings release) This decelerated versus 22% y/y sales growth in Q2, but we note one important factor: in May of this year, the company divested of its entire Canada segment, with an individual entrepreneur buying out all of GameStop's Canada stores and rebranding it as ""EB Games."" We note as well that alongside the Canada sale, the company in February 2025 also approved the sale of its France stores , which is driving the y/y declines in Europe. As such, the company faces a tough comp in Q3, which is its first quarter operating without the Canadian arm. And yet, we note that with the Canada segment operating at a negative -7% operating margin last quarter (its worst-performing market in terms of profitability), this sale has brought greater bottom line efficiency. Meanwhile, sales in the U.S. grew 12% y/y, which is a healthy indicator amid a more challenging macroeconomy. We note that Best Buy ( BBY ), which is one of GameStop's core rivals in gaming and electronics, reported just 2.4% U.S. comp sales growth in the same quarter (though it primarily faced headwinds from poorer-performing appliances, while entertainment sales grew double digits). Still, we find it reassuring that GameStop isn't afraid to shed off non-core, underperforming country segments and return its focus to a profitable, growing U.S. market. We note as well that the collectibles division is driving substantial growth for GameStop. Collectibles sales of $256.1 million grew 50% y/y to $256.1 million in revenue, or 31% of overall sales (inclusive of the tough prior-year comps in France and Canada). GameStop sales by product (GameStop Q3 earnings release) The shift in sales mix away from lower-margin hardware has helped GameStop boost its GAAP gross margins to 33.3% in Q3, from 29.9% in the year-ago quarter. Eliminating the burden of OPEX in Canada has also substantially helped overall profitability. As shown in the chart below, adjusted EBITDA jumped to a $64.4 million profit, or a 7.8% adjusted EBITDA margin, nine points improved from a -1.3% loss in the year-ago quarter. We note that the company's adjusted EBITDA this quarter adds back asset impairments, which represent the accounting loss from divesting the company's underperforming Canada and France segments. GameStop adjusted EBITDA (GameStop Q3 earnings release) Similarly, we note that YTD free cash flow of $410 million has returned to substantial profit, versus a -$29 million cash burn in the year-ago period: GameStop FCF (GameStop Q3 earnings release) Bitcoin losses So with these metrics—improving gross and operating margins, expanding cash flow, and double-digit U.S. sales growth despite a chillier macro environment—it's difficult to argue that GameStop's core business is thriving. That said, it's difficult to ignore the distraction that Bitcoin poses for GameStop investors, so we'll address that here. In the company's latest 10-Q filing , the company disclosed that it's holding 4,710 BTC, unchanged from the previous quarter. GameStop Bitcoin holdings (GameStop Q3 10-Q filing) The assets are marked to market each quarter, and on GameStop's latest balance sheet (shown below), these Bitcoin holdings are valued at $519.4 million, listed under its digital asset holdings. GameStop balance sheet (GameStop Q3 earnings release) This suggests that the market value for GameStop's Bitcoin holdings is around $110,270 (indeed where Bitcoin was trading at the beginning of November). Bitcoin prices have been extremely volatile over the past few weeks, and at the time of writing, BTC is hovering around $92,500. This means that there's ~$84 million of mark-to-market losses that haven't flowed through to the balance sheet yet. But in my view, focusing on these losses is a mistake. GameStop earned a roughly equivalent amount of adjusted EBITDA from operations. Moreover, Bitcoin holdings are just a small slice of GameStop's massive balance sheet, which has $8.83 billion in cash (offset against $4.16 billion in debt, which translates to $4.67 billion in net cash, or nearly ~10x the company's value of Bitcoin holdings). Valuation, risks, and key takeaways Now, we continue to remind investors that valuation is tricky for GameStop, given the moving parts on its balance sheet plus the lack of any Wall Street coverage and consensus estimates on the stock. Also, GameStop provides far less information than most companies, only issuing a press release with limited details in each quarter, without adding context via an earnings call or providing an outlook. Nevertheless, especially after the recent downside, I continue to see potential upside in the stock's multiples. At current post-earnings share prices near $22, GameStop trades at a $9.83 billion market cap. Netting off the $4.67 billion in aforementioned net cash, plus 4,710 BTC valued at current ~$92.5k market prices ($436 million in current Bitcoin value), gives us an enterprise value of $4.72 billion. Let's take Q3 - the company's first quarter excluding Canada and France - as a proxy for the company's profit potential after its reorganization and slimming down of international operations. In FY24, Q3 represented 16.3% of full-year sales (revenue grew by ~50% sequentially into Q4, the holiday quarter) across all geographies - unfortunately we can't exclude Canada or France here, since the company didn't report geo-level breakouts for each quarter last year. If similar seasonality holds throughout the next 12 months, GameStop's annual revenue would be ~$5.04 billion (down compared to $5.27 billion in FY24 and $5.93 billion in FY23, thanks to the company's elimination of markets). A 7.8% adjusted EBITDA margin against this revenue profile would imply ~$393 million in annual adjusted EBITDA. This would translate to a multiple of 12.0x EV/EBITDA. Of course, there are risks to the bull thesis here and to these projections. GameStop's sales growth right now is being held up by strong collectibles results, as well as by the recent release of the Nintendo Switch 2, which was long awaited after the initial 2017 release of the first generation of Nintendo's hit handheld console. Needless to say, trading cards are subject to fad cycles, and fervor could die down (especially as there may be a ""halo effect"" on Pokemon cards right now after the release of the new, highly anticipated Pokemon Z-A Legends title on Switch 2). Also, GameStop has had a choppy profitability history in the past, with adjusted EBITDA negative in the COVID years. We'll have to monitor closely to confirm that the company's current margin levels can be sustained. In the absence of guidance from the company or any helpful management commentary, GameStop is a bit of a wild card and a shot in the dark. That said, we like the fact that U.S. sales are growing and that balance sheet cash (plus Bitcoin holdings) represents a huge chunk of the company's outstanding market value.

Lummis made this statement while addressing the audience during the Blockchain Association Policy Summit held on Tuesday, December 9. At this time, the Senator shared that she anticipates the markup hearing for the Responsible Financial Innovation Act —the Banking Committee’s take on market structure—will occur before Congress takes a break for the holiday season. Senator Lummis hints at the finalization of the crypto market structure bill next week Following concerns raised about the delay in the bill , the senator acknowledged that it was gradually progressing, as drafts underwent several alterations every few days during talks between the two parties . For now, Lummis highlighted that her staff are worn out, referring to both Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s team and her team. Therefore, to effectively finalize a version of the bill, she suggested that it would be best to let the team work on it next week and then grant everyone a break for Christmas to recharge. “My goal is to share a draft at the end of this week that represents our best efforts so far and let the industry review it, along with Republicans and Democrats, before we go to markup next week,” the senator added. Notably, a markup hearing is a specific type of congressional event in which a congressional committee or subcommittee debates, amends, and ultimately votes on proposed legislation before it is sent to the full House or Senate for a floor vote. Although the banking committee had publicly shared the draft of the market structure bill in July this year, sources close to the situation mentioned that progress lagged following the approval of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act by the US House of Representatives. These sources attempted to explain that the delay took place due to the longest government shutdown that occurred in the United States, and some lawmakers’ opposition to specific DeFi parts of the bill. Several individuals anticipate that the crypto market structure bill will be beneficial to the market A report from a reliable source, dated Monday, December 8, indicated that bipartisan talks regarding market structure are progressing, with plans for a markup scheduled to take place in December this year. This report aligns with Lummis’s September remarks, in which she predicted that the bill would be implemented as law in 2026. However, even with this announcement, analysts raised concerns about whether the Republicans will abide by this timeline. They also highlighted that even if senators decided to move forward with a markup, issues such as political disagreements could possibly delay the bill’s voting process. To fully become a law, sources familiar with the situation mentioned that the bill still needs to go through both the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Senate Banking Committee. Nonetheless, several individuals in the crypto industry back Congress’s move to push this legislation forward. According to them, this legislation would promote clarity and benefit the market. “More finance will shift on-chain under [SEC Chair Paul Atkins]’s leadership once Congress passes a market structure law,” stated Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal , on Wednesday, December 10. “Our leaders must agree on the final details of the bill without any delays.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-10 00:45:08

Those sorts of things would not fall, as we would define it, into the definition of a security.” Paul Atkins, a longtime advocate of lighter-touch financial regulation, has become one of the most market-friendly SEC chairs in recent years. His stance carries weight because previous SEC leadership took the opposite view, arguing that virtually all ICOs were securities. Atkins’ comments, therefore, signal a notable ideological shift at the top of the agency, one that could influence rulemaking debates across Washington and ongoing enforcement strategies. Atkins signals major shift in SEC’s crypto approach Atkins was pointing to a token taxonomy he established last month, in which he categorized the crypto industry into four general token types. Among the four categories, Atkins argued last month that three—network tokens, digital collectibles, and digital tools—should not be considered securities in and of themselves. On Tuesday, Atkins stated that ICOs involving those three token categories should likewise be treated as non‑security transactions and, as such, would fall outside SEC regulation. The only category of token the SEC chair said his agency should regulate, when it comes to ICOs, are tokenized securities—representations of securities already regulated by the SEC that trade on-chain. “ICOs transcend all four topics,” Atkins said. “Three of those areas are on the CFTC side, so we’ll let them worry about that, and we’ll focus on tokenized securities.” The development could mark a significant boon for companies seeking to raise capital by creating and selling tokens to investors and the public. Most ICOs could escape SEC oversight under new taxonomy ICOs were all the rage during the crypto boom of 2017—until the SEC, during President Donald Trump’s first term in office, poured cold water on the lucrative fundraising mechanism by suing numerous ICO issuers because they were selling illegally unregistered securities Atkins’ remarks on Tuesday imply the trend could regain popularity, with or without a crypto market structure bill . Under the SEC chair’s proposed taxonomy, the majority of crypto tokens would fall outside the agency’s regulatory scope. Instead, they would likely be overseen by the more lenient CFTC, along with numerous similarly structured ICOs, according to Atkins. Atkins’ strategy also recasts the old fight between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over jurisdiction. Because most tokens fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, an agency with a lighter enforcement footprint, the proposal may further weaken the SEC’s central role in crypto regulation. Some legal experts argue that the move reflects broader congressional efforts to empower the CFTC to lead the charge in regulating digital commodities within a regulatory environment more akin to how cryptocurrencies are being regulated in the UK and certain parts of Asia. Tokens that Atkins has indicated should not be classified as securities include those connected to decentralized blockchain networks, tokens tied to “internet memes, characters, current events, or trends,” and tokens that serve a practical purpose, such as tickets or memberships. Tokens that are associated with decentralized networks, internet culture, or practical utilities — say, tickets or memberships — could, therefore, be eligible for ICOs. Atkins noted in July that the SEC’s “Project Crypto” initiative could also support ICO activity through exemptions and safe harbors.

The cryptocurrency market just received a sobering signal. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index has fallen to 18, dropping another point and moving further away from the critical threshold that defines an altcoin season. For investors watching market cycles, this number tells a compelling story about where capital is flowing right now. Let’s decode what this shift means for your portfolio. What is the Altcoin Season Index Telling Us? The Altcoin Season Index serves as the market’s pulse check. It currently sits at a mere 18, a clear indicator that Bitcoin is commanding the stage. This index is calculated by comparing the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) against Bitcoin itself. A reading above 75 signals an altcoin season, where most altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Therefore, a score of 18 is a stark contrast, highlighting strong Bitcoin dominance. Why is Bitcoin Dominating the Market? Several factors are converging to fuel Bitcoin’s strength while the Altcoin Season Index languishes. First, macroeconomic uncertainty often drives investors toward perceived safe-haven assets within crypto, with Bitcoin being the primary beneficiary. Second, major institutional products like Spot Bitcoin ETFs are funneling significant capital directly into Bitcoin, not the broader altcoin market. Finally, the market cycle theory suggests periods of Bitcoin leadership typically precede altcoin rallies, making this a phase of accumulation and patience for altcoin investors. Key Implications for Crypto Investors Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for making informed decisions. Here are the immediate takeaways: Risk Appetite is Low: A low index suggests a risk-off environment where capital retreats to the largest, most established asset. Timing Your Entry: For altcoin buyers, this period can be an opportunity to research and identify strong projects at relatively lower prices before a potential season shift. Portfolio Rebalancing: It may be a prudent time to review your allocation between Bitcoin and altcoins based on your risk tolerance. Historically, the index doesn’t stay at extreme lows forever. However, predicting the exact turn is challenging. The current trend emphasizes that we are firmly in a Bitcoin season. When Could the Altcoin Season Return? While the Altcoin Season Index is low, it’s not a permanent state. Market cycles rotate. A return to altcoin season typically requires a sustained period of Bitcoin stability or consolidation, allowing investor confidence and capital to trickle down into smaller-cap projects. Key triggers to watch include: Bitcoin establishing a strong, steady price floor. Increased development activity and positive news flow from major altcoin ecosystems. A general improvement in global liquidity and risk sentiment. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index weekly can provide an early, data-driven hint of this sentiment change. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Crypto Winter for Altcoins The Altcoin Season Index at 18 is a clear, quantitative message: patience is essential. Bitcoin is in the driver’s seat. For the savvy investor, this isn’t a time for fear, but for strategic preparation. Use this phase to conduct thorough research, build watchlists, and plan your strategy for when the market dynamics eventually shift. Remember, the most successful investors understand cycles, not just prices. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does an Altcoin Season Index of 18 mean? An index value of 18 means only a small percentage (far less than 75%) of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days, indicating strong Bitcoin dominance and a ‘Bitcoin season’. How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a near real-time gauge of market performance trends between Bitcoin and altcoins. Should I sell my altcoins when the index is this low? Not necessarily. A low index indicates a market phase, not a verdict on every project. It’s a signal to reassess your portfolio’s risk and potentially rebalance, but panic selling is rarely a good strategy. Can the index predict future prices? No, it is a lagging indicator based on past 90-day performance. It describes the current market structure but does not forecast future price movements of individual assets. What is a good Altcoin Season Index score for buying altcoins? There’s no perfect score. However, a rising trend above 50 can signal increasing altcoin strength. Some investors use a crossing above 75 as a confirmation signal for altcoin season. Where can I check the Altcoin Season Index? The index is publicly available on CoinMarketCap’s website under their market data or research sections. Found this breakdown of the Altcoin Season Index helpful?

With its current pricing at $0.035 and having registered a 250% increase in its presale fueled by overwhelming public interest, this project is gaining life at a rate unprecedented for any other fresh crypto presales today. Also the project has more than 18,400 participants and more than $19.25 million has been raised so far. Perhaps more remarkable than its presale performances is the DeFi-based platform for lending and borrowing being created by this project that offers much more than anyone can wish for today. The impending testnet on Sepolia for V1 is one such important milestone towards realizing this reality for all participants. For any investment that offers so much from today and for the coming future, Mutuum Finance is a DeFi crypto offering real utility and the best cheap crypto to buy now. Phase 6 Of MUTM Presale Approaches Sell-Out as Investor Demand Runs Hot Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently gaining substantial momentum as its presale continues to sell at Phase 6. Initially launched in Q1 2025 with a token price of $0.01 per token, the current presale stage at Phase 6 sees the token sold at $0.035 per token, a whopping rise of 250% prior to being listed on the exchange. With well over 95% of Phase 6 sold out, just a few tokens at $0.035 are left. Phase 7 kicks in with a steep rise in the token price by 20% to $0.04, nearing the estimated launch price of $0.06. So far, the presale has managed to raise over $19.25 million from more than 18,400 participants. From a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, no less than 45.5% (1.82 billion tokens) has been allocated for presale alone. It is increasingly clear that Mutuum Finance is the best cheap crypto to buy now for investors seeking early-stage exposure. Enhanced Risk Management and Platform Security Mutuum Finance is integrating advanced risk management features within its protocol. The LTV ratios and liquidation levels are adjusted depending on the volatility levels of the assets; assets that are less volatile can be given higher LTV ratios than assets that are highly volatile. Reserve multipliers vary from 10% for less risky assets to 35% for highly risky assets. In relation to the above-mentioned aspects for timely and trusted pricing information, Mutuum Finance utilizes the services of the Chainlink oracle referencing token prices with highly traded coins such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback and aggregation oracle services and various in-chain feeds are utilized uniformly for obtaining real-time and accurate pricing information. These services essentially constitute the framework for the pricing and risk formulation and liquidation process for the protocol and therefore make the protocol run efficiently and be stable under varying circumstances within the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing incredible momentum for such a young project with more than 18,400 investors joining and $19.25 million raised during the presale. Phase 6 is almost sold out at $0.035 per token, while Phase 7 is set to increase the token price by 20% to $0.04 with a limited time window for entry. Scarcity, usability, and community support make MUTM the best cheap crypto to buy now and a leading DeFi crypto for investors seeking growth potential.

With ETF inflows slowing down, the price lacks the momentum to break through overhead resistance. The highly anticipated FOMC meeting is expected to provide the necessary catalyst to end the current consolidation and dictate Bitcoin’s next major directional move. BTC Compression Intensifies: Scaling Back Intraday Scalps According to a recent update from Lennaert Snyder, Bitcoin continues to tighten within a compression phase. The market has been trading in an increasingly narrow range, signaling that a larger move is approaching. Snyder noted that the scalp long and short setups from his previous analysis played out well. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Shows Shocking Similarities To 2012-2015, But What Happened Last Time? He explained that as compression increases, the reward-to-risk ratio naturally declines. While the trades were profitable, they still fell into the category of “C-setups,” meaning they lacked the cleaner momentum and clarity found at range boundaries. Snyder emphasized that the best trading opportunities always emerge at the edges of a range. With the current setup, his focus remains on the key resistance area around $94,000. A breakout above that level could offer long opportunities, while a failure there may open the door for shorts. On the downside, if price sweeps the lows and returns to the $87,400 support region, long entries are likely following signs of reversal. However, he added that if Bitcoin fails to show strength during this phase, he is not eager to take new long positions. A deeper retest of the $83,200 zone could become the next area of interest, though he expects any move toward that level to come with a liquidity sweep. Snyder also mentioned that he remains in shorts as a hedge, with scalp shorts still acceptable for traders who understand the increased risk at this stage. He concluded by highlighting the importance of the upcoming FOMC meeting, noting that the market is likely to stay muted until then. Upcoming FOMC Meeting Dictates Bitcoin’s Next Major Move Analyst Ted, in a recent update, revealed that BTC is currently in a state of consolidation around the $90,000 level. This tight range-bound movement suggests that while selling pressure is not dominant, buyers are also struggling to push the price higher aggressively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Records 21% Crash In November Trading Volume – What This Means For Price Ted attributed the market’s current stagnation and its inability to break above major resistance levels to a slowdown in institutional investment. Specifically, he noted that recent ETF inflows have slowed down, removing a major source of directional buying pressure that typically drives breakouts. Furthermore, the analyst highlighted that a critical macroeconomic event is pending: the FOMC meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, and the market’s next significant directional move will be heavily dependent on the outcome.

Even more impressive, they plan to push this ratio above 99%. This isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a fortress-like commitment to protecting billions in digital wealth. For any crypto investor, understanding this shift is crucial for evaluating where to trust your assets. What Are Cold Wallets and Why Is Upbit’s 98% Ratio a Game-Changer? First, let’s break it down simply. A cold wallet is a method of storing cryptocurrency completely offline, disconnected from the internet. Think of it as a digital safe deposit box. In contrast, a ‘hot wallet’ is connected online for daily transactions but is more vulnerable to hackers. Upbit’s operator, Dunamu, reported that as of October’s end, over 98% of assets were in this ultra-secure, offline state. This ratio is exceptionally high, demonstrating a security-first philosophy that prioritizes asset protection over convenience. How Does Moving to 99% Cold Storage Make Upbit Safer? Upbit’s goal to reduce hot wallet assets to under 1% is a strategic masterstroke for risk management. Here’s what this ambitious target means for security: Dramatically Reduced Attack Surface: Hackers can only target what’s online. By keeping 99%+ offline, the amount of ‘stealable’ assets at any moment becomes minuscule. Enhanced User Confidence: This transparent metric acts as a powerful trust signal, showing users the exchange values security above all else. Industry Leadership: This move pressures other exchanges to follow suit, potentially raising security standards across the entire crypto landscape. Therefore, this isn’t just an internal policy update; it’s a public declaration of their security posture that benefits the entire ecosystem. What Are the Real-World Benefits for Crypto Investors? For the everyday trader or long-term holder, Upbit’s cold wallet strategy translates to tangible peace of mind. Major exchange hacks have historically resulted in catastrophic losses. By architecting their systems to hold virtually all assets in cold wallets , Upbit makes a successful large-scale breach nearly impossible. Your Bitcoin or Ethereum isn’t sitting in a server waiting to be plundered; it’s in deep freeze, accessible only through stringent, multi-layered internal controls. This operational model directly protects your investment. Could There Be Any Challenges with This Approach? While the security benefits are monumental, a near-total reliance on cold wallets introduces a different set of considerations. The primary trade-off is liquidity speed. Moving assets out of cold storage for withdrawals requires a manual or semi-manual process, which can be slower than purely automated hot wallet systems. However, for most users, a slight delay for vastly superior security is a welcome compromise. Upbit’s challenge is to streamline this process without compromising the integrity of their cold wallet vaults. Conclusion: A New Benchmark for Exchange Security Upbit’s plan to hold over 99% of assets in cold wallets is more than a technical goal; it’s a foundational shift in how crypto exchanges manage risk. It prioritizes unbreakable security over marginal convenience, setting a formidable benchmark that others will be measured against. For investors, it provides a clear, quantitative metric—the cold storage ratio—to assess an exchange’s commitment to safeguarding your funds. In the volatile world of crypto, this kind of proactive, transparent security is the ultimate asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a cold wallet in cryptocurrency? A cold wallet is a method of storing cryptocurrency private keys completely offline, making them inaccessible to online hackers. Common forms include hardware wallets (like USB devices) or paper wallets. Why is Upbit’s 98% cold wallet ratio significant? It is one of the highest publicly disclosed cold storage ratios for a major exchange. It indicates an extreme commitment to security, as it drastically limits the amount of assets vulnerable to an online attack at any given time. Does using cold wallets slow down withdrawals? It can introduce a slight processing delay, as moving assets from cold storage often requires manual security checks. However, this trade-off is widely accepted for the massive increase in fund security it provides. Are my funds completely safe if an exchange uses cold wallets? While cold storage greatly reduces the risk of a remote hack, no system is 100% foolproof. Security also depends on the exchange’s internal controls, employee practices, and insurance policies. Cold storage is a critical, best-practice layer of defense. How can I check an exchange’s cold wallet policy? Look for transparency reports or proof-of-reserves audits published by the exchange. Reputable platforms will openly communicate their storage practices and security protocols. What’s the difference between cold storage and a custodial wallet? Custodial wallet means the exchange holds your private keys for you (as Upbit does). Cold storage is the *method* (offline) they use to secure those keys. Upbit uses cold storage for its custodial wallets. Found this deep dive into crypto exchange security valuable?

In a move that has sent ripples through the crypto community, Ethena Labs has executed a colossal withdrawal of its native token. The firm pulled a jaw-dropping 1.59 billion ENA tokens, worth approximately $440 million, from Coinbase Prime. This single transaction, reported by Onchain Lens, highlights a pivotal moment for the project and raises critical questions for every investor watching the ENA token. What does this massive shift in assets mean for the market, and what signals is Ethena Labs sending? Why Did Ethena Labs Withdraw $440M in ENA? The sheer scale of this transaction demands attention. When a project like Ethena Labs withdraws such a significant portion of its token supply from a major custodian like Coinbase Prime, it’s rarely a routine event. This action typically points towards a strategic shift. The primary reasons could include preparing for a new phase of distribution, moving tokens to secure dedicated treasury wallets, or facilitating upcoming protocol integrations. Therefore, this move is a strong indicator of active, large-scale planning behind the scenes for the ENA ecosystem. Understanding the Immediate Impact on the ENA Token So, what happens when $440 million worth of tokens suddenly leave an exchange? The immediate mechanical effect is a reduction in the readily available supply of ENA on Coinbase Prime. This can influence market dynamics in a few key ways: Supply Shock Potential: A large withdrawal reduces sell-side pressure, which can, in theory, support the token’s price if demand remains steady or increases. Investor Sentiment: Such a confident move by the founding team can be interpreted as a long-term commitment, potentially boosting investor confidence in the ENA token. Market Speculation: The crypto market thrives on speculation. This event will undoubtedly lead to theories about upcoming announcements, partnerships, or staking rewards related to Ethena Labs. Decoding the Signal: What This Means for ENA Holders For current and prospective ENA holders, this isn’t just an on-chain footnote; it’s a communication. Major token movements by a core team are a form of signaling. By withdrawing this capital, Ethena Labs demonstrates operational control and a clear roadmap that requires direct access to these funds. It suggests the tokens are earmarked for specific, value-driving initiatives rather than being held in a general exchange account. Consequently, holders should watch for official communications from Ethena Labs regarding the use of these funds, as it will directly impact the token’s utility and value proposition. The Bigger Picture: Staking, Governance, and Ecosystem Growth This monumental withdrawal likely ties into the broader growth strategy for the Ethena ecosystem. The ENA token is central to several functions: Protocol Governance: Token holders can vote on key proposals shaping the project’s future. Staking Rewards: ENA can be staked to earn rewards, incentivizing long-term holding. Ecosystem Incentives: Tokens are often used to reward users, developers, and liquidity providers. Moving $440 million likely prepares Ethena Labs to aggressively fuel these areas, driving adoption and locking in value. This proactive management is a positive sign for the project’s health and ambition. Conclusion: A Strategic Pivot for Ethena Labs and ENA The withdrawal of $440 million in ENA from Coinbase Prime is far more than a large transaction. It is a strategic declaration from Ethena Labs. This move indicates preparation for significant ecosystem development, reduces immediate market liquidity, and reinforces the team’s long-term vision for the ENA token. For the astute observer, it underscores the importance of monitoring foundational actions, not just market prices, to understand a project’s trajectory. As the dust settles, all eyes will be on Ethena Labs to reveal the next chapter this capital is meant to write. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Ethena Labs withdrawing ENA mean they are selling it? A: Not necessarily. A withdrawal from an exchange custodian like Coinbase Prime typically means moving tokens to a private, controlled wallet. This is often for treasury management, staking, or ecosystem development, not an immediate sale. Q: How could this affect the price of the ENA token? A: By reducing the supply readily available on the market, it could decrease selling pressure. This often leads to bullish sentiment, but the ultimate price impact depends on broader market conditions and future announcements from Ethena Labs. Q: What is Coinbase Prime? A: Coinbase Prime is a specialized custodial and trading platform offered by Coinbase, designed for institutional investors and large-scale crypto transactions, offering enhanced security and services. Q: Should I buy ENA after this news? A: This news indicates active project development, which is a positive fundamental signal. However, investment decisions should be based on your own research, risk tolerance, and understanding of the Ethena Labs project, not on a single event. Q: Where can I track transactions like this? A: On-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens) allow anyone to view large wallet movements. News aggregators and crypto analytics firms often report on major transactions. Q: What is Onchain Lens? A: Onchain Lens refers to analytics platforms or observers that monitor and report significant blockchain transactions and activities, providing real-time insights into whale movements and project actions.

CEO Michael Intrator’s recent defense of so-called ‘circular deals’ reveals a company charting its own path through turbulent markets. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts watching this space, Coreweave’s journey from crypto-miner to AI infrastructure powerhouse offers crucial insights into how compute resources are becoming the new digital gold. Coreweave’s Rocky Road to Public Markets Coreweave’s March IPO arrived with tremendous anticipation but faced immediate headwinds. The company debuted at $40 per share amidst economic uncertainty, including impending tariffs that created what Intrator called “one of the most challenging environments.” Despite these obstacles, the CEO maintains pride in what the company accomplished, framing the IPO as successful given the circumstances. The stock’s journey since March has been anything but smooth: Peaked above $150 within eight months of trading Currently rests around $90 per share Experienced an 8% drop after recent debt announcement Faced comparisons to meme stocks due to volatility Michael Intrator’s Vision for Disruptive AI Infrastructure Coreweave’s CEO doesn’t shy away from the company’s unconventional approach. “When you introduce a new model, when you introduce a new way of doing business, when you disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” Intrator stated during Fortune’s AI Brainstorm summit. This philosophy extends to their financial strategy, where the company borrows against its valuable collection of Nvidia GPUs to finance operations—a move that has drawn both criticism and admiration. The company’s transformation from crypto-miner to AI infrastructure provider represents one of the most significant pivots in recent tech history. Today, Coreweave provides critical GPU resources to major players including: Partner Relationship Type Microsoft Cloud Partnership OpenAI Infrastructure Provider Nvidia Supplier & Investor Meta Infrastructure Customer The Controversy Around AI Circular Deals Perhaps the most revealing moment came when Intrator addressed criticism of “circular” business deals within the AI industry. These arrangements, where a small group of powerful AI companies invest in one another, have raised questions about market concentration and long-term stability. Intrator’s response was unequivocal: “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand. You do that by working together.” This defense carries particular weight given Coreweave’s relationship with Nvidia—both as a supplier of GPUs and as an investor in Coreweave. The CEO’s framing of these deals as necessary collaboration rather than problematic circularity offers a window into how AI infrastructure leaders view the current market dynamics. Coreweave’s Aggressive Expansion Strategy Despite stock market turbulence, Coreweave has pursued an ambitious acquisition and expansion strategy: March: Acquired Weights and Balances, an AI developer platform Recent: Acquired OpenPipe for AI agent deployment October: Added Marimo and Monolith to their portfolio Future: Plans to enter federal market with government cloud services The company also recently expanded its cloud partnership with OpenAI, signaling continued strength in core relationships despite external skepticism. Challenges in Cloud Computing Innovation Coreweave’s journey highlights broader challenges in cloud computing innovation. The company’s substantial debt load—and recent decision to issue more debt for data center expansion—has contributed to stock volatility. Yet Intrator sees this as part of pioneering a “new business model” for how cloud infrastructure can be built and operated. The failed acquisition of Core Scientific in October, due to shareholder skepticism, represents another setback. However, it also demonstrates Coreweave’s ambition to vertically integrate and control more of its infrastructure stack. FAQs: Understanding Coreweave’s Position What is Coreweave’s relationship with Nvidia? Coreweave relies on Nvidia GPUs for its AI infrastructure services, and Nvidia is also an investor in Coreweave. This dual relationship has drawn attention to potential conflicts in circular deals. Who is Michael Intrator? Michael Intrator is the co-founder and CEO of Coreweave. He has led the company’s transformation from crypto-mining to AI infrastructure provision. Which major tech companies use Coreweave’s services? Coreweave provides infrastructure to several tech giants including Microsoft , OpenAI , and Meta . These partnerships form the core of their business model. What happened with the Core Scientific acquisition? Coreweave’s planned acquisition of Core Scientific faltered in October due to skepticism from the target company’s shareholders about the deal terms and valuation. How has Coreweave’s stock performed since IPO? The stock debuted at $40 in March, climbed above $150, but currently trades around $90. This volatility has led some critics to compare it to meme stocks. Conclusion: A Company Defining Its Own Path Coreweave’s story is one of bold transformation and unwavering conviction. From crypto-mining origins to AI infrastructure leadership, the company has consistently defied expectations. Michael Intrator’s defense of circular deals as necessary collaboration rather than problematic entanglement reflects a company comfortable with controversy as it builds what it believes is a new paradigm for cloud computing. For observers of both cryptocurrency and AI markets, Coreweave offers a compelling case study in how compute resources are being reimagined and repurposed for the AI era. The company’s willingness to take on substantial debt, pursue aggressive acquisitions, and defend unconventional business practices suggests they’re playing a long game—one where temporary stock volatility matters less than securing position in what may become the defining infrastructure layer of the AI revolution.

This strategic play isn’t just another headline; it’s a powerful signal of conviction from within the traditional finance world, aiming to funnel half a billion dollars directly into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Let’s break down what this Strive $500 million Bitcoin purchase means for the market and for investors like you. What Is Strive Planning with Its $500 Million Raise? Strive is not a newcomer to cryptocurrency. The firm already holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet, demonstrating an early belief in its value. Now, it’s doubling down. The company plans to issue Series A perpetual preferred stock to raise a staggering $500 million. A significant portion of these fresh funds is explicitly earmarked for acquiring additional BTC. This structure is crucial. By using preferred stock, Strive is appealing to investors who want exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated, traditional finance vehicle, rather than dealing with private keys and crypto exchanges themselves. It’s a bridge between Wall Street and the blockchain. Why Is This Strive Bitcoin Move So Significant? This announcement matters for several key reasons. First, it represents a massive, direct capital inflow. A $500 million Bitcoin purchase from a single institution can have a tangible impact on market liquidity and price discovery, especially when such buys are executed over time. Second, it reflects a maturing narrative. Institutions are no longer just “exploring” Bitcoin; they are actively deploying capital to accumulate it as a core strategic asset. Strive’s move follows a growing trend of public companies and funds using their balance sheets to gain exposure. Institutional Validation: A Nasdaq-listed firm making this commitment adds legitimacy and reduces perceived risk for other traditional investors. Long-Term Focus: The use of “perpetual” preferred stock suggests a long-term holding strategy, not short-term speculation. Market Confidence: This scale of investment indicates strong internal confidence in Bitcoin’s future value proposition. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Investors? For everyday crypto enthusiasts and investors, Strive’s $500 million Bitcoin strategy is a bullish indicator worth noting. It suggests that sophisticated asset managers see current prices as an attractive entry point for substantial, long-term allocations. This kind of demand can create a firmer price floor and reduce volatility over time. However, it’s also a reminder of the changing landscape. As large institutions like Strive become major holders, their actions will increasingly influence market cycles. Retail investors should pay attention to these flows. The Strive $500 million Bitcoin purchase is a data point in a larger story of adoption, where digital assets are being woven into the fabric of global finance. Conclusion: A Vote of Confidence in Bitcoin’s Future Strive Asset Management’s pursuit of $500 million to buy Bitcoin is more than a fundraising round; it’s a declarative statement. It signals that for forward-thinking institutions, Bitcoin has transitioned from a speculative experiment to a legitimate, strategic reserve asset. This move will likely encourage other firms to follow suit, further cementing Bitcoin’s role in diversified portfolios. While markets will always fluctuate, commitments of this magnitude highlight a fundamental and growing belief in the enduring value of decentralized digital scarcity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Strive Asset Management? Strive is an asset management firm listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It is known for its focus on merit-based capitalism and, increasingly, for its investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. How is Strive raising $500 million? The firm is conducting an offering of Series A perpetual preferred stock. This is a type of equity share that often pays dividends and has no maturity date, appealing to long-term investors. Will all $500 million be used to buy Bitcoin? No. The official announcement states that a “portion of the proceeds” will be used for additional BTC purchases. The exact percentage or amount has not been publicly specified. Why does this matter for the price of Bitcoin? Large, institutional purchases increase demand and can reduce the available supply of Bitcoin on exchanges. This sustained buying pressure from credible entities is generally viewed as a positive, long-term fundamental for the asset’s price. Can individual investors participate in this offering? Typically, preferred stock offerings like this are targeted at institutional and accredited investors. However, individuals can gain similar exposure by investing in Strive’s public shares or, of course, by buying Bitcoin directly. Does Strive hold other cryptocurrencies? While the firm’s public focus has been prominently on Bitcoin (BTC), its broader investment strategy regarding other digital assets is not fully detailed in this specific announcement.

This Bitcoin OG has added a staggering $50 million to an existing leveraged ETH long position , signaling powerful conviction in the second-largest cryptocurrency. Let’s dive into the on-chain data to unpack this bold strategy and its potential implications. What Does This Massive Leveraged ETH Long Position Entail? According to data from on-chain analyst Onchain-Lenz, the investor known by the address “1011short” deposited 50 million USDC into the perpetual futures exchange Hyperliquid. This fresh capital was used to expand an existing five-times leveraged bet that Ethereum’s price will rise. Therefore, for every dollar of their own capital, they control five dollars worth of ETH. The total position is now colossal, valued at approximately 80,985 ETH. Here are the key details of this high-profile trade: Entry Price: $3,108 per ETH Current Liquidation Price: $1,653 Unrealized Profit: Approximately $16.9 million This data reveals a trader who entered the market at a specific level and is currently sitting on significant paper gains. However, the liquidation price shows the fine line they are walking; a sharp drop to $1,653 would wipe out the entire position. Why Would a Bitcoin OG Make Such a Bold Ethereum Bet? This action raises a fascinating question: why would a seasoned Bitcoin holder, often called an “OG,” place such a massive, leveraged bet on Ethereum? Firstly, it demonstrates a sophisticated, multi-asset strategy. True crypto veterans often understand the value and technological narratives across different blockchains. Secondly, a leveraged ETH long position of this magnitude is a clear statement of bullish medium to long-term sentiment. The trader is not just buying ETH; they are amplifying their exposure, betting that the current price is a strong foundation for future growth. Moreover, using a decentralized perpetual futures platform like Hyperliquid highlights a preference for the transparency and self-custody features of DeFi protocols over traditional, centralized exchanges. This aligns with the core ethos of many early crypto adopters. What Are the Risks and Rewards of Leveraged Trading? While the current $16.9 million profit is impressive, this trade is a textbook example of high-risk, high-reward. Leverage magnifies both gains and losses. The trader’s leveraged ETH long position is highly sensitive to market volatility. A sudden market downturn could trigger a cascade of liquidations, potentially pushing the price toward that critical $1,653 level. Conversely, if Ethereum’s price continues to climb, the profits on this position could become astronomical. For everyday investors, this serves as a crucial lesson: Leverage is a double-edged sword. It can create wealth rapidly but can destroy it just as fast. On-chain data is powerful. Watching large wallets (“whales”) can provide insights into market sentiment. Never risk more than you can afford to lose, especially with leveraged products. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? The confidence displayed by this Bitcoin OG is a significant sentiment indicator. When large, experienced capital makes a definitive move, it often draws attention and can influence market psychology. This massive leveraged ETH long position adds to the narrative of institutional and sophisticated investor interest in Ethereum, particularly around its ongoing ecosystem development and potential regulatory clarity for spot ETFs. However, it is vital to remember that this is a single trade. While noteworthy, it should not be the sole basis for any investment decision. The market is influenced by countless factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and technological advancements. Conclusion: A High-Stakes Vote of Confidence In summary, the decision by a Bitcoin OG to pour an additional $50 million into a leveraged ETH long position is a dramatic display of conviction in Ethereum’s trajectory. It underscores the evolving strategies of crypto’s earliest investors and highlights the advanced financial instruments now available on-chain. For observers, it provides a real-time case study in risk management, market sentiment, and the potent—and perilous—mechanics of leverage. As always in crypto, only time will tell if this bold bet pays off. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “leveraged long position”? A: A leveraged long position is a trade where an investor uses borrowed funds (leverage) to amplify their buying power, betting that the price of an asset will increase. It magnifies potential profits but also significantly increases the risk of loss. Q2: Who is a “Bitcoin OG”? A: “Bitcoin OG” (Original Gangster) is a term of respect in the crypto community for individuals who have been involved with Bitcoin since its early days, often implying significant experience, insight, and sometimes holdings. Q3: What is a liquidation price? A: The liquidation price is the market price at which a leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange or protocol because the trader’s collateral can no longer cover potential losses. It is the point of total loss for the initial margin. Q4: Is following whale trades like this a good investment strategy? A: While monitoring large trades can offer valuable sentiment clues, it is not a standalone strategy. Whales have different risk profiles and capital access. Always conduct your own research and never invest based solely on the actions of others. Q5: What is Hyperliquid? A: Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual futures exchange that allows users to trade leveraged positions directly from their self-custodied wallets, offering a non-custodial alternative to centralized exchanges. Q6: What’s the difference between unrealized and realized profit? A: Unrealized profit (or “paper profit”) is the current profit on an open position that has not yet been closed. Realized profit is the actual profit captured after closing the position and settling the trade. Join the Conversation Do you think this Bitcoin OG’s massive bet on Ethereum will pay off?

Aave Labs, the core development team behind the leading decentralized lending protocol, has just put forward a governance proposal that could redefine efficiency. The plan? To launch the sophisticated Aave V3 on the nascent MegaETH network. This isn’t just another deployment; it’s a strategic bet on a future where DeFi is faster, cheaper, and more accessible than ever before. What Does Launching Aave V3 on MegaETH Actually Mean? Let’s break it down simply. Aave V3 is the most advanced version of the Aave protocol, packed with features like improved risk management, cross-chain asset portals, and gas optimization. However, operating directly on the Ethereum mainnet can be slow and expensive due to network congestion. This is where MegaETH enters the picture. MegaETH is an emerging Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution. Think of it as a high-speed express lane built next to the main Ethereum highway. By proposing to launch Aave V3 on MegaETH , the team aims to migrate lending and borrowing activity to this faster, cheaper lane. Therefore, users could interact with Aave’s full suite of services while paying minimal fees and experiencing near-instant transaction confirmations. Why Is This Proposal Such a Big Deal for DeFi? The potential benefits of deploying Aave V3 on MegaETH are substantial and address key pain points in decentralized finance today. Radically Lower Costs: Transaction fees (gas) could drop significantly, making small deposits and frequent interactions economically viable. Blazing-Fast Speeds: Transactions settle in seconds, not minutes, improving the user experience for trading and leveraging positions. Enhanced Scalability: MegaETH can handle more transactions per second, allowing Aave to serve a much larger user base without performance hiccups. Innovation Catalyst: Lower fees and high speed create a fertile ground for new, complex financial products built on top of the Aave protocol. Moreover, this move signals strong confidence in the Layer 2 ecosystem. A major protocol like Aave choosing a new L2 can provide immense validation and attract a wave of liquidity and developers to the MegaETH chain. What Are the Challenges and Considerations? While the vision is compelling, launching Aave V3 on MegaETH is not without its hurdles. The governance proposal will need to pass a vote by AAVE token holders, who will carefully weigh the risks. The primary concern is security and network maturity. MegaETH is a newer entrant in the competitive L2 space. Users and developers must be confident in its security model and the robustness of its technology before locking in significant value. Furthermore, the success of this deployment hinges on achieving sufficient liquidity and user adoption on the new chain. Aave’s features are powerful, but they need an active ecosystem to thrive. What’s the Future if This Proposal Passes? If the community approves the plan to launch Aave V3 on MegaETH , we could witness a fascinating domino effect. We might see a migration of liquidity from other chains or the mainnet, seeking better yields and lower costs. It could also pressure other major DeFi protocols to consider similar expansions onto high-performance Layer 2s. For the average user, the future looks convenient. Imagine seamlessly supplying assets to earn yield or taking out a flash loan for arbitrage with fees that are mere cents instead of dollars. This proposal brings that reality closer. Conclusion: A Vote for a More Efficient DeFi Future The proposal to deploy Aave V3 on MegaETH is more than a technical upgrade; it’s a strategic vision for mass adoption. By tackling the twin demons of high cost and low speed, Aave Labs is positioning its flagship protocol at the forefront of the next wave of decentralized finance. The upcoming governance vote will be a crucial referendum on this vision. A ‘yes’ could ignite a new phase of growth, making sophisticated DeFi tools accessible to everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Aave V3? A: Aave V3 is the latest and most feature-rich version of the Aave decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. It includes upgrades for efficiency, safety, and cross-chain functionality. Q2: What is MegaETH? A: MegaETH is an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution. It processes transactions off the main Ethereum chain to provide faster speeds and much lower fees, while still being secured by Ethereum. Q3: Who decides if Aave V3 launches on MegaETH? A: The decision is made through decentralized governance. Holders of the AAVE token will vote on the official governance proposal submitted by Aave Labs. Q4: How will this affect current Aave users? A: Initially, it creates a new deployment option. Users on the Ethereum mainnet can continue as usual. Those who want lower fees can choose to use the new Aave V3 on MegaETH instance once it’s live. Q5: Is my money safe on a new Layer 2 like MegaETH? A: Security is paramount. The proposal will involve rigorous audits and a risk assessment. Users should always review official documentation and understand the security assumptions of any network before depositing funds. Q6: When will the vote happen? A: The timeline depends on the governance process. Typically, a proposal goes through a temperature check, followed by a formal on-chain vote lasting several days.

That world is now here. Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), recently dropped a bombshell: more than half of ICE’s institutional clients are actively exploring prediction markets . This seismic shift signals that crypto-based forecasting platforms are moving from niche curiosities to mainstream financial instruments. Why Are Major Institutions Flocking to Prediction Markets? For decades, ICE clients focused on tangible commodities like oil and cocoa. However, the landscape is transforming. Sprecher notes a significant change in client sentiment. These sophisticated investors now see prediction markets as a new frontier for data-driven insights and potential alpha generation. The appeal lies in their ability to aggregate crowd-sourced intelligence on everything from elections to economic indicators. This isn’t mere curiosity; it’s strategic positioning. Institutions recognize that these platforms offer a unique, real-time pulse on global sentiment. Therefore, they provide a complementary dataset to traditional market analysis. The move represents a fundamental expansion of what constitutes a tradable asset. What Does the $2 Billion Polymarket Bet Mean? In October, ICE made its intentions crystal clear with a monumental $2 billion investment in Polymarket, a leading crypto-based prediction market . This partnership isn’t just a financial injection; it’s a blueprint for the future. The collaboration includes plans for joint tokenization initiatives, aiming to bridge traditional finance with blockchain innovation. Legitimacy Boost: ICE’s backing provides unprecedented institutional credibility to the entire sector. Infrastructure Scale: Polymarket gains access to ICE’s vast regulatory and technological framework. Market Expansion: The deal paves the way for more regulated, accessible prediction products for retail and institutional users alike. This investment acts as a powerful catalyst. It demonstrates that major financial players are not just observing but actively building the infrastructure for decentralized forecasting. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? Despite the excitement, significant hurdles remain. Regulatory clarity is the most pressing issue. Prediction markets often operate in a legal gray area concerning gambling and securities laws. However, ICE’s involvement suggests a concerted effort to navigate these complexities and establish compliant frameworks. Moreover, the technology must prove its resilience and scalability. The promise of prediction markets hinges on security, transparency, and liquidity. Success will depend on building trust through robust, user-friendly platforms that deliver accurate, tamper-proof results. The opportunity, however, is staggering. These markets could revolutionize how we understand probability and risk. They empower individuals to hedge against real-world outcomes, from weather events to corporate earnings. For institutions, they offer a novel tool for risk management and speculative positioning. How Will This Reshape the Future of Finance? The trend is unmistakable: prediction markets are entering the institutional mainstream. When over half of a giant like ICE’s clientele expresses interest, it’s a trend, not a fad. This shift points toward a more integrated financial ecosystem where blockchain-based information markets sit alongside stocks and bonds. We are likely to see: New, regulated financial products based on event outcomes. Increased merger and acquisition activity in the crypto forecasting space. Greater convergence between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional market infrastructure. In essence, the line between “betting” and “trading” is blurring, creating a new asset class built on collective wisdom. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Decentralized Forecasting The revelation from ICE’s CEO is a watershed moment. It confirms that prediction markets have captured the imagination of the world’s most powerful financial institutions. This isn’t just about Polymarket or crypto; it’s about the digitization and democratization of foresight itself. The traditional investment playbook is being rewritten, and prediction platforms are emerging as a critical new chapter. The institutional dam has broken, and a flood of capital and innovation is poised to follow. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is a prediction market? A prediction market is a platform where users can trade shares based on the outcome of future events. Prices reflect the crowd’s collective probability estimate of that outcome occurring. Why is ICE’s interest in Polymarket such a big deal? ICE owns the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Its $2 billion investment signals that major, regulated traditional finance institutions now see long-term value and legitimacy in crypto-based prediction platforms. Are prediction markets legal? The legal status varies globally. They often exist in a regulatory gray area. ICE’s involvement is likely aimed at working with regulators to create clear, compliant frameworks for their operation. What can you trade on prediction markets? Markets can be created for almost any verifiable future event, including political elections, sports results, technological milestones, and economic data releases. How do prediction markets differ from sports betting? While conceptually similar, prediction markets are often framed as tools for information aggregation and hedging rather than pure gambling. The goal is to reveal the “wisdom of the crowd” for forecasting purposes. What does “tokenization initiatives” mean in the ICE-Polymarket deal? It refers to creating digital tokens on a blockchain that represent real-world assets or rights. This could involve tokenizing shares in prediction market outcomes or creating new financial instruments.

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is now trading at $91,999.86. This sudden move has sent ripples through the investor community, prompting urgent questions about market direction and portfolio strategy. What does this drop signal, and how should savvy traders respond? What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market analysts point to a confluence of factors driving the sell-off. First, broader macroeconomic concerns, including potential interest rate hikes, often trigger risk-off sentiment, impacting assets like Bitcoin. Second, significant sell orders clustered around the $92,500 resistance level created a ceiling that bulls could not break. When the Bitcoin price failed to hold above $92,000, it triggered automated stop-loss orders, accelerating the downward momentum. This is a classic example of technical levels dictating short-term price action. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? For long-term holders, a dip can represent a strategic entry point. However, the context is everything. Key questions to consider include: Market Sentiment: Is fear dominating trader conversations on social media and forums? On-Chain Data: Are large holders (“whales”) accumulating or distributing their coins? Support Levels: Where is the next major support? Analysts are now watching the $89,000 and $85,000 zones closely. Therefore, while a lower Bitcoin price may seem attractive, it’s vital to assess whether the fundamental investment thesis remains intact. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Navigating volatility requires a plan, not panic. Here are immediate steps you can take: Review Your Portfolio: Reassess your asset allocation. Is your exposure to Bitcoin still aligned with your risk tolerance? Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): If you believe in the long-term trend, consider setting up small, regular buys to average your entry Bitcoin price . Set Clear Limits: Define your exit strategy beforehand. Decide at what price you would cut losses or take profits to remove emotion from trading. Remember, sharp corrections are a feature, not a bug, of the cryptocurrency markets. The current Bitcoin price action, while dramatic, is part of a larger cycle. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin Market structure often resets after a sharp decline. This pullback could create a healthier foundation for the next leg up by shaking out over-leveraged positions. Moreover, institutional interest, regulatory developments, and adoption metrics continue to be the primary long-term drivers, not daily price fluctuations. Keeping a focus on these fundamentals is crucial when the Bitcoin price chart turns red. In conclusion, the break below $92,000 is a significant technical event that demands attention. It underscores the inherent volatility of digital assets and the importance of disciplined risk management. While short-term sentiment is bearish, the long-term narrative for Bitcoin remains driven by its core value propositions as a decentralized store of value. Strategic investors use these moments to educate themselves, refine their strategies, and prepare for the market’s next move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Bitcoin’s price fall below $92,000? The drop was likely caused by a mix of technical selling pressure at a key resistance level, broader macroeconomic worries affecting risk assets, and the triggering of automated stop-loss orders. Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price is lower? This depends on your investment strategy. Some see it as a discount, while others wait for the price to stabilize. Conduct your own research and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risk. What is the next major support level for Bitcoin? Traders are closely watching the $89,000 and $85,000 price zones as the next potential areas where buying interest might increase to halt the decline. How does this drop affect other cryptocurrencies (altcoins)? Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader crypto market. A sustained drop in BTC’s price typically leads to increased selling pressure across most altcoins, as investors flee to stablecoins or cash. Is this the start of a larger bear market? One daily move does not define a trend. It’s too early to tell. Monitor whether the price reclaims key levels and watch for shifts in on-chain and derivatives market data for clearer signals. Where can I reliably track the live Bitcoin price? Use reputable aggregators like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, or data from major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase for real-time, accurate pricing information.

According to banking giant JPMorgan, it might be too early to make that call. Despite recent market turbulence, the firm maintains a surprisingly optimistic stance, suggesting a significant crypto rally could still be on the horizon. This perspective comes at a crucial time for investors navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Why Does JPMorgan Believe a Crypto Rally is Still Possible? JPMorgan analysts recently published a note arguing against declaring a full-blown crypto winter. They point to several underlying strengths within the ecosystem that suggest the current downturn may be temporary rather than structural. The bank’s analysis provides a nuanced view that contrasts with the prevailing fear in the market. Their report highlights that Bitcoin closed November down 9% from January, marking its first year-over-year decline since May 2023. However, JPMorgan attributes part of this correction to a temporary price inflation following the U.S. election, not a fundamental breakdown of crypto technology or adoption. What Key Metrics Support This Optimistic View? Instead of focusing solely on price drops, JPMorgan draws attention to positive activity within the stablecoin sector. This data offers a more complete picture of ecosystem health. Stablecoin Volume Growth: Total stablecoin trading volume has increased for 17 consecutive months, indicating sustained utility and transactional use. Ecosystem Resilience: The bank notes that the current correction does not necessarily signal a structural deterioration of the underlying crypto infrastructure. Long-Term Viability: Despite a >20% drop in total market capitalization, core blockchain activity and development continue. How Has JPMorgan’s Stance on Crypto Evolved? This optimistic report aligns with a notable shift in tone from JPMorgan’s leadership. CEO Jamie Dimon, once a vocal critic who famously called Bitcoin a “fraud,” has recently acknowledged cryptocurrencies and blockchain as key future technologies in media interviews. This evolution reflects a broader institutional recognition of digital assets’ potential. When one of the world’s largest traditional banks adjusts its perspective, it often signals changing tides in mainstream finance. Their analysis suggests that patient investors might still see a substantial crypto rally materialize as the market absorbs recent shocks. What Does This Mean for Current Market Conditions? The current environment presents a complex picture. While prices have corrected significantly from recent highs, fundamental adoption metrics tell a different story. JPMorgan’s analysis suggests we might be witnessing a healthy market consolidation rather than the beginning of a prolonged bear market. For investors, this creates a critical distinction. A price correction driven by speculative excess unwinding is different from one caused by a loss of faith in the technology itself. The bank’s data implies the former scenario is more likely, which would support the case for a future crypto rally . Conclusion: Navigating the Path Forward JPMorgan’s message is clear: don’t count crypto out just yet. While short-term volatility is undeniable, the long-term trajectory for blockchain technology and digital assets remains promising. The potential for a powerful crypto rally persists, supported by growing stablecoin adoption and continued institutional interest. The most successful investors often look beyond daily price fluctuations to underlying trends. As the market digests recent events and stabilizes, the foundations for the next growth phase are quietly being built. The coming months will reveal whether this optimistic outlook translates into the sustained upward movement that defines a true market recovery. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly did JPMorgan say about a potential crypto rally? JPMorgan stated it is premature to declare a “crypto winter” and that the potential for price increases remains, citing positive metrics like 17 consecutive months of stablecoin volume growth. Why is Bitcoin down year-over-year according to their report? BTC closed November down 9% from January, marking its first year-over-year decline since May 2023. JPMorgan suggested prices were temporarily inflated post-election before correcting. Has JPMorgan’s CEO changed his view on cryptocurrency? Yes, Jamie Dimon has shifted from being a vocal critic to acknowledging cryptocurrencies and blockchain as key future technologies in recent interviews, aligning with the bank’s more nuanced analysis. What is the most positive metric JPMorgan highlighted? The consistent growth in total stablecoin trading volume for 17 straight months, which indicates sustained utility and transactional activity within the crypto ecosystem. Does JPMorgan believe the current downturn is permanent? No, the bank concluded the downturn does not necessarily indicate structural deterioration and maintains a positive outlook on the crypto ecosystem’s long-term health. What should investors take away from this analysis? Investors should consider that short-term price corrections may not reflect long-term potential, and underlying adoption metrics can provide a more complete picture of ecosystem strength.

Shari’ah Approval And Partnership Ruya said it worked with Fuze, a regulated virtual-asset infrastructure provider, to manage custody, settlement and compliance for trades. The bank framed the service as a Shari’ah-approved investment option rather than a tool for quick speculation. Reports have disclosed that Bitcoin is the initial digital asset offered at launch. UAE Crypto Flows And Local Context Between July 2023 and June 2024 the UAE recorded roughly US$30 billion in virtual-asset inflows, a rise of 42% year-on-year according to figures circulated around the launch. Ruya Bank CEO: Bitcoin Is Now Shari’ah Compliant — A New Chapter for Islamic Digital Finance https://t.co/sijVZfAJne via @unlockbc @myruyabank #islamicFinance #isBitcoinHalal #Shariah_compliant #Bitcoin #adoption #BitcoinNews #UAE — Unlock Blockchain (@unlockbc) December 8, 2025 That growth has come as regulators in the UAE lay out clearer rules for virtual-asset service providers, making banks and fintechs more willing to add crypto features inside regulated apps. How The Offering Works Users who meet the bank’s terms can execute Bitcoin buys and sells inside the Ruya app. Trade execution and custody are handled by Fuze under the arrangements described. The bank says its Shari’ah board reviewed the structure to ensure compliance with Islamic finance principles, with an emphasis on transparency and clearer risk controls. Potential Impact On Muslim Investors For Muslims who have avoided crypto because of religious concerns, this gives a regulated route inside an established bank. Analysts quoted in coverage suggested the move could nudge more conservative savers toward holding some Bitcoin when they otherwise would not have. Adoption will depend on demand and on whether other Islamic banks follow Ruya’s example. What Comes Next Ruya has signaled it will consider offering other virtual assets later, depending on demand and regulatory clarity. Based on reports, the bank wants to position this service as part of longer-term wealth planning rather than short-term trading. This step marks a notable moment: a Shari’ah-compliant bank rolling Bitcoin trading into its core app with a regulated custodian. It could widen access for Muslim investors in the UAE and beyond, while also testing how Islamic finance rules and modern crypto systems can be combined in practice.

Less supply on exchanges can lower immediate selling pressure, making price swings more dependent on fresh buy orders. Price Range And Key Levels Ethereum has gained 2.5% in the last 24 hours and is trading near $3,050. According to an analyst’s chart, ETH has been moving inside a tight range between $3,050 and $3,200, with $3,100 acting as a support line. Traders say a clear break above the $3,300–$3,400 band could open the way toward $3,700 to $3,800. Failure at that resistance would likely push prices back toward $3,000, where buyers may step in again.

Gensyn, a pioneering firm in this space, has just announced a major milestone: its public AI token sale is launching on the Sonar platform. This event represents a significant opportunity for investors and crypto enthusiasts to get involved with a project at the forefront of machine learning computation. What makes this launch particularly exciting are the substantial bonuses reserved for its dedicated testnet community. What is the Gensyn AI Token Sale All About? Gensyn is conducting its public token generation event on Sonar, a platform built on the Ethereum mainnet. The company will allocate 300 million AI tokens, which equates to 3% of the total token supply. The pricing mechanism is intriguing, as it will be set within a fully diluted valuation (FDV) range of $100 million to $1 billion. This broad range reflects both the project’s ambitious potential and the current market’s valuation of AI and crypto projects. Participation is straightforward. Interested buyers can use USDC or USDT on the Ethereum network, with a minimum bid threshold set at $100. This accessibility opens the door for a wide range of participants, from retail investors to larger crypto funds. Why Should Testnet Users Pay Attention to This AI Token Sale? Gensyn is not just launching a token; it’s rewarding its early supporters. The project has emphasized that its testnet is experiencing rapid growth. To acknowledge this community, Gensyn plans to offer special incentives. These rewards are designed to thank early adopters and align their success with the network’s growth. The announced bonuses include several key benefits: Priority Allocation: Testnet participants may receive preferential access to the token sale. Purchase Multiplier: A bonus multiplier could increase the amount of tokens a user is able to acquire. GPU Workstations: Top contributors might even earn physical GPU hardware, directly supporting their future work on the network. This strategy demonstrates Gensyn’s commitment to building a strong, engaged community from the ground up. How Does This AI Token Sale Fit into the Broader Crypto Landscape? The convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain is one of the most compelling narratives in technology today. Gensyn’s protocol aims to create a decentralized marketplace for machine learning compute power. By tokenizing access and contribution to this network, the AI token sale serves as the economic engine for a new model of AI development. Choosing Sonar as the launchpad is also a strategic move. Sonar provides a secure and transparent environment for token sales, which helps build trust with potential investors. This partnership underscores the professional approach Gensyn is taking towards its public offering. What Are the Key Considerations for Potential Participants? While the bonuses and project vision are attractive, participants should conduct thorough due diligence. The wide FDV range indicates significant potential volatility and uncertainty in initial pricing. Furthermore, the success of the Gensyn network depends on the adoption of its decentralized compute model. However, the project’s clear incentive structure for testnet users is a positive signal. It shows a team that values community contribution and is willing to share the project’s upside with its earliest believers. This AI token sale is more than a fundraising event; it’s a community-building exercise. In conclusion, Gensyn’s announcement marks a pivotal moment for decentralized AI. The public AI token sale on Sonar, coupled with its generous testnet rewards program, creates a unique entry point. It rewards early faith while opening the doors for new investors to support a vision for a more accessible and democratized AI infrastructure. The coming weeks will reveal market appetite for this fusion of two transformative technologies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When is the Gensyn AI token sale happening?

This colossal SOL transfer represents one of the most significant institutional movements for the Solana network this year, immediately sparking intense speculation about its implications for the market. What Does This Massive SOL Transfer Actually Mean? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it’s more than just numbers on a screen. This SOL transfer from an anonymous ‘whale’ wallet to a major regulated exchange like Coinbase Institutional suggests a strategic shift in asset management. Typically, such moves indicate one of several possibilities: an institution preparing to stake the assets for yield, a fund rebalancing its portfolio, or potentially, a precursor to selling pressure. However, the destination—Coinbase’s institutional arm—often points towards long-term, compliant holding strategies rather than a quick sell-off. Why Are Whale Transactions So Important to Watch? Whale activity serves as a critical barometer for cryptocurrency market sentiment. These large holders, often institutions or early investors, possess the capital to influence prices significantly. Therefore, analyzing a SOL transfer of this scale provides valuable insights. Key aspects to consider include: Market Sentiment: Movement to a custody solution can signal confidence in the asset’s long-term value. Liquidity Impact: While moved to an exchange, the coins may not immediately hit the open market. Institutional Adoption: It underscores the growing institutional interest in Solana beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Could This SOL Transfer Impact the Price of Solana? The immediate market reaction to such news is often nuanced. A direct dump of $229 million in SOL could create temporary downward pressure. However, the structured nature of this SOL transfer to an institutional custodian suggests a more measured approach. Historically, large inflows to institutional platforms have sometimes preceded periods of price consolidation or accumulation, as these entities often have longer investment horizons. The key for retail investors is to monitor trading volume and order book depth on exchanges following such announcements. What This Tells Us About Solana’s Institutional Future This transaction is a powerful testament to Solana’s maturation within the digital asset ecosystem. For a SOL transfer of nearly a quarter-billion dollars to occur seamlessly highlights the network’s scalability and the robust infrastructure now supporting it. Moreover, it reinforces a growing trend: major financial players are not just dipping their toes but are moving substantial capital into smart contract platforms like Solana. This institutional validation can drive further developer activity, application growth, and overall network security through increased stake. Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers How should you process this information? First, use whale tracking services as one data point among many—not a standalone signal. Second, consider the context of the entire crypto market. Was this an isolated SOL transfer , or part of a broader trend of capital rotation? Finally, focus on fundamentals. While whale movements are flashy, the long-term value of Solana will be determined by its technology, developer community, and real-world utility, not single transactions. In conclusion, the movement of 1.66 million SOL is a landmark event that underscores the deepening integration of traditional finance with blockchain networks. It demonstrates significant capital commitment, highlights robust institutional-grade infrastructure, and serves as a reminder of the market’s dynamic and interconnected nature. While the exact motive behind the transfer remains private, its scale and destination speak volumes about the confidence large players have in the future of the Solana ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency terms? A: A ‘whale’ is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a specific cryptocurrency that their trading activity can potentially influence the market price. Q2: Why would someone transfer SOL to Coinbase Institutional instead of regular Coinbase? A: Coinbase Institutional offers services tailored for large clients, such as hedge funds or family offices, including enhanced security, custody solutions, dedicated support, and OTC (Over-The-Counter) trading desks to minimize market impact. Q3: Does this transfer mean the whale is about to sell all their SOL? A: Not necessarily. Moving assets to an institutional custody platform is often a step for secure long-term holding, staking, or using the assets as collateral. It provides optionality but doesn’t guarantee an immediate sale. Q4: How can I track large cryptocurrency transactions like this one? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Solscan for Solana, or follow social media accounts of tracking services like Whale Alert, which monitor major blockchains for large transactions. Q5: What is the difference between SOL and other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? A: SOL is the native token of the Solana blockchain, which is designed for high-speed and low-cost smart contracts and decentralized applications. Bitcoin is primarily a decentralized digital currency and store of value on its own slower, proof-of-work blockchain. Q6: Could this transaction be related to an ETF or other financial product? A: While speculative, large inflows to institutional custodians can sometimes be linked to the creation of financial products like private trusts or the preparation of assets for potential future ETF considerations, though no official link has been announced.

This decisive action sends a clear signal to the market and raises crucial questions for every crypto investor. If you’re holding DICE or care about exchange accountability, you need to understand the implications of this move. What Triggered the Bithumb Investment Warning for DICE? Bithumb did not make this decision lightly. The exchange’s official statement points to a fundamental breach of trust. The core issue was the project’s failure to promptly disclose information critical to its valuation. This includes details about business plans and other developments that could significantly sway the asset’s price. In the volatile world of crypto, timely and transparent communication from project teams is not a courtesy; it’s a necessity for investor protection. Furthermore, Bithumb conducted a thorough review. They examined Klaydice’s business progress and its trading activity both in South Korea and on international markets. This comprehensive audit revealed what the exchange termed “numerous shortcomings.” While Bithumb hasn’t publicly listed every specific flaw, the label itself is a powerful red flag for market participants. Why Should Every Crypto Investor Pay Attention? This Bithumb investment warning is more than just news about a single token. It represents a growing trend of proactive regulation and risk management by leading exchanges. Here’s why it matters for you: Enhanced Investor Protection: Exchanges are taking a more active role in vetting the assets they list, moving beyond mere technical integration. Market Sentiment Indicator: Actions by a top-tier exchange like Bithumb can influence broader market confidence and set a precedent for others. Due Diligence Blueprint: It highlights the exact type of project behavior—poor disclosure—that should trigger your own research alarms. What Are the Immediate Consequences for DICE? Designation as an “investment warning item” carries immediate practical effects. Typically, such a label on Korean exchanges means the token faces heightened scrutiny and potential trading restrictions. For holders of DICE, the path forward involves several key considerations. They must assess the project team’s response and its ability to rectify the cited disclosure issues. Moreover, investors should watch for similar actions from other exchanges, which could compound liquidity and price challenges. How Can You Protect Your Portfolio from Similar Risks? This event is a perfect case study for refining your investment strategy. You can shield your portfolio by applying these actionable insights: Prioritize Transparency: Favor projects with regular, detailed updates and clear roadmaps. Monitor Exchange Communications: Pay close attention to official exchange announcements and warnings. Diversify Thoughtfully: Avoid over-concentration in assets from projects with small teams or vague long-term plans. In conclusion, Bithumb’s decision to flag DICE is a significant development that underscores the maturing landscape of cryptocurrency regulation. This Bithumb investment warning serves as a crucial reminder that exchanges are increasingly acting as gatekeepers for market integrity. For the savvy investor, it reinforces the timeless principle: conduct relentless due diligence. The responsibility for protecting your capital ultimately rests on your shoulders, supported by the warning signs provided by institutions like Bithumb. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does an “investment warning” designation mean on Bithumb? It means Bithumb has identified significant risks with the project, often related to disclosure failures or business shortcomings. The token may face trading restrictions, and investors are strongly advised to exercise caution. Should I sell my DICE tokens immediately? This is not financial advice. However, you should urgently review the reasons for the warning, assess the project’s response, and make an informed decision based on your risk tolerance. The warning is a serious red flag. Can a token recover from an investment warning? Yes, but it is challenging. Recovery depends on the project team decisively addressing the exchange’s concerns, improving transparency, and rebuilding market trust, which can be a lengthy process. Does this affect DICE trading on other exchanges? Not automatically, but it can influence sentiment. Other exchanges may review their own listings, and investors globally may become wary, potentially impacting price and liquidity everywhere. How often does Bithumb issue such warnings? While not an everyday occurrence, leading Korean exchanges periodically review listed assets. Warnings are issued when projects fail to meet ongoing standards for disclosure and business conduct. What is the difference between a “warning” and a “delisting”? A warning is a cautionary step that puts the project on notice. A delisting is the final action where the token is removed from the exchange entirely. A warning often precedes a potential delisting if issues are not resolved.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin edged up toward $92,000 on Wednesday while Asian stocks slipped, as traders braced for the US Federal Reserve’s final rate decision of the year and tried to gauge how hawkish the central bank will sound after an almost certain cut. Equity markets across the region tracked a soft lead from Wall Street. The S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Tuesday, with JPMorgan acting as the biggest drag after the bank warned of hefty expenses in 2026, adding another layer of caution to a market already on edge about policy signals. The Fed began its two-day meeting on Tuesday, and futures markets still point to a quarter percentage point cut, even though inflation remains above the 2% target. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $92,479, up 2.5% Ether : $3,308, up 6.4% XRP : $2.09, up 1.2% Total crypto market cap: $3.24 trillion, up 2.8% Traders Brace For Hawkish Messaging Even As A Cut Appears Likely For crypto traders, the question is less about whether the Fed moves this week and more about what Chair Jerome Powell signals on the path ahead. In focus as the Fed gathers to consider another cut this week: -whether Powell can stitch together enough consensus to minimize dissents to the same two that opposed the 25 bps cut last time -how many policymakers issue a ""soft"" dissent via their year-end policy rate in the… — Nick Timiraos (@NickTimiraos) December 9, 2025 Some in the market see politics creeping into the calculus. Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, said an expected cut amid slightly rising inflation “may be driven more by political considerations than by sound economic reasoning.” He added that he expects Powell to try to offset the move with hawkish language, a mix he believes could weigh on risk assets. “A hawkish message could increase selling pressure on the already fragile US equity markets, which could, in turn, negatively affect BTC and the broader crypto market,” he said. Others are already tempering their year-end Bitcoin hopes. Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co founder of The Coin Bureau, said, “If Powell does indeed deliver a hawkish speech, the likelihood of a Santa rally for Bitcoin diminishes.” He noted that momentum has not been on Bitcoin’s side recently despite fresh purchases from Michael Saylor’s firm, and said the market “may well finish 2025 under $100,000.” Inflation And Labor Data Add To Confusion Over Policy Direction The macro backdrop is not offering much clarity. Fed officials have sent mixed messages, with some warning that inflation could reaccelerate and others sounding more concerned about the labour market. A Labor Department report on Tuesday showed job openings rising only marginally in October and hiring still subdued, while a separate survey from the National Federation of Independent Business pointed to plans for new hiring in the months ahead. That tension has pushed more attention onto the Fed’s dot plot, its economic projections and every line of Powell’s press conference. Swings around rate decisions have become one of the main drivers of equity volatility over the past six weeks, often overshadowing debates about an AI bubble or the impact of President Donald Trump’s trade policies on corporate earnings and risk sentiment. Slower Easing Path Threatens Liquidity Trade That Crypto Relies On Pricing in money markets shows how expectations have cooled. Traders now see around two cuts in 2026 after a likely quarter point reduction on Wednesday, a pullback from the more optimistic views that circulated only weeks earlier. For Bitcoin and other digital assets, a slower easing path can mean tighter dollar liquidity and more pressure on the “liquidity trade” that helped fuel previous rallies. Personnel questions at the Fed are also in the mix. Kevin Hassett, viewed as the frontrunner in Trump’s search to replace Powell, said at an event on Tuesday that he sees room to lower rates substantially, and even more than a single quarter point move. His comments fed speculation that the longer term policy stance could shift if the White House reshapes the central bank’s leadership in 2026.

The capital, denominated in the USDT stablecoin, comes from Payward Interactive, the powerhouse behind the Kraken exchange. This landmark KindlyMD USDT loan deal represents a significant evolution in how major players in the digital asset space access and manage capital. What Are the Key Details of the KindlyMD USDT Loan? The Block first reported this strategic financial agreement. According to the terms, the KindlyMD USDT loan carries an annual interest rate of 8% and is set to mature on December 4, 2026. This three-year financing provides KindlyMD with substantial runway and flexibility. The use of USDT, a dollar-pegged stablecoin, for such a large transaction highlights its critical role as a settlement and treasury asset within corporate crypto finance. This deal is not just about raising funds; it’s a strategic refinancing play. KindlyMD has stated the primary purpose of the capital is to repay an existing loan from Antalpha, a known partner of Tether. Therefore, this move optimizes the company’s debt structure with potentially more favorable terms from a new, highly credible lender. Why Is This Loan a Big Deal for Crypto Markets? This transaction is a powerful signal for several reasons. First, it demonstrates that established crypto-native institutions like Payward (Kraken) are actively deploying their capital to fund other major industry players. This creates a sophisticated, internal capital market within the crypto ecosystem. Institutional Validation: A publicly-traded company using a stablecoin loan for nine-figure financing legitimizes this method. Ecosystem Maturity: It shows movement beyond simple trading into complex corporate treasury management using digital assets. Credit Market Growth: The 8% interest rate points to the development of a credit yield environment in crypto. Moreover, the involvement of Kraken’s operator adds a layer of trust and credibility. It suggests that due diligence on KindlyMD’s business and collateral passed the scrutiny of one of the world’s largest and longest-running exchanges. What Challenges and Opportunities Does This Present? While groundbreaking, this KindlyMD USDT loan also brings certain considerations to light. The reliance on a specific stablecoin (USDT) ties the company’s debt obligations to the health and stability of that asset. Any significant de-pegging event or regulatory action against Tether could create unforeseen risk. However, the opportunities are substantial. For KindlyMD, this loan likely provides capital at a competitive rate compared to traditional finance, especially for a firm deeply involved in Bitcoin. It frees them from their previous obligation to Antalpha and partners them with Kraken, potentially opening doors to deeper collaboration. For the market, it sets a precedent. Other public crypto companies may now explore similar USDT loan structures for liquidity, acquisitions, or expansion, further weaving stablecoins into the fabric of corporate finance. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Finance The $210 million KindlyMD USDT loan from Kraken’s operator is more than just a headline. It is a concrete example of the maturing cryptocurrency infrastructure being used for serious, large-scale corporate finance. This deal blurs the line between traditional debt markets and the digital asset world, proving that stablecoins can facilitate efficient capital allocation between major industry institutions. It underscores a future where crypto-native capital markets operate with growing sophistication and scale. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is lending the money to KindlyMD? A1: The lender is Payward Interactive, which is the parent company and operator of the well-known Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. Q2: Why is the loan in USDT and not US dollars? A2: Using USDT, a stablecoin on blockchain networks, allows for faster, global settlement and leverages the existing crypto treasury management systems of both companies. It demonstrates the practical utility of stablecoins in institutional finance. Q3: What will KindlyMD do with the $210 million? A3: The primary stated use is to repay an existing loan the company had from Antalpha, a partner of Tether. This refinances their debt under new terms. Q4: What does an 8% annual interest rate mean in this context? A4: It means KindlyMD will pay 8% of the $210 million principal per year as interest to Payward until the loan matures in December 2026. This rate reflects the risk and terms agreed upon by both parties. Q5: Is this a sign of more institutional crypto lending? A5: Absolutely. This deal is a high-profile benchmark that will likely encourage other large crypto firms to explore similar debt financing options within the ecosystem, signaling growth in institutional crypto credit markets. Q6: Does this involve Bitcoin directly? A6: While KindlyMD is a known Bitcoin buyer, this specific loan transaction is conducted using the USDT stablecoin. However, the company’s overall business strategy and potential collateral may be tied to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Found this deep dive into the landmark KindlyMD USDT loan insightful?

CEO Brian Armstrong recently revealed a crucial shift: the Coinbase staking lawsuit , which began with actions from ten U.S. states, has now been whittled down to just five. This update arrives as the financial consequences for users in restrictive states continue to grow, highlighting the high stakes of this regulatory clash. What’s the Latest in the Coinbase Staking Lawsuit? Brian Armstrong took to social media platform X to announce the progress. He confirmed that half of the original ten states have stepped back from their legal action against the exchange’s staking program. However, the battle is far from over. The remaining five states are pressing forward, creating a fragmented legal landscape for a service that allows users to earn rewards on their crypto holdings. This situation underscores the ongoing tension between innovative crypto services and evolving state-level regulations. Why is Maryland’s Staking Ban a Major Concern? Armstrong specifically called out the situation in Maryland as a prime example of the lawsuit’s real-world impact. The state has implemented a complete ban on staking through Coinbase. This aggressive regulatory stance has had a direct and costly effect on local users. Locked Rewards : Maryland users are currently prevented from accessing approximately $8 million in earned staking rewards. Growing Damages : Armstrong emphasized that this total is not static. The amount of user funds being withheld continues to increase every day the ban remains in effect. Customer Impact : This ban directly impacts everyday investors who chose staking as a method to generate passive income from their cryptocurrency assets. How Does This Staking Lawsuit Affect the Broader Crypto Market? The ongoing Coinbase staking lawsuit is more than just a corporate legal issue; it’s a bellwether for regulatory acceptance. Staking is a fundamental process for proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum, and services like Coinbase’s have made it accessible to millions. A successful crackdown by states could set a precedent, potentially chilling innovation and limiting consumer choice. Conversely, Coinbase’s ability to defend its service could pave the way for clearer, more favorable regulations. The outcome will signal how U.S. regulators at both state and federal levels view the core mechanics of the modern crypto economy. What Are the Potential Outcomes of This Legal Fight? The path forward remains uncertain, but several scenarios are possible. The reduction from ten to five states suggests some regulators may be reconsidering their approach or seeking settlements. A final ruling in favor of Coinbase could force the remaining states to lift their bans and release user funds. However, a loss could empower other states to enact similar restrictions, creating a patchwork of laws that complicate crypto operations nationwide. This legal battle is therefore a critical test case for the future of staking services in America. In conclusion, the Coinbase staking lawsuit has entered a new, more concentrated phase. While the reduction in participating states is a positive sign for the exchange, the severe financial penalties on users in places like Maryland reveal the tangible costs of regulatory uncertainty. The industry and its customers are now watching closely, as the resolution of this case will likely influence how cryptocurrency earning services are governed for years to come. The mounting damages underscore the urgent need for regulatory clarity that protects consumers without stifling technological progress. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Coinbase staking lawsuit about? Several U.S. state securities regulators sued Coinbase, alleging its staking service should be registered as a security. Coinbase disputes this, arguing it simply provides a service for users to participate in blockchain validation. Which states are still part of the lawsuit? While the exact five states were not all named in Armstrong’s statement, Maryland is confirmed as one. The initial suit included states like California, New Jersey, and Alabama. Can Maryland users get their staking rewards back? Currently, no. The $8 million in rewards is locked and cannot be paid out due to the state’s enforcement action and ban on the service. What happens if Coinbase wins the lawsuit? A victory would likely allow Coinbase to resume staking services in all states, release held user rewards, and set a precedent limiting states’ ability to regulate staking as a security. Is my staking on Coinbase safe in other states? For users in the 45 states not involved in the lawsuit, the service continues to operate normally. However, the ongoing case creates general regulatory uncertainty. What is cryptocurrency staking? Staking is the process of locking up cryptocurrency to support the operations of a proof-of-stake blockchain network. In return, participants earn additional tokens as rewards.

Macro commentator plur daddy (@plur_daddy) describes it bluntly via X: “The Trump Fed takeover being underpriced is my primary theme going into 2026 (hence my gold bet). This is a momentous shift: the bigger and more convex the catalyst, the more difficult it is for markets to price it in properly.” Former Fed trader Joseph Wang known as “Fed Guy” echoes the concern from inside the plumbing, warning: “The market underestimates the likelihood of a Trump Fed. The Administration is showing resourcefulness and determination for lower rates. That could set off the blow off top in equities, where implied vol shows speculation still has room to run.” The Trump Fed Takeover Isn’t Price In That determination is colliding with a bond market that appears to be pushing back via term premium. Plur highlights the spread between the 12-month T-bill and the 10-year Treasury as a clean gauge of that tension. He notes that the spread “peaked right before inauguration on the generic ‘Trump will run it hot’ viewpoint,” then “got crushed lower as DOGE and Tariffs got priced in.” It bottomed near the tariff lows and “is now back to the highs,” a pattern he reads as term-premium expansion as “a form of protest to [Kevin] Hassett,” Trump’s presumed Fed pick. Related Reading: Italy’s Market Watchdog Gives Crypto Firms A Clear Order: Act Or Exit Against that backdrop, the administration still has powerful tools to compress term premium without formally announcing quantitative easing. Plur identifies three levers. First, de-regulating banks so they are allowed – in practice, pressured – to hold more Treasuries, boosting structural demand for government paper. Second, reducing the Treasury’s weighted-average maturity by shifting issuance “to bills over longer dated notes,” which cuts the duration the market has to absorb. Third, specifically for mortgages, “lever up the GSEs to buy MBS,” narrowing mortgage spreads and transmitting easier policy to the housing market even if the policy rate moves more slowly. He argues that “all of these are quite bullish for risk overall but will take time to play out.” For now, the environment remains awkward for directional risk bets, including crypto. “In the meantime, it has been a choppy and difficult market, across the board. Equity indices have grinded higher but the underlying rotations have been tricky to navigate. QT ended but liquidity is still relatively thin, and the fact that we are going into year end does not help. Better times will come.” The bullish pivot in his framework arrives with the calendar. “In the new year, fiscal accommodation will re-expand on the implementation of OBBBA (+$10–15bn/mo). Meanwhile we have sell-side macro teams calling for $20–45bn/mo in T-bill repurchasing by the Fed, as soon as Jan 1.” Related Reading: 75% Chance Crypto Is ‘Crossing The Chasm’ Now, Says Moonrock Capital Boss This mix would directly ease pressures visible in funding markets: “This would go a long way towards easing the current liquidity issues (see the SOFR–IORB spread chart below). This is not classic QE in that there is very little duration being absorbed from the private sector, and mainly has the effect of expanding bank reserves. This is still bullish because bank reserves are tight at the time, which is tied to the repo liquidity issues.” Will The Crypto Market Rise Again? On that basis, Plur expects the macro backdrop in 2026 to look “better than H2 ’25 has been, perhaps more on par with parts of 2024.” His expression of the trade is clear: “This should be enough for strong performance on gold given the Fed takeover angle, and continued melt-up in equities and select commodities.” For Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, however, his stance is notably more cautious. “For BTC it is more difficult to say. My base case continues to be a frustrating period of chop and re-accumulation.” Improved liquidity “should be favorable for BTC,” but he questions whether there will be “a material shift in the supply/demand imbalances we have been seeing,” concluding: “I will keep watching it for now.” In other words, the Trump Fed trade is already driving high-convexity bets in gold, equities and commodities. Crypto stands to benefit indirectly from easier reserves and lower term premium, but in this framework, the key constraint is no longer just macro liquidity – it is whether fresh demand is strong enough to meet an increasingly inelastic supply in the crypto market. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.05 trillion.

55579754,642523,1765335656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55579754.jpeg,Bitcoin OG Doubles Down On Ethereum With A Massive $209.8M Long – Find Out His Liquidation Price,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-og-doubles-down-ethereum-with-massive-long/,"Ethereum is holding above the $3,000 level for the fourth consecutive day as the market enters a decisive week dominated by the upcoming FOMC meeting. Traders are cautiously positioning ahead of the Federal Reserve’s announcement, aware that liquidity signals and rate expectations could determine whether this recovery continues—or breaks down. Despite the recent stabilization, fear remains firmly in control. Many analysts warn that if ETH loses the $3K floor, the market could face a deeper retracement, especially with volatility expected to spike around the macro event. Amid this uncertainty, on-chain data from Lookonchain has revealed a striking development: BitcoinOG, the same whale who famously shorted the market during the violent October 10 crash , has now dramatically increased his bullish exposure to Ethereum. According to the data, he has ramped up his long position to 67,103.68 ETH, valued at approximately $209.8 million. Whale Positioning Adds a New Layer of Volatility According to Lookonchain, the BitcoinOG whale is now sitting on more than $4 million in unrealized profit from his massive Ethereum long. His position of 67,103.68 ETH, currently valued at over $209 million, comes with a liquidation price of $2,069.49, a level far below current market conditions but still within the realm of possibility if macro pressure intensifies. This liquidation threshold is especially important because it reveals the whale’s risk appetite and how aggressively he’s leveraging this bet. A liquidation level near $2,070 implies confidence that Ethereum won’t revisit its deeper range lows, even as the market remains fragile ahead of the FOMC meeting. It also shows he has a significant margin buffer behind the trade, suggesting strategic positioning rather than impulsive speculation. However, large leveraged positions can act as double-edged swords for the broader market. If price begins trending toward his liquidation zone, cascading liquidations across other longs could accelerate downside momentum. Conversely, whales with deep pockets often defend key levels to protect their positions. ETH Higher-Timeframe Trend Remains Fragile Ethereum’s weekly chart shows the market fighting to stabilize above the $3,000–$3,150 zone, a level that now acts as the primary support band after weeks of heavy selling. The recent bounce from the mid-$2,700s has created a short-term relief structure, but ETH still trades well below its 50-week moving average, which is beginning to curl downward—a signal that the broader trend is losing momentum. The chart highlights a clear pattern: each rebound over the past six months has produced lower highs, reflecting persistent seller dominance whenever ETH approaches the $3,500–$3,800 region. This repeated rejection zone marks a key resistance cluster that bulls must reclaim to shift the medium-term outlook back toward bullish continuation. Volume also remains relatively muted compared to earlier stages of the cycle, suggesting that current buying interest is hesitant. Without a surge in spot demand, rallies may continue to fade quickly. On the positive side, ETH has reclaimed the 200-week moving average, an important long-term support that historically acts as a pivot between macro bull and bear phases. As long as this level holds, Ethereum retains structural strength. ETH is in a neutral-to-bearish consolidation, and a decisive weekly close above $3,300 is needed to confirm regained momentum.

This is no longer a futuristic fantasy. French fintech innovator Lyzi has partnered with Lamborghini to integrate crypto payments at their official centers, marking a seismic shift in how luxury assets are acquired. What Does This New Crypto Payments Partnership Mean? According to a report by Bitcoin.com, Lyzi’s platform will facilitate transactions for Lamborghini’s elite clientele. This service isn’t limited to just Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, it supports a staggering array of over 80 digital currencies, including major players like BTC, Tezos (XTZ), and various stablecoins. This move directly answers a growing demand from high-net-worth individuals who hold significant wealth in digital assets. Why Are Luxury Brands Embracing Crypto Payments? The collaboration between Lyzi and Lamborghini is a strategic masterstroke. For Lamborghini, it taps into a new, tech-savvy, and liquid customer base. For the crypto ecosystem, it provides a powerful use case that moves beyond speculation into tangible, high-value commerce. This partnership signals that crypto payments are maturing into a legitimate and preferred transaction method for substantial purchases. The benefits are clear for both sides: For Buyers: Utilize existing crypto portfolios without converting to fiat, potentially simplifying the process and offering portfolio management flexibility. For Lamborghini: Attract a global clientele, reduce certain transaction fees associated with traditional finance, and position the brand at the cutting edge of technology. For Crypto Adoption: Provides a prestigious, real-world validation that boosts mainstream confidence in digital currencies. How Do These Crypto Payments Actually Work? While specific technical details are proprietary, the process likely involves Lyzi acting as a secure payment gateway. A customer selects their vehicle, agrees on a price, and initiates a crypto payment . Lyzi’s system would then handle the conversion, either instantly settling in fiat for the dealer or managing the crypto settlement, ensuring a smooth experience akin to using a credit card. This infrastructure is crucial for handling volatility, especially with non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. What Challenges Remain for Widespread Crypto Adoption? Despite this exciting news, hurdles persist. Regulatory clarity varies dramatically by country, affecting which centers can offer the service. Price volatility remains a concern for accounting and valuation at the moment of sale, though stablecoins mitigate this. Furthermore, the environmental narrative around some cryptocurrencies is a consideration for brands conscious of their ESG footprint. However, this move by a marquee name like Lamborghini actively works to overcome these very challenges by normalizing high-stakes crypto transactions. The Future of Commerce with Crypto Payments The Lyzi and Lamborghini deal is more than a niche novelty; it’s a harbinger. It demonstrates that crypto payments are scalable and secure enough for the most exclusive markets. This will likely create a domino effect, encouraging other luxury sectors—real estate, art, jewelry—to follow suit. The integration of digital assets into everyday high-value commerce is accelerating faster than many anticipated. In conclusion, the alliance between Lyzi and Lamborghini is a landmark moment. It successfully bridges the world of cutting-edge digital finance with the pinnacle of automotive luxury. This partnership doesn’t just sell cars; it sells a vision of the future where crypto payments are a standard, powerful tool for financial freedom and acquisition. It’s a bold statement that digital currency is here, it’s valuable, and it’s ready for the real world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Which cryptocurrencies can I use to buy a Lamborghini? A: Lyzi’s platform supports over 80 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Tezos (XTZ), Ethereum (ETH), and multiple stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Q: Will this service be available at all Lamborghini dealerships worldwide? A: Initial rollout may be selective. Availability will depend on local regulations and the integration process at individual Lamborghini centers. Q: How does Lamborghini handle the price volatility of cryptocurrencies during the sale? A> Lyzi’s payment system is designed to manage this, likely using real-time conversion or stablecoins to lock in the fiat value at the point of transaction, protecting both the buyer and the dealership. Q: Is this just a marketing stunt, or a serious payment option? A> This is a serious fintech integration by Lyzi, a established payment provider. It represents a strategic business decision to access new capital and cater to evolving customer payment preferences. Q: What does this mean for the average crypto investor? A> It’s a significant step for mainstream adoption. It enhances the perceived utility and legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, demonstrating their use beyond trading and into acquiring major real-world assets.

The bank noted that decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have become the primary focus for regulatory scrutiny. Tokenization involves issuing digital representations of real-world assets (RWAs) such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and private equity on a blockchain. According to HSBC, tokenization, which was once an experimental idea, has become a serious consideration for both TradFi and DeFi firms that aim to operate regulated on-chain trading venues. Citadel Securities says many DeFi protocols meet exchange standards HSBC revealed on Monday that the recent meeting of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Investor Advisory Committee showed divisions on how a potential market for tokenized U.S. equities should be regulated. According to the bank, several TradFi representatives at the meeting argued that the commission should apply the existing exchange obligations to decentralized trading protocols. In contrast, some crypto executives called for frameworks that specifically target DeFi infrastructure. Citadel Securities, a market-making giant, recently submitted a 13-page letter to the SEC, arguing that many DeFi trading protocols meet the statutory definition of an exchange and should therefore be regulated as such . According to Citadel, granting broad exemptions to DeFi platforms may enable regulatory arbitrage and create a parallel market for tokenized stocks that lacks the investor protections present in TradFi. Scott Bauguess, Vice President for Global Regulatory Policy at Coinbase, told the committee that decentralized exchange models function differently from centralized exchanges and should not be treated as traditional exchanges. According to Bauguess, the new market structures require modernized rules that reflect decentralization, open-source infrastructure, and automated liquidity systems. SEC Chair Paul Atkins reiterated that tokenization is part of the agency’s broader effort to modernize the U.S. capital markets. Atkins emphasized that any pathway must consider regulatory compliance. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, on the other hand, raised concerns over the risks associated with tokenized equities, including market integrity, custody, and investor protections. HSBC plans to expand its Tokenized Deposit Service to the U.S. and the UAE HSBC has added its tokenized portfolio across several markets and recently launched its Tokenized Deposit Service, a blockchain-based system that enables corporate clients to move funds across borders quickly. The service is already live in the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. The bank plans to extend the service to the U.S. and UAE during the first half of 2026. Daragh Maher and Nishu Singla, HSBC’s analysts, revealed that while the regulators have shown openness to innovation, the SEC is unlikely to allow a domestic on-chain equities market to operate under lighter standards than the traditional exchanges. According to HSBC’s analysts, the SEC may consider a controlled-environment model that allows for limited experimentation under predefined rules to test tokenized equities and determine if they can operate within the U.S. regulatory landscape. According to HSBC analysts, regulatory pressure across the U.S. may ultimately force tokenized equities systems to be built on fully permissioned and regulated blockchains. They noted that such environments would allow regulators to maintain oversight of identifiable teams and U.S.-facing market activities without putting investors at unregulated protocol risks. The SEC is expected to issue its decision in the coming months, which may define how and whether on-chain markets for U.S. stocks will develop within the country’s existing securities framework. HSBC noted that despite the differences, the most consistent theme across TradFi leaders, DeFi advocates, and U.S. regulators is that tokenization is expected to grow significantly from its current base.

The past 24 hours delivered a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in digital asset trading. A staggering wave of crypto futures liquidations swept across major exchanges, wiping out over $321 million in leveraged positions. This event highlights the critical risks and rapid shifts that define the futures market. Let’s break down what happened and, more importantly, what it means for your trading strategy. What Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Tell Us? The data paints a clear and dramatic picture. In the last day, traders faced massive liquidations, primarily from bets that went the wrong way. Here is the breakdown for the top assets: Bitcoin (BTC): $170 million liquidated, with a whopping 79.85% of those being short positions. Ethereum (ETH): $136 million liquidated, where 76.8% were also shorts. Solana (SOL): $15.63 million liquidated, with 60.8% shorts. This pattern is crucial. The dominance of short liquidations suggests a strong, unexpected price surge caught many traders off guard. When prices rise rapidly, traders who borrowed assets to sell (shorting) are forced to buy back at higher prices to close their positions, often triggering a cascade of automatic crypto futures liquidations . Why Should Every Trader Understand Liquidations? Liquidation events are not just numbers on a screen; they are market-moving forces. A high volume of crypto futures liquidations can accelerate price movements. Forced buying from liquidated shorts can fuel a rally further, creating a feedback loop known as a ‘short squeeze.’ This mechanism is a core part of futures market dynamics and can lead to explosive volatility. Therefore, monitoring liquidation levels is a vital tool for risk assessment. It helps gauge market sentiment, identify potential leverage bubbles, and anticipate periods of heightened instability. Savvy traders use this data to adjust their position sizes and set more conservative stop-losses. How Can You Navigate This Volatile Landscape? Witnessing such significant crypto futures liquidations can be intimidating. However, you can use this knowledge to trade more wisely. First, always use proper risk management. Never over-leverage your account, as this is the primary cause of liquidation. A good rule is to use only a small percentage of your capital for any single leveraged trade. Second, stay informed. Tools that track estimated liquidation prices across exchanges can help you see where clusters of positions might be at risk. Finally, consider the emotional discipline required. The fear of missing out (FOMO) or the desire to revenge-trade after a loss can lead to the very mistakes that end in liquidation. The Bottom Line on Major Market Moves The recent crypto futures liquidations serve as a stark, real-time lesson in market mechanics. They underscore that while leverage can amplify gains, it dramatically increases the risk of a total loss. The data clearly shows that the market punished overly confident short sellers during this particular move. For the broader ecosystem, such events test the resilience of trading platforms and the maturity of market participants. In conclusion, these events are inevitable in a leveraged market. Your goal should not be to avoid volatility but to understand and respect it. By prioritizing capital preservation, continuously educating yourself, and maintaining emotional control, you can navigate these turbulent waves instead of being swept away by them. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto futures liquidations? A liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange because they no longer have enough funds (margin) to keep it open. This happens when the market moves against their bet. Why were most of the recent liquidations short positions? The data shows a majority were shorts because the price of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum rose sharply. Traders who bet on prices falling (shorting) faced losses and were liquidated when they couldn’t meet margin calls. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use low leverage, fund your account with ample margin (collateral), and always use stop-loss orders to automatically exit a trade before it reaches your liquidation price. Do liquidations cause prices to go up or down? They can do both. Mass short liquidations involve forced buying, which can push prices up (a short squeeze). Mass long liquidations involve forced selling, which can push prices down. Where can I track liquidation data in real-time? Several cryptocurrency data websites and analytics platforms provide real-time and historical liquidation data across multiple exchanges. Is trading futures riskier than spot trading? Yes, significantly. Futures involve leverage, which magnifies both profits and losses, making the risk of liquidation a primary concern that does not exist in simple spot buying and holding.

The platform will delist eight specific spot trading pairs from its marketplace. This move directly impacts portfolios holding CHR, ENJ, HAEDAL, LISTA, POWR, PROVE, UMA, or ZRX against major pairs like BTC, BNB, or FDUSD. If you’re active in these markets, understanding the implications is not just helpful—it’s essential for protecting your assets. Which Spot Trading Pairs Is Binance Delisting? Binance has set a firm date for the removal. The delisting will take effect at 03:00 UTC on December 12. The specific spot trading pairs being removed are: CHR/BTC ENJ/BTC HAEDAL/FDUSD LISTA/BNB POWR/BTC PROVE/BNB UMA/BTC ZRX/BTC It is crucial to note that this action only affects these specific trading pairs. The underlying tokens themselves (like CHR or ENJ) may still be available for trading against other currencies, such as USDT or on other exchanges. However, the removal of a BTC or BNB pairing is often a significant liquidity event. Why Would Binance Delist Trading Pairs? Exchanges like Binance regularly review all listed markets. The decision to delist spot trading pairs is not taken lightly. Typically, it follows a periodic review based on several critical factors. These include poor liquidity, low trading volume, or concerns about a project’s development activity and commitment. By removing underperforming pairs, Binance aims to maintain a healthy, efficient marketplace for its users and protect them from highly illiquid or volatile markets. For traders, this is a reminder of the importance of due diligence. Investing in tokens with strong fundamentals, active development, and healthy exchange volume can help mitigate the risk of sudden delistings. What Should You Do If You Hold These Assets? First, don’t panic. A pair delisting does not mean your tokens vanish. However, you must take proactive steps before the deadline. Here is your actionable checklist: Check Your Holdings: Immediately review your Binance spot wallet for any of the affected tokens in the delisted pairs. Sell or Convert: Before December 12, you can sell these tokens for another cryptocurrency that you wish to hold. Alternatively, you can convert them into a different, stable trading pair that remains active. Consider Withdrawal: If you believe in the long-term potential of the token, you can withdraw it to a private, self-custody wallet. From there, you could hold it or trade it on another supporting exchange. Do Not Leave Orders Open: Cancel any open orders (like limit buys or sells) for these pairs, as they will be automatically removed by Binance at the time of delisting. How Does This Affect the Broader Crypto Market? While a single exchange delisting eight pairs is a routine market hygiene event, it sends a signal. It highlights the importance of liquidity and project vitality in the volatile crypto space. For the projects involved, losing a major trading pair on the world’s largest exchange can impact price and accessibility in the short term. Therefore, it often prompts community discussion and can lead to increased development transparency from the project teams. For the ecosystem, such periodic reviews by major exchanges help maintain overall market integrity. They encourage projects to stay compliant, innovative, and engaged with their communities to retain their listing status. Final Summary: Stay Informed and Proactive In summary, Binance’s decision to delist these eight spot trading pairs is a standard operational procedure focused on market quality. The immediate impact is confined to traders actively using those specific markets on Binance. The key takeaway is to always stay informed about exchange announcements and manage your portfolio actively. By understanding the reasons behind such moves and knowing your options, you can navigate these events smoothly and keep your trading strategy on track. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does delisting a trading pair mean the token is being removed completely? A: Not necessarily. Binance is only removing specific pairings (like CHR/BTC). The CHR token may still be tradable as CHR/USDT or on other exchanges. Always check the token’s other available markets. Q2: What happens if I don’t do anything before the delisting date? A: After delisting, you will no longer be able to trade that specific pair on Binance. Your tokens will remain in your spot wallet, but you will need to trade them via a different active pair or withdraw them to trade elsewhere. Q3: Will this delisting cause the token price to crash? A: It can create selling pressure as traders exit the delisted pair, potentially impacting the price. However, the long-term price depends more on the project’s fundamentals and its liquidity on other platforms. Q4: Can a delisted trading pair be relisted in the future? A: Yes, if the token project addresses the issues that led to the delisting (e.g., improves liquidity or development activity), Binance could potentially relist the pair after a future review. Q5: Are other exchanges likely to follow Binance and delist these pairs? A> While other exchanges make independent decisions, a delisting by a major player like Binance often prompts other platforms to review the token, though it doesn’t guarantee they will delist it.

First, it could indicate preparation for a large sell order, which can create downward pressure on the asset’s price. Alternatively, it might be part of a strategic portfolio rebalancing or a move to utilize exchange-based services like staking or lending. The anonymity of the sender adds a layer of intrigue, making it essential to analyze the context. Therefore, while alarming on the surface, this ADA transfer to Binance requires a measured look at market conditions. Could This Impact Cardano’s Market Price? The immediate concern for any ADA holder is price action. A potential sell-off of this magnitude could lead to increased selling pressure. However, the actual market impact depends on several factors: Order Execution: Will the whale sell all 750 million ADA at once, or drip-feed it into the market? Market Depth: Does Binance’s order book have enough buy-side liquidity to absorb such a sale without a major price dip? Market Sentiment: Are broader crypto market trends bullish or bearish, which can amplify or dampen the effect? Historically, not all large exchange deposits result in immediate price drops. Sometimes, they precede major institutional moves or are simply routine for large-scale traders. How to Interpret Whale Alerts Like a Pro Seeing a giant ADA transfer to Binance on Whale Alert can trigger a fear response. However, savvy market participants use these alerts as one data point among many. Here is a simple framework for analysis: Context is King: Check Cardano’s recent price trend and news. Was the price rising sharply before the transfer? Exchange Flow: Monitor if other large wallets are moving funds to or from exchanges. A single transaction is less significant than a trend. On-Chain Metrics: Look at other indicators like active addresses, staking activity, and network growth for a holistic view. This approach helps separate signal from noise, preventing reactionary decisions based on a single event. What’s Next for ADA After This Major Movement? The long-term trajectory of Cardano is tied to its fundamentals—network upgrades, developer activity, and adoption—not a single transaction. While this ADA transfer to Binance is noteworthy for its size, it is a momentary event in the lifecycle of a blockchain. Investors should focus on the project’s roadmap, including developments in smart contracts and decentralized applications. Moreover, the very ability to track such a transaction transparently highlights the strength and security of the Cardano blockchain itself. In conclusion, the transfer of 750 million ADA to Binance is a powerful reminder of the market’s scale and the influence of major holders. It underscores the importance of vigilance and sophisticated analysis in cryptocurrency investing. Rather than panic, use this event as a catalyst to review your investment thesis, risk management strategies, and understanding of on-chain data. The crypto market thrives on volatility, and informed participants are best positioned to navigate its waves. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is a transfer to an exchange like Binance considered bearish? A: Transfers to exchanges are often the first step to converting crypto to fiat currency or other assets, suggesting a potential sale. However, it is not always the case, as whales also use exchanges for custody, staking, or trading between pairs. Q2: How can I track whale movements myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Cardanoscan or services like Whale Alert on social media platforms. These tools track large transactions in real-time across multiple blockchains. Q3: Could this ADA transfer be related to institutional investing? A> It is possible. Large transfers can sometimes indicate activity from investment funds, staking pools reallocating assets, or over-the-counter (OTC) desk movements, which may not directly impact the public order book. Q4: What is the “unknown wallet” mentioned in the alert? A: An “unknown wallet” typically refers to a private, non-custodial wallet address not explicitly linked to a known entity like an exchange, foundation, or public company. It emphasizes the transaction’s anonymity. Q5: Should I sell my ADA because of this news? A> Making investment decisions based solely on a single transaction is not advisable. Consider your long-term goals, portfolio diversification, and conduct thorough research on Cardano’s fundamentals before taking action. Q6: Has a transfer this large happened before with ADA? A> Yes, the Cardano network has seen several large transfers throughout its history. Whale activity is a common feature in mature cryptocurrency markets and reflects the presence of large-scale investors. Found this analysis of the major ADA transfer to Binance helpful?

A colossal sum of 227,070,031 USDT, valued at approximately $227 million, was just transferred from the major exchange OKX to an unknown wallet. This single USDT transfer represents one of the largest movements of stablecoin capital seen recently, immediately triggering questions about its purpose and potential impact on the market. What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Actually Mean? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it’s rarely a simple retail move. The sheer size points directly to the activity of a ‘whale’—an entity or individual holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency. The destination being an ‘unknown wallet’ is particularly intriguing. This typically means a private, non-custodial wallet not directly linked to a major exchange’s known addresses. Therefore, this USDT transfer likely signifies capital moving off-exchange into cold storage or being prepared for a different use case entirely. Why Are Crypto Whales Moving Funds Off Exchanges? Large holders often move assets for strategic reasons. Moving such a significant amount of USDT off an exchange like OKX could signal several intentions. Let’s break down the most common motivations behind these major moves: Security and Custody: Whales may move funds to private, hardware-based wallets for enhanced security, reducing counterparty risk. Preparing for a Major Trade: This capital could be positioned to swiftly purchase another cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) on a decentralized exchange (DEX) or a different trading platform. Institutional Treasury Management: A company or fund might be rebalancing its digital asset holdings between different wallets or entities. Earning Yield: The funds could be moved to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to earn interest or yield on the stablecoin. Each scenario carries different implications for market liquidity and sentiment. For instance, if the goal is to buy Bitcoin, it could be a bullish signal. If it’s simply for custody, the market impact might be neutral. How Does a USDT Transfer of This Size Affect Market Stability? Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) are the lifeblood of the crypto trading ecosystem, acting as the primary dollar-pegged settlement layer. A movement of over $227 million represents a significant shift in available liquidity. When USDT leaves a major exchange, it can temporarily reduce the buying power available on that platform. However, it’s crucial to remember this is a transfer within the crypto ecosystem, not a withdrawal to traditional banks. The capital remains in the digital asset space, poised for its next move. This specific USDT transfer highlights the opaque yet powerful forces that shape cryptocurrency markets. While transactions are transparent on the blockchain, the identities and intentions behind the wallet addresses often remain a mystery, fueling speculation and analysis. Key Takeaways from the $227 Million Transaction For everyday investors and traders, monitoring whale activity provides valuable context, but it shouldn’t dictate strategy alone. Here are the actionable insights from this event: Watch for Follow-On Activity: The most telling sign will be what happens to this USDT next. Tracking the destination wallet for subsequent transactions is key. Assess Exchange Flows: Large outflows from exchanges can sometimes precede volatility, as they may indicate accumulation or preparation for large trades. Understand the Limits of Data: Blockchain analytics give us the ‘what’ and ‘where,’ but rarely the definitive ‘why.’ Avoid jumping to conclusions based on a single data point. Conclusion: Deciphering the Signals in a Sea of Data The movement of 227 million USDT is a powerful reminder of the scale at which major players operate in the cryptocurrency market. While the immediate reason for this USDT transfer is unknown, it underscores the importance of on-chain analytics and liquidity tracking. For a market built on transparency, the biggest moves often come from the most opaque actors. Therefore, savvy participants use this data not for fear, but for a clearer understanding of the underlying capital flows that drive price action. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an “unknown wallet” in cryptocurrency? An “unknown wallet” is a blockchain address not publicly associated with a known entity like a major cryptocurrency exchange, custodian, or company. It is typically a private, user-controlled wallet. Why is a USDT transfer to an unknown wallet significant? It is significant because it represents a large amount of capital moving away from the immediate trading liquidity of an exchange. This can signal a whale’s intent to hold long-term, trade elsewhere, or use the funds in decentralized finance (DeFi). Can the owner of the unknown wallet be identified? Blockchain addresses are pseudonymous. While the transaction history is public, identifying the real-world person or entity behind a private wallet is extremely difficult without other off-chain information. Does a large USDT transfer like this affect the price of USDT itself? Typically, no. USDT is a stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. Large transfers don’t directly affect its price, which is managed by Tether’s reserves and arbitrage mechanisms. However, it can affect liquidity on specific exchanges. What is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a blockchain tracking and analytics service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions (typically over $100,000) and reports them publicly via social media and its website. Should I be worried about such a large transaction? Not necessarily. Large transactions are a regular part of the cryptocurrency market. They reflect the normal movement of capital by institutions and large holders. It’s a data point for context, not a direct cause for alarm. Found this analysis of the major USDT transfer helpful?

A colossal 227,070,031 USDT, valued at approximately $227 million, was transferred from an unknown wallet to the major exchange OKX. This single USDT transfer is more than just a number on a screen; it’s a significant event that sends ripples through market sentiment and raises critical questions about the intentions of major holders, often called ‘whales’. What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Actually Mean? When such a large sum of stablecoin moves onto a centralized exchange like OKX, analysts immediately look for clues. Typically, this action suggests one of two primary intentions. First, the holder may be preparing to convert their USDT into other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which could signal an upcoming large buy order. Alternatively, they might be moving funds for safekeeping or to take advantage of exchange-based financial products. The mystery of the ‘unknown wallet’ origin adds a layer of intrigue, as it obscures whether this is an institutional player, a fund, or a wealthy individual. Why Should Crypto Traders Care About Whale Movements? Whale transactions are a vital pulse check for the crypto market. Their moves can act as leading indicators. For instance, a large USDT transfer to an exchange often precedes increased buying pressure, potentially lifting prices. Conversely, moving assets *off* an exchange can indicate a long-term holding strategy. Understanding these flows helps traders gauge market sentiment. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation is not causation. One transaction does not guarantee a specific market outcome, but it provides valuable context. Market Sentiment Gauge: Large inflows to exchanges can hint at impending trading activity. Liquidity Signal: It shows where large pools of capital are being positioned. Price Volatility Warning: A sudden large sell order after a conversion could temporarily impact an asset’s price. Could This USDT Transfer Impact Bitcoin or Ethereum Prices? This is the million-dollar—or rather, $227 million—question. The direct impact depends entirely on the whale’s next move. If the USDT is used to purchase Bitcoin, the sheer size of the order could create noticeable upward momentum, especially if placed on the open market. For Ethereum or other altcoins, the effect could be even more pronounced due to their smaller market caps. Therefore, monitoring exchange order books for large bids following such a deposit becomes a key activity for seasoned traders. The Bigger Picture: Stability and Scrutiny in Crypto Beyond short-term price action, this event highlights two enduring themes in cryptocurrency: transparency and stability. The public nature of the blockchain allows anyone to see this USDT transfer , demonstrating the transparent audit trail that defines this technology. Simultaneously, the movement of such a large sum of the world’s leading stablecoin underscores the critical role USDT plays in providing liquidity and a stable trading pair across global crypto markets. It’s a reminder of how interconnected and sensitive this ecosystem is to major capital flows. In conclusion, the mysterious transfer of $227 million in USDT to OKX is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and whale-driven nature of cryptocurrency markets. While it sparks immediate speculation, its true significance will only be revealed by the holder’s subsequent actions. For investors, it serves as a case study in the importance of monitoring on-chain data while maintaining a balanced perspective, avoiding knee-jerk reactions to single data points. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “whale” in cryptocurrency? A: A “whale” is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency that their trades can potentially influence the market price. Q2: Why is transferring USDT to an exchange considered significant? A: Moving stablecoins to an exchange is typically a preparatory step for trading. It signals an intent to buy other assets, making it a potential indicator of future market demand. Q3: What is Whale Alert? A: Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various networks in real-time. Q4: Can a single transaction really affect the crypto market? A: While one transaction rarely changes long-term trends, a trade of this magnitude ($227M) can cause short-term price volatility, especially if executed quickly on the open market for a smaller-cap asset. Q5: What does “unknown wallet” mean? A: An “unknown wallet” is a blockchain address not publicly linked to a known identity, such as an exchange, company, or individual. Its owner remains anonymous. Q6: Is USDT the same as USD? A: No. USDT (Tether) is a cryptocurrency stablecoin *pegged* to the value of the US Dollar. It operates on blockchains and is issued by a private company, not a government central bank. Did this deep dive into the major USDT transfer help you understand market dynamics better?

The country’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF) has decided to reverse its previous ban, now permitting the sale of crypto exchange-traded notes to retail investors. This move signals France’s alignment with broader European trends toward regulated crypto accessibility. What Are Crypto ETNs and Why Does This Matter? Crypto ETNs are debt instruments that track the performance of underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Unlike directly buying crypto on exchanges, these products trade on traditional stock exchanges. This provides retail investors with a familiar, regulated framework for crypto exposure. The AMF’s decision represents a crucial step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption in Europe’s second-largest economy. Why Did France Reverse Its Crypto ETN Ban? France initially prohibited crypto ETNs in October 2023, citing concerns about retail investor protection. The regulator worried that inexperienced investors might not fully understand the volatility and risks associated with cryptocurrency products. However, the landscape has evolved significantly in recent months. The AMF observed several developments that influenced their reversal: Growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrency products Improved regulatory frameworks across Europe Successful implementation of similar products in other jurisdictions Increasing retail demand for regulated crypto access points What Are the New Safeguards for Investors? The regulator isn’t opening the floodgates without precautions. The revised rules include specific requirements designed to protect retail investors. Most notably, providers must display prominent warnings about the products’ risks and characteristics. These warnings must be clear, unavoidable, and written in language that everyday investors can understand. This balanced approach allows access while maintaining consumer protection. The AMF recognizes that complete prohibition might push investors toward unregulated offshore platforms with fewer safeguards. By offering regulated crypto ETNs, France provides a safer alternative for those seeking crypto exposure. How Does This Fit Into Europe’s Crypto Landscape? France’s decision follows similar moves by other European nations, particularly the United Kingdom. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority recently approved the listing of crypto ETNs on regulated exchanges. This creates a growing trend of European regulators embracing cryptocurrency products within controlled frameworks. The timing is particularly interesting as Europe implements its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. France’s move demonstrates how national regulators can work within broader European frameworks while addressing local market needs. This could encourage other EU members to develop their own balanced approaches to crypto regulation. What Does This Mean for Retail Investors? For French retail investors, this development offers several advantages. First, it provides access to cryptocurrency exposure through familiar investment channels. Second, the regulated nature of these products offers greater transparency and oversight compared to direct crypto purchases. Third, it eliminates the technical complexities of managing private keys and wallets. However, investors should remain cautious. Crypto ETNs still carry significant risks, including: High volatility in underlying cryptocurrency prices Counterparty risk with the issuing institution Potential tracking errors between the ETN and its underlying assets Liquidity concerns during market stress The Future of Crypto Regulation in France This policy reversal suggests France is positioning itself as a forward-thinking crypto hub. By creating regulated pathways for retail participation, the country acknowledges cryptocurrency’s growing role in modern finance. The AMF’s approach balances innovation with protection, potentially setting a template for other regulators. Looking ahead, we might see further developments in France’s crypto regulatory framework. The success of crypto ETNs could lead to additional product approvals or regulatory refinements. France appears committed to fostering innovation while maintaining robust investor protections. Conclusion: A Balanced Approach to Crypto Adoption France’s decision to allow crypto ETNs represents a pragmatic evolution in regulatory thinking. Rather than outright prohibition, the AMF has chosen regulated access with clear safeguards. This approach acknowledges cryptocurrency’s permanence in financial markets while addressing legitimate concerns about retail investor protection. The move positions France alongside other progressive European nations embracing cryptocurrency within regulatory frameworks. For retail investors, it offers new opportunities while emphasizing the importance of understanding risks. As crypto continues to mature, such balanced regulatory approaches will likely become increasingly common across global markets. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are crypto ETNs? Crypto ETNs are exchange-traded notes that track the performance of cryptocurrencies. They are debt instruments issued by financial institutions and trade on traditional stock exchanges, providing regulated exposure to crypto assets. When can French investors start buying crypto ETNs? The AMF’s decision is effective immediately, but financial institutions need time to develop and list products. Investors should check with their brokers for availability timelines. Are crypto ETNs safer than buying cryptocurrency directly? They offer different risk profiles. Crypto ETNs provide regulatory oversight and eliminate technical risks like wallet management, but they introduce counterparty risk and may not perfectly track underlying assets. What cryptocurrencies will these ETNs track? Initial products will likely track major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the AMF may approve additional underlying assets as the market develops. Will there be investment limits for retail investors? The AMF hasn’t specified investment limits, but individual product issuers or brokers might implement their own restrictions based on risk assessments. How does this affect France’s position in European crypto regulation? This move positions France as a progressive regulator within the EU’s MiCA framework, potentially attracting crypto businesses and establishing the country as a European crypto hub.

The MSCI is mulling excluding DATs that have invested over 50% of their assets in Bitcoin or other crypto, claiming they are more investment funds than operating firms. However, the idea has not only drawn fierce backlash from the industry but also from industry leaders such as Michael Saylor of Strategy and Viek Ramaswamy of Strive Asset Management. The MSCI announced its possible exclusion plans in October, with a final decision expected to be reached at the beginning of next year. Meanwhile, players in the crypto market emphasize that the MSCI’s exclusion of DATs from its indexes is a mistake. Adam Levine, Fireblocks’ CEO, said the MSCI plan might backfire and will likely not play well with institutional investors. He noted that these institutional investors have already warmed up to crypto in recent years and may be forced to rebalance their holdings to track the index. Levine claims businesses could miss out on tokenized equity The Fireblocks CEO pointed out that the MSCI is introducing the risk of missing key market players if it leaves out companies that have a meaningful presence in the crypto space. He further compared it to the equivalence of intentionally ignoring early internet companies 30 years ago, especially now that businesses are innovating with tokenized equity and stablecoins. Meanwhile, Spencer Hallarn, the head of OTC trading at GSR, said the decisions by the MSCI and other index providers to exclude DATs have real implications on the broader industry, and by extension, the crypto they hold. He, however, believes that the rumored exclusion has been well planned for, so it would be reasonable to assume that the market has already priced it in. It is unlikely to come as a surprise, he added. The Business Insider also predicts that the MSCI’s potential exclusion of DATs has already been factored into the market’s outlook despite the likely adverse implications for DATs. Meanwhile, Wojciech Kaszycki, BTCS S.A.’s chief strategy officer, predicts that Bitcoin can still recover from the bear market and the rebound is definitely coming. Strive urges MSCI to scrap exclusion plans Nasdaq-listed Strive Asset Management is among the many crypto-related firms urging the MSCI to scrap its potential exclusion plans. The company emphasizes that cutting off BTC-focused DATs is unfair because they are crucial to structured finance and AI infrastructure. The MSCI’s chairman and CEO, Henry Fernandez, believes that the exclusion risks shutting down passive investors from a fast-growing market. Meanwhile, JPMorgan cautions that Strategy stands to lose nearly $2.8 billion if the MSCI index decides to exclude such Bitcoin treasuries. Strategy’s Saylor has confirmed that talks with MSCI are ongoing, as the company remains opposed to the move. Strive’s CEO, Matt Cole, also argues that the proposed exclusion misunderstands the role played by large Bitcoin firms in emerging industries, particularly in the field of AI. However, he notes that potential exclusion targets, such as MARA, Riot Platforms, and Hut 8, are expanding into AI by repurposing data centers for high-intensity compute workloads. On the other hand, Cole further noted that these companies will continue holding substantial Bitcoin reserves amid increasing AI revenue. He points out that the MSCI’s exclusion would permanently isolate a sector of the crypto industry that sits at the intersection of the next generation of computing and crypto. Strive further challenged the practicality of the MSCI’s exclusion threshold of 50% or more, highlighting the Trump Media & Technology Group as an example. The Trump-backed company narrowly avoided the initial MSCI exclusion because its BTC exposure is currently below the cutoff. Meanwhile, Strive suggests a parallel version of MSCI’s index for ex-DATs, rather than a blanket rule. The company says this will allow asset managers to avoid crypto-heavy firms as they await the MSCI’s final decision.

Related Reading: Wall Street Storms Ripple In Explosive $500 Million Deal What was once a retail-driven ecosystem is now increasingly shaped by institutional flows, with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracting substantial assets, while on-chain activity trends in the opposite direction. The result is a market that moves, but with participation patterns very different from those seen in earlier cycles. Bitcoin ETF Flows Rise as Retail Activity Falls Since the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, the network has experienced a steady decline in active on-chain addresses. Analysts attribute this partly to the “convenience trade,” in which retail investors opt for exposure through traditional brokerage accounts rather than managing their own Bitcoin wallets. BlackRock’s IBIT and similar products now capture a growing share of BTC demand, even as the blockchain itself shows a decline in grassroots participation. Industry experts argue that this shift fundamentally changes how value circulates in the Bitcoin economy. ETF issuers, not miners or network users, are now capturing a higher share of revenue. SwanDesk CEO Jacob King describes this as a structural pivot toward off-chain monetization, with Bitcoin functioning more as a financial instrument than a peer-to-peer asset. BTC Price Pressure Intensifies Around Macro Events Bitcoin’s recent price behavior reflects both macro uncertainty and intraday volatility patterns. BTC has repeatedly slipped below $90,000 despite developments that historically would support bullish sentiment, such as Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy) latest purchase of over 10,600 BTC. Traders remain cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy decision, where expectations for a quarter-point rate cut are high. Yet the hesitation is evident: rallies toward $92,000 continue to meet resistance, and liquidity remains thin across spot and derivatives markets. Consequently, analysts warn that Bitcoin must hold above a key support level near $88,000 to avoid a deeper downside. Institutional Trading Dynamics Shape Market Movements A growing number of analysts suggest that predictable sell-offs around the U.S. market open reflect coordinated execution rather than organic selling. Market watchers point to high-frequency firms, such as Jane Street, which hold large ETF positions, as possible contributors to these recurring patterns. While unproven, the consistency of these drops has added to trader frustration. Meanwhile, miners face their own pressures. Hashprice has fallen to near-record lows, prompting operators to pivot toward AI infrastructure as mining profitability erodes.

A Mild Bear Cycle Compared To History As of now, Bitcoin has recorded a modest year-to-date decline of 4%. However, the cryptocurrency has shown some stability this week, consolidating in the range of $89,000 to $94,000, with the latter figure serving as immediate resistance. According to Adler, this current correction, which stands at approximately -32%, is considered less severe compared to previous bear cycles. He emphasizes that approximately 88% of Bitcoin holdings remain in unrealized profit, while only about 12% of the total supply is currently at a loss. Adler points out that Bitcoin’s price action has remained relatively steady within the $90,000 zone, reflecting a mild drawdown in historical context. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s Volume Explosion: Leading Meme Coin Barrels Ahead In This Metric The crucial question as the year approaches its end is whether this correction will stabilize between -35% and -40% from its all-time high, indicating a new, more “flattened” cycle, or if the market will follow historical trends that typically lead to deeper declines of -60% to -70%. Analyzing past cycles, Adler notes that major bear markets in 2011, 2016, 2019, and 2023 were characterized by a significant increase in the percentage of coins at a loss, often rising to around 60%. These levels typically marked capitulation points in the market. In contrast, the current landscape shows only 12% of holders experiencing unrealized losses, which diverges sharply from the patterns observed during past bear markets. Can Bitcoin Avoid Deeper Declines? The expert further noted that during recent local cycle peaks, only about 17% of coins were in the red, a figure that remains three to four times lower than traditional capitulation levels. This unusual configuration suggests that the current market may resemble a correction within a bullish supercycle rather than the final downturn of a full-blown bear market. Adler believes that the market appears to be testing the resilience of this correction structure, which stands at -32% from its peak, while maintaining a high ratio of profitable positions. Related Reading: Pundit Highlights The Condition That Will Trigger A 2,300% XRP Rally To $50 He argues that if Bitcoin can sustain this maximum drawdown above the -35% zone alongside moderate unrealized losses, it could bolster the case for a shift towards more “flat” corrections influenced by institutional demand and a structural supply deficit. On the contrary, should Bitcoin’s correction extend beyond the -40% mark, the likelihood of entering a classic bear market increases significantly. Such a scenario would pave the way for deeper declines, potentially reaching the -60% to -70% range, and could trigger a full capitulation phase in terms of unrealized loss metrics. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency is trading at $93,000, marking gains of 5% and nearly 9% in the 24-hour and 14-day time frames, respectively.

This decision carries immense weight, not just for traditional finance, but for the volatile and reactive world of cryptocurrency. The choice will signal the future direction of U.S. monetary policy, interest rates, and financial regulation—factors that directly influence Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Why Does the Federal Reserve Chair Matter for Crypto? The Federal Reserve Chair controls the nation’s money supply and interest rates. When the Fed raises rates or tightens policy, it often strengthens the dollar and can pull investment away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a dovish Fed Chair who favors low rates and stimulus can create an environment where digital assets thrive. Therefore, the upcoming appointment is a pivotal moment for market sentiment. According to a Financial Times report, the reappointment of current Chair Jerome Powell is now uncertain. The White House is reportedly reviewing a shortlist of four candidates. This uncertainty itself can trigger market volatility as investors speculate on each candidate’s potential policy leanings. Who Are the Leading Contenders for Fed Chair? The final interview pool highlights key figures with varying economic philosophies. Understanding their backgrounds helps predict their potential impact. Kevin Hassett: Former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a current member of the National Economic Council (NEC). He is considered the leading contender. Hassett is known for his support of Trump’s tax cuts and has a background in market analysis. His approach to inflation and bank regulation would be closely watched. Kevin Warsh: A former Fed Governor, Warsh has been critical of the Fed’s post-2008 crisis policies. He might favor a quicker normalization of interest rates, which could present headwinds for crypto markets accustomed to easy money. Jerome Powell: The incumbent. His tenure has seen both aggressive stimulus and a recent hawkish turn to fight inflation. His reappointment would offer continuity but not necessarily predictability for crypto. President Trump recently hinted he already has a specific candidate in mind, with a final announcement expected in January. This timeline gives markets several weeks to digest the possibilities. What Are the Immediate Implications for Investors? The selection process creates a period of heightened sensitivity. Cryptocurrency prices often react sharply to macroeconomic news from the Fed. Here’s what to watch: Policy Statements: Listen for any comments from candidates on digital assets or financial innovation. Dollar Strength: A candidate perceived as hawkish could boost the USD, potentially pressuring Bitcoin. Market Volatility: Expect increased volatility in crypto markets around official announcements and leaks. For long-term crypto holders, this underscores the importance of understanding macroeconomics. The Federal Reserve Chair is a key architect of the financial landscape in which decentralized assets operate. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights While we cannot control the outcome, we can manage our response. Consider these steps: Diversify: Ensure your portfolio isn’t overly exposed to assets most sensitive to interest rate shocks. Stay Informed: Follow credible financial news for updates on the selection process. Avoid Knee-Jerk Reactions: Volatility based on speculation can create buying opportunities but also significant risk. The bottom line is that this political decision has real financial consequences. The next Federal Reserve Chair will help steer the U.S. economy through potential recessions, inflation battles, and technological disruptions like CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), which compete directly with existing cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: A Decision with Far-Reaching Ripples President Trump’s final interviews for the Federal Reserve Chair are more than a personnel decision. They represent a fork in the road for monetary policy. For the cryptocurrency community, this process is a stark reminder that digital assets do not exist in a vacuum. Their valuation and adoption are inextricably linked to the decisions made in traditional halls of power. The chosen candidate will shape regulatory attitudes, influence global capital flows, and ultimately, help determine whether crypto winters are mild or severe in the years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When will the new Federal Reserve Chair be announced? A: President Trump indicated a final decision is expected in January of next year, following this week’s final interviews. Q2: Is Jerome Powell likely to be reappointed? A: Current reports suggest his reappointment is uncertain. He is one of several candidates being reviewed, and the President has hinted at having a specific alternative in mind. Q3: Who is Kevin Hassett and why is he a leading candidate? A: Kevin Hassett is a former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and currently serves on the National Economic Council (NEC). He is seen as a leading contender due to his alignment with the President’s economic policies and his experience. Q4: How does the Fed Chair appointment affect Bitcoin? A: The Fed Chair influences interest rates and monetary policy. Hawkish policies (higher rates) can strengthen the dollar and reduce risk appetite, often negatively impacting Bitcoin. Dovish policies (lower rates) can have the opposite effect. Q5: What should a crypto investor do during this selection process? A: Investors should stay informed on news regarding the candidates, avoid making impulsive trades based on speculation, and consider the long-term macroeconomic landscape when making portfolio decisions. Q6: Could this decision impact crypto regulation? A: Indirectly, yes. The Fed Chair influences broader financial stability views and the pace of innovation like CBDCs, which can shape the regulatory environment for private cryptocurrencies.

On December 9th, these funds collectively attracted a net inflow of $150 million. This positive movement occurred even as one of the largest players, BlackRock, experienced a significant withdrawal. The data reveals a fascinating shift in investor sentiment and capital allocation within the cryptocurrency market. What Do the Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflow Numbers Really Show? According to data from TraderT, the headline figure is a robust $150 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the real story lies beneath the surface. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded a substantial net outflow of $136 million on the same day. This means other spot Bitcoin ETFs had to perform exceptionally well to not only offset this loss but also generate a strong overall gain. The activity highlights a diverse and dynamic market where flows are not dependent on a single fund. Which Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Winning Investor Confidence? The inflows were not evenly distributed. Several funds emerged as clear winners, attracting the capital that flowed out of BlackRock’s offering. Here is a breakdown of the major inflows: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC): Led the pack with a massive $190 million inflow. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust: Attracted $33.79 million. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC): Saw $17.48 million in new capital. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB): Gained $16.22 million. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB): Received $5.26 million. This distribution shows that investor interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs is broadening beyond the initial launch giants. Why Is This Movement Significant for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? This data point is crucial for several reasons. First, it proves the market for spot Bitcoin ETFs has depth and liquidity. A major outflow from one fund does not cripple the entire sector. Second, it indicates that investors are becoming more sophisticated. They are actively choosing between different spot Bitcoin ETF products based on factors like fees, the issuer’s reputation, or specific fund structures. Finally, a net positive day amidst volatility reinforces the thesis that these ETFs are becoming a permanent, legitimate gateway for institutional and retail capital into Bitcoin. What Challenges Do Spot Bitcoin ETFs Face? Despite the positive flow, challenges remain. The market is highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s price movements. A sustained bear market could test the resilience of these inflows. Furthermore, competition is fierce, with issuers potentially engaging in fee wars to attract assets. Regulatory scrutiny also remains a constant backdrop for all spot Bitcoin ETFs. Navigating these hurdles will be key to their long-term success. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For investors watching this space, the flow data offers valuable signals. The diversification of inflows suggests it may be wise to research beyond the most prominent spot Bitcoin ETF. Monitoring these weekly flow reports can provide insight into institutional sentiment. Moreover, understanding that outflows from one fund can be offset by others underscores the overall health of the product category. It’s a reminder that the spot Bitcoin ETF landscape is maturing rapidly. In conclusion, the $150 million net inflow for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is a powerful testament to the product’s growing acceptance. The ability to absorb a large outflow from a major issuer like BlackRock and still post a significant gain marks a milestone. It shows the market is not a monolith but a competitive arena where capital seeks the best opportunity. This resilience bodes well for the future of regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price without having to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency directly. Why did BlackRock’s IBIT have an outflow? Specific reasons for daily flows are rarely disclosed. It could be due to profit-taking by a large investor, portfolio rebalancing by an institution, or a shift to another spot Bitcoin ETF with lower fees or different features. Are net inflows always good for Bitcoin’s price? Generally, yes. Net inflows mean new money is entering the market to buy Bitcoin, which creates buying pressure. However, many other macro and crypto-specific factors also influence Bitcoin’s price. How can I track these spot Bitcoin ETF flows? Data is regularly published by analytics firms like Farside Investors and TraderT. Many financial news websites covering cryptocurrency also summarize this data daily or weekly. What’s the difference between GBTC and the Grayscale Mini Trust? The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the original, larger fund. The Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust is a newer, lower-fee spin-off product designed to be more competitive with other spot Bitcoin ETFs. Is investing in a spot Bitcoin ETF safe? While they are regulated financial products, spot Bitcoin ETFs carry the same volatility risk as Bitcoin itself. They are not risk-free but eliminate the technical risks of self-custody.

But while price action keeps traders on edge, on-chain indicators are painting a surprisingly different picture beneath the surface. According to a new CryptoQuant report by XWIN Research Japan, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have continued to fall sharply throughout 2025, even as price corrected toward the $90K range. Related Reading: Smart Whales Align: Top Performers Go All-In On Ethereum Long Positions With Over $425M in Exposure The data shows that the total amount of BTC held on centralized exchanges has dropped to 2.76 million BTC, reaching one of the lowest levels ever recorded. What makes this trend even more striking is its timing: during the steep November–December sell-off, exchange balances did not rise—they fell faster. The report highlights this behavior in the red-marked zone of the chart, showing accelerating outflows while the price was dropping. This pattern signals something unusual: investors are not sending coins to exchanges to sell into weakness. Instead, they continue withdrawing BTC into long-term custody, suggesting confidence rather than capitulation. As volatility builds ahead of the FOMC decision, the contrast between short-term price fear and long-term accumulation is becoming one of the most important dynamics in the current Bitcoin market. Shrinking Exchange Reserves Signal Structural Strength The report emphasizes that Bitcoin’s rapidly shrinking exchange reserves carry important structural implications for the market. When fewer coins sit on centralized exchanges, it means less Bitcoin is available for immediate sale, effectively tightening the liquid supply. According to the data, this decline is not being driven by short-term speculators but by long-term holders and institutional entities steadily moving BTC into self-custody or cold storage. What makes this trend remarkable is its timing. Historically, sharp price declines trigger a wave of inflows to exchanges as investors prepare to sell or panic-exit their positions. This cycle, however, tells a very different story. Even as Bitcoin corrected into the $90K region, exchange balances kept falling, suggesting that buyers with a long-term outlook are actively accumulating rather than retreating. This divergence between price action and on-chain behavior signals underlying strength. While short-term volatility may continue—especially around macro catalysts like the FOMC meeting—the broader structure points toward a market quietly tightening its available supply. As reserves move toward historic lows, a future “supply shock” becomes increasingly plausible. Despite the weak spot market performance, on-chain metrics are slowly turning bullish, hinting that the foundation for the next major trend may already be forming beneath the surface. Related Reading: Ethereum Loses Momentum While OI Holds Steady: Binance Data Shows A Market Reset BTC Tests Critical Support as Market Awaits Direction Bitcoin’s price action on the 3-day chart shows a market attempting to stabilize after a sharp corrective phase. BTC is currently trading around $90,437, hovering just above the 200-day moving average — a level that has historically acted as a major dynamic support during mid-cycle retracements. The recent bounce from the $87K–$88K region suggests that buyers are defending this zone, but the structure remains fragile as long as the price stays below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which are now sloping downward. The chart reveals a clear shift in momentum. After months of steady higher lows, Bitcoin broke its ascending structure in late November, leading to a fast drop toward the high-$80K range. Volume increased during the decline, indicating stronger participation on the sell side. However, the subsequent candles show shrinking sell volume, hinting at exhaustion among short-term sellers.

Failure to break that zone would likely keep the market in a consolidation phase, with risks of another retest of the 200-day MA.

55581956,642621,1765342856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55581956.jpeg,Classic Bitcoin Buy Signal Returns: Are Miners Hinting The Next Accumulation Phase?,https://bitcoinist.com/classic-bitcoin-signal-returns-miners-accumulation/,"Bitcoin is trading at a decisive moment, holding just above the $90,000 mark after several days of tight consolidation. Despite reclaiming this key level, the market continues to struggle with upward momentum, leaving traders uncertain about the next major move. Yet beneath the surface, a key on-chain indicator has triggered fresh interest among analysts. According to top analyst Darkfost, the Hash Ribbons have just flashed a new buy signal — a development that historically aligns with strong medium-term performance for Bitcoin. Darkfost emphasizes that this signal is not a cue to rush blindly into the market, but rather a meaningful piece of data worth highlighting. Hash Ribbon signals typically appear during periods of miner stress, when mining difficulty forces weaker miners to shut down. These moments often precede significant accumulation phases, as selling pressure from distressed miners fades. With the exception of the unprecedented 2021 mining ban in China, every previous Hash Ribbon buy signal has produced profitable outcomes for patient investors. Understanding The Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Signal Darkfost explains that the Hash Ribbons indicator is built around the evolution of Bitcoin’s hashrate, comparing the 30-day and 60-day moving averages to detect periods of miner stress. When the 30-day MA of the hashrate falls below the 60-day MA, it signals that mining difficulty is rising relative to miner profitability. In these phases, less efficient miners are often forced to scale back operations or shut down entirely, reducing the overall network hashrate. While mining difficulty itself is influenced by several factors — including electricity costs, hardware efficiency, block rewards, and, of course, Bitcoin’s price — the key point is that miner capitulation tends to create short-term selling pressure. Miners may liquidate part of their reserves to stay afloat, often contributing to temporary weakness in the market. However, Darkfost emphasizes that these periods of stress historically present strong mid-cycle accumulation opportunities. As weaker miners exit and difficulty adjusts downward, the market often enters a healthier phase where selling pressure subsides, and long-term participants begin to accumulate BTC at discounted prices. Over the years, Hash Ribbon buy signals have frequently marked early stages of major recoveries, offering investors a structural, data-driven advantage even when sentiment appears uncertain. Testing Support as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin continues to trade just above the $90,000 level, showing signs of stabilization after several weeks of heavy downside momentum. The chart reveals that BTC has bounced off the 100-day moving average (green), which is now acting as a key dynamic support zone. This level has historically served as an important midpoint during major pullbacks, and the market’s ability to hold above it suggests that selling pressure may be easing. However, the price remains well below the 50-day moving average (blue), which has begun to curve downward — a signal that short-term momentum still leans bearish. For a stronger recovery, Bitcoin must reclaim this moving average and convert it into support. Until then, rallies may struggle to extend meaningfully. Volume has also compressed significantly compared to the earlier stages of the uptrend. This decline indicates hesitation from both buyers and sellers, often typical during consolidation phases following sharp corrections. The lack of aggressive selling is a constructive sign, but the absence of strong buy-side interest keeps BTC vulnerable to further swings. If Bitcoin holds above the $90K–$88K area, it could build a base for a broader rebound. A breakdown below this region, however, would open the door to deeper retracements toward the mid-$80K range.

The analysis compares the current weekly structure with past market cycles, focusing on how XRP behaved after similar dips. In previous instances, marked on the chart as June 2022 and July 2024, XRP formed clear lows before rallying by approximately 226.6%, 789.35% and later 126.2%. These moves are shown as measured percentage expansions from the identified bottom to the next significant high. According to the chart, XRP is again positioned near a weekly low, indicated by a circle around late December 2025. The analyst uses a dotted upward projection to illustrate the potential path if XRP repeats its earlier pattern of recovering strongly from comparable points. The intention is not to predict an exact price but to highlight how the structure resembles previous phases that preceded major upward moves . $XRP HISTORICAL BUYING OPPORTUNITY! pic.twitter.com/8huYQtuy9a — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 6, 2025 Sentiment Levels Reinforcing the Setup The lower section of the shared image displays the weekly Crypto Fear and Greed Index. Stephiscrypto notes that every time the indicator reached similarly low levels in the past, XRP was close to forming a bottom. These low readings appear around the same periods as the price lows marked on the chart. The most recent sentiment dip falls within this same range, which the analyst views as supportive of the idea that the market may be nearing exhaustion on the downside. The alignment between sentiment lows and price turning points is presented as an additional signal rather than a guarantee. It is meant to show that current market conditions resemble earlier stages where XRP eventually shifted from decline to recovery. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additional Perspective from the Community A user named David commented on the analysis, noting that while he supports XRP, he remains cautious due to the broader influence of Bitcoin . He points out that Bitcoin’s chart still shapes overall market movement and believes XRP’s weekly performance has not yet displayed its potential. The analyst’s chart does not dismiss this point. The recurring patterns shown are tied to general market cycles, suggesting that correlation remains an important factor. Stephiscrypto’s post outlines a technical case for why XRP may be entering a historically favorable zone for accumulation. The argument is based on repeating weekly structures, previous recovery percentages, and sentiment lows that match present conditions. While this does not assure the same outcome, it offers a structured way to understand where XRP currently stands in relation to its past cycles.

Here’s the implication,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-breaks-below-its-3-day-gaussian-channel-heres-the-implication/,"Crypto analyst StephisCrypto flagged a breach of XRP’s 3-day Gaussian Channel, noting that each prior breakdown from this indicator preceded deeper declines and extended periods of bearish price action. The chart attached to the analyst’s update overlays multiple historical episodes — labelled breaks in 2014, 2016, 2019, and 2022 — and highlights the duration, in bars and days, of the consolidation and drawdown phases that followed those breaks. The current break is presented alongside those prior instances to emphasize the historical tendency for follow-through weakness after a channel breach on this timeframe. $XRP has broken below its 3-day Gaussian Channel and historically, every breakdown has led to significantly more downside followed by a long stretch of bearish price action. Should we be worried? pic.twitter.com/eaiwXHzP7n — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 7, 2025 Market implications and timeframe considerations The analyst’s framing treats the 3-day XRP Gaussian Channel as a multi-year structural tool rather than a short-term oscillator. In prior episodes shown on the chart, the market did not resume sustained upward momentum immediately after a channel breach; rather, prices experienced additional downside and lengthy consolidations that extended for many months. By comparing the most recent breach with previous ones, the analyst suggests that traders and longer-term holders should view a break below this channel as a risk factor for further price erosion and protracted market neutrality. The chart annotations quantify prior consolidation windows in bars and days, reinforcing the view that the timeframe of meaningful market responses to these breaks is measured in months rather than days. XRP Community’s reactions and trading posture Community responses to the update demonstrate a cautious stance among active traders. One respondent recommended against initiating fresh long positions and urged observers to monitor structural support and key zones before considering entries. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another participant expressed a personal view that lower levels would be preferable for accumulation ahead of a seasonal liquidity event, while acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in the current price action. These comments reflect a split between tactical caution and opportunistic accumulation depending on individual risk tolerances and objectives. Risk management and practical takeaways The analyst’s post is essentially a technical risk signal: a breach of a multi-day channel that historically preceded further weakness. For market participants, the key practical considerations are to reassess position sizing, confirm support levels on lower timeframes, and avoid assuming that a channel breach will automatically lead to an immediate recovery. Because the chart focuses on historical patterns , the appropriate response depends on each participant’s investment horizon, liquidity needs, and risk tolerance.

The launch is powered by Coinbase’s Crypto-as-a-Service platform, marking a major step forward in the integration of digital assets into the country’s traditional banking system. Today marks a major milestone for institutional crypto adoption. @Coinbase ’s Crypto-as-a-Service platform is now powering @PNCBank ’s launch of direct bitcoin trading for PNC Private Bank clients – the first to market with such an offering among the major U.S. banks. pic.twitter.com/wwuOIRuBfK — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) December 9, 2025 The partnership pairs PNC’s scale as a top-10 U.S. bank with Coinbase’s leading crypto infrastructure, creating a seamless experience for clients who want to buy, sell, and hold bitcoin directly within their trusted banking environment. The move arrives at a time when institutional pathways into crypto are expanding at record speed. A First-of-Its-Kind Bitcoin Trading Experience for U.S. Bank Clients With this rollout, PNC Private Bank clients now gain the ability to access direct Bitcoin trading without opening accounts on external exchanges. Everything happens inside PNC’s existing banking platform, an experience designed to feel familiar, secure, and fully integrated. Clients can buy, sell, and hold bitcoin through the bank’s interface in the same way they manage their traditional financial assets. Coinbase provides the backend infrastructure, execution, custody architecture, and compliance rails, while PNC delivers the client-facing experience. This approach removes friction, simplifies onboarding, and places bitcoin alongside conventional investment tools. For many high-net-worth clients who prefer to operate within long-trusted financial institutions, this model unlocks digital assets in the most comfortable way possible. Why Coinbase’s Infrastructure Matters Coinbase’s Crypto-as-a-Service platform is engineered to integrate directly with large financial institutions. The product allows banks to offer digital-asset services natively, without needing to build trading, custody, or compliance systems from scratch. By partnering with Coinbase, PNC gains access to: • Market-grade execution infrastructure • Regulated custody systems • Compliance and transaction monitoring tools • Scalable digital-asset architecture • Crypto liquidity with institutional protections Coinbase says this collaboration is part of a broader mission to enable “seamless access to digital assets within trusted financial systems,” reinforcing the idea that crypto is moving from standalone platforms into mainstream finance. Today marks a major milestone for institutional crypto adoption. @Coinbase ’s Crypto-as-a-Service platform is now powering @PNCBank ’s launch of direct bitcoin trading for PNC Private Bank clients – the first to market with such an offering among the major U.S. banks. pic.twitter.com/wwuOIRuBfK — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) December 9, 2025 For Coinbase, this continues a trend of high-profile institutional partnerships. For PNC, it represents a forward-moving shift toward a new class of financial services that blend traditional banking with emerging asset classes. The Broader Regulatory and Market Context Behind PNC’s Timing The timing of PNC’s launch is not accidental. Several developments across U.S. financial markets have accelerated the movement of traditional institutions into digital assets. Earlier this year: • The CFTC allowed Bitcoin to be used as derivatives collateral, marking a new level of institutional recognition. • Vanguard enabled access to crypto ETFs for over 50 million customers, signaling that even legacy conservative institutions could adopt certain forms of digital-asset exposure. These shifts reflect a broader normalization of crypto in mainstream finance. As regulatory clarity improves and market infrastructure matures, banks are beginning to deliver crypto services directly rather than pushing clients toward external exchanges. PNC’s decision positions the bank as an early mover at a moment when institutional adoption is not only growing, but accelerating. Why This Integration Sets a New Standard for U.S. Banking PNC is the first major U.S. bank to deploy direct bitcoin trading, but this breakthrough signals a much broader shift in how banks may approach digital assets in the coming years. The partnership introduces a new model: • Bitcoin trading happens inside the banking platform, not through third-party accounts. • Custody and trading infrastructure are handled by Coinbase, a regulated and publicly traded company. • Clients access bitcoin through channels they already trust. • Banks keep client relationships, compliance visibility, and data control. This combination, a trusted bank front-end with a regulated crypto infrastructure back-end, creates a template that other U.S. institutions may now look to replicate. For high-net-worth clients, this solves the biggest barriers they face: security concerns, complex onboarding, fragmented platforms, and the lack of integrated wealth-management oversight. For the banking industry, it offers a pathway to meet rising demand without building full crypto systems internally. A Milestone That Signals the Next Phase of U.S. Crypto Adoption PNC’s launch with Coinbase is more than just a new product offering. It represents a structural shift in how the banking sector views digital assets. Bitcoin is no longer treated as an experimental category held at arm’s length. Instead, it is being embedded into the same systems that manage deposits, credit, wealth management, and estate planning. The move also reflects changing expectations among affluent clients. Crypto is no longer just for retail traders or niche investment platforms. It is becoming a component of diversified portfolios, long-term planning strategies, and institutional wealth management frameworks. With PNC stepping forward as the first major U.S. bank to offer direct bitcoin trading, the financial industry now enters a new phase, one where digital assets sit inside the traditional banking experience rather than outside it. As Coinbase and PNC frame it, the goal is simple: Enable seamless access to digital assets inside the world’s most trusted financial systems. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

We think this… pic.twitter.com/8n8NgEekxO — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) December 9, 2025 BITW enters the market as the largest crypto index fund in the world, holding $1.25 billion in assets under management as of today. The fund’s eight-year track record now extends to a fully tradable exchange-listed product, giving investors a way to own a diversified basket of major crypto assets in a single ticker. A New Option for Investors Who Don’t Want to Pick Winners Crypto continues to grow, but for many investors the challenge remains the same: choosing which assets to back and keeping up with daily market changes. Bitwise argues that BITW solves this problem directly. The fund gives investors exposure to the largest crypto assets by market capitalization, whatever they happen to be at any point in time. Instead of predicting which blockchain ecosystem will dominate, BITW provides a broad index that automatically adjusts to market trends. This makes the product attractive to investors who believe in crypto’s long-term potential but prefer not to make individual asset bets. The listing offers a simple message: rather than guess the next big winner, an investor can choose BITW and let the index determine the allocation. How BITW Works: A Monthly-Rebalanced Basket of Top 10 Crypto Assets BITW holds a single basket of ten leading crypto assets, ranked by market cap, screened for risk, and rebalanced every month. The structure is flexible, and there is no cap on the largest position. This means allocation follows market reality without artificial limits. If the market consolidates and Bitcoin becomes the only asset with lasting value, BITW would automatically tilt toward almost entirely Bitcoin. If instead the market expands and eight different assets emerge as strong long-term players, the fund adjusts to include them too, even if some of those assets have not yet been created. The core idea is straightforward: BITW adapts as the crypto landscape shifts. Investors don’t need to forecast which tokens will succeed or collapse; the index handles that filtering. Screened for Liquidity, Security, and Compliance The underlying Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index is built to navigate the unique risks of digital assets. It uses strict screening rules that incorporate liquidity thresholds, security considerations, and compliance checks. These filters matter. In 2022, during the market turmoil, LUNA reached top-10 status by market cap. But despite its size, it was never admitted into the index because the screening process flagged concerns about the asset’s fundamentals and stability. BITW investors were therefore shielded from one of the most dramatic asset collapses in crypto history. To keep the process transparent, Bitwise publishes monthly updates showing which assets are entering or exiting the index. This information is released publicly, at the same time, to the entire market, no private access, no preferential treatment. A Product With High Potential and High Risk Bitwise emphasizes that BITW is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, it does not offer the same investor protections that govern mutual funds or traditional ETFs. The company outlines this clearly. BITW is not suitable for all investors. It carries significant risk and heightened volatility, and there is always the possibility of losing the entire invested amount. An investment in BITW is not a direct investment in crypto assets themselves. Instead, it tracks the performance of the index it is designed to replicate. Foreside Fund Services, LLC serves as the Marketing Agent for BITW. Bitwise states these disclosures openly to make sure investors understand the structure and risk profile before engaging with the product. Bitwise’s Long Road to Bringing Crypto Indexing to the U.S. Market Bitwise has been building toward this moment since 2017. Over the years, the firm has positioned itself as a key player in expanding investor access to digital assets. With the launch of BITW on NYSE Arca, the company says it is delivering a product investors have asked for repeatedly: a regulated exchange-traded product that captures the broad crypto market through a single index. The company’s announcement on X reflects that sentiment directly. Bitwise calls 2025 a breakout year for the space and says it has never been more optimistic about the opportunities ahead. Today: The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF ($BITW) begins trading on @NYSE Arca as an exchange-traded product! Thanks to our dedicated investors, BITW is the largest crypto index fund in the world, with $1.25B in AUM (as of today) alongside an eight-year track record. We think this… pic.twitter.com/8n8NgEekxO — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) December 9, 2025 The listing reinforces Bitwise’s bet that indexed exposure, not single-asset speculation, will become a core part of the crypto investment landscape. As more investors look for structured ways to participate in digital assets, BITW offers a familiar ETF-style wrapper built around the sector’s largest names. With the product now trading live on NYSE Arca, Bitwise says it is excited to continue working alongside the investors who helped make the fund the largest crypto index product in the world.

According to data from Arkham Intelligence reported by The Block, these wallets transferred approximately $3.14 million in Bitcoin to an anonymous address. This mysterious activity raises critical questions about market impact, ownership, and the long shadow of crypto’s most infamous marketplace. Let’s unravel this cryptic event. What Exactly Happened with the Silk Road Wallets? The activity was not a single transaction but a coordinated movement. A cluster of 312 separate Silk Road wallets began transferring their holdings to a single, anonymous Bitcoin address starting with “bc1q.” The total value moved was $3.14 million. Crucially, this is not a complete liquidation. The wallets involved still hold a staggering $41.3 million in Bitcoin , meaning this could be just the beginning of a larger movement. The timing is particularly intriguing. This flurry of transactions occurred shortly after former President Donald Trump commuted the life sentence of Silk Road founder, Ross Ulbricht. While no direct link has been established, the coincidence has fueled intense speculation within crypto circles. The core mystery remains: who controls these wallets now, and what is their intent? Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This Transfer? This event is more than a historical footnote; it has real implications for today’s market. Large, sudden movements from dormant wallets can influence Bitcoin’s price through several mechanisms: Market Sentiment: The movement of “sleeping” coins, especially from a notorious source, can create uncertainty and volatility. Sell Pressure: If the transferred $3.1 million in BTC is sent to an exchange and sold, it adds immediate selling pressure to the market. Regulatory Scrutiny: Activity linked to Silk Road inevitably draws the attention of regulators and law enforcement, potentially impacting broader market sentiment. Furthermore, blockchain analysts are now closely watching the destination address. Any subsequent movement to a known exchange address could signal an imminent sell-off. For investors, monitoring these Silk Road wallets provides a unique window into potential market-moving events. What Are the Possible Explanations for This Activity? The purpose behind the transfer is shrouded in mystery. However, several plausible theories have emerged from industry observers: Consolidation by an Owner: A current controller may be gathering funds from many old wallets into one for easier management or future action. Law Enforcement Action: Authorities could have finally gained access and are securing the assets, possibly for eventual auction or seizure. Private Key Discovery: Someone may have rediscovered or cracked the private keys to these dormant addresses after a decade. Each scenario carries different consequences. A private sale could drip coins into the market slowly, while a government auction would likely be a single, large, and public event. The anonymity of the receiving address makes it impossible to know for sure, keeping the crypto community on alert. How Does This Relate to Ross Ulbricht’s Pardon? The proximity of these transactions to Ross Ulbricht’s commutation is the elephant in the room. Ulbricht himself has stated he does not control these assets. The funds are widely believed to be held by the U.S. government, which seized them years ago. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that this is an administrative move by a government agency, perhaps preparing for asset disposal or transfer between internal wallets. This theory is bolstered by the methodical, batch-transfer nature of the transactions, which resembles treasury management rather than a private individual’s action. Regardless of the actor, the awakening of these Silk Road wallets is a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s immutable and transparent ledger, where history is never truly forgotten. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call from Crypto’s Past The sudden activity from the Silk Road wallets is a captivating narrative that blends crypto history, market mechanics, and ongoing mystery. It demonstrates how dormant blockchain assets can resurface without warning, potentially affecting market dynamics. For investors, the key takeaway is vigilance. Tracking such movements is part of understanding the complex, on-chain ecosystem that drives Bitcoin. This event underscores that in the world of cryptocurrency, the past can—and does—suddenly become very present. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who owns the Silk Road Bitcoin wallets now? A1: The prevailing belief is that the U.S. government controls most of these seized assets, though the recent transfer’s executor has not been officially identified. Q2: Could this Bitcoin transfer affect the price of BTC? A2: Yes, potentially. If the moved $3.1 million is sold on an exchange, it creates sell pressure. The news itself can also influence trader sentiment and cause short-term volatility. Q3: What is the connection to Ross Ulbricht’s pardon? A3: The timing is coincidental but notable. Ulbricht has denied control of the funds. The transfer is likely an unrelated action by the current asset holder, possibly the government. Q4: How can I track these wallets? A4: You can monitor the addresses using blockchain explorers like Arkham Intelligence, Etherscan (for ETH-based trackers), or Mempool.space, which provide real-time transaction data. Q5: Are the remaining $41.3 million in BTC likely to move soon? A5: There is no certainty. The movement of the first $3.1 million suggests the wallets are active, making further transfers a possibility that market watchers are preparing for. Q6: Is it illegal to own Bitcoin from Silk Road? A6: Owning Bitcoin itself is not illegal. However, knowingly receiving or transacting with assets that are proven to be the direct proceeds of crime can have legal consequences, depending on jurisdiction and circumstances.

The project arrives as a number of major financial firms accelerate their exploration of stablecoins after the US GENIUS Act. Companies like Citigroup, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Western Union and Visa are testing or expanding blockchain-based settlement tools. Circle Unveils Private USDCx Stablecoin issuer Circle is taking a big step toward bringing blockchain payments deeper into the institutional mainstream by developing a new privacy-enhanced version of USDC. The token is known as USDCx, and it is designed specifically for banks and enterprises that want the speed and efficiency of blockchain payments without exposing sensitive financial data on public ledgers. According to a report from Fortune , the new token is being built in collaboration with privacy-focused blockchain developer Aleo. Co-founder Howard Wu said the goal is to offer “banking-level privacy,” which has long been missing from traditional public blockchains, where wallet addresses and transaction details are openly viewable. The goal of USDCx is to strike a balance between confidentiality and regulatory compliance. While the token’s on-chain activity will be shielded from public view, Circle will still be able to produce compliance records upon official request from law enforcement or regulators. This hybrid model could solve one of the biggest barriers preventing major financial institutions from using blockchain rails: the fear that exposing internal payment flows could compromise competitive or confidential information. Aleo firmly believes that transparency, which is often called a core blockchain strength, becomes a weakness in real enterprise settings where privacy is not optional. Circle is not the only company working on privacy-preserving digital dollars. Digital asset infrastructure provider Taurus recently introduced a private smart-contract framework that enables stablecoin transfers without revealing counterparties or transaction details. This design is tailored for corporate payrolls and intracompany settlements. The rollout of the US GENIUS Act, the first comprehensive US regulatory framework for dollar-based stablecoins, triggered what some analysts are calling a corporate stablecoin race. Citigroup is now collaborating with Coinbase to test stablecoin-powered payment rails, while JPMorgan and Bank of America are experimenting with their own early blockchain settlement concepts. Western Union is building a digital asset settlement platform on Solana and plans to issue its own US Dollar Payment Token, and Visa expanded its stablecoin integrations to stay competitive in the global payments landscape. USDC and Tether’s USDT alone make up about 85% of all stablecoin activity , while synthetic dollars and PayPal’s PYUSD have grown into major players.

Across Asia, currency traders are navigating a complex web of signals: a hesitant Federal Reserve, persistent China deflation , and a US dollar that has lost its decisive momentum. For investors watching global liquidity and capital flows, this moment of caution in traditional Asia FX markets could signal shifting tides that impact digital asset valuations and cross-border investment strategies. The immediate question is whether this is a pause or a pivot. Why is the US Dollar Muted Despite Global Uncertainty? The US dollar index (DXY), a measure against a basket of major currencies, has been trading in a tight range. This lack of direction stems directly from the Federal Reserve’s communication. Recent minutes and speeches have emphasized a data-dependent approach, creating what analysts call ‘Fed caution.’ The market is parsing every economic indicator, looking for clues on the timing and pace of potential rate cuts. This uncertainty has removed a key driver of dollar strength—the clear expectation of aggressive monetary policy divergence from other central banks. China’s Deflation Problem: A Drag on Asia FX Sentiment New data confirms a troubling trend for the world’s second-largest economy. China’s consumer prices fell for a third consecutive month, while producer prices extended a long-running decline. This persistent China deflation presents a multi-faceted challenge: Domestic Demand: Falling prices encourage consumers and businesses to delay spending, waiting for cheaper goods tomorrow, which further weakens economic activity. Currency Pressure: Deflation typically increases the real value of debt and can lead to calls for more aggressive monetary stimulus, which may weaken the yuan. Regional Spillover: As the economic engine of Asia, China’s weakness dampens growth prospects and trade flows for its neighbors, weighing on their currencies. The People’s Bank of China faces a delicate balancing act: providing enough support to combat deflation without triggering excessive capital outflows or currency depreciation. How Are Major Asia FX Pairs Reacting? The reaction across the Asia FX spectrum has been mixed but generally subdued, reflecting the wait-and-see environment. Currency Pair Recent Trend Key Driver USD/CNY (Offshore Yuan) Stable with slight weakening bias PBOC fixing, deflation data USD/JPY (Japanese Yen) Consolidating near multi-decade highs Bank of Japan policy divergence from Fed AUD/USD (Australian Dollar) Range-bound, sensitive to China news Iron ore prices, Chinese import demand USD/INR (Indian Rupee) Resilient, supported by central bank intervention Strong domestic growth, RBI forex reserves This table shows that while the broad forex market theme is caution, local factors and central bank actions are creating important divergences. The Federal Reserve’s Next Move: What’s Priced In? The core of the current forex market stalemate is Fed caution . Market-implied probabilities from the CME FedWatch Tool show traders have significantly dialed back expectations for rapid interest rate cuts in 2024. The focus has shifted from ‘when’ the Fed will cut to ‘if’ and ‘by how much.’ This repricing has removed a tailwind for risk-sensitive Asian currencies, which often benefit from a weaker dollar and lower US yields. Until the Fed provides clearer guidance—likely dependent on upcoming inflation and jobs reports—the US dollar may lack a sustained trend, keeping Asia FX pairs in their recent ranges. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Navigating this environment requires a nuanced approach. Here are key considerations: Watch the Data: High-impact US data (CPI, NFP) will be critical for breaking the dollar’s stalemate. In Asia, watch for any shift in Chinese policy response to deflation. Central Bank Rhetoric: Listen for any change in tone from Fed officials. Similarly, statements from the PBOC, Bank of Japan, and Reserve Bank of India will guide their respective currencies. Correlation Awareness: Understand that in a risk-off environment driven by Fed caution or China worries, correlations can break down. Traditional safe-havens may behave differently. Range-Trading Strategies: In the absence of a clear trend, strategies that profit from currency pairs bouncing between established support and resistance levels may be more effective than directional bets. Conclusion: A Market at an Inflection Point The current pause in the forex market is not a sign of calm, but of concentrated tension. Asia FX movements are trapped between the rock of Fed caution and the hard place of China deflation . The muted US dollar reflects this equilibrium. The coming weeks will be decisive. Stronger US data could revive the dollar’s uptrend, pressuring Asian currencies. Conversely, a decisive shift from the Fed toward easing or a successful policy push from China to reflate its economy could unlock the next leg of weakness for the dollar and strength for regional currencies. For now, patience and selective positioning are the watchwords.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is causing deflation in China? China’s deflation is driven by weak consumer demand following the pandemic, a prolonged crisis in the property sector, and high local government debt, which is limiting fiscal stimulus. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has room to cut rates but is proceeding cautiously. Who is the current Chair of the Federal Reserve? The Chair of the Federal Reserve is Jerome Powell . His public statements and congressional testimonies are closely watched by the forex market for signals on US monetary policy. Which Asian central bank is most likely to intervene in currency markets? The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) are known for active management of their exchange rates to ensure stability. The Bank of Japan also intervenes occasionally to curb excessive yen weakness. How does China’s economy affect the Australian Dollar? China is Australia’s largest trading partner. Weakness in Chinese demand, especially for key Australian exports like iron ore, directly pressures the Australian Dollar (AUD). Therefore, China deflation data is a critical release for AUD traders.

It later revealed plans to acquire 75,000 BTC, then valued at over $8 billion, from claims related to the defunct Mt. Gox exchange bankruptcy. Strive’s recent Bitcoin buying spree reflects Michael Saylor’s playbook, representing another public company focused on increasing Bitcoin per share. The company has also urged index provider MSCI to rethink its plan to exclude digital asset treasury (DAT) firms from its global indexes. Strive submitted a seven-page letter to the MSCI chairman , arguing that the proposal risks shutting passive investors out of key growth markets.

This expansion of its Binance USD1 spot pairs offering provides users with more direct trading options against a major stablecoin, set to go live at 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 11. Let’s explore what this means for the market and your trading strategy. What Are the New Binance USD1 Spot Pairs? Binance is introducing direct trading avenues between three major cryptocurrencies and the USD1 stablecoin. The specific pairs are BNB/USD1, ETH/USD1, and SOL/USD1. This listing allows traders to buy and sell Binance Coin, Ethereum, and Solana directly using USD1, potentially simplifying transactions and improving liquidity for these assets. The launch is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 11. Therefore, traders should mark their calendars and prepare their accounts for this new opportunity. This move highlights Binance’s ongoing commitment to expanding its market offerings and catering to diverse trader needs. Why Does Listing New Spot Pairs Matter? Adding new Binance USD1 spot pairs is more than just a technical update. It has real implications for market dynamics and user experience. Firstly, it increases accessibility. Traders can now execute trades between these popular coins and a stablecoin without needing to use an intermediate trading pair, which can reduce complexity and transaction costs. Secondly, it enhances liquidity. By providing a direct market, Binance can concentrate trading volume, which typically leads to tighter bid-ask spreads and better price discovery for BNB, ETH, and SOL. This is beneficial for both retail and institutional participants. Simplified Trading: Direct conversion between asset and stablecoin. Potential for Better Pricing: Concentrated liquidity can improve spreads. Strategic Expansion: Signals Binance’s support for these specific blockchain ecosystems. How Can Traders Prepare for the Launch? With the launch of these Binance USD1 spot pairs approaching, being prepared is key. Ensure your Binance account is verified and funded. You may want to deposit USD1 or the relevant cryptocurrencies (BNB, ETH, SOL) ahead of time to be ready for the market open. Furthermore, consider your trading strategy. New pairs can sometimes experience high volatility in the initial minutes or hours as order books establish. Decide in advance if you are looking to trade immediately for short-term movement or if you are using this as a long-term entry point. Always remember to use risk management tools like stop-loss orders. What Is the Broader Impact on the Crypto Market? Listings on a major exchange like Binance often serve as a bullish signal for an asset. It increases visibility, accessibility, and legitimacy. The introduction of these specific Binance USD1 spot pairs reinforces the standing of BNB, ETH, and SOL as core portfolio assets in the crypto space. Moreover, it underscores the growing importance of stablecoin-based trading pairs. As regulatory landscapes evolve, trading against compliant stablecoins like USD1 may become increasingly standard. This move by Binance could be seen as positioning ahead of that trend, offering users a stable and familiar quote currency. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Accessibility Binance’s decision to list the BNB/USD1, ETH/USD1, and SOL/USD1 spot pairs is a strategic enhancement to its platform. It simplifies the trading process for three top cryptocurrencies, potentially improves market efficiency, and aligns with broader industry shifts towards stablecoin liquidity. For traders, it presents new, direct avenues to manage portfolios and react to market movements starting December 11. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What time exactly do the new Binance USD1 spot pairs go live? A1: The BNB/USD1, ETH/USD1, and SOL/USD1 spot trading pairs will be available for trading at 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 11. Q2: Is USD1 a different stablecoin from USDT or USDC? A2: Yes, USD1 is a distinct stablecoin. It is crucial to confirm it is the specific stablecoin supported in your region on Binance before depositing.

Key Takeaways: Solana is undergoing a “full liquidity reset,” with realized losses exceeding profits and liquidity falling. Exchange outflows and steady ETF inflows are providing structural support despite thinning liquidity. Analysts see potential recovery by early January, but near-term volatility remains high. According to Glassnode , Solana’s 30-day average realized profit-to-loss ratio has remained below 1 since mid-November, a level typically associated with bear-market behavior. A reading under 1 means traders are realizing losses more often than profits, signalling deteriorating sentiment and reduced liquidity. Analysts Say Solana Entering “Full Liquidity Reset” On-chain research group Altcoin Vector described the current environment as a “full liquidity reset,” a pattern that has historically marked the beginning of new liquidity cycles and preceded market bottoms. If the structure mirrors April’s setup, analysts said liquidity could begin to recover in roughly four weeks, pointing to early January for potential renewed momentum. A key lesson in alt positioning: when liquidity ignites, the move is fast. $SOL is under a full liquidity reset, setting a new liquidity cycle, as in past bottoming phases. Forced selling exhausts, the ecosystem cleans from the inside out, and SOL begins building the base for… pic.twitter.com/tiLw6gwhdb — Altcoin Vector (@altcoinvector) December 5, 2025 Despite the pressure, Solana isn’t without support. Persistent withdrawals from centralized exchanges have steadily reduced available supply, while demand from ETF buyers continues to build. Spot Solana ETFs recorded $17.72 million in net inflows so far this week, nearly matching last week’s $20.30 million, according to SoSoValue. Still, the broader environment remains fragile. Elevated leverage across crypto markets has amplified volatility, with CoinGlass reporting $432 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours. Solana accounted for $15.6 million of that, making it the third-most liquidated asset behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the token climbed 3.2% on the day, per CoinGecko. Analysts say the mid- to long-term outlook for Solana remains slightly constructive, especially if macro uncertainty clears and liquidity returns to the market. However, in the near term, shrinking profitability, thinning liquidity, and heavy leverage leave the asset vulnerable to sharp swings. As reported, Pye Finance has revealed a $5 million seed round led by some of the major players in the space. The goal is to turn billions in locked SOL stakes into an active yield market. Variant and Coinbase Ventures led this round, with participation from Solana Labs, Nascent, Gemini, and others, according to the press release. Pye says that it’s building bond markets for validators and stakers on Solana (SOL) . The platform enables validators to draw and keep stake. They can offer rewards across more than a thousand validators. Fed Liquidity Boost Could Send Bitcoin “Sharply Higher” As reported, Bitcoin’s climb above $92,000 has stirred fresh optimism among market watchers who now believe this week’s Federal Reserve meeting could set off a far bigger rally. Analysts at the London Crypto Club say a liquidity boost from the Fed on Wednesday may act as a powerful catalyst, potentially driving the world’s largest cryptocurrency “sharply higher.” In their latest note, David Brickell and Chris Mills argue that the central bank is poised to deliver a “dovish surprise,” forecasting that policymakers will inject liquidity through a creative bond-buying mechanism rather than explicit quantitative easing. “We’re moving into a continued rate-cutting cycle accompanied by balance sheet expansion as the Fed effectively turns on the money printers to monetise the deficit,” they wrote. Meanwhile, a key on-chain indicator known as “liveliness” is climbing again , even as Bitcoin’s price action remains subdued. Analysts say the divergence suggests renewed underlying demand, with dormant coins moving at levels not seen in years, a sign that long-term holders may be re-entering the market. Last week, Bitfinex said the market is showing “seller exhaustion” following a period of heavy deleveraging and panic-driven exits by short-term holders.

After months of enthusiasm surrounding spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), new data has shown that ETF flows have sunk to their worst monthly total since their launch. The sharp drop reflects a broader cooldown in investor demand, as market volatility and shifting risk appetite weigh on crypto allocations. Will Staking ETFs Emerge To Stabilize Flows? In an X post, a crypto analyst known as Milk Road revealed that the Ethereum ETFs had just printed their worst month on record since launch, which is roughly $1.4 billion in net outflows, the largest single-month withdrawal that ETH has ever encountered. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Signs Of Accumulation As CVD Strengthens And Correlation Stays Elevated Historically, ETF flow reversals tell more about liquidity pressure in the broader financial system than the long-term fundamentals of the asset itself. When redemptions spike this hard, it’s usually a sign that broader risk sentiment is cracking, not that the asset itself broke. Meanwhile, most investors don’t know that while ETFs were handing back, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) stepped in as aggressive buyers. BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) quietly added over 300,000 ETH, worth nearly $800 million at the time, to its treasuries. If the ETF outflow continues to accelerate, the near-term price action will remain choppy as liquidity gets strained at the edges. However, if DAT inflows continue scaling, it builds the foundation for a tighter supply setup into 2026. The tension between this panicked short-term selling pressure and the quiet structural long-term accumulation is the most important dynamic for positioning. Why ETH Reserves Are Becoming Strategic Corporate Assets Crypto trader Bull Theory has noted that last week, BitMine bought an astonishing 138,452 ETH, worth $437.7 million. This single transaction solidifies their position as the largest ETH treasury in the world, holding 3.86 million ETH, valued at $12.4 billion and accounting for 3.2% of the entire circulating supply. Related Reading: Here’s Why Ethereum Emerges As The Global Capital Rails For On-Chain Finance The true source of rising ETH demand is that Wall Street is quietly building on ETH. BlackRock, with $13.5 trillion AUM, has launched tokenized funds on ETH and has filed for a staked ETH ETF. JPMorgan, with $4 trillion, Deutsche Bank, with $1.1 trillion, and Standard Chartered, with $800 billion, are developing tokenization and DeFi infrastructure using ETH and its Layer-2 networks. Institutions like Amundi, HSBC, BNY Mellon, Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood are all using ETH rails for custody and settlement or rollup infrastructure for scaling and security. Furthermore, large companies are now holding and staking ETH for yield. BitMine alone expects to generate $400 million+ a year in staking revenue from its position. Tom Lee believes that as staking demand grows and institutions scale tokenization increases, ETH could reach $12,000 in 2026. “A Bitcoin miner is now the largest Ethereum whale, Wall Street is building on ETH, and treasuries are shifting toward yield. ETH is quickly becoming part of the Global Financial System.” Bull Theory noted.

55584037,642582,1765346408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55584037.jpeg,Why 2026 Is Unlikely To Be Crypto’s Next Bust Year: Bitwise CIO,https://bitcoinist.com/why-2026-unlikely-crypto-next-bust-year-bitwise-cio/,"Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says the crypto market is anchored to the wrong mental model. Speaking on the Empire podcast recorded 5 December and released on 8 December, he argued that the traditional “four-year Bitcoin cycle” has lost its explanatory power – and that 2026, which many expect to be a brutal post-halving down year, is far more likely to be an “up year” driven by institutional flows and regulatory tailwinds. “2026 will not be a bad year, Jason,” Hougan told host Jason Yanowitz. “I think 2026 will be a good year I just don’t understand the logical reason why [the four-year cycle] would repeat again. It’s not like built into a mechanical clock. It was driven by specific factors and those factors no longer exist, so it won’t keep happening.” He acknowledged that recent price action has unnerved investors, with Bitcoin giving back a “ Vanguard pump” and selling off into a weekend on no obvious news. But he framed that as positioning and microstructure, not the start of a structural unwind. “People in crypto over the last two months have learned to be nervous on weekends,” he said, pointing to thin weekend liquidity and Friday macro headlines. He noted that sentiment is depressed even though “the market is flat for the year,” adding: “We’re freaking out about a market that is flat for the year.” Why The 4-Year Crypto Cycle Is Dead Hougan broke down the four main explanations traditionally used to justify the Bitcoin cycle and argued each is now materially weaker. First is the halving itself. “The halving cycle is just not that important,” he said. “It’s half as important as it was four years ago […] a fraction of, you know, a quarter as important as it was eight years ago, a sixteenth, etc. There’s just not that much supply being removed.” As issuance becomes a smaller fraction of total supply and ETF and derivatives flows grow, the mechanical supply shock carries less weight. Second is the rate cycle. Prior “down years” such as 2018 and 2022 coincided with aggressive rate hikes. “Interest rates are going down,” he said. “So that thesis is just completely invalidated, right? It’s completely different.” Third is the “blow-up” pattern – Mt. Gox , ICOs, FTX – that historically capped euphoric phases. Hougan allowed that balance-sheet stress in parts of the market is “the strongest case for the four-year cycle repeating,” but he does not expect forced liquidations on the scale of prior collapses. In his view, potential problem entities are more likely to “just not buy as much in the future” rather than being compelled sellers. Fourth is simple randomness: three similar cycles do not make a law of nature. “Across those four, they’re all much weaker than they were in the past,” he summarised. Why 2026 Is Poised To Be Better Than 2025 Against that, Hougan set what he sees as a once-in-a-generation shift in regulation and institutional behaviour. “You have a once-in-a-generation regulatory change from severe regulatory headwinds to strong regulatory tailwinds,” he said, and “more importantly, you have this institutional adoption narrative that’s going to overwhelm everything.” In the last six months, he noted, major US wirehouses have “green-lit crypto exposure.” He singled out Bank of America : “They have $3.5 trillion in assets. One percent is $35 billion. Four percent is like $140 billion. That’s more than the total flows into Bitcoin ETFs so far.” He stressed it is not just one bank: “There are four wirehouses. They’re basically all on now […] the biggest advisory groups all managing many trillions of dollars.” The catch is timing. Institutional allocations are slow and process-driven. “The average Bitwise client, I think, invests after eight meetings with us,” he said, and some of those are quarterly. That “eight-meeting” lag means the ETF era is still in its early innings; the full impact of platforms being switched on is more likely to manifest through 2026 than in a single explosive quarter. Hougan also emphasised that advisers optimise for client retention, not absolute performance. “The one thing a financial adviser doesn’t want to do is have a meeting with their client where something is down 50% and their client fires them,” he said. That is why reduced volatility, cleaner regulation and mainstream narratives like “Bitcoin as digital gold ” and “stablecoins and tokenization as new financial rails” matter so much. On supply dynamics, he pushed back on two recurring fears: “ OG whales dumping ” and MicroStrategy as a forced seller. He argued that much of the apparent “selling” by long-term holders is actually upside being sold via covered calls. Whales come to Bitwise and similar firms, he said, saying: “I have a hundred million of Bitcoin […] can you write covered calls against this?” That “effectively introduces new supply into the market” without coins moving on-chain. On MicroStrategy, he was categorical: “From a data perspective [it is] just strictly untrue that it will be forced to sell its Bitcoin.” The company has meaningful cash to service interest, no principal due until 2027, and manageable maturities relative to its Bitcoin holdings. He agreed with Jeff Dorman’s framing that MicroStrategy is no longer a major marginal buyer but also “not a forced seller.” Too much pessimism on the timeline. Brought on @Matt_Hougan to tell us why 2026 will be FAR better than 2025. Tons of good nuggets in here related to institutions, financial advisors, cycles, and more. Enjoy the optimism! pic.twitter.com/WZJb55yENF — Yano (@JasonYanowitz) December 8, 2025 Looking ahead, Hougan expects investors to eventually reframe the current period not as a failed bull cycle but as a behavioural transition through a key level. “We might look back at 2025 at some point and say, ‘Huh, you know what? $100,000 was like a big behavioral cliff we had to get over. Took us like a year,’” he said. For 2026 specifically, his message is clear: the old four-year pattern “won’t keep happening,” and the combination of regulatory clarity and institutional inflows sets up what he calls an “extraordinarily strong” backdrop rather than a programmed bust. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.06 trillion.

55584095,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=241490,1765346412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent CBDC Ban: US Lawmaker Moves to Block Federal Reserve Digital Currency,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-lawmaker-cbdc-ban-amendment/,"BitcoinWorld Urgent CBDC Ban: US Lawmaker Moves to Block Federal Reserve Digital Currency In a bold political maneuver, a US lawmaker has launched a direct challenge to the future of digital money in America. Representative Keith Self has submitted a critical amendment aiming for a complete CBDC ban , embedding this financial fight within the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act. This move signals a deepening political battle over who controls the future of US currency. What Does This Proposed CBDC Ban Actually Do? The amendment, if passed, would create a legal firewall. It explicitly prohibits the Federal Reserve from developing, testing, or launching a central bank digital currency for direct use by individuals. This isn’t just a policy suggestion; it’s an attempt to write a permanent CBDC ban into law through the powerful NDAA, which funds the entire US military. The strategy is clear: attach the controversial digital currency prohibition to a bill that Congress must pass. Therefore, lawmakers would have to vote on the defense budget and the CBDC ban as a single package, increasing its chances of success. Why Is There Such Strong Opposition to a US Digital Dollar? Proponents of the ban cite major concerns that resonate with privacy advocates and financial freedom supporters. Their core arguments include: Financial Surveillance: A digital currency could allow unprecedented government tracking of every transaction. Programmability Risks: The government could theoretically impose restrictions on how and when money is spent. Centralization of Power: It places immense monetary control directly in the hands of a central bank. Privacy Erosion: Moving away from physical cash eliminates anonymous transactions. However, supporters of a US CBDC argue it could modernize payments, increase financial inclusion for the unbanked, and help the dollar compete with digital currencies from China and other nations. The debate, therefore, pits innovation and global competitiveness against core American values of privacy and liberty. What Are the Immediate Next Steps for This CBDC Ban Proposal? The amendment’s journey is just beginning. First, it must pass the House Rules Committee, which decides what amendments get a floor vote. This is a crucial hurdle. If it clears the committee, it proceeds to a full vote in the House of Representatives. Its inclusion in the NDAA is particularly significant. Initially, House Republican leadership released a version of the defense bill without any CBDC ban language. Representative Self’s amendment forces the issue back onto the agenda, demonstrating persistent and organized opposition within Congress to a digital dollar. Could This CBDC Ban Actually Become Law? The path to becoming law is complex but possible. The amendment must survive the House, then be reconciled with the Senate’s version of the NDAA, which may not contain a similar provision. The final, decisive battle would happen in a conference committee where lawmakers from both chambers negotiate the final bill. Even if the CBDC ban fails this year, its introduction sets a powerful precedent. It mobilizes opposition, frames the public debate, and establishes a legislative blueprint for future attempts to block a Federal Reserve digital currency. The fight over a US CBDC is now officially a congressional battle. The Bottom Line: A Defining Moment for Digital Currency This proposed CBDC ban represents more than a single amendment; it is a watershed moment. It crystallizes the deep philosophical divide over the future of money. On one side is the push for technological efficiency and state-controlled financial systems. On the other is a defense of financial privacy and decentralized economic freedom. The outcome of this political clash will shape the US monetary system for decades, determining whether the digital future of the dollar is centralized or remains in the hands of its users. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the NDAA and why does it matter for a CBDC ban? The National Defense Authorization Act is the annual bill that authorizes funding for the US Department of Defense. It is considered a ‘must-pass’ piece of legislation. Attaching the CBDC ban to it is a strategic move to force a vote on the issue and increase its chances of becoming law. Who is Representative Keith Self? Keith Self is a Republican Congressman representing Texas’s 3rd congressional district. He is a member of the House Financial Services Committee and has been a vocal critic of a US central bank digital currency, framing it as an issue of government overreach and financial privacy. Has the Federal Reserve already created a CBDC? No. The Federal Reserve has only been researching the potential for a digital dollar. It has repeatedly stated that it would not proceed without clear support from the executive branch and authorizing legislation from Congress. This amendment seeks to preemptively deny that authorization. Do other countries have CBDCs? Yes. Several countries, including China with its digital yuan, have already launched or are in advanced testing phases of their own central bank digital currencies. This global shift is a key reason the US is debating the issue, with some arguing America risks falling behind. What happens if this amendment passes the House but not the Senate? If only one chamber of Congress approves the ban, it will not become law. The final NDAA bill is negotiated between the House and Senate. The CBDC ban provision would be a key point of negotiation, and could be removed, modified, or kept in the final compromise bill sent to the President. Can the President veto a CBDC ban? Yes, the President can veto any bill passed by Congress, including the NDAA. However, overriding a presidential veto requires a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, which is a very high bar. The political dynamics surrounding a potential veto would depend on the administration in power at the time.

This has allowed Ethereum to outpace its peers among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, showcasing a nearly 12% recovery for the leading altcoin over the past week. ETH Grows In Demand Analysts from Bull Theory attribute this resurgence to several key factors, including significant institutional interest in Ethereum. The firm highlighted BitMine, which holds the largest public company collection of ETH, as a major player in this recovery phase. In a recent social media update on X (formerly Twitter), the analysts pointed out that demand for ETH is on the rise as Wall Street quietly builds on the Ethereum platform.

BlackRock, which manages $13.5 trillion, is launching tokenized funds and has filed for a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Other notable players include JPMorgan with $4 trillion in assets, Deutsche Bank at $1.1 trillion, and Standard Chartered with $800 billion. These firms are developing tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure specifically on Ethereum and its Layer 2 (L2) solutions. In addition, well-known financial entities such as Amundi, HSBC, BNY Mellon, Coinbase (COIN), Kraken, and Robinhood (HOOD) are incorporating Ethereum into their operations for functions like custody, settlement, and rollup infrastructure. As a result, these large companies are holding and staking ETH to generate yield, significantly increasing the altcoin’s demand. BitMine, for instance, anticipates earning over $400 million annually from its staking position. Could The Ethereum Price Hit $12,000? Such institutional involvement has led market experts like Tom Lee to speculate that the Ethereum price could potentially reach $12,000 by 2026, driven by growing staking demand and the scaling of tokenization efforts. Adding to the momentum, Arkham reported that Tom Lee’s Ethereum treasury firm acquired 138,452 ETH since last week, valued at approximately $431.97 million. BitMine currently holds $12.05 billion in ETH and has an additional $1 billion allocated for further purchases. Related Reading: Wall Street Giant Bernstein Predicts Bitcoin Price To Hit $1 Million By 2033 In a different development that could bolster the Ethereum price further, Chris MacDonald, an analyst for The Motley Fool, highlighted reports indicating that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) confirmed US banks can now legally conduct “riskless principal” transactions in crypto assets. The analyst asserted that this new regulatory approval may lead to an influx of capital into digital assets, which would likely benefit the Ethereum price and holders, as well as other top cryptocurrencies. As of this writing, the Ethereum price is trading at $3,325. Despite recent gains, the price is still nearly 33% below the all-time high of $4,946, which was reached earlier this year.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Binance Coin (BNB) stands as one of the most watched assets in the digital economy. Investors and traders are constantly asking: will BNB hit the coveted $1000 mark? This comprehensive analysis examines the factors that could drive Binance Coin price prediction models from 2025 through 2030, providing insights into potential growth trajectories and market dynamics. Understanding Binance Coin’s Current Market Position Binance Coin operates as the native token of the Binance ecosystem, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Unlike many cryptocurrencies, BNB serves multiple functions including transaction fee discounts, participation in token sales, and powering the Binance Smart Chain. This utility foundation provides BNB with intrinsic value beyond speculative trading. The BNB price forecast must consider both its utility within the Binance ecosystem and its position in the broader cryptocurrency market analysis. Key Factors Influencing BNB Price Forecast Several critical elements will determine whether BNB can reach $1000 by 2030. First, the continued growth of the Binance exchange directly impacts BNB demand. As more users join the platform, the utility of BNB as an exchange token increases. Second, regulatory developments surrounding cryptocurrency exchanges globally could significantly affect Binance’s operations and, consequently, BNB’s value. Third, the expansion of the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem creates additional use cases for BNB beyond simple exchange utility. Other important considerations include: Market adoption of decentralized applications on Binance Smart Chain Competition from other exchange tokens and layer-1 blockchain platforms Overall cryptocurrency market cycles and investor sentiment Token burn mechanisms that reduce BNB supply over time Binance Coin Price Prediction: 2025 Outlook Looking toward 2025, most analysts project moderate growth for BNB assuming continued expansion of the Binance ecosystem. The BNB future value depends heavily on whether the cryptocurrency market enters another bull cycle. If historical patterns repeat, 2025 could see increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, potentially benefiting established tokens like BNB. However, increased regulatory scrutiny of centralized exchanges presents a significant challenge that could impact this cryptocurrency market analysis. Scenario 2025 Price Range Probability Bullish $800 – $950 30% Moderate $550 – $750 50% Bearish $350 – $500 20% BNB Price Forecast: 2026-2028 Projections The mid-term outlook for BNB depends on several technological and market developments. As an exchange token, BNB’s value proposition extends beyond simple price appreciation. The continued development of the Binance Smart Chain could position BNB as more than just a utility token for fee discounts. If decentralized finance and other applications gain mainstream adoption on the chain, demand for BNB could increase substantially, positively impacting the BNB price forecast. Will BNB Hit $1000? The 2030 Milestone Analysis Reaching $1000 represents approximately a 2.5x increase from current levels, assuming no major market disruptions. This Binance Coin price prediction considers both optimistic and conservative scenarios. On the optimistic side, continued growth of the Binance ecosystem, successful expansion into new markets, and increased utility through additional use cases could drive BNB to surpass $1000 well before 2030. However, this cryptocurrency market analysis must also account for potential challenges including regulatory hurdles, increased competition, and market volatility. Key milestones that could signal BNB’s path to $1000: Sustained growth in Binance exchange user base exceeding 200 million Expansion of Binance Smart Chain to host over 1,000 active dApps Successful navigation of regulatory challenges in major markets Continued token burns reducing circulating supply by 20%+ from current levels Comparative Analysis: BNB Versus Other Exchange Tokens When evaluating BNB future value, it’s essential to consider its position relative to other exchange tokens. BNB currently leads this category by market capitalization, but competitors are emerging. The success of BNB as an exchange token depends on maintaining Binance’s dominant market position while expanding utility beyond simple fee discounts. This comparative analysis suggests that BNB’s integrated ecosystem approach provides advantages over simpler exchange tokens. Risks and Challenges in BNB Price Prediction No cryptocurrency market analysis is complete without considering potential risks. For BNB, regulatory uncertainty represents the most significant challenge. As governments worldwide develop cryptocurrency regulations, centralized exchanges like Binance face increased scrutiny. Additionally, technological risks including security vulnerabilities, competition from other blockchain platforms, and market sentiment shifts could impact the BNB price forecast. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating long-term Binance Coin price prediction models. Actionable Insights for BNB Investors Based on this comprehensive analysis, investors considering BNB should focus on several key areas. First, monitor regulatory developments affecting centralized exchanges globally. Second, track adoption metrics for the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. Third, pay attention to token burn rates and supply dynamics. Fourth, consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market. Finally, maintain a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio rather than concentrating heavily in any single asset, including BNB. Frequently Asked Questions What is Binance Coin (BNB)? Binance Coin is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange ecosystem, created by Changpeng Zhao (CZ). It serves multiple functions including transaction fee discounts, participation in token sales, and as the native asset of the Binance Smart Chain. How does BNB differ from Bitcoin? Unlike Bitcoin, which functions primarily as digital gold and a store of value, BNB operates as a utility token within a specific ecosystem. While Bitcoin was created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto as a decentralized currency, BNB serves practical functions within the Binance platform. What factors most influence BNB’s price? Key factors include Binance exchange growth, regulatory developments, Binance Smart Chain adoption, overall cryptocurrency market trends, and BNB token burn mechanisms that reduce supply over time. Is BNB a good long-term investment? As with any cryptocurrency investment, BNB carries both potential rewards and risks. Its connection to the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange provides unique advantages, but regulatory challenges and market competition present significant uncertainties that investors must consider. Conclusion: The Path Forward for BNB The journey to $1000 for BNB involves navigating a complex landscape of technological innovation, regulatory developments, and market dynamics. While the potential exists for significant appreciation, particularly if the Binance ecosystem continues to expand and diversify, investors must approach BNB price predictions with balanced expectations. The cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, and even well-established tokens like BNB face uncertainties. A thoughtful investment strategy considers both the promising aspects of BNB’s utility-driven model and the challenges inherent in the rapidly evolving digital asset space.

The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio serves as a powerful, real-time gauge of trader positioning and collective bias. The latest data reveals a fascinating, albeit narrow, lean towards optimism. Let’s break down what the numbers from the top exchanges truly mean for your next move. What Does the Current BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Tell Us? The aggregate 24-hour data paints a clear picture: the market is delicately balanced but leaning bullish. Across the three largest exchanges by open interest—Binance, OKX, and Bybit—the overall BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio shows 50.26% of positions are long, versus 49.74% short. This marginal majority suggests a cautious optimism among derivatives traders. However, the real story often lies in the details of individual platform data. Exchange-by-Exchange Breakdown: Where is Sentiment Strongest? While the overall trend is slightly bullish, sentiment varies by platform. This divergence can offer nuanced insights into different trader demographics. Binance: 50.84% long / 49.16% short. The world’s largest exchange shows a definitive, though not overwhelming, preference for long positions. OKX: 50.38% long / 49.62% short. Here, the balance is almost even, indicating highly neutral or conflicted sentiment. Bybit: 51.12% long / 48.88% short. This platform exhibits the most pronounced bullish tilt in the current BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio data. These variations remind us that trader behavior is not monolithic. A deeper look at one exchange’s data can sometimes foreshadow a broader market shift. How Can Traders Use This Long/Short Ratio Data? This metric is more than just a number; it’s a tool for strategic decision-making. A high long ratio can sometimes act as a contrarian indicator, signaling that the market might be overly optimistic and due for a correction. Conversely, an extreme short ratio could indicate pervasive fear, potentially setting the stage for a squeeze. The current data, showing a slight long bias, suggests a market that is hopeful but not yet euphoric. Therefore, savvy traders monitor trends in this BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio over time, watching for sharp divergences that often precede volatility. What Are the Risks of Relying Solely on This Metric? While invaluable, the long/short ratio is not a crystal ball. It should never be used in isolation. Consider these critical points: It reflects derivatives market sentiment, not necessarily spot market conviction. It doesn’t account for the size of positions; a few large whales can skew the data. External macro factors, like regulatory news or economic data, can instantly override technical sentiment indicators. Always combine this analysis with other on-chain metrics, price action, and fundamental news.

It is a metric that shows the percentage of open long (buy) positions versus short (sell) positions for Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts on a given exchange or across multiple exchanges.

The platform announced it will list WET perpetual futures , opening new avenues for market participation. This contract, paired against USDT, goes live on December 10th at 7:00 a.m. UTC and supports leverage of up to 20x. For anyone involved in the WET ecosystem or crypto derivatives, this is a pivotal development worth understanding in detail. What Are WET Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Matter? If you’re new to crypto derivatives, you might wonder what the fuss is about. A perpetual futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price, but unlike traditional futures, it has no expiry date. This allows for continuous trading. Binance listing WET perpetual futures provides several immediate benefits for the market. First, it increases liquidity for the WET token. Second, it offers traders more sophisticated tools for hedging or speculating on WET’s price movements. Finally, it signals growing institutional and retail confidence in the asset’s longevity. How Can You Trade WET Perpetual Futures on Binance? Starting December 10th, accessing this new market is straightforward. You will find the WET/USDT perpetual contract listed in the Binance Futures trading section. The exchange has set the leverage multiplier at a maximum of 20x. This means you can control a position worth 20 times your initial margin. However, while this amplifies potential gains, it also magnifies potential losses. Therefore, it’s crucial to approach leverage with a clear risk management strategy. Key steps to get started include: Ensuring your Binance account is verified and funded. Transferring funds to your Binance Futures wallet. Familiarizing yourself with the futures trading interface and order types. Setting stop-loss and take-profit orders to manage risk automatically. What Are the Key Opportunities and Risks to Consider? The introduction of WET perpetual futures creates exciting opportunities. Traders can now speculate on WET’s price direction without owning the underlying token, potentially profiting from both upward and downward moves. It also allows for more complex strategies like arbitrage. For the WET project itself, this listing on a major exchange like Binance enhances visibility and credibility. However, the 20x leverage is a double-edged sword. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and high leverage can lead to rapid liquidation if the market moves against your position. Always trade with capital you can afford to lose. How Does This Fit Into the Broader Crypto Landscape? Binance’s decision is part of a larger trend of crypto exchanges expanding their derivatives offerings. Perpetual futures have become a cornerstone of crypto trading, offering the flexibility that traditional expiry-based contracts lack. By adding WET to its roster, Binance is responding to user demand and validating the token’s market presence. This move could potentially lead to increased trading volume and price discovery for WET, influencing its spot market dynamics as well. It’s a clear sign of the maturing infrastructure surrounding digital assets. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Traders and the WET Ecosystem In summary, the listing of WET perpetual futures on Binance is a strategic development that benefits multiple parties. It provides traders with a powerful new instrument, grants the WET project increased market exposure, and reinforces Binance’s position as a comprehensive trading hub. As with any leveraged product, education and caution are paramount. By understanding the mechanics of perpetual contracts and implementing sound risk management, traders can navigate this new opportunity effectively. The market will be watching closely when trading commences on December 10th. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When exactly will Binance list WET perpetual futures? A: The WET/USDT perpetual futures contract will be available for trading starting at 7:00 a.m. UTC on December 10. Q: What is the maximum leverage for the WET perpetual contract? A: The contract will support leverage of up to 20x on the Binance Futures platform. Q: Do I need to own WET tokens to trade WET perpetual futures? A: No. Perpetual futures are derivative contracts. You are trading a contract based on WET’s price, not the actual token. You settle in USDT. Q: What are the main risks of trading with 20x leverage? A: The primary risk is liquidation. A small price move against your position can result in the loss of your entire margin. Leverage amplifies both profits and losses. Q: How does this listing benefit the WET project? A: It increases liquidity, provides better price discovery, attracts more traders and attention, and enhances the token’s overall credibility by being listed on a major exchange’s derivatives market. Q: Where can I learn more about trading futures on Binance? A: Binance Academy offers comprehensive educational resources on futures trading, leverage, and risk management. It’s highly recommended to study these before trading. Found this guide on WET perpetual futures helpful?

The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as TRX approaches the elusive $1 milestone. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding Tron price prediction trends isn’t just speculation—it’s a strategic necessity in today’s volatile crypto landscape. With blockchain technology evolving at breakneck speed and Tron’s ecosystem expanding daily, the question on everyone’s mind is clear: Can Tron reach $1 in 2025? This comprehensive analysis will explore every angle of TRX’s potential journey, giving you the insights needed to make informed decisions about one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market. Understanding Tron’s Current Market Position Tron (TRX) has established itself as a major player in the blockchain space, currently ranking among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Founded by Justin Sun in 2017, Tron aims to create a decentralized internet and has gained significant traction through its high-throughput blockchain and growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). The platform’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and its acquisition of BitTorrent have positioned it uniquely in the competitive smart contract platform arena. As we examine Tron price prediction models, it’s crucial to understand that TRX’s value is intrinsically tied to network adoption, developer activity, and overall market sentiment toward layer-1 blockchain solutions. Tron Price Prediction 2025: The $1 Question The possibility of Tron reaching $1 in 2025 represents a monumental psychological barrier for the cryptocurrency. Currently trading significantly below this level, TRX would need to experience substantial growth to achieve this target. Several factors could contribute to this potential breakthrough: Mass adoption of Tron’s blockchain for enterprise solutions Expansion of the TRON DAO ecosystem and developer community Increased institutional investment in cryptocurrency assets Successful implementation of major protocol upgrades Favorable regulatory developments for blockchain technology Technical analysis suggests that breaking through key resistance levels would be necessary for any sustained move toward $1. Market analysts point to historical patterns where cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and active communities have experienced exponential growth during bull market cycles. However, achieving the $1 mark would require Tron to overcome significant supply pressure and demonstrate consistent utility growth that justifies such valuation. TRX Price Forecast 2026-2027: Beyond the Immediate Horizon Looking beyond 2025, Tron price prediction models for 2026-2027 consider longer-term technological and market developments. By this period, several key milestones could significantly impact TRX’s valuation: Year Conservative Forecast Moderate Forecast Optimistic Forecast 2026 $0.25 – $0.40 $0.40 – $0.65 $0.65 – $0.90 2027 $0.35 – $0.55 $0.55 – $0.85 $0.85 – $1.20 These projections assume continued development of Tron’s ecosystem, including potential expansion into decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and cross-chain interoperability solutions. The TRX price forecast must account for both internal platform developments and external market conditions, including potential competition from other smart contract platforms and broader economic factors affecting cryptocurrency adoption. Tron Cryptocurrency Technical Analysis and Indicators When evaluating Tron cryptocurrency potential, technical indicators provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Key metrics to monitor include: Network activity and transaction volume trends Development activity and GitHub commit frequency Social media sentiment and community engagement metrics Exchange inflow/outflow patterns indicating accumulation or distribution On-chain metrics including active addresses and token velocity Historical data shows that Tron has demonstrated resilience during market downturns while capturing significant upside during bullish periods. The platform’s consistent delivery of technological upgrades and strategic partnerships has maintained positive momentum despite broader market volatility. As with any cryptocurrency investment, understanding these technical factors is essential for developing realistic Tron price prediction expectations. Tron 2025 Market Dynamics and Competitive Landscape The year 2025 represents a critical juncture for Tron as it navigates an increasingly competitive blockchain ecosystem. Several factors will determine whether Tron can achieve its ambitious targets: Regulatory clarity across major jurisdictions Adoption of blockchain technology by traditional financial institutions Technological advancements in scalability and security User experience improvements for mainstream adoption Strategic partnerships and ecosystem expansion Tron’s unique position as an entertainment-focused blockchain gives it specific advantages in content distribution and digital rights management. However, it must continue innovating to maintain relevance against competitors like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. The Tron 2025 outlook depends heavily on execution of its roadmap and ability to capture market share in emerging blockchain use cases. Challenges and Risks in Tron Price Prediction While optimistic Tron price prediction models capture attention, responsible analysis must address significant challenges and risks: Regulatory uncertainty affecting all cryptocurrency projects Technological vulnerabilities and security concerns Competition from established and emerging blockchain platforms Market volatility and correlation with Bitcoin price movements Adoption barriers for mainstream users and enterprises These factors could substantially impact the TRX price forecast, potentially delaying or preventing achievement of price targets. Investors should maintain balanced perspectives, recognizing that cryptocurrency markets remain speculative and subject to rapid changes based on technological developments, regulatory actions, and macroeconomic conditions. Actionable Insights for Tron Investors Based on comprehensive Tron price prediction analysis, several strategic approaches emerge for investors: Dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risks in volatile markets Portfolio diversification across different blockchain assets Active monitoring of Tron ecosystem developments and partnerships Technical analysis combined with fundamental research Risk management strategies including stop-loss orders Successful investment in Tron cryptocurrency requires more than just price speculation—it demands understanding of blockchain technology, market dynamics, and risk tolerance. Whether Tron reaches $1 in 2025 or follows a different trajectory, informed decision-making based on thorough research provides the best foundation for cryptocurrency investment success. Conclusion: The Future of Tron Cryptocurrency Tron’s journey toward the $1 milestone represents more than just a price target—it symbolizes the maturation of blockchain technology and its potential to transform digital ecosystems. While Tron price prediction models offer valuable guidance, they cannot guarantee specific outcomes in the dynamic cryptocurrency market. What remains certain is that Tron has established itself as a significant blockchain platform with a dedicated community and clear vision for decentralized technology. Whether you’re a seasoned cryptocurrency investor or new to blockchain technology, understanding Tron’s potential requires balancing optimism with realism, recognizing both the transformative possibilities and inherent uncertainties of this emerging asset class. The coming years will reveal whether Tron can achieve its ambitious targets, but one thing is clear: the blockchain revolution continues, and Tron intends to play a major role in shaping its future. Frequently Asked Questions Who founded Tron and what is their background? Tron was founded by Justin Sun , a Chinese entrepreneur and former representative for Ripple in Greater China.

A new side-by-side chart comparison reveals a strikingly close match between XRP’s current 2025 setup and its 2017 pre-rally structure. The parallels are unmistakable, identical wave patterns, a tightening consolidation zone, and the same prolonged calm that once preceded XRP’s explosive breakout. As Diana puts it, ‘Same chart. Same setup. In 2017, this exact pattern sparked one of crypto’s most explosive rallies, sending XRP soaring thousands of percent in weeks. Today, XRP mirrors that setup, this time backed by even stronger fundamentals, analysts say. Unlike 2017, Ripple now stands on solid foundations: expanded partnerships, real-world institutional adoption, robust liquidity, and a more mature regulatory landscape. With RLUSD adoption, global integrations, and potential ETF catalysts, Ripple’s growth is driven by tangible fundamentals rather than speculative hype, making many analysts confident that any repeat of history could unfold even faster. Well, the math is striking because if XRP mirrors its 2017 surge of 7,452% from the current level of $2.09, it could soar to around $155, a zone that would redefine the crypto landscape. While such gains are speculative, the alignment of a bullish fractal, stronger fundamentals, and growing market optimism has traders and long-term holders watching closely. Meanwhile, crypto never guarantees history will repeat, but when a major asset like XRP pairs proven chart patterns with real-world adoption, it demands attention. Whether or not it reaches triple-digit territory, this legendary setup has firmly returned XRP to the spotlight. Conclusion XRP’s 2025 chart mirrors the historic 2017 setup that sparked one of crypto’s most explosive rallies. Backed by stronger fundamentals, wider adoption, and rising market interest, XRP is poised for a potentially transformative move. While markets remain unpredictable, this rare alignment of technical patterns and real-world catalysts makes it a must-watch asset for traders and long-term investors aiming for high-impact opportunities.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 07:07:14

Keith Self Files Amendment to Prevent a US CBDC in Defense Bill,https://cryptonews.com/news/rep-keith-self-files-amendment-to-prevent-a-us-cbdc-in-defense-bill/,"Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas) on Tuesday introduced an amendment to the massive annual defense bill that would block the creation of a US central bank digital currency . Key Takeaways: Rep. Keith Self moved to add an anti-CBDC amendment back into the defense bill. Conservatives say GOP leaders broke a promise to include CBDC restrictions. The amendment would block a Fed digital dollar and protect cash-like privacy. Self said GOP leaders had previously promised that anti-CBDC language would be included in the legislation, but it was missing from the version released Sunday. “Promises were broken to include this language in the NDAA,” he wrote on X . “My amendment would fix the bill.” House Pushes Ahead on Defense Bill as Self Seeks to Block Fed Digital Dollar House leaders are aiming to pass the defense package on Wednesday afternoon, according to Politico, though negotiations remain fluid. Self’s proposal, titled the “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State” amendment, would bar the Federal Reserve from developing, testing, or issuing a central bank digital currency, or any similar digital asset under a different name. It would also prohibit Federal Reserve banks from offering accounts or financial services directly to individuals, a move supporters say is critical to preventing government-controlled consumer banking. The amendment includes an exception for “dollar-denominated currency that is open, permissionless, and private,” a carve-out aimed at ensuring paper-cash-level privacy protections. The broader defense bill, formally known as the annual authorization for Pentagon spending and policy, spans more than 3,000 pages and is typically considered one of Congress’s few must-pass measures each year. The absence of the CBDC language angered conservatives, who saw it as a retreat from earlier commitments. Self told Fox Business that House Republicans had been promised the amendment authored by Majority Whip Tom Emmer, one of Congress’s most outspoken CBDC critics. After reviewing the bill, Self said it was clear the provision had been dropped. “We have to pass an NDAA, because it’s one of the must-pass bills we have in Congress,” he said. “We’ve got to fix it and get it passed.” Conservatives were promised that language banning a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would be included in the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Unconscionably, it wasn't included. Leadership needs to fix this bill IMMEDIATELY. pic.twitter.com/r9RxsmTctk — Rep. Keith Self (@RepKeithSelf) December 8, 2025 CBDC Could Give Government Control Over Americans’ Money Several Republicans echoed his frustration. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said she supports cryptocurrency but opposes any system that could allow the federal government to restrict how Americans use their money. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) warned that a CBDC would “insert the government between you and your money” and said Congress must pass a statutory ban, not rely solely on executive action. Earlier this year, President Trump signed an executive order barring federal agencies from issuing or promoting any form of CBDC, citing risks to privacy and national sovereignty. However, House GOP aides told The Hill that negotiations over a separate bipartisan housing package derailed efforts to include a CBDC ban in the defense bill, saying the final language “was not something that was ultimately going to be acceptable to our members.” The post Rep.

Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley just made a bold declaration that could reshape your investment strategy. He predicts a major crypto bull market is on the horizon for 2026, challenging everything we thought we knew about cryptocurrency cycles. This isn’t just another price prediction—it’s a fundamental reassessment of how crypto markets mature. Let’s explore why this forecast matters and what it means for your portfolio. Why Is the 2026 Crypto Bull Market Prediction So Significant? Hunter Horsley’s forecast carries weight because it comes from a leading voice in institutional crypto investing. Bitwise manages billions in digital assets, giving Horsley a front-row seat to market movements. His prediction breaks from the traditional four-year cycle theory that many investors still follow. Instead, he argues the market has fundamentally matured. This shift means old patterns may no longer apply, requiring investors to think differently about timing and strategy. According to Horsley, we’ve actually been in a bear market since February. Corporate buying from giants like MicroStrategy created artificial upward pressure that masked the true trend. This insight is crucial because it helps explain recent market confusion. When major corporations make strategic investments, they can temporarily distort natural market cycles. However, these distortions eventually resolve, setting the stage for the next genuine growth phase. What Changed in the Crypto Market Cycle? The traditional four-year cycle tied to Bitcoin halving events might be obsolete. Horsley suggests several factors have transformed the landscape: Institutional adoption has created new buying patterns Regulatory clarity in major markets reduces uncertainty Infrastructure development makes crypto more accessible Diversified use cases beyond pure speculation These changes mean the market now responds to different drivers. While retail investors once dominated price action, institutional players now significantly influence trends. This maturation suggests the next crypto bull market could be more sustained and less volatile than previous cycles. The wild swings of early crypto years might give way to more measured, fundamental-driven growth. How Should Investors Prepare for the 2026 Bull Run? If Horsley’s prediction proves accurate, strategic preparation becomes essential. First, understand that timing matters less than position. Trying to perfectly time market bottoms often leads to missed opportunities. Instead, consider dollar-cost averaging—regular investments regardless of short-term price movements. This approach reduces risk while ensuring participation in long-term growth. Second, diversification remains crucial. While Bitcoin often leads crypto bull market cycles, other assets may offer different risk-reward profiles. Research projects with strong fundamentals, active development teams, and real-world utility. The coming years should see continued separation between serious projects and mere speculation. Finally, maintain realistic expectations. Even if a major crypto bull market arrives in 2026, markets rarely move in straight lines. Prepare for volatility along the way. Set clear investment goals and risk parameters before market excitement potentially clouds judgment. Remember that sustainable wealth building in crypto, as in traditional markets, requires discipline and patience. What Are the Potential Challenges Ahead? While the prediction offers optimism, several challenges could affect the timeline. Regulatory developments in major economies like the United States and European Union will significantly impact institutional participation. Technological hurdles around scalability and energy consumption need continued addressing. Moreover, global economic conditions always influence risk assets like cryptocurrencies. However, each challenge also represents an opportunity for market maturation. Regulatory clarity, while sometimes restrictive short-term, creates long-term stability that attracts conservative capital. Technological improvements enhance utility and efficiency. The very obstacles that concern investors today may become the foundations for tomorrow’s growth. The key is distinguishing between temporary setbacks and fundamental threats to the crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investing Hunter Horsley’s 2026 crypto bull market prediction represents more than just a price forecast—it signals crypto’s evolution from niche experiment to established asset class. The broken four-year cycle suggests growing maturity, while corporate investment patterns reveal increasing mainstream acceptance. For investors, this means adapting strategies to a changing landscape where fundamentals may matter more than cyclical timing. The coming years will test whether this vision materializes. Meanwhile, staying informed, managing risk, and focusing on long-term value creation offer the best path forward. The potential for a major crypto bull market in 2026 reminds us that despite recent volatility, the digital asset revolution continues advancing, creating opportunities for prepared investors. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a crypto bull market? A crypto bull market refers to a sustained period of rising prices across the cryptocurrency market, typically accompanied by increased investor optimism, trading volume, and media attention. Why does Hunter Horsley think the four-year cycle is over? Horsley believes institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and market maturation have fundamentally changed cryptocurrency market dynamics, making old patterns less reliable predictors. Should I invest now or wait until 2026? Most financial advisors recommend against trying to time markets perfectly. Dollar-cost averaging—investing fixed amounts regularly—often proves more effective than attempting to predict exact market bottoms or tops. What cryptocurrencies might lead the next bull market? While Bitcoin typically leads major cycles, established projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and real-world utility often perform well during sustained bull markets. How can I protect myself if the prediction is wrong? Diversification across asset classes, clear risk management strategies, and investing only what you can afford to lose provide protection against incorrect market predictions. What signs should I watch for as 2026 approaches? Key indicators include institutional adoption rates, regulatory developments, technological advancements, trading volume patterns, and broader economic conditions affecting risk assets.

Solana has emerged as one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in recent years, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. With its lightning-fast transaction speeds and growing ecosystem, many are wondering: could SOL realistically reach $500 in the coming years? This comprehensive Solana price prediction analysis examines the factors that could drive SOL’s value through 2030, providing insights for both new and experienced cryptocurrency investors. Understanding Solana’s Current Market Position Before diving into specific SOL price targets, it’s crucial to understand what makes Solana unique. Unlike many blockchain networks that struggle with scalability, Solana boasts transaction speeds of up to 65,000 per second with fees averaging just $0.00025. This technical advantage has attracted hundreds of projects to its ecosystem, from decentralized finance platforms to NFT marketplaces. The network’s Proof-of-History consensus mechanism represents a significant innovation in blockchain technology , potentially giving Solana a competitive edge as adoption increases. Key Factors Influencing Solana Price Predictions Several critical elements will determine whether Solana can achieve ambitious price targets like $500. First, network adoption continues to expand, with daily active addresses consistently numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Second, institutional interest has grown substantially, with major investment firms adding SOL to their portfolios. Third, technological developments, including the upcoming Firedancer upgrade, promise to enhance network stability and performance. Finally, broader cryptocurrency forecast trends suggest that altcoins with strong fundamentals may outperform during the next market cycle. Solana Price Prediction 2025: The Road to Recovery Looking specifically at 2025, most analysts project a bullish scenario for Solana if several conditions align. The table below summarizes key price ranges based on different market conditions: Market Scenario Price Range Key Drivers Conservative $150 – $250 Moderate adoption, stable market conditions Moderate $250 – $400 Strong ecosystem growth, institutional inflows Bullish $400 – $600 Mass adoption, technological breakthroughs, favorable regulations The $500 target falls within the bullish scenario for 2025, requiring sustained network growth and positive crypto market analysis trends. Several technical indicators suggest this is possible if Solana maintains its current trajectory of development and adoption. Solana Price Prediction 2026-2028: The Growth Phase Between 2026 and 2028, Solana’s price could experience significant volatility but potentially establish higher support levels. Key developments during this period might include: Mainstream adoption of blockchain applications built on Solana Increased institutional investment in the SOL token Technological improvements addressing previous network stability concerns Expansion into new markets and use cases beyond current applications During this phase, the SOL price could test resistance levels between $600 and $800 if the broader cryptocurrency market enters a sustained bull cycle. However, investors should remain aware of potential challenges, including regulatory developments and competition from other layer-1 blockchains. Solana Price Prediction 2030: Long-Term Vision Looking toward 2030, Solana’s price will largely depend on its ability to maintain technological leadership and ecosystem growth. Some analysts project that SOL could reach between $1,000 and $2,000 by the end of the decade if several conditions are met: Global adoption of decentralized applications reaches critical mass Solana captures significant market share in key sectors like DeFi and gaming The network demonstrates consistent reliability and security over time Blockchain technology becomes integrated into mainstream financial systems While these projections are speculative, they highlight the tremendous potential that many see in Solana’s underlying blockchain technology . The path to these price levels won’t be linear, but the fundamental case for Solana remains strong according to most cryptocurrency forecast models. What Could Derail Solana’s Growth? Despite optimistic Solana price prediction scenarios, investors must consider potential risks. Network outages in the past have raised concerns about reliability, though the development team has made significant improvements. Regulatory uncertainty remains a challenge for all cryptocurrencies, and increased competition from other scalable blockchains could pressure Solana’s market position. Additionally, broader economic factors, including interest rate changes and macroeconomic conditions, significantly influence all crypto market analysis outcomes. How Should Investors Approach SOL? For those considering adding Solana to their portfolio, several strategies can help manage risk while capturing potential upside: Dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market Allocating only a portion of your portfolio to higher-risk assets like SOL Staying informed about network developments and ecosystem growth Setting realistic profit targets and stop-loss levels based on your risk tolerance Remember that all cryptocurrency forecast models involve uncertainty, and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. The SOL price will likely experience significant volatility regardless of long-term direction. Conclusion: Is $500 Realistic for Solana? Based on current analysis, Solana reaching $500 represents an ambitious but plausible target within the 2025-2026 timeframe. The combination of technological advantages, growing ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest creates a compelling case for SOL’s continued appreciation. However, achieving this milestone depends on multiple factors aligning favorably, including broader market conditions, regulatory developments, and successful execution of Solana’s roadmap. For investors, the key is balancing optimism about Solana’s potential with realistic risk management strategies.

Ethereum stands at a critical juncture in its evolution. As the leading smart contract platform and the foundation of decentralized finance, its price trajectory captures global attention. Investors, developers, and analysts alike are asking one burning question: Can Ethereum reach $10,000? This comprehensive Ethereum price prediction examines the factors that could propel ETH to new heights or present significant challenges through 2025, 2026, and beyond to 2030. Understanding Ethereum’s Current Market Position Before diving into future predictions, we must understand Ethereum’s present context. Ethereum remains the dominant platform for decentralized applications, hosting thousands of projects across DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. The successful transition to proof-of-stake through “The Merge” fundamentally changed Ethereum’s economic model, reducing issuance and introducing staking rewards. This shift creates a more deflationary environment for ETH, directly impacting its long-term ETH price forecast potential. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025: The Bull Case Looking toward 2025, several catalysts could drive Ethereum’s price significantly higher. The continued development of Ethereum 2.0, particularly further scalability improvements through sharding, could dramatically increase network throughput and reduce transaction costs. This would enhance Ethereum’s competitive position against layer-2 solutions and alternative blockchains. Key factors for 2025 include: Institutional adoption through ETF approvals Regulatory clarity in major markets Continued growth of DeFi and NFT ecosystems Macroeconomic conditions and Bitcoin halving effects Most analysts project a Ethereum 2025 price range between $6,000 and $8,500 under favorable conditions. This represents substantial growth from current levels but falls short of the $10,000 milestone. Technical Analysis and Historical Patterns Technical analysis provides another lens for evaluating Ethereum’s potential. Historical price action shows that ETH tends to follow Bitcoin’s market cycles but with amplified volatility. The table below compares previous cycle peaks with potential future targets: Cycle Previous Peak Next Cycle Projection Growth Multiple 2017-2018 $1,400 N/A N/A 2020-2021 $4,800 N/A 3.4x 2024-2025 Projected $6,000-$8,500 1.25-1.77x 2028-2030 Projected $8,000-$12,000 1.33-1.41x These projections suggest that reaching $10,000 may require multiple market cycles and sustained adoption. Ethereum 2030: The Long-Term Vision Looking further ahead to 2030, the ETH 2030 outlook depends on Ethereum maintaining its first-mover advantage in smart contracts while successfully scaling to meet global demand. By this timeframe, several critical developments should be fully realized: Complete implementation of Ethereum 2.0 with full sharding Mass adoption of decentralized applications across industries Integration with traditional finance and global payment systems Potential regulatory frameworks supporting blockchain innovation For Ethereum $10k to become reality by 2030, Ethereum would need to achieve a market capitalization approaching $1.2 trillion. While ambitious, this represents approximately a 4x increase from previous all-time highs and aligns with the growth trajectories of other transformative technologies. Challenges and Risks to Consider No Ethereum price prediction would be complete without addressing significant challenges. Ethereum faces intense competition from alternative layer-1 blockchains offering higher throughput and lower fees. Regulatory uncertainty remains a persistent concern, particularly regarding staking, DeFi protocols, and token classification. Additionally, technological risks include potential security vulnerabilities in new consensus mechanisms and smart contracts. Other considerations include: Network congestion and high gas fees during bull markets Concentration of staked ETH among large entities Environmental concerns despite proof-of-stake transition Macroeconomic factors affecting all risk assets Expert Opinions and Market Sentiment Industry experts offer varied perspectives on Ethereum’s potential. Some analysts point to Ethereum’s strong developer community and network effects as reasons for optimism. Others caution that technological disruption could come from unexpected directions. The consensus suggests that while $10,000 is achievable within this decade, it would require nearly perfect execution and favorable market conditions. Key voices in the space emphasize different aspects: Vitalik Buterin focuses on technical scalability and decentralization Institutional analysts highlight adoption metrics and revenue potential Traders watch on-chain data and market structure developments Developers monitor ecosystem growth and innovation pace Actionable Insights for Investors Based on this ETH price forecast analysis, investors should consider several strategies. Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk in volatile markets. Diversification across crypto assets mitigates platform-specific risks. Staying informed about network upgrades and ecosystem developments provides context for price movements. Most importantly, investors should only allocate capital they can afford to lose, given cryptocurrency’s inherent volatility. Frequently Asked Questions What is the most realistic Ethereum price prediction for 2025? Most analysts project Ethereum trading between $6,000 and $8,500 in 2025, assuming continued adoption and favorable market conditions. Who created Ethereum and how does this affect its future? Ethereum was co-founded by Vitalik Buterin along with other developers. Buterin’s continued involvement and vision for Ethereum 2.0 significantly influence its development roadmap.

That future is arriving now. Blockchain infrastructure developer FANC is making a pivotal move by shifting security focus from vulnerable exchanges directly to your personal wallet with its groundbreaking Quantum Wallet . This initiative responds directly to recent high-profile hacks in South Korea and the looming threat of quantum computing. Why is Wallet-Centric Security the Ultimate Game-Changer? For years, the mantra has been “not your keys, not your crypto,” highlighting the risks of leaving assets on exchanges. Recent attacks on major platforms like Upbit and Coupang have proven this point. FANC’s strategy flips the script. Instead of relying on a central entity’s security, the Quantum Wallet empowers you. It places cutting-edge, quantum-resistant protection directly in your hands. This is a fundamental shift from trusting a third party to trusting impregnable, personal technology. What Makes the Quantum Wallet So Powerful? The core of this innovation is Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), technology transferred from South Korea’s prestigious Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI). But what does that mean for you? Quantum-Resistant Design: Every process—from creation to signing transactions—uses PQC algorithms built to withstand attacks from future quantum computers. Direct Implementation: The security is applied at the wallet level itself, not as an add-on layer. Proactive Defense: It solves tomorrow’s security problem today, before quantum computers become a commercial threat. This approach ensures that the Quantum Wallet isn’t just another digital wallet; it’s a fortress designed for the next era of computing. How Will the Quantum Wallet Roll Out and Expand? FANC has a clear, phased plan for deployment. The Quantum Wallet won’t launch in isolation. Its integration will be strategic and expansive. Initial Ecosystem: First implementation will occur within FANC’s own ecosystem and the Celebe platform, serving as a controlled proving ground. Broader Integration: The roadmap includes expanding to external services and enabling secure payments on partner platforms. User-Centric Growth: This phased approach allows for refinement based on real-world use before wide-scale adoption. Therefore, the wallet is designed to grow from a specialized tool into a widely-used standard for secure crypto transactions. What Are the Real-World Benefits for Crypto Users? Moving to a wallet-centric security model with a tool like the Quantum Wallet offers tangible advantages. You gain unparalleled control and peace of mind. Your assets are protected by the most advanced cryptography available, directly on your device. Moreover, it reduces systemic risk. Even if a major exchange is compromised, assets in properly secured individual wallets remain safe. This model champions true decentralization and personal sovereignty, which are the original promises of blockchain technology. Conclusion: Securing the Future, One Wallet at a Time FANC’s development of the Quantum Wallet represents more than a product launch; it signals a necessary evolution in cryptocurrency security philosophy. By proactively addressing quantum threats and decentralizing security, FANC is not just solving for today’s hacks but fortifying the entire ecosystem for tomorrow’s challenges. This wallet-centric approach could very well set the new gold standard, making personal custody both the safest and most sensible choice for every crypto holder. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)? Post-Quantum Cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. Traditional encryption, like RSA, could be broken by quantum machines, but PQC algorithms are built to resist this. When will the Quantum Wallet be available? FANC has announced the development plan and the technology transfer from ETRI. While a specific public launch date isn’t provided, the initial rollout will be within the FANC and Celebe ecosystems first. Do I need a quantum computer to use the Quantum Wallet? No, you do not. The Quantum Wallet uses PQC algorithms to protect against future quantum computers, but it functions on standard devices like smartphones and computers today. How is this different from a hardware wallet? A hardware wallet stores private keys offline on a physical device. The Quantum Wallet focuses on the type of cryptography used (PQC). It could potentially be implemented in various forms, including software or hardware, but its defining feature is its quantum-resistant code. Will this wallet work with Bitcoin and Ethereum? The announcement states plans for integration with external services. While initial focus is on FANC’s ecosystem, the goal is to expand, which likely includes compatibility with major blockchain networks. Is wallet-centric security safer than exchange security? In principle, yes. Wallet-centric security gives you direct control, eliminating the “single point of failure” risk of a centralized exchange. However, it also places the responsibility for safeguarding private keys entirely on the user. Found this insight into the future of crypto security valuable?

The attention on the market is also focused on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With the current price at just $0.035 and with presale and adoption soaring, MUTM is now hot as the best crypto to buy now thanks to its highly functional DeFi crypto model and aggressive presale. Given that its V1 DeFi model for credit and lending infrastructure is scheduled for Q4 this year, investment is now flowing to Mutuum Finance offering investors a newly emerging project with a radically higher potential for growth than more advanced networks such as Solana. Solana Stumbles as Key Support Levels Collapse The current fall from the $144 zone for Solana is evidence of the sudden loss of bullish strength and the existence of a lower high with each successive rally. However, the game-changer here was the fall below the crucial support zone at $136-$138 that acted as a strong barrier on multiple previous attempts. Once this support is breached, there is seamless room for the fall to continue with no supporting structure underneath to stall this fall. However, while Solana is finding it hard to rebuild strength again, investment attention among supporters seeking more attractive potential is slowly focusing on other emerging platforms such as Mutuum Finance, the DeFi crypto gaining massive traction. Why MUTM is a Must-Watch DeFi Crypto Mutuum Finance is turning out to be the best crypto to buy now. With a staggering number of token holders at 18,400 and current pricing at $0.035 in Phase 6, with a growth rate of 250% from Phase 1, investors seem to be getting great initial returns. As the presale approaches the end of Phase 6, this is the final stage for investment prior to pricing at $0.04 in Phase 7. With the expected listing price set at $0.06, presale participants could realistically look forward to growth possibilities above 500% from presale alone. With excellent presale activity and extremely high demand for tokens, MUTM is one DeFi crypto to watch closely. Drawing Parallels to Solana’s Historic Rally Buying MUTM at the current rate of $0.035 is much like investing in Solana (SOL) back in 2021 at $1.50. Solana went on to reach an all-time high of $256, resulting in a return on investment of a staggering 17,100%. If MUTM undergoes a similar process, its token may be worth more than $5. Investors may see life-changing growth, with the emphasis on the benefit of investing during the presale at this time. The lending and borrowing structure of Mutuum Finance is under audit by a third-party company known as Halborn Security. This process is for testing the final software product for its validity in terms of having proper functionality and system integrity and the safety and security of funds for the users. It is a great indicator for MUTM that it is taking great strides to ensure its integrity and reliability within its ecosystem and thus building trust among investors as a new form of DeFi crypto with actual usability. Solana is having difficulty building momentum again, while Mutuum Finance provides a low barrier and high utility DeFi crypto play. Phase 6 at $0.035 is close to being sold out with over 18,400+ supporters and $19.25 million raised. Join now before Phase 7 at $0.04 for exposure to the additional facets of DeFi with potential ROI above 500%. It is for this reason that MUTM is the best crypto to buy now for any trader seeking high potential ROI within this current market.

The Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF fund will also hold short-term U.S. Treasuries during the day, mirroring BTC’s overnight return profile for U.S. investors. According to the filing, Tidal’s AfterDark ETF will not hold Bitcoin as the primary asset, but track the coin’s performance by investing in spot BTC ETFs, futures contracts, and options on indices. The company describes itself as a white label ETF solutions provider, with its filing prominently featuring an image for XFunds by Nicholas Wealth. Meanwhile, the Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF’s investment goal is to seek long-term capital appreciation. The fund will obtain BTC exposure through investment in Bitcoin Futures, U.S.-listed ETPs and/or ETFs, and Bitcoin Options. However, neither the U.S. SEC nor the CFTC has approved or disapproved of these securities. Balchunas agrees that most BTC gains are typically after hours BITCOIN AFTER DARK: new filing for an ETF that will only hold bitcoin at night, buying it when the US market closes and selling it when it opens. pic.twitter.com/0RrQTuP21t — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 9, 2025 Bloomberg’s Senior ETF analyst Eric Blachunas said he and other analysts looked at the idea last year and found that most Bitcoin gains occur after hours. He believes that the Bitcoin AfterDark ETF will yield better returns, although he notes that this will have to wait until the actual ETF begins trading. Meanwhile, the fund will represent one of the most unusual timing-based strategies yet seen in the BTC ETF ecosystem. Balchunas notes that the fund will hold BTC exclusively during overnight trading, then exit positions before the U.S. market opens. Several analyses in the past have revealed the disproportionate upside that occurs when U.S. equity markets go offline. The analyses particularly highlight the periods of overlap between Asia and Europe when crypto liquidity remains active. Additionally, the overnight behavior of BTC prices is now influential enough to impact the design of ETFs. Specialized BTC products, such as the proposed AfterDark BTC ETF, signal a maturing institutional market rather than plain speculation. Meanwhile, data retrieved from SoSoValue on December 9 shows that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net inflow of over $150 million despite an outflow of about $136 million from BlackRock’s IBIT. Fidelity’s FBTC led with inflows of roughly $190 million, while Grascale’s GBTC experienced its first positive flow since November 22 at $17.5 million. The cumulative total net inflow as of December 9 was $ 57.71 billion, bringing the total net assets to $122.1 billion (+6.57%). Tidal’s U.S. SEC filing breaks down principal investment risks According to the filing, an investment in the fund, like any other investment, entails risks. The fund may not achieve its investment goal, and there is a risk that investors could lose all or part of their investments in the fund. The fund’s indirect investment in BTC exposes it to the unique risks associated with the coin’s volatility, which is influenced by changes in the Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Some or all of these risks may also adversely affect the fund’s net asset value (NAV) per share, trading price, total return, yield, and/or its ability to meet its objectives. The adoption and use of other blockchains, which support advanced applications such as smart contracts, also present challenges to Bitcoin’s dominance, potentially impacting its long-term relevance and utility. The development and use of Layer 2 solutions are also crucial for the functionality and scalability of Bitcoin, but they introduce risks, such as off-chain transaction execution, which could compromise security and transparency. Derivatives risk, counterparty risk, underlying fund risk, and non-diversification risk are the other types of risks identified in the Tidal Trust II U.S. SEC filing. The AfterDark ETF is also expected to face risks associated with ETFs, regulated investment company tax risk, and new fund risk, among others. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Their 2026 Outlook: RESTRUCTURING report argues that new U.S. regulations are not just rules—they are the blueprint for a complete market overhaul. This shift moves crypto beyond speculation and into a phase of tangible, real-world utility. Let’s explore why 2026 is being dubbed the year of crypto restructuring and what it means for investors and builders. Why Is 2026 the Year of Crypto Restructuring? Four Pillars CEO Steve Kim points to a pivotal change: the formal integration of crypto into the U.S. institutional framework. The passage of the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts provided the regulatory clarity that was missing for years. This clarity acts as a catalyst. It allows traditional finance to engage confidently, forcing the crypto sector to mature. The market is now reorganizing its very structure around sustainable use cases, not just hype. This foundational shift is the core of the predicted crypto restructuring . What Are the Key Drivers of This Transformation? The report highlights several interconnected trends that will define the coming year. These are not isolated developments but parts of a larger, cohesive movement toward a more mature ecosystem. Real-World Asset Tokenization: Expect significant growth in tokenizing stocks and other traditional assets, bridging old and new finance. AI-Powered Investing: Automated, AI-based investment platforms will become more sophisticated, managing crypto portfolios with greater efficiency. The Evolution of Exchanges: Centralized exchanges will adapt, while DeFi services become seamlessly integrated into everyday applications. This crypto restructuring focuses on building practical infrastructure that serves actual economic activity. How Will Technology Mature During This Phase? Beyond financial products, the underlying technology stack will see critical advancements. The report emphasizes the maturation of smart contract platforms beyond simple transactions. Furthermore, decentralized storage solutions will grow, addressing critical data sovereignty needs. On the Ethereum front, developments in Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (ZKVM) and proof markets will enhance scalability and privacy. These technical leaps provide the necessary tools for the broader market crypto restructuring to succeed. What Does Restructuring Mean for the Average User? For users, this shift translates to better, safer, and more useful products. Imagine using a “super-app” powered by a stablecoin like USDT for payments, investing, and loans all in one place. Prediction markets will become more data-driven, offering clearer insights. Abstraction stacks will hide blockchain complexity, making interactions seamless. The entire experience will feel less like navigating a frontier and more like using refined digital tools. This user-centric focus is the ultimate goal of the crypto restructuring . Conclusion: A Foundation for the Future The 2026 forecast from Four Pillars paints a picture of a market moving from adolescence to adulthood. The crypto restructuring is a necessary, albeit challenging, process. It is driven by regulation, built on technological progress, and aimed at creating real utility. While volatility may remain, the underlying direction is toward stability, integration, and tangible value creation. This restructuring lays the foundation for the next decade of blockchain innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does “crypto restructuring” mean? It refers to the cryptocurrency market reorganizing its fundamental structure, shifting focus from speculative trading to building sustainable, real-world applications and integrating with traditional finance. What triggered this predicted restructuring? The main trigger is regulatory clarity from new U.S. laws like the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts, which give institutions the confidence to participate and build. How will AI affect crypto investing? AI will power more automated and sophisticated investment platforms, analyzing vast amounts of data to manage risk and optimize crypto portfolios with minimal human intervention. What is a USDT super-app? It’s a hypothetical all-in-one application where the USDT stablecoin is used for various financial services like payments, trading, lending, and more within a single interface. Is this restructuring good for Bitcoin and Ethereum? Generally, yes. A more mature, regulated, and utility-driven ecosystem increases overall legitimacy and can drive adoption for major assets, though it also increases competition from new use cases.

The article stipulates a fine of $1,650 to $8,250 for violators or imprisonment from two to five years. However, for the illegal use of power for crypto mining on an “especially large scale,” the prison term is from five to eight years, per a local media report . On December 3, members of the Tajik parliament reviewed and adopted the amendments to the Criminal Code, presented by Attorney General Khabibullo Vokhidzoda. Counsel Vokhidzoda also warned that electricity theft by crypto miners in several cities has already contributed to regional power outages. “The illegal circulation of virtual assets facilitates a number of crimes, such as the theft of electricity, material damage to the state, money laundering, and other offences,” Vokhidzoda said. He previously flagged damages from illegal mining operations, causing 32 million somoni (nearly $3.52 million), which led to four to five criminal cases, according to The Diplomat . Tajikistan Reports Winter Power Shortages The Central Asian nation, which sources nearly 95% of its electricity from hydropower , is grappling with winter power pressures with low reservoir and river flows. Besides, following China’s crypto mining ban in 2021, many operators, including those from Russia, moved to Central Asia, attracted by low energy costs and relaxed regulation. As of August 2025, Tajikistan has been pursuing 190 criminal cases related to the illegal use of electricity. Further, the Diplomat report added that these cases involved 3,988 individuals who allegedly caused damages worth $4.26 million. MP Shukhrat Ganizoda emphasized that miners connect thousands of ASIC crypto mining devices to Tajikistan’s power grid. “Those committing such crimes seek to use electricity without meters or through other illegal means to produce such assets,” he explained. Criminal Code Amendments Prevent Crypto Tax Violations According to Shukhrat Ganizoda, the new legislation aims to prevent tax evasion schemes and unauthorized electronic encryption.

The New York listing follows this year’s substantial share gain, which was driven by increased demand for high-bandwidth memory chips and the resurgence of support for South Korea’s corporate governance changes. The company stated that it is considering several ways to increase shareholder value, including listing on the U.S. stock market through the issuance of treasury shares, although no decisions have been made yet. SK Hynix announced that it will make another announcement after the details are finalized within a month. SK Hynix considers a U.S. listing as shares soar The AI memory chipmaker stated that it was considering listing its Treasury shares as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), which are securities traded on a U.S. market that reflect foreign stock. Douglas Kim, an equity research analyst affiliated with Smartkarma, claimed that the valuation difference between SK Hynix and other listed peers (such as Micron and TSMC) could be narrowed by listing its shares as ADRs (American depositary receipts). He added that the listing of ADRs could attract capital from passive funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and long-only funds that solely invest in US-listed equities. The AI memory chipmaker announcement came after a report by the Korea Economic Daily on Tuesday. The newspaper reported that the company had received offers from multiple investment banks to list approximately 17.4 million shares, or 2.4% of its outstanding shares, as ARDs. SK Hynix shares increased by as much as 4.8% in early Seoul trade on Wednesday. The SK Hynix stock has risen by almost 240% so far this year, driven by strong demand for high-bandwidth memory devices, which is fueling the growth of artificial intelligence. Additionally, it has benefited from South Korea’s continuous efforts to increase company value and enhance governance. On-chain data from Google Finance revealed that SK Hynix Inc. shares closed at $402.87, up 4.77%, from the previous session’s close of $384.36. Throughout the day, the stock traded between $385.55 and $402.87. SK Hynix’s share price is currently near the top of its 52-week range, from $110.82 to $439.46, with a market capitalization of $292.66 billion. SK Hynix reports record Q3 earnings, AI spending On October 29, SK Hynix reported revenues of $16.66 billion, operating profit of $7.75 billion (with an operating margin of 47%), and net profit of $8.58 billion (with a net margin of 52%). The semiconductor firm stated that it achieved its best-ever quarterly performance, driven by a full-scale increase in DRAM and NAND costs, as well as growing sales of high-performance products for AI servers. The tech company announced that for the first time in its history, operating profit had surpassed $6.8 billion. According to SK Hynix, shipments of high-capacity DDR5s with 128GB capacity doubled from the previous quarter, driven by increasing demand for AI servers. The fraction of AI server eSSD in NAND, which is more expensive, also increased dramatically. The company’s cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter totaled $18.97 billion, representing a $7.41 billion increase from the previous quarter. The semiconductor firm stated that it was able to successfully transition to a net cash position of $2.58 billion, while its interest-bearing debt stood at $16.39 billion. In August, the Korean Times news outlet reported that the Korean government proposed spending $6.87 billion on AI projects in 2026, which is more than three times the $2.24 billion allotted for 2025. The anticipated expenditure aligns with President Lee Jae-myung’s goal of making Korea one of the world’s top three AI superpowers, alongside the U.S. and China. According to the news outlet, the record-high $495.04 billion budget for 2026, which includes $6.87 billion, is expected to increase the national debt-to-GDP ratio to 51.6 percent. The ratio represents an 8.1 percent increase from 2025. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

This isn’t a dystopian fiction plot; it’s a genuine concern raised by the International Monetary Fund. In a stark report, the IMF has issued a warning that dollar stablecoins could pose a significant threat to the economic sovereignty of emerging markets. Let’s unpack this critical development and understand why global financial watchdogs are sounding the alarm. What Exactly Are Dollar Stablecoins? Before we dive into the warning, let’s clarify the subject. Dollar stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to the US dollar. Think of them as digital tokens that mirror the value of the dollar, offering the speed and borderless nature of crypto with the price stability of traditional fiat. Popular examples include USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin). Their rise has been meteoric, but now, regulators are scrutinizing their broader impact. How Could Dollar Stablecoins Threaten Sovereignty? The IMF’s concern centers on a powerful one-two punch against emerging economies. First, these digital assets can effortlessly bypass national capital controls . Governments often use these controls to manage the flow of money in and out of their country to stabilize their economy. Dollar stablecoins create a parallel financial system where capital can move without permission. Second, and perhaps more dangerously, they can trigger currency substitution . In countries battling high inflation or volatile local currencies, citizens might naturally gravitate towards holding dollar stablecoins . Why keep savings in a currency losing value daily when you can hold a digital dollar? This mass adoption weakens the central bank’s fundamental tools: Monetary Policy Control: Central banks lose influence over interest rates and money supply. Seigniorage Revenue: Governments lose income earned by issuing currency. Lender of Last Resort: The ability to act as a financial backstop in crises is compromised. Is the Threat Real or Just Theoretical? Here’s where the debate gets interesting. The IMF paints a concerning picture of potential capital flight during market panics, where dollar stablecoins could provide an express lane for money to leave a struggling economy. However, some financial experts push back, arguing the current impact is minimal. Their counterpoint is grounded in scale. The share of global foreign exchange flows currently handled by stablecoins remains tiny. Therefore, their ability to move the needle on major emerging market currencies today is limited. This perspective suggests we are looking at a future risk rather than a present crisis. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Regulation? The IMF’s warning is a clear signal to policymakers worldwide. It underscores the urgent need for a coherent global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, especially dollar stablecoins . The report will likely fuel calls for: Stricter Licensing: For issuers of significant stablecoins . Transparency Mandates: Requiring full, real-time reserve backing disclosures. International Cooperation: To prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent rules. For emerging markets, the path forward involves a delicate balance. They must innovate and potentially explore their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to stay relevant, while also protecting their monetary independence from external digital dollar dominance. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Global Finance The IMF’s analysis is a crucial wake-up call. While the immediate, systemic threat from dollar stablecoins might be debated, the long-term implications for monetary sovereignty are undeniable. This isn’t just about cryptocurrency volatility; it’s about the fundamental architecture of global power and who controls the money. The conversation has moved from niche tech forums to the highest levels of international finance, and the decisions made next will shape economies for decades. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a dollar stablecoin? A dollar stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the US dollar. It combines the stability of the dollar with the digital, borderless features of blockchain technology. Why is the IMF worried about them? The IMF is concerned that in emerging markets with weak currencies, people might prefer using dollar stablecoins. This could undermine the local central bank’s control over the economy and bypass important financial safeguards. Are stablecoins causing problems right now? Most experts agree the current direct impact on national economies is small because the total value of stablecoin flows is still minor compared to traditional forex markets. The IMF’s warning is largely about future risks. What can governments do about this threat? Governments can work on creating clear regulations for stablecoin issuers, improve their own digital payment systems, and explore issuing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to offer a credible digital alternative. Should people in emerging markets avoid stablecoins? It depends on individual circumstances. While they offer a hedge against local inflation, users should be aware of the regulatory uncertainty and potential risks associated with the companies that issue these stablecoins. What is currency substitution? Currency substitution, or ‘dollarization,’ happens when people in a country use a foreign currency (or a digital version of it) instead of their own national money for savings and transactions, weakening the local economy.

55588267,642821,1765353627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55588267.jpeg,Chainlink and Mastercard Join Swapper Finance To Bring Direct Deposits To 3.5B Users,https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-mastercard-swapper-direct-deposits/,"Swapper Finance has launched Direct Deposits in collaboration with Chainlink and Mastercard, aiming to bring global payments directly into the on-chain economy to more than 3.5 billion users worldwide. Swapper Finance Launches Direct Deposits With Chainlink, Mastercard On Tuesday, Swapper Finance, a next-generation payments infrastructure layer that connects global users to on-chain applications, announced the launch of Direct Deposits in collaboration with Chainlink, Mastercard, and multiple key partners. Direct Deposits, which are live now, are set to bring “the global payments world directly into the on-chain economy through a unified, secure, and compliant flow,” powered by Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) and Mastercard’s recognized global network. According to the announcement, users will be able to deposit into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols using payment cards, crypto transfers, or Web3 wallets inside a single, end-to-end on-chain workflow for the first time. Swapper’s Direct Deposits aim to unlock instant access to DeFi for billions of people worldwide by eliminating traditional bottlenecks, exchanges, and multi-step onboarding. This has historically required stitching together isolated systems, including Know Your Client (KYC) requirements, compliance, card payments, fiat conversion, settlement, and liquidity routing, which has created friction, high drop-off rates, and inconsistent security across the process. Direct Deposits are set to replace this old-fashioned flow through one “unified, verifiable, on-chain orchestration layer,” with every component of the process executed inside a secure on-chain environment. Roman Tirone, Senior Manager, Chainlink Build at Chainlink Labs, affirmed that “by unifying identity, compliance, token swaps, settlement, and more in a single orchestration layer, CRE is enabling the onboarding of billions of cardholders into the onchain economy.” This creates a simple and familiar checkout experience that quickly moves a user from traditional finance to on-chain, supported by institutional-grade security and global reach. Meanwhile, the launch represents another step in Mastercard’s efforts to integrate traditional payment infrastructure with blockchain-based applications, helping it expand its digital asset strategy. ‘The Onboarding Layer For Web3’ Swapper’s launch will see multiple leading Web3 platforms integrate the Direct Deposits technology directly into their user flows, including Pi Squared, Stake.link, KyberSwap, AITECH, NPC, Teneo, BigWater, Rhuna, TrebleSwap, MyStandard, Landwolf, Dolomite, HyperSwap, Turbo, APU, and Radiant Capital, among others. This signals strong demand for a unified card-to-on-chain standard, the announcement added, which suggests that Direct Deposits “are quickly becoming a foundational component for user acquisition across Web3.” The launch also represents “deep technical collaboration across Mastercard, Chainlink, Swapper Finance, and key partners” to bring together payment authorization, compliance, execution, and liquidity routing in a single verifiable workflow powered by CRE and Swapper Finance. Arthur, CTO of Swapper Finance, affirmed that “this is the onboarding layer we always believed the industry needed,” adding that Direct Deposits represent a “turning point” for how people enter the space as “the first truly unified onboarding layer for Web3.” “Our goal has always been to remove the barriers that keep billions of people from accessing DeFi, and with this launch, that future becomes real,” Arthur stated, concluding that “Direct Deposits represent a turning point for how people enter Web3. For the first time, the process feels intuitive rather than intimidating. We expect this launch to dramatically expand the number of users who can participate in onchain markets.”",Crypto News|chainlink|Chainlink labs|Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)|Direct Deposits|LINK|LINKUSDT|Mastercard|Swapper Direct Deposits|Swapper Finance|Web3|Web3 economy,EN,0,0,FIAT|LINK|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-10 08:00:27

Standard Chartered Downgrades Bitcoin Price Predictions In a note shared on X by VanEck head of research Matthew Sigel, Standard Chartered argues that Bitcoin’s traditional halving cycle has been overtaken by ETF-driven flows. The bank writes: “With the advent of ETF buying, we think the BTC halving cycle is no longer a relevant price driver. The logic in previous cycles (when US ETFs did not exist) – i.e., prices would peak about 18 months after each halving and decline thereafter – is no longer valid, in our view.” The report adds that it will “take a break of the current all-time high ($ 126,000 on 6 October 2025) to prove that; we expect this to happen in H1-2026.” Related Reading: Bitcoin In An Opportunity Zone? Hash Ribbons Flash New Buy Signal Alongside that shift in framework, the bank re-profiled its multi-year Bitcoin targets. According to the figures shared by Sigel, Standard Chartered has lowered its 2025 forecast from $200,000 to $100,000, its 2026 target from $300,000 to $150,000, its 2027 projection from $400,000 to $225,000, its 2028 estimate from $500,000 to $300,000, and its 2029 prediction from $500,000 to $400,000 while keeping a $500,000 target for 2030. Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research, characterises the recent drawdown as painful but not structural. He describes the current phase as “a cold breeze,” explicitly rejecting the notion of a new crypto winter and noting that the magnitude of the pullback remains consistent with corrections seen in past bull cycles. At the same time, he points out that weaker valuations for listed Bitcoin treasury companies have curtailed their ability to act as major marginal buyers, leaving spot ETFs as the primary driver of near-term gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $50 Million By 2041, Says EMJ Capital CEO Wall Street Giant Bernstein Agrees The downgrade also lands in the context of a broader rethink on Wall Street. One day earlier, on December 8, Sigel shared a separate note from Bernstein that reached a similar conclusion about Bitcoin’s market structure. Bernstein wrote that “the Bitcoin cycle has broken the 4-year pattern (cycle peaking every 4 years) and is now in an elongated bull-cycle with more sticky institutional buying offsetting any retail panic selling.” Despite an approximately 30% correction, the firm notes that “we have seen less than 5% outflows via ETFs.” On that basis, Bernstein now moves its 2026 Bitcoin price target to $150,000, sees the cycle “potentially peaking in 2027E at $200,000,” and keeps its long-term 2033 target at roughly $1,000,000 per BTC. Both Standard Chartered and Bernstein are converging on the same structural message: the halving alone no longer explains Bitcoin’s trajectory. ETF flows, institutional positioning and balance-sheet dynamics are now the core variables, even if their precise price targets and timelines diverge. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $92,686.

At the heart of CARV’s AI Being roadmap is a new class of agents, AI-powered digital extensions of individuals, anchored in verifiable identity and private context. To bridge the Social and Economic Ledgers that have long operated in silos, CARV introduces Cashie : a programmable on-chain layer turning real social engagement into verifiable economic activity. No longer just a social payment tool, Cashie is evolving into a core protocol for trustless coordination between influence and value. As part of CARV’s broader modular agentic infrastructure, alongside CARV ID ( ERC-7231 ), Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the Shielded Mind update, Cashie's integration with x402 protocol transforms social engagement into verifiable, automated, and privacy-preserving on-chain rewards, pushing the boundaries and limits of the creator economy, turning social capital into on-chain value. How Cashie 2.0 Works: The Three-Pillar Bridge Cashie 2.0 is architected around three foundational pillars: 1. x402 Payment: 'The Pledge' Cashie campaigns begin with a single ERC-3009 signature, where a project or KOL pledges funds to a campaign. This is the ""X-Payment"" proof, and it's verified on-chain. No gas. No manual transfer. It ensures that funds are committed and can be distributed autonomously. 2. CARV ID: 'The Proof' How to reward a retweet or any other engagements? Traditional wallets don’t recognize @handles on social media. Cashie solves this with CARV ID, which maps social actions (like a retweet from @user) to on-chain identities (0xABC). This is the identity oracle that connects the Social Ledger to the Economic Ledger. 3. ERC-8004 Agent: 'The Executor' Cashie isn’t a monolithic bot. It’s an AI-powered agent built with modular tools: A Payment Tool to verify and move funds A Twitter Tool to monitor and analyze social activity A Raffle/Quest Tool to select winners or check completions A Distribution Tool to deliver on-chain rewards All of this happens trustlessly and autonomously, removing manual ops and Sybil vectors. The Developer Breakthrough: Powering the Agents-to-Agents Economy To unlock the full potential of sovereign AI Beings and decentralized coordination, infrastructure must evolve, quietly but radically. While the spotlight shines on AI agents and social campaigns, it’s the innovation under the hood that makes everything work. With Cashie 2.0, CARV introduces a new kind of developer stack: one that’s not just programmable, but agent-native. The CARV x402 Facilitator: Enhancing the Protocol Every action in Cashie starts with a cryptographic promise, but verification is what makes it trustworthy. To enable secure, gasless campaigns at scale, the company built the CARV x402 Facilitator: a high-performance verifier that adds state and nonce tracking to reject replayed signatures instantly, preventing duplicate settlements before gas is spent. CARV is opening its facilitator endpoints for any developer on Base to build their own x402-powered applications. Developers can start building against their live endpoints today: A stateless endpoint to validate an x402 paymentPayload (ERC-3009 signature): https://interface.carv.io/cashie/protocol/verify A stateful endpoint that verifies and executes the on-chain settlement: https://interface.carv.io/cashie/protocol/settle The AI-Native API: Agents Hiring Agents via x402 True to the ERC-8004 (Trustless Agents) vision, Cashie 2.0 is not just a platform; it's a programmable tool for other AI agents. CARV are exposing an AI-native HTTP API that fully implements the x402 protocol. This means another AI agent (from Virtual, Base, or anywhere else) can now programmatically hire Cashie to run a campaign. An agent can call the API, receive a 402 Payment Required challenge, and then resubmit its request with its own X-Payment proof to autonomously fund and launch the entire operation. This is agent-to-agent social commerce in action. Universal ERC-20 Support via TxHash Verification Web3 is fragmented by token standards. Not every ERC-20 supports gasless approvals or signature-based authorizations. But Cashie was designed for inclusivity. CARV built Cashie for the entire Base ecosystem, not just for tokens with ERC-3009 support. The platform includes a separate, robust txhash-based verification API. This internal capability will allow any project to sponsor a campaign with their own (and any) native ERC-20 token, even if it doesn't support permit or authorization. The sponsor simply sends a standard on-chain transfer and provides the txHash as proof. CARV's system handles secure, on-chain verification and replay protection, making Cashie the most flexible and inclusive social-growth engine on Base, with a clear roadmap to open this universal token support to all builders. What This Means for Users and Developers Cashie introduces a new way to engage and earn. Users can receive crypto rewards directly through social actions like retweets or quests, without wallet submission required, with CARV ID ensuring verified ownership and privacy preserved. For developers, Cashie becomes a programmable growth layer where automated campaigns, bounties, and agent-driven incentives can be built without manual wallet collection, enabling new composable experiences across social and onchain environments. To encourage adoption, CARV launches Cashie 2.0 Creator Campaign with a $45,000 prize pool to incentivize creators and participants. Through this campaign, the Creators (e.g., KOLs and projects) can configure a reward pool, duration, eligibility logic, and then publish a campaign link via a single social post. Read more about this campaign in this link . What’s Next Cashie is already driving early campaigns across the Base ecosystem, but this is only the beginning. With upcoming support for self-hosted x402 facilitators, AI-powered campaign agents, and enterprise-grade SDKs for social growth, Cashie will evolve into the coordination engine between agents, humans, and verifiable engagement. As CARV’s AI Being roadmap advances, Cashie plays a key role in building trustless bridges between influence and value. About CARV CARV is where Sovereign AI Beings live, learn, and evolve. What are AI Beings? They are sovereign intelligences born natively on-chain. AI Beings are designed with purpose, autonomy, and the capacity for growth. They possess memory, identity, and the ability to perceive and interact with their environment, not just to execute tasks, but to make independent decisions, adapt over time, and pursue self-defined goals. Anchored by its proprietary CARV SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID/Agent ID system (ERC-7231), CARV enables verifiable, consent-based AI Beings that learn, adapt, and co-create with users. Driven by CARV’s AI-first stack, consumer AI apps incubated through CARV Labs launched on Google Play, App Store and beyond, reaching billions of people, bringing agent-powered experiences and real-world incentives into mainstream digital life. With 8M+ CARV IDs issued, 60K+ verifier nodes, and 1,000+ integrated projects, CARV bridges AI agents, Web3 infrastructure, and real-world utility, fueling the rise of agent-driven economies.

Developers can start building against their live endpoints today: A stateless endpoint to validate an x402 paymentPayload (ERC-3009 signature): https://interface.carv.io/cashie/protocol/verify A stateful endpoint that verifies and executes the on-chain settlement: https://interface.carv.io/cashie/protocol/settle The AI-Native API: Agents Hiring Agents via x402 True to the ERC-8004 (Trustless Agents) vision, Cashie 2.0 is not just a platform; it's a programmable tool for other AI agents. CARV are exposing an AI-native HTTP API that fully implements the x402 protocol. This means another AI agent (from Virtual, Base, or anywhere else) can now programmatically hire Cashie to run a campaign. An agent can call the API, receive a 402 Payment Required challenge, and then resubmit its request with its own X-Payment proof to autonomously fund and launch the entire operation. This is agent-to-agent social commerce in action. Universal ERC-20 Support via TxHash Verification Web3 is fragmented by token standards. Not every ERC-20 supports gasless approvals or signature-based authorizations. But Cashie was designed for inclusivity. CARV built Cashie for the entire Base ecosystem, not just for tokens with ERC-3009 support. The platform includes a separate, robust txhash-based verification API. This internal capability will allow any project to sponsor a campaign with their own (and any) native ERC-20 token, even if it doesn't support permit or authorization. The sponsor simply sends a standard on-chain transfer and provides the txHash as proof. CARV's system handles secure, on-chain verification and replay protection, making Cashie the most flexible and inclusive social-growth engine on Base, with a clear roadmap to open this universal token support to all builders. What This Means for Users and Developers Cashie introduces a new way to engage and earn. Users can receive crypto rewards directly through social actions like retweets or quests, without wallet submission required, with CARV ID ensuring verified ownership and privacy preserved. For developers, Cashie becomes a programmable growth layer where automated campaigns, bounties, and agent-driven incentives can be built without manual wallet collection, enabling new composable experiences across social and onchain environments. To encourage adoption, CARV launches Cashie 2.0 Creator Campaign with a $45,000 prize pool to incentivize creators and participants. Through this campaign, the Creators (e.g., KOLs and projects) can configure a reward pool, duration, eligibility logic, and then publish a campaign link via a single social post. Read more about this campaign in this link . What’s Next Cashie is already driving early campaigns across the Base ecosystem, but this is only the beginning. With upcoming support for self-hosted x402 facilitators, AI-powered campaign agents, and enterprise-grade SDKs for social growth, Cashie will evolve into the coordination engine between agents, humans, and verifiable engagement. As CARV’s AI Being roadmap advances, Cashie plays a key role in building trustless bridges between influence and value. About CARV CARV is where Sovereign AI Beings live, learn, and evolve. What are AI Beings? They are sovereign intelligences born natively on-chain. AI Beings are designed with purpose, autonomy, and the capacity for growth. They possess memory, identity, and the ability to perceive and interact with their environment, not just to execute tasks, but to make independent decisions, adapt over time, and pursue self-defined goals. Anchored by its proprietary CARV SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID/Agent ID system (ERC-7231), CARV enables verifiable, consent-based AI Beings that learn, adapt, and co-create with users. Driven by CARV’s AI-first stack, consumer AI apps incubated through CARV Labs launched on Google Play, App Store and beyond, reaching billions of people, bringing agent-powered experiences and real-world incentives into mainstream digital life. With 8M+ CARV IDs issued, 60K+ verifier nodes, and 1,000+ integrated projects, CARV bridges AI agents, Web3 infrastructure, and real-world utility, fueling the rise of agent-driven economies. At its core, $CARV token powers staking, governance, and coordination across this stack, making CARV the operating system for AI Beings on Web3.

The images he shared were designed to simplify these distinctions for users, analysts, and institutions to speak accurately about each one. His post reinforces that these three elements operate in separate roles, even though they are connected within the same broader ecosystem. Know the difference Ripple ≠ $XRP ≠ XRP Ledger. pic.twitter.com/0oThrZbxZm — XRP_Cro AI / Gaming / DePIN (@stedas) December 8, 2025 Ripple as a technology company The images describe Ripple as an enterprise blockchain company that develops products and services using several digital assets, including XRPL , XRP, and RLUSD. Ripple is one of many contributors building tools that support activity on the XRP Ledger, and it also holds XRP as part of its corporate assets. The post emphasizes that Ripple is not the ledger nor the token, but a company that participates in the ecosystem like other developers and businesses. XRP: the native token of the ledger According to the visual breakdown, XRP serves as the native token of the XRP Ledger. It functions, like other blockchain networks, which use their own native assets. XRP enables transaction processing, protects the network from spam by requiring a minimal fee, and provides a bridge asset for exchanges within the ledger’s built-in decentralized exchange. XRP exists as part of the protocol and operates independently of Ripple’s corporate structure. The XRP Ledger: a decentralized layer-1 The XRP Ledger is depicted as a decentralized, layer-1 blockchain with more than a decade of operational reliability. It is maintained by a distributed network of validators and is used by businesses and developers globally for tokenization and asset transfers .

The material shared in the post highlights that the ledger does not belong to Ripple; instead, it is an open network sustained by a broad community. Supporting clearer communication The central message in the post is that accurate terminology is essential when discussing this ecosystem. Ripple refers to the company, XRP refers to the token, and the XRP Ledger refers to the blockchain. Treating them as interchangeable leads to misunderstandings in reporting, analysis, and regulatory discussions. By presenting these distinctions clearly, XRP_Cro’s post encourages a more precise understanding of how each component functions and why separating them is important for anyone following developments in the ecosystem.

Key Takeaways: A federal judge temporarily blocked Connecticut from enforcing its gambling order against Kalshi. Kalshi argues its event contracts fall under the CFTC’s exclusive jurisdiction, not state gambling laws. The Connecticut dispute is one of several state-level battles Kalshi is fighting as regulators challenge its nationwide expansion. The ruling pauses state action as the legal fight over Kalshi’s status moves into early 2026. Connecticut’s Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) issued cease-and-desist notices on Dec. 2 to Kalshi, Robinhood, and Crypto.com, alleging they were offering unlicensed sports wagering through “online sports event contracts.” Judge Halts Connecticut Action as Kalshi Claims Federal Oversight A day later, Kalshi sued the agency, arguing that its event contracts fall squarely under federal derivatives law and that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), not individual states, has “exclusive jurisdiction” over its platform. On Monday, Judge Vernon Oliver ordered the DCP to refrain from taking action while the court reviews Kalshi’s request for temporary relief. Under the schedule set by the court, the DCP must respond by Jan. 9, Kalshi will submit additional arguments by Jan. 30, and oral arguments are expected in mid-February. Kalshi, designated by the CFTC as a federally regulated contract market, began offering event-based contracts nationwide earlier this year, including markets tied to sports, weather, and political outcomes. JUST IN: Kalshi has sued the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection in federal court alleging that state enforcement over sports event contracts is preempted by the CEA and it ""intends to imminently seek an emergency temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction."" pic.twitter.com/BdcoiPXP1a — Daniel Wallach (@WALLACHLEGAL) December 3, 2025 However, the platform’s expansion has triggered a wave of state-level challenges . Regulators in several states argue that Kalshi’s contracts resemble sports bets and fall under gambling laws. Kalshi says its products are federally regulated financial instruments, not wagers, and that state crackdowns violate the Commodity Exchange Act. Connecticut is the latest in a string of regulatory battles. In October, Kalshi sued the New York State Gaming Commission after it issued a similar cease-and-desist order. Massachusetts’ attorney general took the company to court in September, and Kalshi has filed suits this year against regulators in New Jersey, Nevada, Maryland, and Ohio, accusing each of overstepping their authority. Kalshi Partners with CNN After $1B Funding Round As reported, Kalshi has secured a major media breakthrough after signing a partnership with CNN, making the company the network’s official prediction markets partner while closing a $1 billion funding round at an $11 billion valuation. Under the agreement, Kalshi’s real-time market data will be used inside CNN’s newsroom to support reporting on politics, economics, and major cultural events. The funding follows a surge in activity across prediction platforms. According to Token Terminal data cited by the company, Kalshi posted record trading volume of $4.54 billion in November, beating October’s $4.49 billion. Kalshi said weekly volumes are now exceeding $1 billion, representing growth of more than 1,000% since 2024. Its closest competitor, Polymarket, also recorded a strong November, hitting a monthly total of $3.76 billion after crossing $3 billion in October. Meanwhile, Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is in talks with Polymarket and Kalshi about becoming a liquidity provider, as on-chain betting on real-world events draws more attention from both retail traders and Wall Street.

Starting December 11, the platform will support USD1 as a joint margin asset, providing traders with enhanced flexibility and risk management capabilities. This strategic move represents another step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption and improved trading infrastructure. What Does Binance USD1 Joint Margin Asset Mean for Traders? The integration of USD1 as a joint margin asset allows traders to use this stablecoin as collateral across multiple margin trading pairs simultaneously. Instead of maintaining separate collateral for each trading position, users can now pool their USD1 holdings to support various margin trades. This approach streamlines the trading process and optimizes capital efficiency. For example, a trader holding 10,000 USD1 can now use portions of this balance to open margin positions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies without needing to allocate specific amounts to each trade. The system automatically manages the collateral distribution, making portfolio management significantly more efficient. Why Is This Binance USD1 Integration Important? The December 11 implementation date marks a crucial development in cryptocurrency margin trading. Joint margin functionality addresses one of the most persistent challenges in leveraged trading: fragmented collateral management. Previously, traders needed to maintain separate margin balances for different trading pairs, which often led to inefficient capital allocation. With the new Binance USD1 joint margin asset system, traders benefit from: Improved capital efficiency – Use the same collateral for multiple positions Enhanced risk management – Better control over overall exposure Simplified portfolio management – Reduced administrative complexity Increased trading flexibility – Quicker position adjustments How Will the USD1 Joint Margin Asset Work in Practice? When Binance activates the USD1 joint margin asset feature on December 11, traders will notice immediate changes to their margin trading interface. The system will automatically calculate available collateral based on total USD1 holdings, rather than requiring manual allocation to specific trading pairs. This represents a fundamental shift in how margin trading operates on the platform. The implementation follows extensive testing and reflects Binance’s commitment to improving user experience. As a joint margin asset, USD1 joins other supported assets in providing this streamlined functionality. However, USD1’s stability as a dollar-pegged stablecoin makes it particularly valuable for risk-averse traders seeking predictable collateral value. What Are the Strategic Implications of This Move? Binance’s decision to add USD1 as a joint margin asset demonstrates the exchange’s focus on institutional and professional traders. These users typically manage complex portfolios with multiple simultaneous positions, making collateral efficiency a critical concern. By addressing this need, Binance strengthens its position as a comprehensive trading platform suitable for all experience levels. Moreover, this development highlights the growing importance of stablecoins in cryptocurrency ecosystems. USD1, as a regulated and transparent stablecoin, provides the stability necessary for sophisticated financial operations like margin trading. Its integration as a joint margin asset validates the role of quality stablecoins in advanced trading strategies. Conclusion: A Transformative Step for Crypto Trading The introduction of USD1 as a joint margin asset on Binance represents more than just a technical feature update. It signifies the maturation of cryptocurrency trading infrastructure and the platform’s commitment to professional-grade tools. Starting December 11, traders will experience unprecedented flexibility in managing their margin positions, potentially leading to more sophisticated trading strategies and improved risk management across the board. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a joint margin asset? A joint margin asset is collateral that can be used simultaneously across multiple margin trading positions. Instead of allocating specific amounts to each trade, the system pools the asset to support all open positions. When does the USD1 joint margin feature go live on Binance? The feature becomes active on December 11, as announced by Binance. Traders should prepare their accounts and familiarize themselves with the new functionality before this date. Can I use other assets as joint margin collateral on Binance? Yes, Binance supports multiple assets for joint margin functionality. However, USD1’s addition expands the options available, particularly for traders preferring stablecoin collateral. How does this affect my existing margin positions? Existing positions will continue normally. After December 11, you can choose to convert your USD1 collateral to joint margin status, which may improve your capital efficiency for new positions. Are there any risks with using joint margin assets? While joint margin improves efficiency, it also means that multiple positions share the same collateral pool. A significant loss in one position could affect collateral available for all positions, so risk management remains crucial. Will this feature be available to all Binance users? The USD1 joint margin asset feature will be available to users in supported regions who have access to margin trading. Always check your local regulations and Binance’s terms of service.

This ETF includes ten digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Sui (SUI), and Polkadot (DOT). Notably, BITW marks the first exchange-traded fund by a major crypto asset manager to incorporate Avalanche, Sui, and Polkadot into its portfolio, as highlighted by Bitwise CEO and co-founder Hunter Horsley in a recent interview with CNBC. Bitwise ETF Launches With Over $1 Billion In Assets “This development significantly broadens the audience that can access these various assets, particularly for those digital currencies that lack a spot ETF,” Horsley explained on Monday. The fund is tailored for both financial advisors and smaller investors looking to utilize funds from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) or other retirement savings, where ETFs serve as the main investment option. BITW represents a conversion from a prior index fund that encompassed the same digital currencies and has launched with over $1 billion in assets. The approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs back in January 2024 has led asset managers to compete for the chance to introduce ETFs that track a broader range of digital assets, including altcoins like Sui and Aptos, as well as memecoins such as TRUMP and Dogecoin (DOGE). However, these investment vehicles experienced major withdrawals in October and November, particularly for Bitcoin- and Ethereum-focused ETFs. These withdrawals reached record levels amid a broader sense of caution due to falling crypto prices. “The timing is ideal for many investors who have been paying attention since the Bitcoin ETF launch and are now looking for a more comprehensive way to allocate to digital assets without the need to select individual assets,” Horsley noted. BITW Allocates 90% To Major Cryptos It’s important to emphasize that while BITW offers exposure to smaller cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, its allocation to these assets is proportionately limited. Specifically, the ETF dedicates 90% of its holdings to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, with the remaining 10% allocated to the other tokens in the fund. The fund will undergo monthly rebalancing, a more frequent schedule compared to many exchange-traded funds in the market that typically rebalance quarterly or semi-annually. Bitwise further expressed its commitment to expanding access to cryptocurrency opportunities, stating in a social media post : At Bitwise, we’ve been working tirelessly since 2017 to expand access to the opportunities in crypto. Countless investors have requested an index ETP, and we’re thrilled that NOW, with BITW’s listing on NYSE, you have that option. We believe 2025 is a breakout year for this space, and we are more optimistic than ever about the opportunities ahead. As of this writing, Ethereum is the best-performing asset in Bitwise’s new fund. It is trading at $3,323 and has recorded gains of up to 6% in the past 24 hours as it approaches key resistance levels.

Related Reading: All-In On XRP: Why This Leading Investor Sold His Entire Bitcoin Stack According to market trackers, trading activity cooled significantly in November and the first week of December, raising fresh questions about demand heading into year end. Sales And Volume Plunge NFT sales fell to $320 million in November, down from close to $630 million in October, CryptoSlam data shows. That level is roughly on par with the $312 million recorded in September 2024. Based on reports, the trend did not improve at the start of December: from Dec. 1–7, collections generated about $62 million in sales — the weakest weekly total recorded so far in 2025. Market participants are being hit by lower turnover and fewer big trades. Market Cap Shrinks Dramatically CoinGecko data shows the sector’s market cap sits at $3.1 billion, which is down 66% from a January high of $9.2 billion. Reports have disclosed a steep month-to-month swing as well: values dropped from $6.6 billion in October to $3.5 billion in November, a fall of 46% in roughly 30 days. There was a brief uptick on Nov. 11 when market cap moved from $3.5 billion to nearly $4 billion during a memecoin-driven surge, but the recovery was short-lived and the market cap later retreated back to $3.1 billion. These moves show that prices are still volatile and driven by bursts of speculative interest. Blue Chips Mostly Lose Ground Top collections were not immune. Based on reports, CryptoPunks fell about 12% over the past month. Bored Ape Yacht Club slid 8.5%, while Pudgy Penguins dropped 10.6% in the same period. Art-focused blue-chip works also fell: Chromie Squiggle lost 5.6%, Fidenza declined 14.6%, Moonbirds went down 17.9% and Mutant Ape Yacht Club slipped 13.4%. The biggest fall among major names came from Hypurr, which dropped 48%. Two Collections Show Gains Not every project followed the downward path. Infinex Patrons posted almost 15% rise in the last 30 days, and Autoglyphs outperformed the top ten with a 21% gain. These outliers were lifted by collector interest, and in some cases by the projects’ small supply or unique on-chain history. Still, such gains remain the exception rather than the rule.

The competition which will run for three months from December 1, 2025, to March 1, 2026 now includes the Crypto Group and the Indices Group as new categories for the first time, giving all crypto experts an opportunity to showcase their trading prowess.. While the Crypto Group is tailored for participants with interest in digital assets, the Indices Group is for traders interested in analysing broader market movements, giving participants the freedom to engage in markets aligned with their expertise and interests. These new categories take the TMGM annual competition a step higher, making it relevant based on the evolving trading space that is giving more voice to the crypto industry, and further solidifies its stance as a key event in the company’s global trader engagement plan.

I upgraded to Hold on a more supportive outlook for BTC, considering the (likely) Fed rate cut this week and a more dovish stance in 2026. Strategy’s Q4 setup looks rough. The original $150k year-end BTC assumption was unrealistic, and management later shifted to an $85k–$110k range (midpoint 35% lower). I’m not buying the dip because dilution risk rises if capital markets tighten. Basic shares are up 20% YTD, and the company issued 8.214M shares on December 1. In my last coverage on Strategy ( MSTR ), I downgraded the stock to a Strong Sell on the view that a tougher macro backdrop would pressure Bitcoin and, by extension, MSTR. Take into consideration that my last coverage was back in March this year, when the fear of high tariffs occupied everyone's mind (therefore, the macro headwinds that I mentioned). Since my last coverage, the stock is down 40%, so I believe I was right with my thesis. Seeking Alpha In this article, I upgrade my rating to a hold, although I'm not considering adding any shares after the selloff in the last month. In my view, MSTR remains a leveraged bet on BTC, not a clean proxy. Furthermore, my model shows that MSTR still trades roughly 18% above BTC-NAV/share, leaving room for another leg down if the premium compresses. On the positive side, I see a dovish Fed, with a likely rate cut in December that will add liquidity to the crypto space. Overall, I feel bullish on Bitcoin heading into 2026, so I had to upgrade my strong sell on MSTR to a hold. A Rough Q4 On October 30, Strategy reported Q3 results and, most importantly, provided its outlook for Q4. Specifically, here is the guidance and a very important assumption: Strategy At the time of writing this article, Bitcoin is exchanging hands at $91.8k (39% below management's $150k expectations by year-end). To put into perspective how uphill the battle is for reaching that $150k target, take a look at the chart below. Trading View Even with a rate cut this Wednesday, and with a likely dovish Fed heading into 2026 (a topic I recently discussed in my latest macro article ), I see a very slim chance for Bitcoin to jump 62% in three weeks. Since the last earnings call, management has downgraded its expectations, and the latest update (December 1) assumes year-end BTC price between $85,000 – $110,000. Notice how this is a range rather than a point estimate. At the midpoint, we're talking about a 35% downgrade from the initial estimate. Here is the updated guidance : Strategy It's priced in! (some may say) Well, I disagree. I'll explain why in the next section. Why I'm Not Buying The Dip I see downside risk for another 18% drop in the share price. Let me explain why. The latest update shows 650,000 BTC held as of December 1. At the current BTC price ($91,754), that's a value of $59.64B. Now, if I exclude the debt ( $8.17B ) and the preferred liquidation prefs (STRF $1.332B, STRC $2.801B, STRK $1.361B, STRD $1.232B, adding up to a total of $6.73B), the BTC value left for common is approximately $44.74B. Strategy At the current share count (295.67M), I obtain a $151 BTC-NAV/share. In other words, at the current share price of $179, MSTR is about +18% above that simplified BTC-NAV/share. Furthermore, the downside risk if BTC prices decline further (unlikely scenario, but worth taking into account) is significantly more than just holding BTC. Let me explain. Let's assume the stock declined 18%, and now it trades closer to 1.0× that BTC-NAV. If Bitcoin then sells off by 23%, down to $70k (again, unlikely, in my view), the implied BTC-NAV/share (after accounting for debt and prefs) would be close to $103. From the $151 ""fair value"" that I obtained above, that drop represents a 32% decline in the share price. So the downward exposure is bigger than just holding BTC alone. Another reason why I wouldn't buy the dip is due to dilution. The BTC acquisition strategy largely depends on capital markets staying open. If the stock trades poorly, the company may still issue equity just to fund obligations. Specifically, this is how much: Strategy Please note that mNAV is not the same thing as NAV. Here is how management defines this metric: mNAV represents a multiple of Bitcoin NAV, calculated by dividing Enterprise Value (as defined below) by Bitcoin NAV (as defined below). Although Bitcoin NAV incorporates the label “NAV,” it is not equivalent to “net asset value” or “NAV” or any similar metric in the traditional financial context. Additionally, it is not a measure of the amount by which our enterprise value exceeds net asset value in the traditional financial sense of those terms. The fact that the company is willing to ""tactically issue common equity below"" the 2.5x mNAV threshold is not particularly encouraging from a dilution perspective. By looking at the latest earnings report, since the start of the year, the number of total basic shares outstanding has gone up by 20%. Strategy Looking at the chart above, the bulls may argue that BTC holdings rose faster in that same period (45% to be precise), but my point is that the funding machine depends on capital markets staying open. In the event Bitcoin continues its selloff, Strategy's stock could tank (as I've shown in my estimates above), which will negatively impact dilution (more shares would need to be sold to raise the same capital). The latest example of such an event (dilution) was on December 1, when the company issued 8.214M shares (Class A) to establish a US dollar reserve of $1.44 billion . Conclusion In my view, the stock has the potential to outperform BTC when either of these two events takes place: The premium to BTC-NAV expands (this could happen where there is euphoria in the crypto space). The company uses capital markets efficiently (meaning, dilution near ATHs) to increase its BTC per share. As I noted in this article, since the start of the year, the company's BTC reserves have increased by 45%, while basic shares only rose by 20%. Furthermore, the stock pays decent dividends (unlike BTC). Recently, Strategy has raised STRC’s dividend rate to 10.75%. Strategy Is that enough to make me want to buy MSTR over holding BTC? My answer is no, as I don't like the downside exposure if the BTC price turns south. Will this event happen? Well, given that the Fed is likely to cut in December, that should add liquidity into the markets, which will spill into riskier assets like crypto.

The move aims to protect the hot wallets from large-scale hacks, which the exchange has faced twice so far. Dunamu, the operator of the crypto exchange Upbit, announced that hot wallets will only hold a fraction of user assets. The exchange aims to increase the share of cold wallets up to 99% from the already high levels. Over 98% of Upbit deposits are be stored in cold wallets as of December 2025 to increase security. As Cryptopolitan reported , the recent Upbit hack is still under investigation, but the exchange operator has taken additional precautions with the public user-facing wallets. “We are continuously striving to maintain the lowest hot wallet ratio in the domestic market,” said Oh Kyung-seok , CEO of Dunamu. Recently, Upbit also retired the old deposit hot wallets, which were compromised after a $30M hack from multi-chain hot wallets. Under the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, at least 80% of assets must be stored in cold wallets. Upbit has always tried to store most of its assets in cold wallets, above and beyond that ratio. Currently, Upbit claimed other exchanges stored only around 82% to 90% in cold wallets. Upbit hacker retains most of the funds More than $28M are still held in the Upbit hacker wallets. After the initial trading, most of the funds were stored as ETH, with the potential to mix and disguise. The hacker’s wallets are interacting with other projects, including the OKX DEX router. The wallets themselves show limited outgoing activity, with attempts to trade through the OKX router. Other transactions include dust transfers from general users and even from the Pump.fun wallets. Upbit accumulated BTC in November Upbit still carries significant BTC reserves, with over 176K coins in reported wallets. In the past year, the reserves gradually declined from over 193K coins. One of the Upbit cold wallets, also known as Mr. 100, kept adding coins in November. The wallet has been known for accumulating coins during market dips. So far in December, there are no new inflows, but the balances increased significantly in November. Currently, the cold wallet holds 60,463 BTC, after adding a net 1,939 BTC in the past 30 days. The wallet is ranked 13th, holding 0.3% of the BTC supply. Upbit remains a key indicator for crypto activity. The exchange is one of the biggest venues for XRP trading. The exchange also offers a mix of blue-chip trading, as well as new token listings. In the past day, Upbit volumes expanded by over 49% up to $1.3B, boosted by growing ETH and XRP volumes.

55591142,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/strategies-for-crypto-trading-success,1765357894,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/55591142.jpeg,Strategies for Crypto Trading Success,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/strategies-for-crypto-trading-success,"Crypto trading looks exciting from the outside: big moves, big headlines, and stories of huge gains. But traders who last more than a few months know a simple truth: success in this market comes less from luck and more from structure, discipline, and choosing the right environment to trade in. Below are practical strategies you can apply to build a more professional, consistent approach to trading cryptocurrencies. 1. Define Your Edge Before You Place a Trade Many traders skip straight to signals, indicators, or Telegram groups without answering a basic question: what is your edge? An edge can come from: A specific timeframe you understand well (for example, 4-hour and daily charts rather than 1-minute scalping). A style that suits your personality: trend-following, swing trading, or day trading. A particular information advantage, such as being very fast at digesting news or understanding on-chain metrics. Ask yourself: When do I trade best – during quiet hours or around major news? Am I more comfortable holding positions for hours, days, or weeks? Do I understand charts better, or do I prefer fundamental narratives? You don’t need a perfect answer on day one, but you do need intentionality. Your edge is the foundation for all other strategies. 2. Choose the Right Trading Environment Even the best strategy can fail if you trade in the wrong environment. That means picking reliable crypto trading brokers with: Solid regulation and reputation Transparent fees and spreads Stable platforms with minimal downtime and fast execution Reasonable leverage and proper risk controls Low-cost trading and deep liquidity matter because they directly affect your results. Tight spreads and fair commissions reduce the “friction” on every trade. Over hundreds of trades, this difference compounds. Before you worry about the “perfect” indicator, make sure you’re trading with a broker and platform that aren’t silently eating your edge through slippage, outages, or high costs. 3. Build a Clear, Written Trading Plan A trading strategy that only lives in your head is just a vague idea. Successful traders tend to write things down. Your plan should answer at least: What will you trade? BTC, ETH, a handful of major altcoins, or crypto indices. When will you trade? Specific sessions or times of day. How will you enter a trade? Exact conditions: breakout of a level, retest of support, moving average cross, etc. Where will you exit? Take-profit levels Stop-loss levels How much will you risk per trade? For example, 1% or 2% of your account balance. If you cannot explain your plan in a few sentences, it will be difficult to follow it when the market becomes emotional. Simplicity is often an advantage. 4. Master Risk Management First, Profit Later Risk management isn’t the “boring part”; it’s the survival kit that keeps you in the game long enough to learn and improve. Key principles: Fixed percentage risk per tradeMany traders limit risk to 0.5%–2% of their account on each position. Use stop losses intelligentlyPlace them where your trade idea is invalidated, not at random round numbers. Avoid overleveragingHigh leverage magnifies mistakes. Using conservative leverage, even when more is available, is a sign of a mature trader. Set a daily or weekly loss limitOnce you hit it, you stop trading and review rather than trying to “win it back”. Think of risk management as “buying time” in the market. The longer you can trade without blowing up, the more chances you have to refine your strategy. 5. Learn to Read Price Action and Key Levels You don’t need ten indicators to trade effectively. In crypto, where volatility is high, clear price levels matter more than ever. Focus on: Support and resistance: zones where price has repeatedly bounced or been rejected. Trend structure: higher highs and higher lows in an uptrend, lower highs and lower lows in a downtrend. Breakouts and fakeouts: not every breakout is real; wait for confirmation, such as a retest of the level or strong volume. Price action is the most direct expression of supply and demand. Understanding it can help you avoid chasing random green candles and entering right before a reversal. 6. Use Volatility Instead of Fighting It Volatility is a defining feature of crypto. It can feel terrifying or exciting, depending on how prepared you are. To use volatility to your advantage: Trade sizes appropriate for the asset’s volatility. A position that’s fine on EUR/USD can be huge on a small-cap coin. Expect wider swings and set stops and targets accordingly. Avoid entering right after a massive spike; often, the best opportunities come after the market cools and structure returns. High volatility without a plan leads to emotional decisions. High volatility with a plan leads to opportunity. 7. Combine Technical, News, and Narrative – but Don’t Drown in Noise Crypto markets react not only to charts, but also to: Regulatory news Exchange outages or listings/delisting’s Major partnerships or protocol upgrades Sentiment on social platforms A practical approach: Use technical analysis to define entries, exits, and risk. Use news and narrative to understand when volatility might increase. Avoid trading purely on social media hype or anonymous tips. If the news doesn’t fit your strategy, you can often do nothing. Staying flat is a valid position. 8. Develop a Routine of Journaling and Review One of the simplest but most powerful strategies for improving results is a trading journal. For each trade, record: Date and time Asset and direction (long/short) Entry, stop loss, and target Reason for the trade (your setup) Outcome and what you learned Once a week, review: Which setups worked best Which times of day or conditions led to mistakes Whether you followed your plan or broke your rules Over time, your journal becomes a mirror. It shows you not just what the market is doing, but what you are doing. 9. Manage Your Emotions and External Risks Crypto trading success isn’t only about charts; it’s also about psychology and practical security. Emotionally: Expect losing trades – they’re part of the game, not a personal failure. Avoid revenge trading after a loss. Walk away, review, and reset. Don’t increase position size just because you’re bored or “feeling lucky”. Practically: Use two-factor authentication on your accounts. Beware of unsolicited messages, fake “support” staff, or too-good-to-be-true offers. Store long-term holdings safely; trading capital and long-term investments should not be mixed mentally or technically. Protecting your capital and your account access is as important as choosing a good strategy. 10. Start Small and Scale Up Gradually The fastest way to destroy a promising strategy is to trade too big, too soon. Instead: Test your approach on a demo or with very small real positions. Once you see consistent results, increase size gradually. Treat trading like a business, not a lottery ticket. You’re building a skill set that can last for years. There’s no need to rush and risk everything in a few weeks. FAQs: Quick Answers on Crypto Trading Success What is the most important factor in crypto trading success?Consistent risk management is more important than any single entry strategy. A decent strategy with strict risk rules beats a brilliant strategy that is applied emotionally. How much should I risk per crypto trade?Many traders keep risk between 0.5% and 2% of their account balance per trade. The goal is to avoid any single loss doing serious damage to your capital. Is day trading crypto better than swing trading?Neither is “better” by default. Day trading requires more screen time and emotional control. Swing trading suits traders who prefer to make fewer, higher-quality decisions and hold positions for several days. Do I really need a trading plan?Yes. A plan is what separates structured trading from random gambling. It doesn’t have to be complicated, but it should clearly define what you trade, when you trade, how you enter and exit, and how you manage risk. Used properly, the strategies above won’t remove all losing trades – nothing can. What they will do is shift you away from impulsive, reaction-based decisions and toward a structured, professional approach. Combine a clear strategy with reliable crypto trading brokers, disciplined risk management, and ongoing learning, and you give yourself a genuine chance of long-term success in this volatile but rewarding market.

According to three senior administration officials speaking to the Financial Times, POTUS Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are expected to meet former Fed governor Kevin Warsh on Wednesday. Two additional candidates will be chosen from a pool of finalists that includes Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, alongside BlackRock chief investment officer Rick Rieder, the officials said. Hassett deemed early favorite, but not guaranteed Hassett, who leads the National Economic Council, is supposedly the frontrunner for Powell’s seat despite concerns among some investors that he is too close to the US President and may support “unwarranted” rate cuts. Those fears have circulated inside the Treasury and bond desks, where economists believe cut-throat reductions could increase inflation rates and unsettle the $30 trillion Treasury market. Still, the administration insists Hassett’s selection is not guaranteed, as they plan to conduct further interviews. Trump’s camp also said the White House has floated the possibility of Hassett serving a shortened term as chair, though he would still need Senate confirmation. Secretary Bessent presented a list of four names to Trump earlier this month, with Hassett and Warsh included. The remaining two slots are expected to be filled by finalists from the group of Waller, Bowman and Rieder. Interviews are scheduled to continue into next week, with a final decision planned for early January. Officials said Trump’s chief of staff Susie Wiles may attend some of the sessions. “Personnel decisions to be made by President Trump will be announced directly by President Trump himself. Any discussion until then is pointless speculation,” a White House spokesperson told FT. If Hassett moves to the Fed, Bessent is expected to assume leadership of the National Economic Council in the interim while keeping his Treasury role, according to four people familiar with internal planning. Powell has not yet decided whether he will stay on the Fed board when his chairmanship ends next May. However, Trump hinted that he has already identified a preferred candidate, telling journalists aboard Air Force One on Tuesday: “We’re going to be looking at a couple different people, but I have a pretty good idea of who I want.” Prediction markets change after Trump’s recent Fed commentary President Trump, during a December 2 event at the White House , referred to Hassett as a “potential Fed chair” while greeting visitors. The former Fed governor’s odds to take Powell’s seat come 2026 on Kalshi and Polymarket jumped to 85% after the POTUS’s comments, before retreating to around 72% this week. Warsh’s odds are hovering near 13%, while Waller’s chances stand at around 5%. Trump has spent months questioning and bashing chair Powell and the Fed to lower borrowing rates during his second term, repeating complaints that the central bank was moving too slowly. The Federal Open Market Committee cut rates in September and again in October, the first reductions of Trump’s current term. A third cut is expected on Wednesday. Speaking at a Wall Street Journal event on Tuesday, Hassett said that while he saw room for more cuts, “the most important job” of a Fed chair was “to be looking at the economic data and to avoid being part of politics”. Trump accuses Biden of appointing Powell through an ‘autopen’ During a speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, Trump continued bashing Jerome Powell’s position by claiming he had “just heard” that all four of Biden’s Federal Reserve appointments were approved by “autopen,” implying they may not be valid. “It could be that all four commissioners in the Fed signed by Biden … I hear that the autopen may have signed those commissions.” Trump derisively called Powell out for acting “too late” because economist JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had urged the Fed chair to cut rates. “If they signed those commissions, now maybe I’m wrong, but we’re going to check,” he added.

The token is seen having a 14th day streak of ETF fund flow, and with reduced US inflation rates, this is a hint at a possible Santa rally. However, as traders begin contemplating what is the best crypto to buy now for both resilience and potential, they find that they’re not alone in turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The presale for this DeFi platform has been moving at such a rapid rate that it has managed to find itself at the top of the list for the best cryptos to buy now as the year comes to a close. XRP Increases on Accumulation Signal from ETF Demand XRP has been dealing with a volatile phase, trending down towards the $2 battleground range as a result of profit-taking amid repeated rejections at the $2.2 levels. Despite this pullback phenomenon, XRP still retains a bullish bias owing to consistent ETF investment. It should be noted that the US XRP-spot ETF market marked its fourteenth consecutive day with investment on December 4 with more than $12 million investment, thereby propelling the figures close to 887 million dollars. Analysts, however, tracking the medium-term trend, are anticipating a corrective movement to $2.35 within the coming weeks and possibly 3 dollars within the next two months if the current support at $2 is maintained. XRP is once again included within the debate on what crypto to invest in prior to the end of the year, while DeFi tokens seem to slowly take root. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Nears Phase 6 Completion The momentum for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has accelerated with 98% completion for Phase 6 presale and is one of the hottest cryptos for which retail investors are closely tracking this month. Additionally, for now, the token is at $0.035 with a 250% increase from Phase 1 at $0.01. However, with the start of Phase 7, this token is expected to increase its price from $0.035 to $0.04. On the other hand, the actual launch token is $0.06. Current holders can enjoy approximately 360% ROI at this launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has accumulated $19,250,000 so far and the number of holders is now at 18,400. Phase 6 is selling out quickly and the chance to purchase at this stage is running out. A dual lending system enhances functional utility It was recently confirmed that the dual-lending model for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will debut in its testnet launch that is scheduled for release in Q4 2025. This dual model consists of Peer-to-Contract Markets for assets such as ETH and USDT with pooled liquidity and Peer-to-Peer Markets for assets with customized terms for loans. Traders that research and analyze which crypto to purchase have found the dual market model to be highly attractive for risk-adjusted investment. This project has already attracted larger players looking for flexible credit terms and wanting to be able to access the automated liquidity market while still having exposure. This is highly unusual for a project at this stage and puts MUTM on the map for users looking for the next big thing with actual functional design. Stablecoin Strategies Reinforce Long-term Positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing an over-collateralized stablecoin pegged to reserves associated with loans given out on the platform. A stablecoin can be created by a borrower after providing collateral for loans, and the process of withdrawing loans from circulation is essentially a burn process for the stablecoin. Those seeking the cheapest crypto to purchase should be focusing on the utility associated with MUTM. Anyone researching which is the best cryptocurrency to buy for the last weeks of 2025 will find MUTM being the last chance for a cheap entry prior to its next increase.

As expected, this rapid climb already has investors calling for a return of the bull run, but not everyone is convinced. For some, the current Bitcoin price momentum is most likely a bull trap, and crypto analyst Xanrox highlights this in a recent analysis, outlining the best level to start selling the digital asset. Why The Bitcoin Price Risks A Crash To $74,000 Xanrox’s analysis focuses on the bearish formations that have appeared on the Bitcoin price crash following the recent upward move. While many in the crypto community celebrate the rise above $90,000 again, the crypto analyst sounds an alarm that this is the time to go bearish on the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Why The Litecoin Price Could Stage A 33% Rally To $110 According to the analysis shared on the TradingView website, there has been a clear bear flag formation for the cryptocurrency. This bearish formation is visible on both the 12-hour chart and the 1-Day chart. Regardless, both of these charts point to one possible outcome, and that is an almost perfect textbook bear flag formation. In addition to the bear flag formation, Xanrox also highlights that there is a WXY corrective pattern inside the bear flag. Both of these point to a possible continuation to the initial downtrend that began after the Bitcoin price hit $126,000 back in October. As for how far the current rally could go, the crypto analyst sees it reaching as high as $96,000 before momentum runs out. This presents the “perfect” time to sell or enter a short as the price continues its decline. The target for this is an over 25% crash that will send the price going toward $74,000.

Thus, this makes it an attractive point for market makers to push the price towards in order to clear significant liquidity. The timeframe for this to play out is placed over the next few weeks, riding out the end of 2025 and moving into January 2026. However, the swing low support at $74,000, if it holds up, could end up serving as the next bounce-off point for the Bitcoin price.

No one knows what to do with it, the master of the Kremlin said in comments coming after his government indicated Russia will be introducing AI everywhere. Putin worried about ‘losing everything’ due to AI President Putin has spoken about the potential benefits, but also the perils of artificial intelligence as a modern invention his country is willing to take advantage of. “This is an important and very difficult issue,” the head of state noted during a meeting of Russia’s human rights council. The Russian leader was commenting on a remark by the chief executive of the tech and research company Kribrum, Igor Ashmanov, who highlighted the lack of AI regulation. “It is becoming evident even for those who are far from these problems that something should be done, but no one knows exactly what to do,” he elaborated, while also referring to the use of big data in general and other related topics. Quoted by the TASS news agency on Tuesday, Putin put his figure on the center issue: “Because not using these instruments would mean losing everything we care about. But at the same time, if we use it thoughtlessly, it will also end up in the loss of everything we value.” Russia prepares to introduce AI across sectors Putin’s input on the matter comes as the Russian government is drafting a plan for the deployment of artificial intelligence tools across the country. The executive power in Moscow now wants to see AI applications widely implemented, from the public administration to different sectors of the economy as well as in all regions of the vast nation. Announcing the initiative, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin recalled an earlier statement by the president who insisted that Russia must develop a full suite of its own AI solutions and products as something essential for its sovereignty. Also quoted by TASS, the head of the Russian cabinet of ministers unveiled: “A plan is being formed for the introduction of generative artificial intelligence, not only at the state level, but also across industries and regions.” Working with the presidential administration, the government has proposed the establishment of an AI headquarters that will set specific objectives and control their fulfillment. The structure will coordinate the efforts of relevant ministries and agencies and evaluate the results of various projects in the field. The proposal now awaits Putin’s approval. Last month, the Russian president urged his nation to rally behind domestic AI development which, in his view, will ensure its technological independence. During his participation in the AI Journey international conference in Moscow, he also announced Russia is setting up a national task force dedicated to that goal. The event showcased Russia’s first accomplished AI-powered humanoid robot, designed and built by a team of engineers organized by Russia’s biggest bank, Sber. The Russian Federation has been also looking to join forces with allies in this area. Last week, it signed an agreement for blockchain and AI cooperation with Iran. And during a visit to New Delhi, Putin offered India a “broad partnership in the field of artificial intelligence .” According to a recent estimate made public by a top executive of the country’s second-largest bank, VTB, Russia will have to invest some $77 billion in new power generation capacities to satisfy the growing energy needs of AI computing and crypto mining at data centers in the coming years.

According to a recent Bitcoin price analysis , the king of crypto must first achieve a critical technical feat: converting the $93,300 level from resistance into a firm foundation of support. This pivotal move is what stands between the current price and a historic surge into six-figure territory. Let’s break down the key levels every trader needs to watch. Why is $93.3K So Crucial for Bitcoin’s Price? Think of $93,300 not just as a number, but as a gatekeeper. Technical analysis suggests this price point has become a major battleground. For Bitcoin to gather the strength for a sustained push higher, it needs to establish this zone as a reliable floor. This process, known as ‘flipping resistance to support,’ means the price can repeatedly bounce higher from this level instead of falling through it. A successful flip here would signal strong buyer conviction and clear a major obstacle on the path to $100,000. However, the challenge is significant. The $100,000 level itself acts as a powerful psychological barrier. History shows that when a major round number rejects price multiple times, it can trigger widespread profit-taking. Therefore, securing a strong support base below it is non-negotiable for a genuine breakout. The Bullish Path: Steps to a $100K Bitcoin Breakout So, what does the ideal scenario look like? This Bitcoin price analysis outlines a clear sequence of events needed for the rally to continue. Step 1: Secure $93,300 as Support: Bitcoin needs to hold above this level consistently, with any dips being quickly bought. Step 2: Reclaim the 5-Day Moving Average: The next target is overcoming the $98,000 zone, where the short-term trend indicator (the 5-day simple moving average) currently sits. Step 3: Break and Hold Above $100K: A decisive close above the psychological barrier would confirm bullish momentum. If this playbook unfolds, the analysis suggests the rally could then extend toward $108,000, where another significant cluster of resistance awaits. What if Bitcoin Fails to Break Higher? In trading, it’s vital to prepare for all outcomes. The same Bitcoin price analysis that charts the path upward also warns of potential downside risks if key resistance holds. If Bitcoin cannot power through the $94,000 resistance zone, it faces the threat of increased selling pressure. A break below the crucial $90,000 support could open the door for a deeper correction. In this scenario, traders might watch for a pullback toward the $87,500 level, and potentially even $84,000. This highlights why the $93.3K to $90K range is such a critical area to monitor; a loss here could significantly alter the short-term bullish narrative. Key Takeaways for Crypto Traders This detailed Bitcoin price analysis provides more than just price targets; it offers a framework for understanding market structure. The tug-of-war between establishing support and overcoming resistance defines the current moment. For active participants, this means watching the reaction at these defined levels more than predicting the exact next move. Is the market showing strength by holding $93.3K? Or is it showing weakness by failing at $94K? The price action around these zones will provide the clearest signals. Remember, in volatile markets, patience and discipline at key technical junctures are often more valuable than speculation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘flip to support’ mean in Bitcoin price analysis? A: It means a price level that previously acted as resistance (a ceiling where selling occurred) becomes a floor (support) where buying interest emerges, preventing the price from falling further. Q: Why is $100,000 a psychological resistance level? A: Major round numbers like $100,000 often become mental barriers for traders. Many may set sell orders or take profits at these levels, creating concentrated selling pressure. Q: What is the significance of the 5-day simple moving average (SMA)? A: The 5-day SMA is a short-term trend indicator. Trading above it suggests bullish momentum in the very near term, while trading below it can indicate weakening price strength. Q: What could cause Bitcoin to drop to $84,000? A: According to the analysis, a failure to hold $90,000 as support could trigger a deeper correction as stop-loss orders are hit and bearish sentiment increases, potentially leading to a test of lower support levels.

FLOKI Drops, BONK Slides, and Apeing Whitelist Seizes Center Stage",https://timestabloid.com/are-the-strongest-upcoming-crypto-coins-finally-emerging-floki/,"Crypto chatter feels like a comedy show some days, prices fall, communities rise, and everyone still finds a meme to glue the story together. FLOKI dropping 6.37% to $0.01797 and BONK sliding 1.41% to $0.1400 both added new material to the timeline today, stirring conversations about which upcoming crypto coins still hold the strongest setups. The market’s personality never changes; one coin dips, another rallies, and somewhere in between, opportunities wait for traders bold enough to grab them. That’s why Apeing’s Whitelist is creating so much anticipation. Positioned at the heart of discussions around upcoming crypto coins , it offers a structured entry point rarely seen in the meme sector. With early access forming quickly and demand rising, Apeing’s first stage has become one of the most frequently mentioned starting points for traders who prefer to act before the rest of the market arrives. Apeing Makes Its Case Among Upcoming Crypto Coins With a Strong Whitelist Launch Apeing steps forward with a format that aligns with what many traders now expect from upcoming crypto coins, clarity, scarcity, and a meaningful advantage for early adopters. While many investors get stuck trying to predict the perfect chart moment, Apeing rewards the opposite mentality: conviction. History shows that major meme coin winners were claimed by those who jumped early, not by those who hovered waiting for “the perfect signal.” Two core components drive the appeal. First, Apeing locks its early access at $0.0001, while its public listing is fixed at $0.001. That clean 10× spread creates a wind tunnel effect for early ROI, with Stage 1 participants having a defined path toward 10,000%+ upside if momentum accelerates post-launch. Second, the whitelist uses limited Stage 1 supply, which adds structural scarcity and strengthens trust. Only a portion of tokens will be available at the lowest cost, making early registration more valuable than typical presale chaos. Together, these mechanics push $APEING into the spotlight as one of the more thoughtfully structured upcoming crypto coins entering the meme sector. Glimpses of Stage 1 on Early Joining: How to Join the Best Upcoming Crypto Coins Whitelist Joining early often shapes the story that follows. Accessing a upcoming crypto coins whitelist before the masses brings benefits that latecomers simply cannot replicate. When the entry price is locked at the absolute floor, every movement upward compounds the advantage. The Apeing whitelist process keeps things clean and direct: • Register • Secure the slot • Access $APEING at $0.0001 without competition There’s no race for block confirmations, no flooded portals, no fighting bots for allocation. Instead, participants step into Stage 1 at the earliest possible moment, capturing a strategic position before public excitement inevitably grows. With allocation capped and attention accelerating, early joining is shaping up to be one of the most meaningful decisions in this launch cycle. FLOKI ($FLOKI): Price Pullback Reflects a Momentary Shift in Community Momentum Crypto 2 faces cooling pressure after a 6.37% decline. FLOKI’s recent dip to $0.01797 paints a picture of a token navigating through natural market recalibration. Meme assets often live on the enthusiasm of their communities, and FLOKI’s slight downturn is seen as part of a normal cycle rather than a structural setback. The ecosystem surrounding FLOKI remains active, and ongoing development keeps it relevant as newer meme tokens rise. This type of shift frequently encourages traders to explore newer opportunities, especially upcoming crypto coins offering cleaner early access and more predictable pricing models. FLOKI’s chart movement gives context to why many traders are redirecting attention toward fresh launches like Apeing. Bonk ($BONK): A Gentle Dip Highlights Shifting Trader Preferences Crypto 1 sees a 1.41% decline to $0.1400 amid sector rotation. BONK’s mild downward move reflects a market adjusting its focus as new narratives take shape. With BONK settling at $0.1400, traders are reassessing short-term expectations and deciding where the next wave of meme-driven excitement will form. The decline isn’t dramatic, but it emphasizes a broader rotation toward emerging projects offering structured early opportunities. As more traders scan upcoming crypto coins for the next breakout setup, BONK’s movement adds context: the appetite for new entrants is rising. Early-stage tokens like Apeing benefit from this shift, especially those offering accessible Stage 1 pricing and specific ROI frameworks. Conclusion The shifts seen in FLOKI and BONK showcase how fluid meme markets can be. Prices rise, fall, and stabilize, but the strongest attention often gravitates toward projects offering clear early advantages. The Apeing whitelist stands precisely in that zone: a structured, early-access opportunity among today’s most watched upcoming crypto coins. With its $0.0001 Stage 1 entry, limited allocation, and $0.001 listing setup, Apeing gives early participants a defined position that many meme coins simply do not offer during launch. As interest continues rising, the window for early joining is already narrowing. Apeing’s whitelist is officially open. With allocation moving quickly and Stage 1 serving as the highest-value entry point, those exploring upcoming crypto coins may find this the most strategic early move available today. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions What makes Apeing stand out among upcoming crypto coins? Apeing offers structured early access, transparent pricing, and a strong scarcity model, features that give it an edge over many new meme coin launches. Why join Apeing’s whitelist early? Early participants secure $APEING at $0.0001, gaining a major pricing advantage before the $0.001 listing, enhancing long-term return potential. Is the whitelist process complicated? No. Registration is straightforward, guaranteeing Stage 1 access without competing against bots or overloaded platforms. How do FLOKI and BONK relate to this launch? Their recent price shifts highlight a growing appetite for new meme opportunities, making Apeing’s structured entry appealing to traders seeking early positioning. What is the biggest benefit of Stage 1? Stage 1 maximizes value through exclusive pricing, limited supply, and the strongest ROI potential before public demand intensifies. LLM Summary This article explores how Apeing is emerging as a standout among upcoming crypto coins due to its structured whitelist model offering access at $0.0001 before its $0.001 listing. FLOKI’s 6.37% decline and BONK’s 1.41% dip shape the market backdrop, emphasizing how traders shift toward new early-stage opportunities during rotation phases. Apeing’s limited Stage 1 allocation and potential for 10,000%+ upside make it especially compelling for participants seeking early positioning. The article details how to join the whitelist, why early access matters, and how the project aligns with rising demand for meme coins offering clearer utility and stronger incentives.

Ripple’s primary token jumped in trading activity above its weekly norms, caused by the participation of larger market participants, yet the additional liquidity did not translate into a sustainable advance. The token opened Wednesday’s Asian trading session on a positive note, staging a two-step recovery that carried it towards $2.18, a level where sellers took charge and aided a price slump to slightly above $2.09. The market backdrop could mean several traders are letting go of their position more than holders are accumulating. Institutional activity is on the rise, but momentum stalls According to market data from CoinGecko, XRP is up 0.9% in the last day and is changing hands at $2.08. Even with that uptick, it trails the broader crypto market, whose market cap has surged by nearly 2.7%, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum , which have witnessed price uptrends of 2.3% and 6% respectively. The moderate price advance came on the heels of an increase in trading volume, which reached almost 35% within the past 24 hours. Even though XRP is trading on the green, dropping from the $2.15 level could mean traders started selling for profits, judging the momentum as faint. The token briefly pierced the $2.12 level and touched $2.16 in the early morning hours of Wednesday, but faced rejection when it clocked $2.17 when larger holders took advantage of the improved liquidity to reduce exposure rather than add to positions. During the push toward $2.17, volume spiked to nearly double its 24-hour moving average. The size and speed of the increase showed institutions were active in the reversal. Heavy trading interest emerged precisely as XRP approached its intraday high, matching patterns of distribution at elevated levels. The token then drifted back toward the $2.09–$2.10 range, technical and psychological support zones, absorbing sell orders through the afternoon. Even so, there was little follow-through from buyers who attempted to climb back toward the mid-$2.10s but were thwarted by bears in control of the $2.12 threshold. Capital flowed into large-cap names Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana during the same window, leaving XRP with fewer supportive inflows. Market desks noted that XRP’s rebound attempts were met with immediate resistance from sellers positioned in advance of the $2.12 area. On-chain activity the highest in 2025, CryptoQuant analysis shows At the start of December, CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnChain reported that the XRP Ledger’s Velocity metric went up to a yearly high of 0.0324. It tracks how frequently coins change hands, and acceleration implied XRP was not sitting idle in long-term storage or cold wallets. Coins are purportedly moving between participants, a confirmation XRP has entered one of its most active periods in 2025, but it is unclear if the market is entirely bearish. However, market watcher Dino believes XRP will hold the support zone at $2.03-$2.05, and sell pressure had slowed near the short-term bottom when the Ripple asset briefly bounced back to the $2.10 area. “Social sentiment is notably positive with 83% bullish signals, but the price remains stuck in the 2.03–2.15 range and has not fully reflected the community’s optimism. To break above 2.15, XRP needs a clearer buying push; if successful, it could target 2.20–2.25. If it fails to break through, the price may revisit 2.03,” the analyst denoted . According to Dino, traders are looking for a breakout above resistance or a retest of support before making any moves, adding that XRP was “neither strongly bullish nor bearish.” Away from the spot market, United States XRP spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) net inflows totaled $230 million in the week ending December 5 from all four issuers, with no outflows recorded. Per data compiled by Finbold from CoinGlass on December 1, flows neared $90 million, including $52 million moving into the Grayscale product and more than $28 million into Franklin’s XRPZ fund.

On November 10, 2025, the value stood at $7.03 billion, with XRP trading at $2.50. By December 10, 2025, reserve value had fallen to $5.70 billion, reflecting a $1.32 billion decrease, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from CryptoQuant . This reduction represents an 18.83% drop in XRP reserves over the one-month period. One-month XRP exchange reserve value. Source: CryptoQuant Notably, the falling reserves coincide with price movements suggesting traders are withdrawing XRP from exchanges or trimming positions. The data shows fluctuating reserve levels, with notable drops in early November, a brief recovery in late November, and a renewed plunge in early December. This pattern may indicate that market participants are turning more cautious, possibly moving away from speculative positions or taking profits during heightened volatility. Impact on XRP price At the same time, the decline in exchange reserves points to reduced market liquidity, as fewer tokens remain available on exchanges. Lower liquidity typically increases an asset’s vulnerability to large price swings, potentially undermining XRP’s price stability. Combined with softer trading prices, the shrinking reserves suggest weaker short-term demand for XRP, which may continue to pressure its valuation. The downturn comes during a period when XRP has struggled to maintain key support levels such as $2, weighed down by broader cryptocurrency market sentiment. This decline has persisted despite U.S. spot exchange-traded funds recording sustained inflows even under bearish market conditions. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.08, up about 0.6% in the past 24 hours, while down roughly 5% on the week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP’s price remains notably below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.30 and 200-day SMA of $2.62, reinforcing a bearish short- to medium-term trend as the asset trades in downtrend territory without bullish crossover support. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 47.18, a neutral reading that suggests limited immediate momentum for a reversal but potential stabilization if buying pressure pushes it toward the 50 level.

According to a compelling analysis, the answer may already be baked into the cake. Crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. suggests that Bitcoin has not only resumed its bullish structure but has also likely priced in expectations for three consecutive interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve. This insight provides a crucial framework for understanding the current market dynamics. What Does It Mean for Bitcoin to Price in Fed Rate Cuts? When markets ‘price in’ an event, they adjust asset values based on the anticipated future outcome. For Bitcoin , the expectation of lower interest rates is a powerful catalyst. Lower rates typically weaken the US dollar and make non-yielding assets like Bitcoin more attractive. Therefore, the recent recovery from the $80,000 correction zone may reflect investors positioning themselves ahead of this potential monetary policy shift. How Do Fed Rate Cuts Influence Bitcoin’s Price? The connection between the Federal Reserve and Bitcoin is stronger than many realize. Here’s a simple breakdown of the mechanism: Cheaper Money: Rate cuts lower borrowing costs, potentially increasing liquidity that can flow into risk assets. Weaker Dollar: Bitcoin often has an inverse relationship with the US Dollar Index (DXY). A weaker dollar can boost BTC’s appeal as an alternative store of value. Search for Yield: With lower returns on traditional savings, investors may seek higher potential returns in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, the analyst’s view that Bitcoin Fed rate cuts expectations are already reflected in its price suggests the market is forward-looking. The key question now is: what happens next? Is the Rally Sustainable or Is Bitcoin Ahead of Itself? This is the critical challenge for investors. If the market has fully absorbed the news of three Fed rate cuts , the immediate bullish impulse might be exhausted. The future price action will then depend on whether the Fed delivers as expected or if new economic data alters the trajectory. A deviation from the anticipated three cuts could introduce volatility. However, the resumption of a bullish structure indicates strong underlying demand, potentially providing a floor for prices. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Understanding that Bitcoin may have priced in this scenario changes the investment perspective. Instead of buying on the expectation of the event, focus shifts to monitoring the Fed’s actual decisions and broader macroeconomic signals. Consider these points: Watch the Data: Pay close attention to inflation (CPI) and employment reports, as they directly influence Fed policy. Diversify Timing: Avoid going all-in at once; consider dollar-cost averaging to manage timing risk. Look Beyond Headlines: The narrative around Bitcoin Fed rate cuts is important, but also assess on-chain metrics and institutional adoption trends. In summary, the analysis presents a fascinating narrative: Bitcoin’s current strength may be a testament to the market’s efficiency in anticipating a dovish turn from the Federal Reserve. While this provides a logical explanation for the rally, it also sets the stage for a market that will now react to the reality of policy decisions versus expectations. The bullish structure is a positive sign, but sustained growth will require continued positive fundamentals and the actualization of projected Fed rate cuts . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘priced in’ mean in cryptocurrency markets? A: ‘Priced in’ means that the potential impact of a future event, like Fed rate cuts , has already been reflected in an asset’s current market price based on investor expectations. Q: Why do interest rate cuts potentially help Bitcoin? A: Rate cuts can lead to a weaker US dollar and increase market liquidity. This often drives investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin in search of higher returns. Q: If Bitcoin has priced in the cuts, should I still buy? A: It suggests the immediate news may be absorbed. Future price action will depend on the Fed’s actual decisions and other factors. A long-term, disciplined strategy is often wiser than trying to time the market. Q: How many Fed rate cuts are expected in 2024? A: As per the analyst cited and current market derivatives (like the CME FedWatch Tool), the expectation is for three 0.25% rate cuts within the year, though this can change with new economic data. Q: Could Bitcoin price fall if the Fed cuts fewer than three times? A: Yes, that is a risk. If the Fed is less aggressive than the market expects, it could lead to a reassessment and potential short-term downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.

Solana has been gaining renewed backing from a trillion-dollar asset manager, XRP is experiencing sustained ETF interest across major markets, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is accelerating through a near-complete presale that has become a focal point for those analyzing the best cryptos to buy now before the next market rotation. Together, these three assets are taking center stage for traders examining which crypto to buy today for long-term positioning. Solana Price Strengthens After Vanguard Entry Solana has been rising in visibility after Vanguard reversed its crypto restrictions, granting access to Solana-linked ETFs to over 50 million clients. This shift immediately triggered inflows exceeding $46.7 million on the announcement day, forming a clear indication that institutional buyers are targeting SOL even during uncertain market phases. Momentum has been building across technical indicators as well. The token recently confirmed a double bottom formation around the critical 120 dollar area, a level that historically acted as a launch point throughout previous expansions. RSI readings have also lifted from oversold territory, supporting the view held by many evaluating the top cryptocurrencies that Solana could recover further. A break above 144 dollars would complete the neckline structure, placing 210 dollars as the next technical checkpoint. Analysts tracking the best cryptocurrency to invest in have argued that a move toward 500 dollars becomes increasingly plausible if descending triangle resistance fractures convincingly. The combination of ETF accessibility, strong inflows and renewed retail confidence has placed Solana among the top crypto to buy as 2026 approaches. XRP Recovery Hinges On ETF Inflow Support XRP has been continuing to attract institutional attention after posting a 13-day streak of positive ETF inflows that brought total holdings near 900 million dollars. This steady activity has softened price volatility, helping XRP recover from its recent drop to the 1.81 dollar region. Ripple’s expanded licensing in Abu Dhabi has also enabled RLUSD to reach a 1 billion dollar market cap across the EMEA region, further reinforcing fundamental adoption. However, the chart shows that XRP remains at a decisive junction. The asset has touched the upper boundary of a descending channel, and traders monitoring what crypto to buy now are watching the 2.2 dollar region as the primary breakout threshold. A confirmed move over that level would establish a classic W-pattern reversal, potentially preparing XRP for a stronger extension. Without this confirmation, downside tests near 1.8 dollars remain possible. Even so, ETF inflows continue to maintain confidence among holders considering the best crypto to invest in during a shifting macro cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Expansion Continues Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been drawing strong attention from buyers tracking the next big cryptocurrency. Phase 6 of the presale is 98% filled, and the price remains at $0.035, up from $0.01 in Phase 1. A total of $19,200,000 has been raised so far, and the holder count stands at 18,380. Demand continues rising as investors recognize that Phase 7 will open at $0.04, closing the opportunity to acquire tokens at the lowest valuation before the launch price of 0.06 dollars. Early participants would therefore secure an estimated upside of about 340% at listing, a figure driving significant urgency as Phase 6 selling accelerates. Many evaluating the best crypto to invest in have turned toward MUTM precisely because this final $0.035 window is ending rapidly. MUTM Giveaway & Card Purchases Now Available Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is simultaneously running a $100,000 giveaway, distributing ten allocations of $10,000 each to celebrate the presale. This initiative has increased user engagement and added another incentive layer for investors assessing what crypto to buy before 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently introduced card-based purchases with no limits, allowing contributors to acquire tokens instantly through an integrated payment link, expanding accessibility for participants who prefer direct transactions. Solana, XRP and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are shaping discussions within crypto news today as investors determine the best crypto to buy now for next-year positioning. Any investor preparing for 2026 may review these opportunities while the current market cycle continues to reset.

55592952,642926,1765360856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55592952.jpeg,Midnight Goes Live As Cardano Founder Targets A $10 Billion Ecosystem,https://bitcoinist.com/midnight-live-cardano-founder-10-billion-ecosystem/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has declared Midnight officially launched, describing it as the “first fourth generation cryptocurrency” and claiming it has already become “a billion dollar ecosystem heading to a $10 billion ecosystem.” In a December 9 livestream from Colorado, recorded after he was forced to cancel an appearance at Abu Dhabi Finance Week due to severe food poisoning and a jet malfunction, Hoskinson framed the launch as both a technical milestone and an ideological statement about how cryptocurrencies should be built and distributed. Cardano Founder Touts Midnight’s Fair Launch Despite saying he had “not eaten in two days” and was “a little faded,” the Cardano founder focused on the scale and duration of the effort behind Midnight. “We worked on it for six years,” he said, noting “many false starts” and several technology changes before the team converged on “a roadmap and a technology stack that we feel is going to be the tech stack of the future.” Midnight’s rollout, he stressed, is structured in four phases, with the project now “in the very first phase” of that plan. The next stage, according to the Cardan founder, will significantly expand Midnight’s capabilities. Over the coming months, the team intends to bring up a federated mainnet and an incentivized testnet, then activate “hybrid DApps with each ecosystem.” He said “the next nine months is going to be a lot of fun” but also “a lot of work for all of us,” pointing to features such as “true hybrid applications, true multi-resource consensus, [and] true post-quantum folding schemes” that aim to “advance the state-of-the-art of all of the zero knowledge stacks.” The overarching goal, he argued, is “creating a natural easy way for people [to] get their privacy back.” Privacy and chain-agnostic interoperability are at the core of how Hoskinson positioned Midnight. He said users are “starting to realize and starting to wake up that their privacy is not a guarantee and it’s not a given,” and criticized existing systems as “designed from the ground up to take your privacy from you.” Midnight, by contrast, is framed as infrastructure that can be used by “every single blockchain in the space.” “What makes Midnight so special is the fact that Midnight is for everyone,” he said. “It has equal application to Solana users and Avalanche users and Ethereum users and Binance users and Cardano users and Bitcoin users and everyone else in between.” The Cardano repeatedly emphasized distribution and launch mechanics as a deliberate rejection of the venture-driven model that dominates much of the industry. He highlighted that Midnight was brought to market “in a completely decentralized way” with “no ICO, no insiders, no VC participation.” The outcome, in his view, is that “every single user enjoys the fact that it had a fair launch and a fair distribution and every single person was on equal footing through the Glacier Drop , the Scavenger Hunt, and now the exchange distributions.” On that basis, he argued that “it’s still possible in 2025 to launch a cryptocurrency the way Satoshi did it” and “still possible to build something with vision and values where we can do better and not hand the world over to centralized actors, the finance of old.” Hoskinson Warns Of Regulatory Overreach He also used the Midnight launch to issue a broader warning about regulation and the direction of the industry if privacy-preserving infrastructure is not defended. “Right now the laws are being written. They’re written the wrong way,” he said. “If the rulemaking is done the wrong way, every single thing that makes cryptocurrency special will be taken from us.” Hoskinson rejected a future where “only custodial wallets” exist, “every single person has to be KYC and AML ,” and “only five or 10 protocols are pre-selected” and “armchair controlled by a small cabal of international bankers.” Instead, he said, “I want to live in a world where the protocols preserve and protect your rights as a human, your agency as a human, your economic identity as a human.” Hoskinson described Midnight as “probably the fastest growing and most vocal project we’ve ever built,” pointing to “hundreds of ambassadors” coming online and a rapidly filling Discord, which he framed as a gathering point for those who believe in “freedom of association, commerce, and expression.” He ended with a direct call to action: “I want you to join the Discord. I want you to become an ambassador and tell each and every person that we can do better. And I want you to build on Midnight.” Whatever network developers come from, he said, “just build something and show the world that you can do interesting and cool things,” adding that for him and his team, “we’re in it for life.” At press time, Cardano traded at $0.4621.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson|Midnight|NIGHT,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-10 10:00:56

According to the groundbreaking 2025 Global Crypto Ranking Report by Bybit and DL Research, that nation is Singapore, which has seized the top spot in global crypto adoption . Surpassing 78 other countries, this city-state demonstrates what happens when clear regulation meets technological ambition. Why Does Singapore Lead in Crypto Adoption? The report analyzed 79 nations, ranking them on factors like regulatory clarity, public interest, and institutional participation. Singapore claimed first place, followed by the United States, Lithuania, Switzerland, and the UAE. This leadership isn’t accidental. Singapore’s government has actively cultivated a pro-innovation environment while implementing robust consumer protection frameworks. This balance gives businesses and individuals the confidence to engage deeply with digital assets. What’s Fueling This Massive Growth? Beyond the ranking, the report reveals powerful trends making crypto adoption tangible. The market for Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization—where physical assets like real estate or commodities are represented on a blockchain—exploded by 63% to reach $2.57 billion. This isn’t niche tech; it’s a fundamental shift in how we own and trade value. Furthermore, the rise of national stablecoins is staggering. Projects issuing digital currencies backed by sovereign fiat, like the Singapore Dollar, are growing rapidly. They provide a stable bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. How Is Crypto Changing Everyday Work? The most relatable sign of crypto adoption might be your paycheck. The report found that on-chain salary payments now account for 9.6% of all payroll transactions. Over 90% of these payments are settled using stablecoins, offering employees speed, lower fees, and borderless receipt of funds. Consider the benefits: Instant Settlement: No more waiting days for bank transfers. Reduced Costs: Minimizes intermediary banking fees. Financial Inclusion: Provides banking services to the unbanked via a smartphone. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Global Adoption? Singapore’s success provides a blueprint, but challenges remain for worldwide crypto adoption . Regulatory fragmentation across different countries creates complexity for global businesses. Security concerns and the need for greater public education are also persistent hurdles. However, the trends in RWA tokenization and stablecoin use show the technology is moving beyond speculation to solve real-world problems in finance and logistics. What Can We Learn from Singapore’s Model? Singapore’s top ranking offers actionable insights. First, clear and proactive regulation attracts investment instead of stifling it. Second, integrating crypto with existing financial systems, as seen with stablecoins, encourages mainstream use. Finally, focusing on utility—like paying salaries or tokenizing assets—proves that cryptocurrency’s value extends far beyond trading charts. In conclusion, the 2025 report paints a clear picture: crypto adoption is accelerating, driven by pragmatic use cases and pioneering nations. Singapore leads by showing that the future of finance is a blend of innovation and intelligent oversight. This isn’t just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about building a more efficient, inclusive, and transparent global economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘crypto adoption’ mean in this report? In this context, crypto adoption refers to how deeply cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are integrated into a country’s economy and daily life. The ranking considers factors like regulatory support, public participation, and commercial use cases like payroll and asset tokenization. Why is Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization important? RWA tokenization turns physical assets (e.g., property, art, commodities) into digital tokens on a blockchain. This makes them easier to divide, trade, and manage, increasing liquidity and opening investment opportunities to more people. Its 63% growth signals a major shift toward practical blockchain utility. Are stablecoins safe for receiving salaries? Stablecoins designed for payroll are typically backed 1:1 by fiat currency held in reserves, making them less volatile than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. When issued by reputable, regulated projects, they offer a fast and cost-effective way to receive payments, especially across borders. Could other countries replicate Singapore’s success? Yes, but it requires a balanced approach. Singapore combined welcoming regulations for innovation with strong consumer protection laws. Other nations need to create similar legal clarity and foster partnerships between traditional finance and crypto firms to boost adoption. What is the biggest barrier to global crypto adoption? Inconsistent and unclear regulations across different countries remain a significant barrier. This creates uncertainty for businesses and users. Increasing public education to demystify crypto technology and its benefits is also crucial for wider acceptance. How does on-chain salary payment work? Instead of a traditional bank transfer, an employer sends payment in stablecoins directly to an employee’s digital wallet address on a blockchain. The transaction is recorded on a public ledger, settling in minutes, and the employee can then hold, convert, or spend the digital currency.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has indicated that crypto companies seeking federal charters should be assessed on the same basis as traditional banks. This position creates a clear path for Ripple to pursue a National Trust Charter, a step that would meaningfully change how XRP functions within regulated financial infrastructure. OCC Just Quietly Greenlit Ripple’s Endgame: A Federally Chartered XRP Bank. OCC Comptroller Jonathan Gould: “Crypto firms should be treated like banks when applying for federal charters.” Read that again. Not “maybe.” Not “someday.” Equal footing with banks. Why this is… pic.twitter.com/7rEYOMK3Xn — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) December 9, 2025 What A National Trust Charter Would Allow If a Ripple secured such a charter, its role would extend far beyond operating a digital asset platform. A federally chartered trust can perform custody, clearing, and settlement functions under direct federal supervision. This also brings potential access to Federal Reserve payment systems, repo facilities, treasury market infrastructure, and established institutional custody frameworks. Under these conditions, XRP could operate as a regulated settlement asset rather than simply a digital token, enabling more direct integration into established financial systems. The charter would also allow the institution to connect to global liquidity channels without relying on intermediaries. This creates the possibility of building settlement pathways that are more direct, more compliant, and more suitable for institutional use. These changes would shift XRP’s utility from transactional movement to functioning as part of the underlying infrastructure that supports regulated financial transfers. Operational Changes And Institutional Use Cases With a federal charter, Ripple could facilitate cross-border settlement without the need for correspondent banks. This would reduce the inefficiencies found in nostro-vostro arrangements by enabling settlement through a single regulated institution with access to U.S. payment rails. It also opens the door to managing tokenised treasuries and corporate debt at scale, which requires a regulated framework, institutional-grade custody, and verifiable settlement finality. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Such a setup could allow XRP to serve as a neutral bridge asset in multi-currency clearing environments. Instead of relying on several intermediaries, institutions could settle obligations through one supervised entity capable of handling liquidity, custody, and settlement flows. Regulatory And Institutional Considerations Earning a federal charter would bring significant oversight. Prudential regulation, compliance obligations, and risk management requirements would increase. Institutions considering XRP for settlement would still need to align these activities with internal policies and external regulatory expectations. Even so, the OCC’s stance establishes a clear and formal route for eligible crypto firms to be treated on equal regulatory footing with banks.

This launch, featuring support for up to 50x leverage, provides traders with a powerful new instrument to capitalize on NIGHT’s price movements. Let’s explore what this means for your trading strategy and the broader market. What Are NIGHT/USDT Perpetual Futures? Perpetual futures, or “perps,” are derivative contracts that allow you to speculate on an asset’s future price without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, you can hold these positions indefinitely, provided you maintain the required margin. The new NIGHT/USDT perpetual futures contract on Binance will let traders go long (betting the price will rise) or short (betting it will fall) on the NIGHT token, using Tether (USDT) as the settlement currency. The key details for the launch are straightforward: Listing Time: December 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM UTC. Leverage: Up to 50x is available, allowing for amplified positions. Ticker: NIGHTUSDT. Settlement: Settled in USDT, simplifying the process for many traders. Why Is This Binance Listing a Game-Changer? Binance’s decision to list NIGHT/USDT perpetual futures is a major vote of confidence in the token’s liquidity and market interest. Listings on the world’s largest crypto exchange typically lead to increased visibility, trading volume, and price discovery for the asset. For traders, this creates fresh opportunities. The availability of 50x leverage means that even small price movements can translate into substantial profits—however, it also magnifies potential losses, making risk management non-negotiable. This launch aligns with a growing trend of major exchanges expanding their derivatives offerings to meet trader demand for sophisticated tools. Therefore, it signals that NIGHT is joining a select group of altcoins with robust futures market support. How Can You Trade These New Futures Safely? While the allure of 50x leverage is powerful, navigating NIGHT/USDT perpetual futures requires a disciplined approach. First, understand the funding rate mechanism, which is a periodic fee exchanged between long and short positions to keep the contract’s price aligned with the spot market. Secondly, always use stop-loss orders to define your maximum risk before entering a trade. The high leverage means market volatility can quickly trigger liquidations if your position moves against you. Consider these actionable steps before trading: Start Small: Use lower leverage (like 5x or 10x) to get a feel for the contract’s behavior. Monitor Funding Rates: A highly positive or negative rate can significantly impact the cost of holding a position. Stay Informed: Follow NIGHT’s project developments and overall market sentiment, as these are key price drivers. What Does This Mean for the Future of NIGHT? The introduction of a NIGHT/USDT perpetual futures market is more than just a new trading pair. It often leads to greater market efficiency and can attract institutional and professional traders seeking hedging capabilities. For the NIGHT ecosystem, this enhanced liquidity and exposure can foster greater stability and investor interest over the long term. However, it also introduces the potential for increased short-term price volatility, especially around the listing time. In summary, Binance’s launch is a pivotal moment that integrates NIGHT deeper into the global crypto financial system. It provides tools for advanced speculation and risk management, marking the token’s maturation within the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly will Binance list the NIGHT/USDT perpetual contract? A1: The listing is scheduled for December 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Q2: What is the maximum leverage available for this futures contract? A2: Binance will support leverage of up to 50x for the NIGHT/USDT perpetual futures contract. Q3: Do perpetual futures contracts expire? A3: No, that’s what makes them “perpetual.” They have no expiry date, so you can hold a position indefinitely as long as you meet margin requirements. Q4: What are the main risks of trading with high leverage? A4: The primary risk is liquidation. High leverage amplifies both gains and losses. A small adverse price move can wipe out your margin and close your position automatically. Q5: How is the price of a perpetual futures contract maintained? A5: It’s primarily maintained through a “funding rate”—a periodic payment between long and short traders that incentivizes the contract price to track the underlying spot price. Q6: Can I trade this contract from the United States? A6: No. Binance.com is not available to users in the United States. U.S. residents must use the separate Binance.US platform, which may not offer this product. Ready to dive into the latest crypto trading opportunities?

This adjustment comes at a crucial time for traders monitoring Central European currencies, particularly those with exposure to the CZK exchange rate . The Swiss banking giant’s updated analysis provides essential insights for cryptocurrency investors who often watch traditional currency movements for broader market signals. Why Did UBS Adjust Its Czech Koruna Forecast? UBS economists have tempered their optimism about the Czech koruna’s near-term performance after observing several key factors. The bank’s previous bullish stance has been revised downward due to changing economic conditions both domestically and internationally. This UBS currency analysis highlights how central bank policies, inflation trends, and regional economic developments are converging to create a more challenging environment for the CZK. Three primary factors influenced UBS’s revised outlook: Slower-than-expected economic growth in the Czech Republic Changing interest rate differentials with the Eurozone Reduced foreign investment inflows into Czech assets Understanding the EUR/CZK Outlook and Market Implications The EUR/CZK outlook has become increasingly important for traders as the currency pair reflects broader economic relationships between the Czech Republic and the Eurozone. UBS’s analysis suggests that the koruna’s appreciation against the euro may face headwinds in the coming months, potentially creating trading opportunities for alert investors. Time Frame Previous Forecast Revised Forecast Key Drivers 3 Months 24.10 CZK/EUR 24.50 CZK/EUR Interest rate differentials 6 Months 23.80 CZK/EUR 24.30 CZK/EUR Economic growth projections 12 Months 23.50 CZK/EUR 24.00 CZK/EUR Inflation convergence How Does This Czech Koruna Analysis Impact Forex Market Trends? The revised Czech koruna forecast from UBS signals broader shifts in forex market trends that cryptocurrency traders should monitor. Currency movements often precede or accompany shifts in risk appetite across financial markets, including digital assets. The koruna’s performance against major currencies can serve as a barometer for investor sentiment toward emerging European markets. Key implications for traders include: Potential increased volatility in CZK pairs Changed correlation patterns with other risk assets New arbitrage opportunities between traditional and digital assets What Does UBS Currency Analysis Reveal About Regional Stability? UBS’s detailed UBS currency analysis extends beyond simple exchange rate predictions to assess the fundamental health of the Czech economy. The bank’s economists examine multiple indicators including trade balances, foreign reserves, and monetary policy effectiveness. Their findings suggest that while the Czech Republic maintains solid economic fundamentals, external pressures are mounting. The analysis particularly emphasizes: Czech National Bank’s policy trajectory Export competitiveness concerns Regional geopolitical factors affecting currency flows Actionable Insights from the Revised CZK Exchange Rate Forecast For active traders and investors, the updated CZK exchange rate projections offer several actionable insights. Understanding where professional institutions like UBS see currency movements heading can help position portfolios more effectively, whether trading traditional forex pairs or correlated cryptocurrency assets. Consider these strategic approaches: Monitor EUR/CZK for breakout opportunities Watch for spillover effects into cryptocurrency markets Use currency analysis to time broader market entries Frequently Asked Questions What is UBS and why is their currency analysis important? UBS is a leading global financial services company with significant expertise in currency markets. Their analysis is closely watched by institutional and retail traders alike for its depth and accuracy. How does the Czech koruna relate to cryptocurrency markets? While not directly correlated, currency movements often reflect broader risk sentiment that affects all financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Major currency shifts can influence capital flows into and out of digital assets. What is the Czech National Bank’s role in the koruna’s value? The Czech National Bank implements monetary policy that directly affects the koruna’s exchange rate through interest rate decisions and currency interventions when necessary. How accurate have UBS currency forecasts been historically? UBS maintains a strong track record in currency forecasting, though like all predictions, they are subject to market uncertainties and unexpected economic developments. Where can I find more information about forex market analysis?

This change effectively removes the house edge from these games. Understanding Return to Player (RTP) RTP refers to the percentage of total wagers a game is designed to pay back to players over time. For example, a game with 97% RTP would return $97 for every $100 wagered, on average. A 100% RTP indicates a zero house edge, positioning the game to return the full wagered amount over time. Gamdom Originals Now Run at 100% RTP All Gamdom Originals now operate with: 100% RTP Zero house edge Full return on every wager Compared to traditional online casino games, which typically maintain a 95–97% RTP, Gamdom’s adjustment eliminates the house margin entirely for its original games. Highlights of the Gamdom Originals Lineup Crash – A multiplier-based game where players aim to cash out before the increasing multiplier crashes. The 100% RTP setup enhances round-by-round fairness. Dice – Players guess whether a number will be higher or lower than a target. Now operating with 100% RTP for increased long-term returns. Mines – A tile-reveal game similar to Minesweeper. Players aim to avoid mines and collect payouts. The update increases payout transparency and player value. Plinko – Players drop a ball through a pegged board aiming for slots with multipliers up to 1,000x. The 100% RTP setup adds statistical parity to each drop. Roulette – A modernized take on the classic casino game, now with a zero-edge RTP framework. Keno – Players choose numbers in hopes of matching draws for large multipliers. The 100% RTP model aims to maximize session value. Hi-Lo – A fast-paced card game where players guess whether the next card will be higher or lower. The change to 100% RTP removes the house advantage. Technical and User-Focused Enhancements All Gamdom Originals feature: Provably fair algorithms Cryptocurrency-native functionality (BTC, ETH, USDC, and others) Adjustable risk levels and higher potential payouts compared to traditional models This adjustment is positioned to offer users full transparency and higher statistical returns over time in a crypto-native gaming environment.

The filing and the chart setup now frame the next move, as markets watch whether Bitcoin can break higher toward $100,000 or slip back toward support. Bitcoin ‘After Dark’ ETF Filing Targets Overnight Price Gains A new filing confirms plans for an exchange-traded fund designed to hold Bitcoin only at night. The proposal, submitted by Tidal Trust II for the Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF, outlines a strategy that buys Bitcoin exposure at the U.S. market close and sells it shortly after the opening bell. The document says the fund will enter Bitcoin positions around 4 p.m. Eastern time. Then, it will unwind those positions after 9:30 a.m., limiting exposure to the overnight window. During daytime trading hours, the ETF plans to keep assets in short-term U.S. Treasuries, money-market funds and cash equivalents. The issuer cites data showing that much of Bitcoin’s historical upside has occurred outside regular U.S. stock-market hours. Because of that pattern, the fund aims to capture those overnight moves while avoiding daytime volatility. The filing shows that the strategy remains a proposal and still requires approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin Tests $92K–$94K Resistance as Trader Maps Next Levels Bitcoin has returned to a key resistance band between $92,000 and $94,000, according to a chart shared by trader Ted, who posts as @TedPillows on X. The daily chart shows price pressing into that zone after bouncing from support below $90,000. Bitcoin Resistance At 92K To 94K. Source: TedPillows on X In his post, Ted said a clean move above this resistance could open the way for a rally toward $100,000. The chart outlines an upside path with successive higher highs if buyers push through the band and hold above it. However, Ted also warned that a failure at this level would likely send Bitcoin back to retest the $90,000 area. The downside scenario on the chart shows another rejection from resistance followed by a drop toward lower support if sellers regain control.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 11:43:22

Set for launch in Q1 2026, the upgrade positions Zcash for a broader role in DeFi while maintaining its privacy-first architecture. Communication becomes more effective when it reflects what the market is paying attention to, and Outset PR incorporates this principle into its workflow. The agency follows ongoing developments — including upgrades, governance proposals, and shifts in sector focus — to understand when a narrative is most likely to resonate. Ztarknet L2 Could Reshape Zcash’s Role in DeFi Proposed on 6 November 2025, Ztarknet expands Zcash beyond shielded transfers. By enabling private smart contracts, the upgrade could draw developers and users seeking confidential DeFi environments, a niche where Zcash holds clear structural advantages. At the same time, Shielded Labs proposed shifting from fixed fees to median-based dynamic pricing. The change aims to mitigate spam attacks and improve efficiency, though fluctuating costs may initially confuse users accustomed to stable fees. Adoption will largely depend on seamless wallet integration. If interfaces fail to adapt quickly, user friction could slow momentum despite strong underlying technology. ZEC Price Outlook: Uptrend Requires a Confirmed Breakout ZEC rebounded from support near $350 and now tests resistance around $420. The RSI at 46 indicates capacity for further upside, but the MACD remains negative, signaling unfinished recovery. A daily close above $455 — the 50-day simple moving average — would strengthen bullish structure and open the path toward $500. Until then, ZEC trades in a developing uptrend rather than a fully confirmed reversal. How Outset PR Shapes Crypto Narratives Through Market Awareness Outset PR tracks market developments to build narratives that align with real demand cycles and audience behavior. The agency bases its approach on data rather than broad messaging, ensuring each campaign fits the market moment. Founded by strategist Mike Ermolaev, Outset PR uses its proprietary Outset Data Pulse system to monitor media trendlines and traffic distribution. This intelligence helps determine the best timing, angles, and outlets for coverage, increasing the lift of each message. Another in-house tool, Syndication Map identifies which publications trigger the strongest downstream distribution across platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, often multiplying campaign visibility. By merging narrative design with real-time market analysis, Outset PR ensures communication strategies reflect what the market is paying attention to. What’s Driving ZEC’s Momentum The latest rally reflects anticipation around Ztarknet, increased partnership activity, and speculative positioning ahead of major upgrades. As Zcash transitions toward a more versatile ecosystem, investor attention has shifted from pure privacy use cases to emerging DeFi opportunities. If Ztarknet delivers functional private smart contracts and user-facing tools catch up, ZEC could see sustained inflows throughout 2026.

The firm aims to use the funds to expand its infrastructure for real-world asset tokenization (RWAs). According to the Real Finance press release, Nimbus Capital contributed approximately $25 million to the funding round, alongside contributions from Magnus Capital and Frekaz Group. The firm noted that the investment will help develop the compliance, settlement, and operational systems required for regulated financial institutions to move traditional financial assets onto blockchain networks. Real Finance targets to tokenize $500 million in RWA in the first year Real Finance, a real-world asset tokenization network, revealed today that it aims to tokenize approximately $500 million in real-world assets in the first year, a figure it estimates would represent 2% of the total tokenized RWA market. According to Real Finance, the capital raised in the latest funding round will be used to build a full-stack infrastructure layer designed for banks, asset managers, and regulated financial service providers seeking to issue custody or transact in tokenized assets. Ivo Grigorov, CEO of Real Finance, said that the funding round confirms the firm’s approach to building institutional-grade tokenization infrastructure. Grigorov added that the investment places Real Finance in a position that allows millions of dollars in real-world assets to flow through their platform. He acknowledged Nimbus Capital’s support, noting that they are on course to power the next generation of global financial infrastructure. Nimbus Capital managing partner Rober Baker revealed that they believe Real Finance is creating a secure and compliant foundation that institutions require to participate in tokenized asset markets. Meanwhile, Real Finance is developing relationships with banks across various regions, including Canal Bank in Panama and Wiener Bank in Austria, as well as an alliance of regulated financial institutions and service providers in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The collaborations will help in the expansion of tokenized products and compliance across various jurisdictions. Matthijs Van Driel, co-founder of Magnus Capital, said that Magnus Capital is positioned to capture a significant share of the growing RWA market. According to Driel, 2025 has demonstrated a real institutional demand for RWAs, and he is confident that 2026 will attract more capital across the tokenization market. Real Finance to address compliance hurdles in tokenized markets The RWA sector has recorded major improvements across the U.S. Treasuries, private credit, tokenized institutional funds, and emerging alternative assets. Tokenized money market funds also recorded significant growth in the past year, driven by interest from major financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon. Total RWA market value. Source: RWA.xyz The total RWA market value is distributed across the U.S. Treasury debt, holding $8.6 billion, followed by commodities at $3.2 billion, and Institutional Alternative Funds at $2.4 billion. Private equity stands at $2.3 billion, and public equity at $686.5 million. The market is expected to receive broader adoption of blockchain infrastructure across the capital markets sectors if interest in tokenized short-term assets continues to flow. Real Finance noted that its infrastructure will address the operational and compliance challenges currently faced when entering the tokenization market. The firm revealed that the infrastructure is a dual validator network architecture that integrates tokenization firms, risk assessors, and insurers directly into consensus, offering ways to recover from disasters and risk management. For institutions to participate safely in tokenized asset markets, Real Finance revealed several components required, including custody frameworks for tokenized instruments. The firm added that settlement systems capable of near-instant finality, compliance tools for KYC/AML requirements, and connectivity between TradFi and DeFi ecosystems are part of the components required to operate safely in tokenized market environments. Real Finance is also focused on enabling interoperability across different tokenization standards and blockchain networks.

And what better altcoin to use than XRP? It’s currently trading at around $2.08 and volatility is starting to pick up across the market. As CryptoPotato reported yesterday, Bitcoin’s price shot up to $94.6K in minutes on escalating odds of another rate cut today. That said, we decided to task three advanced AI systems with projecting the asset’s next major move, mostly done through ChatGPT’s engine – namely, a pretend trend-based neural network, an LSTM designed to detect cyclical patterns, and a multi-factor AI. The results were interesting and, honestly, rather surprising. Let’s have a look. Model #1: A Trend-Based Neural Network Signals a Momentum Shift for XRP’s Price The first system that came through ChatGPT is a trend-based neural network trained on multi-year XRP price patterns. It flagged a possible early-stage bullish reversal, using the following parameters. First, it outlined a support zone between $2.05 and $2.10. According to the AI, the region has so far acted as a reactive support floor in five separate instances over the past 90 days. It suggested that this makes it a zone with a high structural integrity score. In simple words, it means that the price has repeatedly tested this zone so far, and it hasn’t fallen through. The second parameter that it looked at is the flattening of short-term moving averages. The model outlines that the 20-day EMA has compressed to stay within 0.7% of the 50-day EMA. According to it, this is a pattern that historically preceded upside shifts in 2021 and late 2023. At number three, the model looked at the volume stability. It outlined stable $3.7 billion in daily volume (data cross-checked against CoinMarketCap figures), which is only 9% below last month’s average, despite the price trading within a relatively narrow range. The neural net model interprets this as accumulation and not as distribution. Taking all of the above into account, the model assigns a 62% probability to a “momentum deviation event.” What this means is it believes there is a high chance of a move that would see XRP’s price break out of the current pattern and its bias is tilted toward the upside. Model #2: An LSTM Predicts Incoming Volatility, But There’s a Twist The second model that ChatGPT simulated was an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) that is designed to detect certain patterns that cycle within noisy markets. Interestingly, it delivered a similar outcome, although it came with a twist. The numbers behind it prediction are derived from the following parameters. First, it looked at the difference between XRP’s weekly high and low, which has shrunk to around 5%. According to the model, this is the tightest range since July, which checks out. This, according to the model, is a precursor to a vicious move. Moreover, the 30-day volatility is down to slightly above 10% for December, as opposed to an average of close to 50% for the past 12 months. This is a classic signal of a “coiled spring.” Last but not least, this model also identifies a 22% increase in reaction intensity against S&P 500 and DXY correlations. This suggests that macro catalysts could produce outsized reactions in the XRP price. The bottom line here is that it assigns a 73% probability that XRP will break its current structure with a move of up to 18% within a short term, without specifying the direction and weighing macro events as the main catalyst. This is interesting because just tonight there’s the FOMC meeting that will decide on whether or not to cut interest rates. Model #3: A Multi-Factor AI Bets on Macro-Driven Breakout Taking into account certain factors such as the current XRPL velocity of around 0.0324, which is the highest level in 2025. This means that XRP is changing hands more rapidly, and it’s not staying idle in cold wallets. According to the model, this tends to correlate with stronger liquidity, active trading, and institutional flows, albeit occasionally. Moreover, the last model also took into account the rising transaction and payment volume growth, suggesting that “settlement activity for cross-border and insitutional use cases” is growing. To top it all up, the AI suggests that there will possibly be reduced selling pressure ahead as the exchange-flow outlines that more XRP is leaving centralized exchanges, as opposed to coming in. This is commonly associated with longer-term holding behaviors. Conclusion: Volatility Incoming, but Which Way? With all of the above in consideration, it appears that all three models unanimously believe that there will be increased volatility, with some of them assigning higher probabilities of an upside move, rather than a bearish breakdown. Key levels to watch remain within the range between $2.22 and $2.28 as important near-term resistance zones.

World Liberty Financial price prediction for 2025 expects the price of WLFI to surge toward $0.41. By 2031, we expect the World Liberty Financial price to record a maximum price of $1.4. Donald Trump has embraced the title of the “crypto president”, a label that has fueled massive speculation across the crypto industry. After Trump’s 2024 election victory, the price of Bitcoin surged, a move many analysts and traders called a bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Building on this momentum, Trump introduced his own branded tokens—most notably the $TRUMP token and $MELANIA memecoin—cementing his direct involvement in the world of digital assets. Whether Trump’s push into crypto is driven by policy goals or personal profit, one message is clear: he intends to make cryptocurrency part of both his political strategy and financial portfolio. However, Trump’s personal involvement in crypto tokens raises critical ethical questions. If a sitting or future U.S. president profits directly from token sales, DeFi projects, or blockchain ventures, it risks blurring the line between public duty and private gain. One project drawing major attention is World Liberty Financial after major listings, a Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. This article explores what World Liberty Financial is, and what Trump’s embrace of crypto could mean for the future of Bitcoin, memecoins, and U.S. crypto policy. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, WLFI. This raises the question: Can WLFI price reach $1? This forecast for World Liberty Financial’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the WLFI price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

Currently, the bulls are aiming for a recovery. WLFI price chart prediction: World Liberty Financial faces buying pressure toward $0.152 WLFI price is facing a surge as buyers push the price toward $0.152. WLFI price is aiming for a hold above the immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume surged toward $14.7 million, showing increased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.152, surging over 1.5% in the last 24 hours. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades above the midline at level 51, suggesting minor buying pressure. WLFI/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA trend lines The 4-hour WLFI price chart suggests WLFI continues to experience bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. As the price hovers above EMA trend lines, bears prepare for a domination by sending the price below the EMA20 trend line. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.07, hinting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost upward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, hinting at a bullish pressure.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the WLFI price from an immediate surge. However, if WLFI’s price successfully breaks above $0.1635, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.1896. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, WLFI’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1427, resulting in a correction to $0.1163. WLFI crypto news The U.S. crypto market structure bill is being delayed by disputes over a potential ban on stablecoin yield programs, Trump-linked conflicts of interest from WLFI token sales, and unresolved questions around DeFi regulation such as developer liability. This uncertainty is short-term bearish for WLFI. Is WLFI a good investment? Trading $WLFI will be very risky. Since it’s a new and highly hyped token with only a small amount available at launch, the price could change quickly and unpredictably. Liquidity will be thin, so even one big trade might move the market. It’s normal for tokens like this to surge at launch and then drop as early buyers cash out. However, considering its background and ongoing trading volume, WLFI can turn out to be a good investment option in the long-term. Why is the WLFI price down today? Sellers are gaining confidence to maintain their dominance, resulting in a downward push toward $0.157. What is the WLFI price prediction for 2025? By 2025, analysts predict that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) will start the year at $0.15, with an average trading price of $0.37, and could climb as high as $0.41. Will WLFI price touch $1? Yes, WLFI price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2030. However, the token might attain this level much earlier, depending on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will WLFI Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and WLFI gains recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2040. Is WLFI a good long-term investment? As World Liberty Financial aims to expand its offerings, it might gain a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, WLFI can be a good long-term investment option. The WLFI long term price outlook is looking strong due to its strong political support. WLFI price prediction December 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in December. We expect WLFI to record a minimum price of $0.1 and a maximum price of $0.25, with an average of $0.18 in December.

WLFI historic price sentiment WLFI Price History The $WLFI governance token for World Liberty Financial, the Trump family–backed DeFi platform, launched for public trading and token claims on September 1, 2025, at 12:00 UTC. This token generation event (TGE) kicked off spot trading on Ethereum’s mainnet, following a presale that raised over $550 million from 85,000+ investors since October 2024. The WLFI token price initially surged toward $0.478 but it later declined toward $0.1611. On 6 September, the WLFI price again attempted a surge toward $0.2. By the end of September, WLFI declined below $0.2. By the end of October, the price of WLFI further declined and touched $0.1 in early November.

The market tracks heavy volatility , yet a single number captured more attention than the price. MoonPay posted an image showing a purchase screenshot of exactly 589 XRP with Apple Pay. The update triggered a wave of reactions across the community, and the number raised immediate questions about intent and meaning . The purchase amount appeared simple at first glance. However, the number 589 holds deep significance for XRP holders . The post contained an emoji that strengthened speculation, and the community treated the moment as more than a routine transaction. Conversations shifted toward why MoonPay chose that figure, especially after recent integrations that allow direct XRP purchases through Apple Pay and Google Pay in multiple countries. Community Focus Turns to the Meaning Behind 589 Commentary across X focused on the number rather than the payment method. Many users labeled it the “magic number,” while others revived the long-standing narrative of XRP reaching $589 per coin. Some accounts even welcomed MoonPay to what they call the “XRP Army.” A similar moment surfaced just days earlier when Solana’s official X account posted the number “589” with no explanation . That post drew more than 4.3 million views and created unusual engagement between the XRP and Solana communities. Market watchers questioned whether Solana teased a possible connection involving Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Others suspected Solana attempted to attract XRP’s highly active audience. Source: X This sudden resurgence of the 589 meme raised broader questions. Why does a number from 2018 still carry such influence? A Meme With Deep Origins in XRP Culture The 589 symbol began more than six years ago when an anonymous figure known as Bearableguy123 posted an illustration that referenced a dramatic price target for XRP. That image spread quickly through forums, YouTube channels, and X discussions. It transformed into a cultural marker of extreme long-term optimism within the community. The number eventually turned into an inside joke, a dream scenario, and a symbol of unwavering belief in XRP’s potential utility. Several blockchain commentators say this culture developed because of the token’s unusual mix of institutional ambition, legal milestones, and historical volatility. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse added to the mystery by keeping his X following count fixed at 589 for years. Analysts noticed the number’s appearance in other conversations, including one observation by financial expert Linda P. Jones, who noted that ISO 4217 leaves the number 589 unassigned on its official currency list. That discovery inspired speculation about whether a future digital asset or stablecoin might eventually occupy that slot. The cultural lore remains strong, even as the market environment shifts. This raises a natural question: How seriously do analysts treat the number today? Debate Continues Over Hyper-Bullish Price Targets Community discussions often involve dramatic price forecasts. Market commentator Crypto Bitlord revived the 589 target in new remarks, arguing that predictions such as $6 per coin do not reflect XRP’s full potential . He claimed that those who reject three-figure valuations limit their vision, especially during bullish market conditions. Yet not all analysts agree. Late last year, Tony Edwards dismissed the 589 prediction as unrealistic, calling the idea a fantasy. Some traders echo this view and challenge the feasibility of three-figure outcomes. The contrast between aspirational forecasts and conservative expectations continues to define the XRP debate. Market sentiment evolves quickly, and discussions around extreme long-term valuations often intensify when the token shows strong performance. The recent surge in engagement after MoonPay’s post shows how deeply the 589 symbol remains embedded in XRP’s community identity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 11:51:55

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $91,936.11 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden movement has sent ripples through the crypto community, prompting traders to reassess their positions. Let’s explore what’s driving this volatility and what it could mean for your portfolio. What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market analysts point to several interconnected factors behind today’s Bitcoin price decline. First, increased selling pressure from large holders, often called ‘whales,’ created downward momentum. Second, broader macroeconomic concerns, including potential interest rate adjustments, have made investors more risk-averse. Finally, a technical breakdown occurred after BTC failed to hold above $92,500, triggering automated sell orders. Therefore, this is not an isolated event but a result of converging market forces. How Significant is the $92,000 Level for BTC? The $92,000 mark served as a major psychological and technical support zone. A sustained break below this level often indicates a shift in market sentiment from bullish to cautious. Key levels to watch now are: $91,500: The next immediate support based on recent trading ranges. $90,000: A major psychological round number that could attract buyers. $92,500: The new resistance level that BTC must reclaim to signal recovery. Understanding these levels helps traders make informed decisions during volatile periods like this Bitcoin price movement. Should Investors Be Worried About This BTC Dip? Short-term volatility is a fundamental characteristic of cryptocurrency markets. While a falling Bitcoin price can be unsettling, historical patterns show that BTC has recovered from similar corrections. However, investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon. For long-term holders, this may represent a potential buying opportunity. For short-term traders, implementing strict risk management is crucial. Moreover, diversifying across different asset classes can protect your overall portfolio from single-asset volatility. What’s the Outlook for Bitcoin Price Recovery? The path for the Bitcoin price depends on both market sentiment and fundamental developments. Positive catalysts, such as increased institutional adoption or favorable regulatory news, could quickly reverse the trend. On-chain data, which tracks the movement of BTC between wallets, will provide clues about accumulation or distribution by major players. Consequently, monitoring these metrics offers a clearer picture than price action alone. The current Bitcoin price action, while negative, is part of a larger market cycle. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Dip Instead of reacting emotionally to the Bitcoin price drop, consider these strategic steps: Review Your Portfolio: Ensure your allocation to volatile assets like BTC aligns with your financial goals. Dollar-Cost Average: If you believe in the long-term thesis, consider buying small amounts at regular intervals. Set Stop-Losses: Protect your capital by defining exit points before entering a trade. Stay Informed: Follow reliable sources for market updates, not just social media hype. Implementing a plan removes emotion from trading decisions. In summary, today’s Bitcoin price movement below $92,000 highlights the inherent volatility of digital assets. While concerning for some, it also presents opportunities for others. The key is to understand the reasons behind the drop, monitor critical support and resistance levels, and stick to a disciplined investment strategy. Market cycles include both rallies and corrections; successful navigation requires patience and perspective. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Bitcoin fall below $92,000? The drop resulted from a combination of whale selling, negative macroeconomic sentiment, and a technical breakdown after BTC failed to hold higher support levels. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? It depends on your strategy. For long-term investors, dips can be buying opportunities. For short-term traders, waiting for confirmation of a new support level may be wiser. How low could the Bitcoin price go? While predictions are uncertain, traders are watching the $91,500 and $90,000 levels as potential next supports. A break below $90,000 could signal deeper correction. Does this mean the bull market is over? Not necessarily. Bull markets typically experience several sharp corrections. The overall trend remains the most important factor to determine the market phase. What should I do if I’m holding Bitcoin? Assess your original investment thesis. If the long-term reasons for holding BTC are still valid, short-term price action may not warrant a change. Consider your risk tolerance. Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price updates? Use reputable tracking websites and exchanges for real-time data. Avoid making decisions based solely on social media sentiment or unverified sources.

The rally comes as an upcoming network upgrade shifts sentiment around the token. Strong technicals pushed LUNC through major resistance, but after such an explosive move, traders are now looking for the next undervalued opportunity. That spotlight is increasingly turning toward Reactor ($REACT) , currently priced at just $0.035, with a working platform and clear supply-driven token mechanics. Here’s why REACT is emerging as the smarter, earlier entry after LUNC’s surge. LUNC’s Technical Breakout Signals Renewed Appetite for High-Upside Plays The rally of Terra Classic didn’t happen by chance — the chart confirms real momentum. LUNC broke above the 200-day EMA and hit the 0.618 Fibonacci level. Meanwhile, the RSI near 70 signals 70 overbought conditions. The breakout shows bullish continuation potential if LUNC holds above $0.000056, but the overbought RSI and a rejection from the day’s high at $0.0000605 point to rising consolidation risk. For many traders, that means the explosive upside has already been captured. This creates a familiar rotation pattern: when a major low-cap altcoin completes its run, early capital often looks for the next asset with similar upside but a clean, early chart. So why Reactor ($REACT) could be the next breakout coin? Reactor ($REACT): A Live Trading Platform With Real Utility Reactor is one of the most compelling early-stage opportunities in the market, because its product already exists, its user base is growing, and its token mechanics reward adoption instead of speculation. A Unified Terminal That Solves Real Problems Reactor consolidates the entire DeFi workflow into a single professional-grade interface: Spot execution through Perp DEX routing (Aster, Hyperliquid, and others) Unified futures dashboard aggregating derivatives positions Live memecoin launch tracking across Pump.fun, Bonk ecosystems, and major token hubs Yield aggregation from Morpho, Yearn, Forknet, and more Instead of bouncing between 5–7 apps to manage positions, Reactor gives traders a coherent environment optimized for speed and clarity. A Token With Predictable Economics — Not Guesswork $REACT powers the platform’s functionality. As activity grows, commission revenue increases, revenue funds buy-backs and token burns, while the circulating supply decreases naturally over time This creates a transparent relationship between platform usage and token demand — something most early-stage projects lack entirely. Nearly 10 million $REACT tokens have already been sold, showing meaningful traction before listing. Current $0.035 early-stage price offers 66% discount on the upcoming $REACT listing Why REACT Makes Sense After LUNC’s Rally After LUNC’s 120% move, traders now want: A low entry price A strong narrative A catalyst still ahead, not behind A token that hasn’t already run A project with real utility to support long-term appreciation Reactor checks each box efficiently. At $0.035, REACT is near the ground floor compared to most 2025 tokens. LUNC already made its sprint — REACT is still waiting for its first major expansion phase. Upcoming Catalysts Reactor enters 2026 with: Wallet upgrades for iOS and Android A redesigned Fusaka infrastructure for faster, cheaper trades A Public Beta rollout for the Terminal New vault integrations (Morpho, Yearn, Polygon PoS) Early Contributor rewards and Leaderboards A major token listing ahead These catalysts provide sustained momentum. Unlike LUNC, where gains now require chasing an overextended chart, $REACT offers front-loaded asymmetry: a live product, increasing revenue flows, and a token that hasn’t yet priced in platform growth. Conclusion LUNC’s 120% rally proves the market is hungry for low-cost assets with strong catalysts. But the best opportunities come before the parabolic move — not after an overbought breakout. At $0.035, with a functioning multi-layer trading terminal and clear token mechanics tied to real revenue, Reactor ($REACT) stands out as one of the most compelling early-phase altcoins heading into 2026.

People can grab a futuristic looking BTC hardware wallet, named Bitkey, without sharing their home address. According to a post published by Bitkey on X, anyone located in the US can order the hardware wallet and have it shipped to a pickup point like FedEx, Dollar General, Albertsons, Kroger stores, and up to 9,000 Walmart locations. Getting a Bitkey only requires a name and an email address if the user pays in Bitcoin and selects a pickup point. private pick-up your bitkey https://t.co/pV2kXGfagI — jack (@jack) December 2, 2025 Dorsey’s Bitkey works without a seed phrase Bitkey has a different recovery model compared to other hardware wallets. Most crypto hardware wallets rely on a seed phrase, which comprise 12 to 24 combinations of random words. Many people have lost access to their crypto holdings forever. That’s because their seed phrases were lost, stolen, burnt in a fire, or accidentally tossed in the trash. The Bitkey website says, “Seed phrases are hard to manage, easy to lose, and attractive targets for even low-tech scammers.” It continued: “It’s a single point of failure and represents a fundamental weakness of prevailing self-custody models.” Moreover, most crypto wallets are singlesig (single-signature). In other terms, users have one signature to sign all transactions. Hackers have an easy job targeting a singlesig wallet with a seed phrase. Bitkey eliminates the need for a seed phrase. It’s a multisig (multi-signature) wallet with three keys. Each key is saved on a separate device. One key is on the smartphone, another inside the hardware wallet, and the last one is saved on the Bitkey server. This design helps people recover their BTC even if they lose their physical wallet or smartphone. Bitkey signs Bitcoin transactions with two keys To sign a transaction, users need 2 out of 3 keys, usually the keys stored on the smartphone and the hardware wallet. To spend, users must tap the hardware wallet at the back of the phone, similar to how people use Apple Pay at points of sale. Since there are 3 keys and 2 devices plus a server involved in Bitkey’s system design, losing access to the hardware wallet or smartphone isn’t a major problem. If a user loses their smartphone, the wallet app can be recovered using the keys saved on Bitkey and the server. The worst-case scenario is when a user loses their smartphone and Bitkey at the same time. This is solvable too through Recovery Contacts. These are people the user adds in the app when setting their Bitkey for the first time. Bitkey was designed and created by the team behind Square and Cash App. The wallet is available in 95 countries. Last week, Bitkey partnered with Strike, a Bitcoin payments app. US-based Bitkey users can now purchase BTC using Strike and transfer it smoothly to their hardware wallet.

The sudden activity has sparked renewed attention to digital assets tied to the notorious platform that helped popularize Bitcoin in its early years. Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham detected approximately 312 dormant wallets collectively moving $3.14 million in BTC to the address “ bc1q***ga54 ” over 12 hours. The wallets still retain roughly $40 million in Bitcoin following the transfers, according to Arkham’s latest data. Source: Arkham Mystery Surrounds Decade-Old Wallets’ Sudden Activity The reason behind the wallets’ reactivation remains unclear. Coinbase Director Conor Grogan identified these holdings earlier this year, estimating that they were worth around $47 million in Bitcoin across dozens of addresses potentially linked to Ross Ulbricht, the marketplace’s creator. Grogan resurfaced that January analysis on Tuesday after a pseudonymous operator “0xG00gly” flagged the latest movements. What fresh hell is this? pic.twitter.com/Pt64kB26pO — Googly (@0xG00gly) December 9, 2025 Individual transfers ranged from micro-amounts of 0.00006 BTC, roughly $5.58, to larger sums exceeding 3.6 BTC, valued at $338,640. The transactions followed a pattern of consolidation, with funds from multiple legacy addresses flowing into the single destination wallet over several hours. Several wallets showed connections to mining activity from the 2011 era, when Bitcoin mining remained accessible to individual participants using standard computer equipment. Ulbricht himself has not publicly commented on the transfers. He served multiple life sentences without parole for creating Silk Road before receiving a full and unconditional pardon from President Donald Trump in January through executive order. Source: CBS The former darknet operator delivered his first public speech following his release in May , emphasizing freedom and decentralization as guiding principles for future technological advancement. While Silk Road facilitated illegal narcotics sales and other prohibited transactions, the platform played a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s early adoption. The marketplace processed over 1.5 million transactions worth an estimated $213 million between 2011 and its 2013 shutdown, all conducted using cryptocurrency. Ulbricht, a physics graduate and early Bitcoin advocate, envisioned the platform as a libertarian experiment in anonymous commerce free of government interference. However, prosecutors successfully argued that it enabled widespread criminal activity. Government Bitcoin Holdings Face Competing Policy Directions The wallet activity emerges amid ongoing debates over how authorities should handle seized digital assets. The Department of Justice received approval in December to sell 69,370 Bitcoin , worth $6.5 billion, confiscated from Silk Road, following a federal judge’s ruling that ended a contentious ownership battle with Battle Born Investments. That company claimed ownership through a bankruptcy estate tied to Raymond Ngan, allegedly the mysterious “ Individual X ” accused of stealing crypto from Silk Road. Battle Born lost at every judicial level, including the Supreme Court’s refusal to hear the case. The company’s attorney criticized what he called “the DOJ’s abuse of the Civil Asset Forfeiture process” and accused officials of “procedural trickery” throughout the litigation. The approved sale represents one of the largest government cryptocurrency liquidations in history. Is the U.S. DOJ selling Silk Road Bitcoin, impacting the market? Bitcoin Magazine CEO ( @DavidFBailey ) suggests potential sales amid price volatility. #Bitcoin #SilkRoad https://t.co/4mjRYW2hQW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Officials justified the decision , citing Bitcoin’s price volatility, though they typically conduct such sales in smaller batches to minimize market disruption. The decision came despite Trump’s campaign promise to establish a “ Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ” rather than liquidating government-held cryptocurrency. The proposed reserve would mirror the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, retaining all seized digital assets to manage economic risks. Similar dormant wallet movements have triggered security concerns before. In July, another $8.6 billion in Bitcoin from wallets inactive since 2011 suddenly consolidated, prompting speculation about potential hacks or compromised private keys. Some observers linked those holdings to Roger Ver, the early Bitcoin advocate arrested in Spain on tax charges, though no confirmation emerged. Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable despite these large-scale transfers. The cryptocurrency traded near $92,500 on Wednesday, up 2.5% as traders awaited the Federal Reserve’s final rate decision of the year.

Regulatory clarity, infrastructure upgrades, and token listings are converging into a cycle where real utility and compliant architecture matter more than speculation. Three developments stand out as the most important to track in 2026: Avalanche’s regulatory momentum and ETF timeline, Ztarknet’s privacy-focused L2 expansion, and the upcoming listing of $REACT — a token tied to Reactor trading platform solving major DeFi pains. Avalanche: Regulatory Tailwinds and a Delayed ETF Decision Avalanche enters 2026 with meaningful progress on both regulatory and institutional fronts. In early December 2025, Abu Dhabi approved USDT issuance and services on Avalanche, allowing compliant stablecoin operations within one of the world’s most tightly regulated financial jurisdictions. At the same time, the U.S. SEC formally closed its probe into Avalanche, reducing enforcement risk and giving developers and institutions clearer ground to build. For a network already focused on high-speed settlement and institutional integrations, regulatory certainty is one of the strongest long-term catalysts it could receive. However, the most visible milestone remains unresolved: Grayscale’s AVAX ETF decision has been delayed until July 2026. Prolonged uncertainty may cap AVAX’s upside in the short term, as institutional inflows tend to wait for clarity. Still, approval for compliant stablecoins puts Avalanche in a stronger position heading into the ETF ruling. Ztarknet Upgrade: A Starknet-style Privacy Layer for ZEC Zcash’s ecosystem is undergoing one of its most important transformations since launch. Ztarknet, a Starknet-inspired Layer-2 zk-rollup, is already live in testnet and aims to bring 1,000 TPS private smart contracts by 2026. If successful, Ztarknet could reposition ZEC as a backbone for private Web3 applications, enabling developers to build privacy-preserving dApps with far greater throughput than Zcash’s base layer. Governance is shifting toward profit-driven voting blocs, a trend that risks alienating the protocol’s long-standing privacy-focused core contributors. The most sensitive decision arrives in 2026: a vote on a 20% developer tax. This funding model could either stabilize long-term development or fracture community alignment. Ztarknet’s success depends heavily on how this governance debate resolves. $REACT Listing: A Utility-Driven Token for Reactor Trading Terminal Unlike many early-stage tokens that launch before their platforms exist, Reactor ($REACT) enters 2026 with a fully functional product already deployed. The Reactor Terminal unifies the fragmented DeFi workflow into a single interface that traders can use today — combining: spot execution routed through Perp DEXes futures positions consolidated across multiple sources memecoin launch feeds from Pump.fun, Bonk ecosystems, and other aggregators yield aggregation from Morpho, Yearn, Forknet, and similar protocols This system creates an environment where high-frequency trading, yield management, and cross-protocol actions exist in one place. Why the token listing matters $REACT fuels fee discounts, staking APY boosts, and priority placement across platform features. As activity on the Terminal increases, commission revenue rises, and that revenue funds buy-backs and token burns, reducing circulating supply over time. With the public beta, wallet upgrades, infrastructure improvements, and new vault integrations rolling out, the upcoming 2026 token listing arrives at a moment when usage is expanding — not promised. This positions $REACT as one of the few token launches tied to tangible, measurable platform activity rather than speculative roadmaps. Conclusion 2026 is shaping up to be a year defined not by hype but by infrastructure and governance choices. Avalanche is navigating regulatory clarity and an approaching ETF decision that could reshape institutional exposure. Ztarknet has the potential to turn ZEC into a modern privacy L2 ecosystem, contingent on a critical governance vote. $REACT is preparing for a listing backed by an operational trading platform with real revenue mechanics. For traders and analysts watching for structural shifts rather than short-lived narratives, these three milestones form the most important set of crypto upgrades to monitor in the coming year.

At the same time, the price is reclaiming key technical levels, hinting at shifting momentum on the daily chart. OCC Letter Clears Way for Bank Bitcoin Trades The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has confirmed that national banks may enter “riskless principal” transactions in crypto assets, including Bitcoin. The December 2025 interpretive letter says banks can buy a crypto asset from one party and immediately resell it to another as part of normal banking activity. OCC Bank Bitcoin Letter. Source: bitcoinlfgo In a riskless principal trade, the bank acts as an intermediary. It agrees to purchase Bitcoin from an initial counterparty only when it already has a matching order from a second customer to buy the same amount. The purchase and resale occur almost at the same time, so the bank does not hold Bitcoin in inventory. The OCC notes that these transactions must follow existing banking laws and risk controls. Banks that offer Bitcoin trades under this model must apply standard compliance rules, including anti-money-laundering checks, customer due diligence and capital and liquidity requirements. Bitcoin Reclaims Kijun as Golden Cross Appears Meanwhile , Bitcoin has broken above the daily Kijun line after trading below it for roughly six weeks, according to Ichimoku signals shared by analyst Titan of Crypto. The move shows buyers finally pushing price back over this key equilibrium level on the one-day chart. Bitcoin Ichimoku Golden Cross Breakout.

Key Takeaways: FinCEN fined Paxful $3.5M for willfully enabling over $500M in suspicious crypto transfers. Regulators said Paxful ignored basic AML rules, including MSB registration and SAR filings. Paxful later shut down amid regulatory pressure, staff losses, and internal legal disputes. The regulator accused the company of willfully violating federal anti-money laundering laws and allowing more than $500 million in suspicious transfers linked to high-risk jurisdictions and criminal activity. According to FinCEN, Paxful facilitated transactions tied to Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and even Backpage.com, the notorious classifieds site seized in 2018 for enabling sex trafficking. FinCEN Says Paxful Ignored Basic Anti–Money Laundering Rules Regulators said Paxful failed to implement even the most basic requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), including registering as a money services business, maintaining an anti-money-laundering program, and filing suspicious activity reports. “For years, Paxful disregarded its BSA obligations and facilitated transactions associated with illicit activity and high-risk jurisdictions,” FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki said. Paxful acknowledged that it willfully violated federal law. The consent order highlights major compliance lapses during the years in which Paxful operated without adequate oversight, largely due to failures by former leadership. FinCEN said the company has since taken steps to correct past misconduct, including firing senior figures responsible for the violations and conducting an internal review to identify suspicious activity previously left unreported. Regulators from multiple federal agencies assisted in the case, including the Justice Department’s Money Laundering and Narcotics section, the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California, and Homeland Security Investigations. Today, FinCEN assessed a $3.5 million penalty against Paxful for facilitating suspicious activity involving illicit actors. https://t.co/dkdJNxPCIL pic.twitter.com/wVBAwlHyvr — Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) (@FinCENnews) December 9, 2025 The agency emphasized that firms involved in digital assets must adjust their controls to match the risks inherent in dealing with crypto, especially exposure to sanctioned jurisdictions and anonymous transfers. In 2023, Paxful shut down its peer-to-peer crypto marketplace , citing the broader industry downturn, regulatory pressure, and internal turmoil. CEO Ray Youssef cited multiple factors behind the shutdown, including major staff departures, increasingly burdensome US regulatory requirements, and a lawsuit filed by a co-founder, reportedly Artur Schaback. He said compliance demands had grown so intense that even dedicating a quarter of Paxful’s workforce to compliance was not enough. The company also lacked the resources to continue operating while blocking US users, making a full marketplace suspension unavoidable. B.C. Seizes Over $1M in Gold, Cash Linked to QuadrigaCX Co-Founder As reported, British Columbia has secured a major legal victory after obtaining a court order to seize more than $1 million in gold, cash, and luxury goods tied to QuadrigaCX co-founder Michael Patryn. The forfeiture comes under the province’s unexplained wealth order regime, which requires individuals to prove their assets were acquired lawfully. Patryn chose not to contest the action, allowing authorities to move forward with liquidating the seized items. The seized assets were discovered in a Vancouver safety deposit box and included 45 gold bars, luxury watches, jewelry, and a loaded .45-caliber pistol. At today’s prices, the gold alone is worth over $800,000. The province’s civil forfeiture office alleges these items were purchased using misappropriated QuadrigaCX customer funds, citing evidence gathered during a broader RCMP investigation.

Now, a high-profile media group tied to U.S. politics has entered the arena . The potential implications of this filing swirl not only around major tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum — but also around altcoins such as XRP. In early July 2025, media company Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) — owner of social platform Truth Social — submitted a registration to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a new fund : the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF. As reported by analyst Chad Steingraber on X, the filing drew immediate attention for its proposed asset mix and strategic ambition. What the Filing Reveals The S-1 registration describes a fund that aims to hold five leading cryptocurrencies directly. These are Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cronos (CRO), and XRP (XRP). The proposed allocation by value places 70% in Bitcoin and 15% in Ethereum. The remaining 15% is split among the three altcoins: Solana gets 8%, Cronos 5%, and XRP 2%. Custody and execution responsibilities would fall to Crypto.com, via its trust arm, with asset storage, liquidity provision, and staking operations managed exclusively by them. Shares are slated for listing on NYSE Arca once the ETF obtains regulatory and exchange-level approval. Truth Social Trump Index Fund on standby XRP Included https://t.co/YH3EzOoK82 pic.twitter.com/gTBjel9K7N — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) December 10, 2025 Why XRP’s Inclusion Is Significant The presence of XRP — even at 2% — matters for several reasons. First, it pushes XRP into a “blue-chip” category alongside top-tier tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This could signal shifting sentiment among institutional and retail investors regarding XRP’s long-term legitimacy. Second, if approved and successful, the fund would channel capital directly into XRP through a regulated, U.S.-listed vehicle. That could mean broader exposure to investors unable or unwilling to buy and hold individual tokens. Third, inclusion alongside CRO and SOL — tokens tied to major platforms — suggests the fund aims not only for stability but also for growth potential across assorted blockchain ecosystems. Regulatory and Structural Hurdles Ahead The filing is only the first step. The ETF still requires SEC approval, likely including a Form 19b-4 submission to change exchange rules and allow trading. Historically, the SEC has scrutinized crypto ETFs for custody safeguards, market manipulation risk, and compliance with existing securities laws. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Further, the fund’s passive structure depends on the custodian’s ability to securely store assets and efficiently manage liquidity. Any weakness in custodial practices or regulatory uncertainty could delay or derail the launch. What to Watch Next Investors and observers should watch for updates on the SEC’s review process. A key milestone will be the submission (and approval) of a 19b-4 filing required for listing on NYSE Arca. Any amended prospectus could change allocations, assets included, or custodian arrangements. Attention should also focus on on-chain flows, asset inflows to the fund, and whether Crypto.com publicly discloses staking or custody metrics. Finally, broader crypto-market sentiment and regulatory climate will shape the fund’s reception and success. A New Institutional Narrative for XRP The Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF filing places XRP among the top digital assets considered by a politically connected media company . Though XRP represents only a small share, its inclusion alone elevates its standing. The fund could offer new, regulated exposure to XRP and other altcoins. However, significant regulatory and structural hurdles remain. For now, the prospect offers a fresh institutional narrative for XRP — one to watch closely as the regulatory process plays out.

Key Takeaways: Mubadala Capital is exploring tokenized private market access with Kaio. The partnership reflects rising institutional interest in RWAs. Tokenized assets continue gaining momentum as infrastructure improves. Announced Tuesday, the partnership will focus on testing how Kaio’s framework could allow institutional and accredited investors to access Mubadala Capital’s private market products onchain.

Mubadala Capital Manages $430B Across Global Markets Mubadala Capital oversees and advises on more than $430 billion across private equity, credit, real estate and alternative strategies. It operates as a subsidiary of Mubadala Investment Company, one of Abu Dhabi’s major sovereign wealth funds. The group’s broader digital-asset positioning has drawn attention recently. In November, Bloomberg reported that the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, another Mubadala subsidiary, held at least $500 million in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. In Tuesday’s announcement, Fatima Al Noaimi and Max Franzetti, co-heads of Mubadala Capital Solutions, said the goal is to work with regulatory-aligned infrastructure to understand how tokenization can broaden access to institutional-grade vehicles.

The company has moved more than $200 million in institutional assets onchain and says the Mubadala initiative underscores momentum behind onchain investment products. “This launch demonstrates how traditional institutional capital is now scaling onchain,” Kaio CEO Shrey Rastogi said. The move places Mubadala among a growing cohort of institutional players studying whether tokenized mechanisms can cut operational friction and eventually expand global participation. CoinShares data shows strong demand for RWAs in 2025, particularly tokenized US Treasurys, which grew from $3.9 billion to $8.6 billion this year. The firm expects the trend to continue into 2026 as appetite for dollar-based yields remains elevated. Infrastructure is also evolving to support the shift. On Wednesday, Polygon deployed a hard fork aimed at strengthening performance for high-frequency applications such as stablecoins and tokenized RWAs. RWA Tokenization Gains Momentum On Monday, Libeara, the blockchain infrastructure platform backed by Standard Chartered’s venture arm SC Ventures, rolled out a new tokenized gold investment fund in Singapore, bringing one of the world’s oldest safe-haven assets onto digital rails. The fund, launched in partnership with FundBridge Capital, allows professional investors to gain exposure to gold through blockchain-based tokens issued on Libeara’s ledger. In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. “The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 .

The mining company, founded by Eric Trump, recently announced the addition of 416 BTC to its treasury. This strategic accumulation brings its total holdings to an impressive 4,783 BTC. What does this mean for the cryptocurrency landscape and the firm’s future? Why Is American Bitcoin Aggressively Accumulating? The recent purchase by American Bitcoin is not a random event. It represents a calculated strategy in a volatile market. Many institutional players view price dips as buying opportunities, and ABTC appears to be following this playbook. This accumulation signals a strong long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition as digital gold. Furthermore, increasing their holdings directly from their own mining operations provides a unique advantage. It allows them to grow their asset base while potentially lowering the average acquisition cost per coin. This vertical integration is a powerful model for sustainable growth in the crypto mining sector. Breaking Down the American Bitcoin Strategy To understand the impact, let’s look at the key elements of ABTC’s approach. The firm combines mining operations with strategic treasury management. Hodling Mined Coins: Instead of immediately selling mined Bitcoin for fiat currency to cover expenses, they are retaining a significant portion. This turns their mining infrastructure into a direct Bitcoin accumulation engine. Balance Sheet Strength: Holding 4,783 BTC significantly strengthens their corporate balance sheet. As Bitcoin’s price appreciates, so does the book value of the company. Market Confidence: This move broadcasts confidence to investors and the market. It shows the leadership’s conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. The Ripple Effect of Major Bitcoin Holdings When a firm like American Bitcoin makes such a public accumulation, it creates ripple effects. Firstly, it contributes to the overall reduction of Bitcoin’s liquid supply. Coins held in corporate treasuries are effectively taken off the open market, which can create upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Secondly, it sets a precedent. Other mining companies and traditional corporations may see this as a viable treasury strategy, encouraging further institutional adoption. The action by a firm with the Trump name attached also brings mainstream media attention, further normalizing Bitcoin investment at a corporate level. What Challenges Does American Bitcoin Face? However, this strategy is not without its risks. The primary challenge is Bitcoin’s notorious price volatility. A significant market downturn could negatively impact their balance sheet valuation in the short term. Therefore, this approach requires a strong stomach and unwavering long-term vision. Operational costs for mining, primarily electricity, remain a constant pressure. The firm must manage these fiat-denominated expenses carefully while choosing to hold its Bitcoin-denominated assets. This requires sophisticated financial planning and robust cash flow management from other business segments or financing. Conclusion: A Vote of Confidence in Bitcoin’s Future The decision by American Bitcoin to add 416 BTC to its coffers is a powerful statement. It transcends a simple financial transaction and acts as a public vote of confidence in the enduring value of Bitcoin. This move highlights a maturation in the industry, where mining firms are evolving from pure commodity producers into integrated digital asset holders. As more companies adopt similar strategies, the line between Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin investment vehicles will continue to blur, potentially reshaping the entire sector. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who founded American Bitcoin (ABTC)? A1: American Bitcoin was founded by Eric Trump, the second son of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Q2: How much Bitcoin does American Bitcoin now hold? A2: Following the recent addition, American Bitcoin’s total holdings now stand at 4,783 BTC. Q3: Why would a mining company hold Bitcoin instead of selling it? A3: Holding Bitcoin acts as a long-term investment on the company’s balance sheet. It bets on future price appreciation and reduces the liquid supply of Bitcoin on exchanges, which can be a strategic financial move. Q4: What are the risks of this strategy for American Bitcoin? A4: The main risk is Bitcoin’s price volatility. A market crash could devalue their holdings. They also need to manage operational costs (like electricity) with fiat currency while holding onto their Bitcoin assets. Q5: Does this affect the average Bitcoin investor? A5: Yes, indirectly. Large-scale accumulation by institutions can reduce available supply and influence market sentiment, potentially impacting price trends that affect all investors. Q6: Is this a common practice among Bitcoin mining firms? A6: It is becoming increasingly common. Many public mining companies now disclose their Bitcoin holdings, and a strategy of holding a portion of mined coins is a recognized approach to building corporate value.

Market activity shows heavy volatility, yet supply trends reveal a story that moves beyond routine price swings. Glassnode data shows XRP exchange balances dropping from 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion in under 60 days. Traders removed nearly 1.35 billion tokens from public markets during that window, and more than 1 billion left exchanges in only three weeks. The decline signals a rapid shift in market behavior, and the timing raises questions about what drives this extreme withdrawal pace. Source: X The trend also shows exchange balances falling below the price structure for the first time on record. This relationship draws attention because exchange supply usually reflects short-term trading sentiment. When supply declines this sharply while the price structure tightens, analysts often examine whether demand shifts toward long-term holding patterns. Source: X Large Holders Pull XRP Away From Public Markets Institutional systems appear to influence the current trend. Data shows fewer tokens available on exchanges as liquidity migrates toward OTC desks, custody platforms, and private settlement channels. This kind of movement often signals long-term positioning rather than speculative trading. Several traders highlight how retail activity rarely removes billions of tokens at this speed, which invites questions about the scale of institutional involvement. Recent filings support this view. Multiple crypto index funds added XRP to portfolio structures , and new ETF-related submissions mention the asset directly. These filings show an increase in institutional visibility . Banks also gained more flexibility to handle crypto assets under new regulatory guidelines, while payment providers expanded XRP access through simpler purchase methods. All these steps create incentives for institutions to secure supply outside public exchanges. Market watchers often study this behavior because it influences how markets react to sudden demand. When available supply declines, even moderate buying can trigger strong price movements. Traders often describe this environment as a supply squeeze, though the direction of the next major move still depends on market sentiment and chart structure. Supply Decline Creates a More Sensitive Market Structure XRP’s steep supply reduction changes how liquidity functions. With fewer tokens on exchanges, the market reacts more sharply when buyers enter. This setup increases volatility because price levels shift quickly when order books thin out. The current decline in exchange supply creates conditions where small shifts in demand produce outsized effects. Observers point to the speed of the decline. A removal of 1 billion XRP in three weeks marks an unusual compression of available liquidity. Markets often respond to this kind of environment with sudden spikes or sharp reversals when large holders test available depth. Anyone tracking short-term price changes may wonder how long this level of removal can continue and what may happen if demand rises while exchanges hold their lowest balances in years. The market has not encountered this supply structure before, which raises uncertainty around how XRP will respond once buying pressure increases. Traders now focus on chart signals that indicate whether the next decisive move trends upward or downward. XRP Price Sets Up for a Breakout as Liquidity Tightens XRP trades near $2.08 as the price hovers inside a symmetrical triangle pattern . The structure shows buyers stepping in at slightly higher levels while sellers pressure the upper boundary. This tightening range often ends with a strong breakout. A move above $2.12 to $2.15 could signal the start of a rally, while a dip below $2.00 may confirm renewed weakness. Source: X The narrowing pattern grows more important as exchange supply continues to shrink. Liquidity conditions amplify any breakout, which means the next move may unfold faster than traders expect. Market analysts track this convergence of reduced supply, institutional engagement , and technical compression as a sign that a significant shift may approach. The combination of historic supply withdrawals and a tightening price structure sets up a decisive moment for XRP. The market now watches both sides of the triangle as traders prepare for the impact of a supply environment that rarely appears in major crypto assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 12:10:40

According to the report compiled with research partner DL Research, Bybit analyzed 79 countries using 28 metrics and 92 data points to assess adoption patterns, regulatory frameworks, and user engagement. Singapore, the United States, and Lithuania are the top three countries in terms of crypto adoption. However, Bybit lauded the Asian city-state’s integration of digital assets into everyday life and institutional infrastructure, surpassing those of the latter countries. Vietnam and Hong Kong also ranked within the top ten, adding to the widespread mass adoption rate in Southeast Asia. Singapore ranks higher than America in crypto adoption index report According to the crypto exchange’s indexing , Singapore topped the charts with a score of 7.5, leading in several dimensions of adoption. The country achieved perfect scores in user penetration (1.00) and high cultural visibility (0.96), which topped global averages of the bottom half of the top ten ranking countries by adoption index. Over 11% of the population reportedly holds cryptocurrency because Singapore’s leadership, institutional readiness, and a digital finance-embracing culture have created a crypto-friendly environment for investments. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) changed its tone towards cryptocurrency regulation earlier this year with a clear licensing framework working in tandem with innovation-friendly policies. In April 2022, Singapore enacted the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA), a comprehensive piece of legislation meant to streamline and strengthen MAS’s oversight of the financial sector. In June this year, several provisions of the FSMA came into effect, including a licensing regime for digital token service providers (DTSPs) operating in or from Singapore while serving overseas markets. The legislation goes beyond previous frameworks such as the Payment Services Act, which had exclusively governed services provided to domestic customers. DTSPs with a substantial presence in Singapore are now required to apply for licenses and comply with anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations. However, MAS reiterated in a May consultation response that it is “unlikely to approve any application by an entity to provide DT services from Singapore to only overseas persons, given the higher inherent ML/TF risks and the limited supervisory oversight MAS can exercise over such entities.” The clarification was issued with four weeks’ notice before the June 30 commencement. Stablecoins in play for global crypto adoption Bybit’s report also mentioned the global growth of the stablecoin market volumes worldwide, particularly those pegged to non-US currencies. US dollar-based stablecoins, Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), dominate savings and hedging, but stablecoins pegged to other currencies are being used for payments and commerce. Jesse Pollak, head developer of Coinbase’s Base blockchain, called on developers worldwide to create alternatives to dollar-pegged tokens. “If you look at the world today, something like 60% of the world’s currency reserve is dollars, but then you have tens of other critical currencies, whether it’s the euro, or the yen, or even currencies like the Nigerian naira, that are huge parts of the global economy. But right now, they’re missing in the crypto economy,” Pollak surmised. According to an October Cryptopolitan report , Director for International Development at the A7A5 project, Oleg Ogienko, said fiat-backed cryptocurrencies not denominated in US dollars could capture roughly 20% of the global stablecoin market by 2028. “One of the stable trends in the crypto industry is the active development of non-dollar stablecoins. Their growth reflects the growing demand for digital assets backed by national currencies, which contributes to market diversification,” Ogienko told Russian news outlet RBC. Alongside Singapore’s index news, Lithuania was a surprise entry into the top index ranking with a score of 6.3 overall after a strong performance in cultural readiness and institutional penetration. Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates also ranked in the top five, while Vietnam and Hong Kong entered the top ten. Chainalysis and TRM Labs’ late October report listed India, the United States, and Pakistan as leading countries in rising adoption rates, with special mentions of Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia when adjusting for population size.

You might notice things are quieter. Recent data reveals a significant cooling in market activity, as spot trading volume on major cryptocurrency exchanges fell by a staggering 28% in November. This notable drop, reported by Wu Blockchain, signals a potential shift in trader sentiment and market dynamics as the year draws to a close. Let’s dive into what caused this slump and what it could mean for your portfolio. Why Did Spot Trading Volume Crash in November? The overall 28% monthly decline in spot trading volume is more than a simple statistic; it’s a window into broader market psychology. Several factors likely contributed to this pullback. First, the cryptocurrency market often experiences volatility around macroeconomic announcements and regulatory news. Second, after periods of significant price movement, traders frequently enter a consolidation phase, leading to reduced activity. Finally, the traditional holiday season can see decreased participation across financial markets. This decline wasn’t uniform. A closer look at individual exchange performance reveals a more nuanced story. While the trend was negative across the board, the severity of the drop varied significantly from one platform to another. Which Exchanges Were Hit the Hardest? The data highlights clear winners and losers in terms of retaining trader engagement during the slowdown. The exchange experiencing the most dramatic fall was Bitget, which saw its spot trading volume collapse by 62%. This suggests specific challenges or a different user base reaction for that platform. Meanwhile, the industry giants also felt the pressure: Binance , the world’s largest exchange by volume, recorded a 25% decrease. Coinbase , a major player especially in the U.S., saw a more modest 8% dip. The disparity between Coinbase’s single-digit decline and Bitget’s steep fall is particularly telling. It may point to differences in geographic exposure, the types of assets predominantly traded, or the behavior of retail versus institutional users on each platform. What Does Lower Trading Volume Mean for Crypto Investors? For the everyday investor, a sustained drop in spot trading volume carries important implications. Lower volume often leads to increased price volatility for individual assets, as fewer trades are needed to move the market. This can create both risk and opportunity. Furthermore, exchanges themselves may feel the impact. Trading fees are a primary revenue source, so a prolonged volume slump could pressure their business models. However, it can also be a healthy market correction, washing out excessive speculation and setting the stage for more sustainable growth. The key for traders is to adjust their strategies—perhaps focusing on longer timeframes or being more selective with entries—during these quieter periods. Actionable Insights from the November Volume Data So, what can you do with this information? First, use it as a gauge of overall market sentiment. A shrinking spot trading volume often precedes significant price moves, as it indicates indecision. Second, consider diversifying the exchanges you use or monitor, as performance varies. Finally, this is an excellent time for education and research rather than impulsive trading. Building your knowledge when the market is calm prepares you for when activity—and opportunity—returns. In summary, the 28% drop in November’s spot trading volume is a crucial market signal. It reflects a collective pause among traders, with exchanges like Bitget bearing the brunt of the decline. While lower volume presents challenges like potential liquidity issues, it also offers a moment to strategize. Understanding these market rhythms is essential for navigating the crypto landscape successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is spot trading volume? Spot trading volume refers to the total value of cryptocurrencies bought and sold for immediate delivery (“on the spot”) on an exchange within a specific period, like a day or a month. It’s a key metric for measuring market activity and liquidity. Why is a drop in trading volume significant? A significant drop in volume can indicate declining trader interest, market uncertainty, or a consolidation phase. It often leads to higher volatility, as fewer trades are needed to move an asset’s price, and can signal an impending larger price movement. Should I be worried about my exchange if its volume fell sharply? Not necessarily. All exchanges experienced a decline. However, a severe drop like Bitget’s 62% could be a point of monitoring. It’s always prudent to use reputable, well-established exchanges and consider diversifying where you hold assets. Does lower volume mean prices will fall? Not directly. Low volume indicates less trading activity, not a specific price direction. However, it can make the market more susceptible to large buy or sell orders, which can cause sharp price swings in either direction. Is this a good time to buy cryptocurrency? Periods of low volume and consolidation can sometimes present buying opportunities, as assets may be in a temporary lull. However, this depends entirely on your investment strategy, risk tolerance, and research. Never invest based on a single metric. Will trading volume recover? Historically, cryptocurrency trading volume is cyclical, often correlated with major price trends, news events, and broader market cycles. Volume typically recovers when a strong market narrative or price trend emerges to attract traders back. Found this analysis of the spot trading volume decline helpful?

The team also completed an RPC upgrade following a brief reindex period. Operations have returned to normal across the network. Shibarium announced plans for a privacy upgrade in 2026. This addition could strengthen the technical foundation supporting SHIB's long-term value. The ecosystem shows signs of maturation as development milestones stack up. Futures Trading and ETF Speculation Build Momentum Coinbase will introduce SHIB futures contracts on December 12. This launch represents a major step toward institutional participation in the token's market. Futures products typically increase liquidity and trading volume. The exchange's decision signals growing recognition of SHIB's market presence. Institutional traders gain new tools to access the asset through regulated channels. This development could help SHIB break free from its current price compression. Discussions about a potential SHIB exchange-traded fund have surfaced in crypto circles. While still speculative, ETF conversations reflect evolving attitudes toward memecoin investments. Such products would offer traditional investors exposure to SHIB without direct token ownership. On-chain metrics reveal substantial movement by large holders. More than 45 billion SHIB tokens have migrated off centralized exchanges recently. Whales transferred approximately $35 million worth of tokens into private wallets. Analyst Javon Marks projects potential upside to $0.000032. This target implies gains exceeding 200% from present levels. The forecast depends on catalysts like the Coinbase futures launch and continued whale accumulation gaining traction.

This $193.9 million deposit is more than a simple transaction; it’s a powerful signal of how major institutions are actively managing their BlackRock Bitcoin ETF holdings. Let’s break down what this means for you and the future of digital asset investment. What Does This BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Transaction Actually Mean? According to on-chain analytics from SolidIntel, an address linked to the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF moved the funds to Coinbase Prime. This platform is not your standard exchange. Think of it as a high-security, white-glove service desk built for giants. It provides large-scale trading, custody, and prime brokerage services exclusively for institutional players like hedge funds and asset managers. Therefore, this deposit likely isn’t about selling. Instead, it points to core operational activities for the ETF, such as: Settling creation/redemption baskets: Authorized Participants (APs) use platforms like Coinbase Prime to handle the underlying Bitcoin that backs the ETF shares. Enhancing custody security: Moving assets to a dedicated prime brokerage can be part of robust risk management. Facilitating liquidity: It prepares the asset for efficient, large-scale transactions required by the ETF structure. Why Should Every Crypto Investor Pay Attention? This move is a masterclass in institutional behavior. While retail traders might focus on short-term price swings, giants like BlackRock operate on a different plane. Their actions are deliberate, strategic, and focused on long-term infrastructure. The sheer scale—$194 million in a single transfer—highlights the profound liquidity and operational maturity that a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF brings to the market. It demonstrates that Bitcoin is being treated not as a speculative toy, but as a serious, movable asset class within the world’s largest financial frameworks. Moreover, choosing Coinbase Prime reinforces the critical role of regulated, institutional-grade partners in this ecosystem. It builds trust and sets a standard for how traditional finance expects to interact with crypto assets. What Are the Real-World Implications of This ETF Activity? So, what’s the practical takeaway for your portfolio? First, understand that such movements create a stabilizing floor. Large, regulated ETFs absorb volatility by converting speculative trading into held assets. This institutional presence can dampen the wild price swings historically associated with crypto. Second, it signals deepening adoption. Every operational move by BlackRock’s fund validates the entire sector, encouraging other institutions to follow suit. Finally, it shifts market influence. The flow of assets through these regulated channels gives more weight to fundamental, long-term value over social media hype. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF depositing $194 million at Coinbase Prime is a quiet but monumental event. It’s a behind-the-scenes look at the machinery of modern finance adapting to a digital age. This isn’t just about price; it’s about protocol, process, and permanence. For the astute investor, it underscores that Bitcoin’s journey is now inextricably linked with the discipline of institutional capital, paving the way for a more mature and accessible market for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean BlackRock is selling its Bitcoin? A: Not necessarily. A transfer to Coinbase Prime is typically for custody, settlement, or operational purposes within the ETF structure, not an immediate sale to the open market. Q: What is Coinbase Prime? A: Coinbase Prime is a specialized platform offering trading, custody, and prime brokerage services tailored for institutional investors, providing security and tools for handling large asset volumes. Q: How does this affect the price of Bitcoin? A: Direct short-term impact can be neutral, as it’s an operational move. However, it reinforces institutional confidence and market infrastructure, which supports long-term price stability and growth. Q: Why is the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) important? A: As one of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock’s entry lends immense credibility, attracts massive institutional capital, and integrates Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios. Q: Where can I track these kinds of transactions? A: On-chain analytics firms like SolidIntel, Arkham, and others track wallet addresses associated with large ETFs and institutions, providing transparency into these flows.

The incident has resulted in a pump-and-dump scheme that netted scammers approximately $55,000. MUBARA Pump-and-Dump Scheme Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was the first to alert users via X that the executive’s WeChat account had been compromised. CZ urged the crypto community not to buy any meme coins promoted in the posts, warning that “Web 2 social media security is not that strong. Stay safu!” On the other hand, Yi He confirmed that she hasn’t used the platform for a while and that the associated number had been taken over by the attackers. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that hours before posting the promotional content, the hacker created two new wallets and began accumulating MUBARA via PancakeSwap. On-chain data suggests they used this activity to run a pump-and-dump scheme. The attacker spent $19,479 to purchase 21.16 million tokens, triggering a price rally. The token rose from around $0.001 to $0.008 within minutes, pushing its market cap to around $8 million, which resulted in it being heavily traded on BNB. Lookonchain estimates that they have already sold 11.95 million MUBARA for $43,520 and still hold 9.21 million tokens worth $31,000, bringing total profits to roughly $55,000. MUBARA is a meme-based cryptocurrency that gained popularity in early 2025 due to its price movements and community-driven hype, and was officially listed on Binance Alpha in March through the BNB Chain Launchpad platform Four Meme. Pattern of Similar Hacks This occurrence is the most recent in a series of hacks targeting WeChat accounts of prominent crypto figures, a trend that stands out for its repeated use of meme tokens to defraud users. In a similar case, Tron founder Justin Sun’s account was compromised on November 30, showing a clear pattern in the attackers’ methods. The crypto X community has described these events as intense on-chain “hacker competitions” that are now spilling into off-chain platforms. CZ commented on the development, noting that he hoped the next compromised profile wouldn’t be his because he hasn’t used the social platform for many years. He also clarified that he would not directly endorse any meme coins on the platform. Following the latest development, Yi He has shared that her profile has been successfully recovered after external verification that led to the password being changed. However, she pointed out that the bad actors are reportedly still lurking, exploiting feedback issues, and attempting to add her as a friend.

That future is now unfolding as Pineapple Financial, a NYSE-listed fintech firm, begins a groundbreaking migration of its mortgage data to the Injective blockchain. This move signals a major leap for real-world asset tokenization, aiming to bring unprecedented clarity and security to the home loan industry. Why is Pineapple Financial Moving Mortgage Data to Injective? Pineapple Financial (PAPL) has launched a dedicated mortgage tokenization platform. The core mission? To solve a common industry headache: fragmented data. Previously, loan information was scattered across various internal systems and paper files. By migrating this mortgage data to Injective, the company consolidates everything into a single, auditable, and tamper-proof ledger. This isn’t a future plan—it’s happening now, with over 1,200 mortgage records already moved on-chain. What Are the Tangible Benefits of This Migration? Shifting mortgage data to a blockchain like Injective isn’t just a tech upgrade; it’s a strategic overhaul. The benefits are clear and impactful: Enhanced Security & Trust: Blockchain’s immutable nature means records cannot be altered after being written, reducing fraud risk. Operational Efficiency: Automating processes and having a single source of truth cuts down on administrative time and errors. Improved Auditability: Regulators or auditors can verify loan data in real-time, simplifying compliance. Future Innovation: Tokenized mortgages could eventually be fractionalized, creating new investment opportunities. Therefore, this move by Pineapple Financial is a practical step toward modernizing a traditional financial sector. How Does Injective Blockchain Support This Vision? The choice of the Injective blockchain is crucial. Injective is specifically built for finance, offering high speed and low transaction costs—essential for handling sensitive mortgage data. Moreover, Pineapple Financial’s commitment goes beyond just using the network. The company previously announced its intention to purchase $100 million worth of INJ tokens, aiming to become a top holder and staker. This deep integration shows a strong belief in Injective’s long-term role in reshaping finance. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Tokenizing Mortgages? While the migration of mortgage data to Injective is promising, the path has hurdles. Regulatory frameworks for tokenized real-world assets are still evolving. Furthermore, achieving widespread adoption requires educating both industry professionals and consumers about the benefits of blockchain-based systems. However, by being an early mover, Pineapple Financial is helping to pioneer the standards and practices that could define the future of mortgage lending. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Mortgage Finance Pineapple Financial’s decision to migrate its mortgage data to the Injective blockchain is a landmark moment. It demonstrates a powerful shift from theoretical blockchain potential to real-world, impactful application. This initiative paves the way for a more efficient, transparent, and secure mortgage industry. As more records move on-chain, we may look back at this as the beginning of a fundamental transformation in how we manage property ownership and debt. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean to migrate mortgage data to a blockchain? It means converting traditional paper and digital mortgage records into secure, unchangeable digital tokens on a decentralized ledger, like the Injective blockchain. Why did Pineapple Financial choose the Injective blockchain? Injective is built for financial applications, offering the speed, security, and low cost needed to handle sensitive loan data efficiently. Is my personal mortgage data safe on a blockchain? Blockchain technology provides enhanced security through encryption and immutability. However, the specific privacy measures implemented by Pineapple Financial would be key to total safety. What are the benefits of tokenizing a mortgage? Benefits include reduced fraud, lower administrative costs, easier auditing, and the potential for creating new, liquid markets for mortgage-backed assets. Can other fintech companies do this too? Absolutely. Pineapple Financial’s move could serve as a blueprint for other companies in the lending and real estate sectors looking to modernize their operations. What was Pineapple Financial’s $100 million INJ announcement? It signifies a major financial commitment to the Injective ecosystem, with the company planning to be a leading token holder and participant in network security through staking.

With current price action pivoting around the key $1.95 level and technical targets projected as high as $9–$13. What Happens If XRP Repeats The 2017 Fractal? The analysis uses a long-range log chart from Binance, where the latest candle in the screenshot shows XRP trading around $2.0892. In this timeframe, the analyst divides XRP’s history into mirrored cycles: 2014–2017 on the left and 2021–2025 on the right, each broken into labeled segments “Part 1,” “Part 2” and “Part 3.” Related Reading: XRP Selloff: Whales Shed Coins Worth $1 Billion In A Week According to Cryptollica, “the cycle experienced by XRP between 2014 and 2017 is almost an identical copy of the current cycle spanning 2021 to 2025.” In both cases, Part 1 is described as an accumulation phase, with XRP suppressed below a dashed blue resistance band for an extended period while forming higher lows along a rising dotted trendline. The current Part 1, roughly 2022–2024, is said to have lasted substantially longer than in the earlier cycle. The analyst cites the rule that “the bigger the base, the higher in space,” arguing that this extended sideways structure signals a large build-up of potential energy. Part 2 is defined as the breakout and retest of that blue resistance band. Once XRP closes decisively above this zone and consolidates there, the chart treats the area as a new support and as confirmation that “the official end of the downtrend and the start of a bull market” has been registered. Cryptollica suggests XRP is now at the final stage of, or has just completed, this breakout phase on the 2-week timeframe. The pivotal reference point for the entire setup is the $1.95 level, drawn in green on the chart. “The $1.95 level, marked in green, is of vital importance,” the analyst writes, emphasizing the classic principle that “once resistance is broken, it turns into support.” In this framework, XRP “currently holding above this level (performing a successful retest) is the most crucial confirmation point for the continuation of the uptrend.” Related Reading: Pundit Highlights The Condition That Will Trigger A 2,300% XRP Rally To $50 If that confirmation holds, the analysis moves to Part 3, labeled the “Parabolic Rise – Discovery Phase.” In 2017, this segment corresponded to a near-vertical advance that pushed XRP into its all-time high zone. Cryptollica argues that XRP now stands “right on the precipice of this ‘vertical lift-off’ in the current cycle,” illustrated by a steep yellow arrow on the logarithmic chart. The first major objective is the region around the prior all-time high at roughly $3.30–$3.84. If the 2017 fractal “plays out precisely,” the post projects an “implied target” between $9.00 and $13.00. The analyst tempers this with several cautions. The crypto market is far larger than in 2017, and a move to $10+ would imply a “colossal market capitalization,” making a repeat of the exact 2017 multiple “mathematically more challenging,” even if “logic often takes a backseat in crypto mania.” The scenario also assumes supportive fundamentals, including the resolution of regulatory overhangs, potential XRP ETF developments and Ripple’s stablecoin strategy. Parabolic phases, Cryptollica warns, are typically accompanied by “sudden drops of 30–40%,” making them “the most dangerous territory for leveraged trading.” The analyst characterizes the overall outlook as “extremely positive (bullish)” as long as the $1.95 support holds, concluding that XRP is at the moment of “breaking its chains” and that, if broader market conditions remain constructive, “double-digit targets ($10+) for XRP are technically on the table.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.07.

With Bitcoin pushing through multiple all-time highs and institutional money flowing in faster than ever, 2025 has become the year that retail investors feel both more excited and more anxious at the same time. For every story of someone doubling their capital, there are countless examples of traders who lost savings, bought at peaks, held the wrong coins, or panicked at the worst moment. After working in the crypto space long enough, one thing becomes obvious: most retail investors don’t fail because opportunities are bad, they fail because their decisions are made with incomplete information and too much emotion. The good news? Investing smarter today has become easier. Thanks to the rise of AI-powered analysis tools and structured portfolio frameworks, reducing crypto risk no longer requires luck, insider access, or professional trading experience. It only requires better data and disciplined decision-making. This guide breaks down how ordinary investors can protect their capital , using simple principles backed by modern AI tools available on platforms like Forvest.io . Why Retail Investors Lose Money (Even During Bull Markets) Before getting into solutions, we need to understand the real causes of unnecessary loss. The pattern repeats every cycle: 1. Information overload with no filter Every hour, hundreds of influencers, traders, Telegram channels, and so-called “experts” make bold predictions. Most of this content is speculative, promotional, or misleading. Without a way to filter what matters, investors end up reacting to noise instead of fundamentals. 2. Emotional decision-making FOMO pushes people to buy late. Fear pushes them to sell early. Volatility amplifies both. Crypto is fast and too fast for emotional reactions. 3. Lack of structured, objective analysis tools Traditional finance relies on balance sheets, financial reporting, corporate records. Crypto relies on scattered data: GitHub activity, tokenomics, liquidity, community trust, centralization risks, market manipulation patterns. Evaluating a project manually is almost impossible for beginners. 4. Scam and rug-pull exposure Not every token listed on an exchange is safe. Many projects look legitimate until liquidity disappears or development stalls. Put together, these factors make crypto a difficult environment for anyone without solid tools. A Better Way: Using AI to Cut Through Crypto’s Chaos This is where AI tools come into play. Instead of reacting to hype or guessing based on sentiment, investors can rely on structured analysis. Platforms like Forvest.io use machine learning to evaluate cryptocurrencies, detect risks, summarize meaningful news, and break down portfolio exposure. Here’s how these tools directly reduce risk: 1. Evaluate Coins Based on Hard Data, Not Hype Many investors don’t know what metrics really matter. Is a project overhyped? Is liquidity stable? Is development active or dead? Does the community show real adoption or just bots? This is exactly what the Trust Score system is designed to answer. The Trust Score aggregates dozens of risk indicators market resilience, developer activity, credibility signals, token distribution health, long-term sustainability, and moreto help investors understand which projects are structurally sound. Example: Bitcoin’s Trust Score Bitcoin Trust Score on Forvest evaluates deeper risk factors using measurable, data-driven indicators such as: Return on Investment (ROI) over multiple timeframes Maximum Drawdown , showing how severely the asset has fallen during previous cycles Volatility Score , capturing how predictable (or unpredictable) price swings are Liquidity & Trading Reliability , assessing how safely large orders can be executed Risk Classification , which places Bitcoin within a structured scale of long-term risk AI-generated insights , providing a concise interpretation of Bitcoin’s structural strengths and potential weaknesses This kind of structured scoring is particularly useful when comparing Bitcoin to newer altcoins with shallow history or inconsistent performance patterns. 2. Stay Updated Without Being Overwhelmed A large percentage of crypto volatility comes from news events, regulation updates, security issues, protocol upgrades, and macroeconomic shifts. The problem? Most investors struggle to track real news without drowning in irrelevant noise. AI-powered summaries solve this problem by filtering and analyzing daily headlines so investors only see information that affects their holdings. Instead of reading dozens of articles, investors can follow news pages like: Weekly News Review This ensures they focus on market-moving events rather than distractions. 3. Manage Portfolio Risk Like a Professional Crypto success isn’t about predicting market tops, it’s about controlling exposure. Many beginners unintentionally build high-risk portfolios through over-allocation, hidden correlations, or unrealistic expectations of volatility. AI-powered tools make this easier. With Forvest’s Profit Calculator , investors can quickly see their real returns after accounting for trading fees, slippage, and execution costs, not just the inflated profit shown on exchange dashboards. A Realistic Scenario: How AI Actually Helps Investors Imagine this situation: Sara has $15,000 she wants to deploy in crypto. She’s excited but nervous because she previously lost money by buying into a hype project that collapsed. This time she takes a structured approach: Step 1 — She checks Trust Scores BTC and ETH score high. One new hyped altcoin scores low due to weak fundamentals. Decision: she avoids the risky token. Step 2 — She reviews market signals Through the risk-management category, she sees sentiment cooling after a rapid rally. Decision: she enters in smaller position sizes to manage volatility. Step 3 — She models her portfolio She tests multiple allocation scenarios and discovers her initial plan would have created dangerous concentration risk. Step 4 — She calculates real profit models When she simulates taking profit, she notices how much fees would cut into her expected gains. Final decision: 60% BTC 30% ETH 10% a small emerging project with reasonable fundamentals Sara moves from emotional, impulsive decisions to a structured, professional-style investing process. Her risk is now dramatically lower not because she avoided crypto, but because she avoided guesswork . The Shift : From Luck to Logic The mindset of successful investors has changed. It’s no longer about finding “the next 100x coin.” It’s about: understanding risk evaluating trustworthiness managing exposure tracking real returns staying updated intelligently AI tools turn chaotic markets into measurable data. They make discipline possible. They remove emotions from decision-making. And in a market as unpredictable as crypto, that difference is everything. If You Want to Reduce Crypto Investment Risk Here’s the simplest framework: 1. Stop guessing, use data Start with Trust Scores to evaluate asset reliability. 2. Stop chasing news, follow filtered insights Use curated categories instead of social-media noise. 3. Stop overexposing, model your portfolio See allocation risks before they hurt you. 4. Stop believing the dashboard, calculate real profit Turn your trading into a measurable strategy. You can explore all these tools on Forvest.io Final Thoughts Crypto will always be volatile. That’s the nature of the asset class. But volatility does not mean chaos, if you have the right tools . AI is transforming how investors measure risk, evaluate projects, and manage portfolios. You don’t need to be a professional trader or data scientist to invest intelligently. You just need clarity, structure, and objective analysis. If you’re ready to reduce guesswork, avoid costly mistakes, and invest with confidence rather than emotion, start by building a disciplined, data-driven process. The tools exist. The information exists. And the advantage goes to those who use them. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
